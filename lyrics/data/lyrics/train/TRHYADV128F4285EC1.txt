Sweet cream ladies, forward march
The world owes you a living
Sweet cream ladies, do your part
Think of what you're giving

To the lost and lonely people of the night
Out of need, they seek direction for their life
They will love you in the darkness
Take advantage of your starkness
And refuse to recognize you in the light

Sweet cream ladies, forward march
...
