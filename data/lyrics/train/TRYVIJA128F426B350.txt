You need to get out of my sight
(A lonely heart can beat)
You're too dangerous
(A lonely heart can bleed)
I cannot stand it to be enclosed but isolated
(A lonely heart can be enclosed but isolated)
You're too much
(A lonely heart is weak)
Too dependent
(A broken heart will seek)
You take the life out of me, no heart is broken forever
(Its broken promises, but my faith is broken forever)

Can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
