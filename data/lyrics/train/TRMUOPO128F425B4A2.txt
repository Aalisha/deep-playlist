I really need you woman. Yay ah!

You say you gonna leave me cause you're sick & tired of me

you tell me that it's over and that you've turned a new page over
you drive me out my mind, and you're leaving me behind
but before you walk through the door
there is something I've got to make sure, oh baby

Dim the lights, turn the lights down low
I really need your lovin
Dim the lights, get through your soul
