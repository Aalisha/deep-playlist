Rape, D.U.I., assault and battery
These are the things that will bring you to me
Murder and theft and all of the above
You can bet your life I know what you're thinkin' of
I've taken you and I'll take your friends
Don't you worry we'll all meet in the end
Cause life's a bitch and then you die
Trust me baby cause I don't lie

I'm the goddamn devil, this job pleases me
I'm the goddamn devil, and I do it for free
