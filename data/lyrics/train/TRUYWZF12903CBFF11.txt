There have been so many people
Walking through my door
They don't seem to wanna come back any more
I never ask them to
I let them only go
I guess I'm not the easiest one to talk to when it's cold
But I guess I'm alright
I guess I'm fine
I think sunshine'l treat me kind
And I'm feeling kind a locked up in this house of mine

COURSE:
Cause, these walls are killing me
Killing me when I am down
I am not a warrior but I can stay calm
And these walls are breaking me
Breaking me down
But I'm living in
I'm living in
and that's how it's done
Oooh yes
That's how it's done

My house is full of flowers
