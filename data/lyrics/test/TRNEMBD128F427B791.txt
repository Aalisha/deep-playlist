This hills are burning, fields turn to steel
the big house is haunted with what we don't feel
the streets are empty, no one ever comes around
so you know they won't make a sound
burn down this town

My lungs are blackened with the smoke and sobs
so just be a man and finish the job
and I'll watch you from this distant place I've found
oh you know I won't make a sound
burn down this town
...
