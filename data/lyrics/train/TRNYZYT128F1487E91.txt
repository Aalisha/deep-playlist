They got the raddest hooks
They got the dopest looks
And when they're misunderstood it's even better
And they all agree
The future ends with me
On their computer screens
Like they even...

Matter to the words we sing
Or feel apart in our melodies
If all you have is yourself, you're never going to need anyone else
