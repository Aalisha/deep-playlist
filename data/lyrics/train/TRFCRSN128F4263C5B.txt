Hear Dis
All di girl did want
was a little attention
man a deal wid progress not to mention
Kiss and caressing har all night long
But all di bwoy did want was a lick and run off
Him and him fren dem
Sidung an a laaf

a walk an a talk bout how di gal saaf
yu ago get whats coming to you
For all the bad bad things U do to your

Lady treat her like a lady
U'll make a good girl crazy
If you don't treat her like a lady
...
