Whilst we float on this molten sea
We wear our colours so heroically
Were only living in GMT
Everyone else is just a refugee

Ah I wake up, I'll take up
It's about time for a shake up
When pride is blind you know were only stuck in second gear
So … up; never give up
It's about time to deliver
Without the man who drives you …
You know I'm staying in
