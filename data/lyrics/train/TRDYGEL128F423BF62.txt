Why? Why are You still here with me?
Didn? t You see what I? ve done?
In my shame I want to run and hide myself
Yeah, but it? s here I see the truth
I don? t deserve You

But I need You to love me
And I, I won? t keep my heart from You this time
And I? ll stop this pretending that I can
Somehow deserve what I already have
I need You to love me

I, I have wasted so much time
