Take a look at me, 
I look into your eyes, 
Take a look you'll see, 
I'm looking right through you, 
I can read your lies, 
They're drifting in your breath, 
It gives me the chills.
I'm blind with the effects of your beauty and perfect fake smile, 
Your smooth lips mouthing every word, like a perfect crime, 
It's funny how you're not worth my time, 
You're worthless like a dime, 
A cover of a book I've already read.
I'll shut you down, you're not worth it.

There's trust and too much control (and you've got) the worst of both worlds
It's bros before hoes so don't lie bitch when you know you've been caught.
(You're getting caught before you get dropped, and I'm heading out)
Are you out there, this is so unfair, are you out there
