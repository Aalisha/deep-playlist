Saphire earings in the one hand
Long stem rose and cash in the other
Got one last kiss on her forehead
Wonder what she's going to tell mother
Out the window to the alley
Join the sidewalk crowd and dissapear
Take the last train to Marseilles

Theres not much more to discuss
There's you and me but there's no us
So if you would just get out of the way.
