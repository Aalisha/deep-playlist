Here I am riding along in this ambulance
To the city jail
Going to jail accused of being a peeping torn
Dammit man I'm saying
Any man would try to find out it his girt
Was doing him wrong
That's all I was doing there outside her home

Oh I'm a little ole country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble drink or swear
And she did this to me

Mama said son you're going to fall
For that common Cajun queen
She's going to take you for your all
And that's what she done done to me

Black eye cracked ribs and a bloody nose
I've been victimized
I'm the victim of a one sided circumstance
No-one's heard my side
When you hear my side you'll see the rotten trick
She pulled on me
