A blacksmith courted me
Nine months and better
He fairly won my heart
Wrote me a letter

With his hammer in his hand

But where is my love gone
With his cheeks like roses?
And his good black Billycock on
Decked round with primroses?

I'm afraid the scorching sun
Will shine and burn his beauty
And if I was with my love
I'd do my duty
