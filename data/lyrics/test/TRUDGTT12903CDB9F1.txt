Damn right I'm a nigga
and I don'T care what you are
Cause I'm a Capitaal N-I double-G-E-R
Black people might get mad
Cause they don'T see
That they're looked upon
As a nigga just like me
I'm a nigga, not a Colored man
Or a Black, or a Negro
Or an Afrom American, I'm all that
Yes I was born in America true
Does South Central
Look like America to you?
I'm a nigga, a straight up nigga
From a hard school
Whatever you are
I dot care, that is you fool
I'm loud and proud
Well endowedd with the big beef
Out on the corner
