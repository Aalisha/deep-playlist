(Chapter I - Bestial propagation)

Beneath the dark earth...
Under the black seas...
Underworld reign in ground below!
In a promised realm lies a race?
Gargoyle beiings roam within
The fertile Valley of... Existence.

Their colonizing approach assault the sources...
The Valley torn by the masterful beasts!
The wilderness life potential retrieved from their vitality.

For aeons... The Force had been drained.
Misused selfishness of the center's resources!
Mightiest thoughts? ... Wish an ultimate control.

They developed this new energy.
That occurs to be a malformation...
Among them spreads... The winged gargoyles.
...
