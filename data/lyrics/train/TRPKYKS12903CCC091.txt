Went walkin' through town just the other day
With nothin' much to do
As the sun came breakin' down through the clouds
I never seen the sky so blue

I saw a Cajun man with a red guitar
Singin' on the side of the street
I threw a handful of change in his beat up case
And said play me a country beat
And it sounded like

Met up with some friends outside of town
We were headed towards the lake
I hopped into the back of a jacked up jeep
Felt the wind upon my face

We got to the spot and the sun was hot
Everybody was feelin' fine
