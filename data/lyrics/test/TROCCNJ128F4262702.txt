Sleeping off the last five years takes another five
Recovery in lieu of being here right now
When I throw myself at your feet you know it's to be walked on
We're breaking up every single night

If I had a choice don't you think I'd make it?
I lost my voice, hope I didn't break it
Little demons by my bed
Whisper secrets, the kind you never hear

I dip my toe in this cold, cold life
I want to dive but I can't find your feet
...
