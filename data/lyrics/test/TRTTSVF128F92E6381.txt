This world rejects me
This world threw me away
This world never gave me a chance
This world gonna have to pay

And I don't believe in your institutions
I did what you want me to
Like the cancer in your system
I've got a little surprise for you

Something inside of me
Has opened up its eyes
Why did you put it there
Did you not realize?

This thing inside of me
It screams the loudest sound
Sometimes I think I could
Burn

Burn

I look down there, where you're standing
