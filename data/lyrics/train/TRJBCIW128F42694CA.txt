You can dance
Every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight

You can smile
Every smile for the man who held your hand
Neath the pale moonlight

And don't forget who's taking you home
And in his arms you're gonna be
So, darling (save the last dance for me)
Save the last dance for me, mmm

Oh, I know
That the music's fine like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
