See a man jumping in
With both feet and his eyes closed
See a dog chasing his tail
In a never ending circle
See yourself in the mirror
Is what you see what you get?
See me, is it reality
Or someone you never met

Sometimes I'll feel
It's taking me nowhere
Sometimes I feel my actions are not mine
Sometimes I feel it's taking me nowhere
Sometimes I'm taken by madness divine

If only you could know my secret life
The things that I hide with my lying eyes
Your trust that I breach with my every stride
The depths that I reach when I fall inside

And when I'm on my knees, I'd do anything, anything
Just to kick it, kick it, kick it
I'd do anything, anything
...
