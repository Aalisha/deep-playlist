I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart

I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
I want to learn to rope and to ride
I want to ride o'er the plains and the deserts
Out west of that great divide
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'
While the sun sinks in the West>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>SETS in the West
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life I love the best >>>>>>>>>THE life I love the best
