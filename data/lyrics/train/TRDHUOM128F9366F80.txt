I came home early to see you
Couldn't wait to hold you
I've been away for so long now

But as I walk through the door now
My heart was shattered
to find that your not alone


When will, I break, into pieces
It's your, mistake, I finally see that
Everything I thought was you, was a lie
Now you left and I'm dying
It's in the arms of a stranger

The days just seem so much longer
now that I'm without you
...
