We all see black and white
When it comes to someone else's fight
No one ever gets involved
Apathy can never solve

FORCED OUT - Brave and Mighty
STOLEN LAND - They can't fight it
HOLD ON - To pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missin'
WE'RE DISSIN' THEM...

On reservations
A hopeless situation

Respect is something that you earn
Our Indian brothers' getting burned
Original American
Turned into second class citizen

FORCED OUT - Brave and Mighty
STOLEN LAND - They can't fight it
HOLD ON - To pride and tradition
Even though they know how much their lives are really missin'
WE'RE DISSIN' THEM...

On reservations
A hopeless situation
