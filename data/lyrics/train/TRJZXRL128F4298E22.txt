The morning's full of rain
I listen to the murmur
Of the breaking waves
If you are afraid
If you feel uncertain
Honey let me change your mind

On these summer days
Your dark and stormy ways
They captivate those who came before me
I am captured by your gaze
Drawn into the flames
They leave no trace
Of one thing I am certain

I can't turn away
I can't turn away

Murder all goes back
In which I don't envision
Your face in my mind, no
I am hypnotized
...
