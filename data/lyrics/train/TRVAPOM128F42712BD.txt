So it's a private education,
and it's not getting any easier,
but if it's any indication,
well I feel a little weaker now.
And it's a private education,
so I present you with your degree.
A degree of separation goes a long long way when schooling me.

So forgive me for what I have done,
and forgive me for what I might do,
and redeem me to everyone,
as I submit myself to you.

You could wear me 'round like your best dress and I wouldn't mind,
you could ruin me in one long night and then cast me aside,
you could turn your mind back to your past and I couldn't change your heart,
...
