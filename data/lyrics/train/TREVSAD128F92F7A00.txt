Intro
Yeah roll down from up town platinum all round to the westside
rolling classics rides you know its east coast so purpose a toast
coz we turn a party out down south
Oowww
Roll to central city with nights with no end's aint no going back once a
track begins sshea
Oh no we gone done it again on a rise take flight home base in Grey Lynn
Verse 1
I haven't had much sleep
Been working hard all week
I can't wait to party tonight
So I call up some friends Rendezvous around 10
Looking fly with the Nesian up high
It's N-E-S to the I-A-N
It really don't matter what spot that you in
Bounce, Ya'll know we bring that Funk like Flex
We bound to turn it out till there aint nothing left
From a spark to a flame, feel the heat get higher
Just getting' started got the place on Fire
Its party night and we bout to get wit' it
DJ spin that back run de Rhythm
Chorus
I wanna dance with you
