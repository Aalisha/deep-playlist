Baby, I went back to funeral row
kicking through the old streets
of a place I once called home, not long ago
Searching for an omen, looking for a sign
looking for the place I swore an oath of love undying
of love undying

But I'm tired of this dull ache
this endless and fake parade
I'm goinna torch my name and my trade

Run into the bright lights
...
