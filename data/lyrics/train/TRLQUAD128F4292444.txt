She said hey cowboy get off of that couch
Yeah, the party's on and we're goin' out
I got my low cut dress and my knee highboots
I'm like money to burn and nothing to lose
You're the man of the house you better think of something
'Cause Mama don't get dressed up for nothing

She said I been cooped up in this house all week
It's time to pick it up and move it out to party street
She said saddle up hoss it's your lucky day
