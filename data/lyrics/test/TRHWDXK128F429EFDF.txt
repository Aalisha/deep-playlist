By the second verse, dear friends
My head will burst, my life will end
So I'd like to start this one off by saying
"Live and love"

I was young and at home in bed
And I was hanging on the words some poem said in '31
I was impressionable, I was upsettable

I tried to make my breathing stop
Or my heartbeat slow
So when my mom and John came in I would be cold

From a bridge on Washington Avenue
The year of 1972, broke my bones and skull
And it was memorable

It was half a second in, I was halfway down
Do you think I wanted to turn back around and teach a class
Where you kiss the ass that I've exposed to you?
