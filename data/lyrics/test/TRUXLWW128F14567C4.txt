Well, I started out down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill
And the town lit up and the world got still

I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings
Coming down is the hardest thing

Now the good ol' days may not return
And the rocks might melt, and the sea may burn

I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings
(Learning to fly)
And coming down is the hardest thing
(Learning to fly)
...
