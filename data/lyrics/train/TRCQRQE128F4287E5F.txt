I wanna rock with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna rock with you

Don't you worry love is on the way
As we lay we'll rock the night away
You just name the time and place

I know you miss me
And I've been missing you
Before you know it
I'll be right there next to you

No matter the distance
You're still in my heart
Baby I'm with you, even though we are apart
So don't worry

Don't you worry love is on the way
I really miss you
As we lay we'll rock the night away
You just name the time and place
