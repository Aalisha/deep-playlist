Life is sacred, so be it yea?
I couldn't give a shit coz you made me sick.
Nobody can refuse you the right,
to give up your life, just fuckin end it!
Pressured into suicide by the fucked up laws,
then labeled a psycho for being sick of your bodies war,
No one should have to suffer the pain,
the strain and then be told that their insane.
Keep your religion out of our laws,
in fact fuck religion, fuck the law.
Assisted suicide its illegal we know,
so would you take me to the backstreets and fuckin slit my throat?
No.
