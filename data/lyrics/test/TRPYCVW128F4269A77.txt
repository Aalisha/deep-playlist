I can't get away from the past of my life
I must look forward, kill the pain, deny the past
But when I'm alone in the dark
My thoughts start running through my mind
And the sweat on my forehead begins to drip
I've seen it in my dreams

I will not fall, but the edge is close enough now
I hope tomorrow I will see the dawn again
I will not fall, but the edge is closer now
I hope tomorrow I will see the dawn again
