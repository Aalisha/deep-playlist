oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh
oooh ooooooh

we were lovers
we were kissers
we were holders of hands
we were make believers
just losing time

and you said you'd rather live in tv land
than say that you care
but you don't
that's heartless and I will not cry

but i'm still in love
and i'm still in love
...
