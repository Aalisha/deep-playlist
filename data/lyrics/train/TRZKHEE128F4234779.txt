Tremor of light
The sky, a porcelain wall
Landing at Heathrow, a Tuesday in the fall
You are sleeping next to me
I just let go your hand
I hope I can go through with this
I hope you understand
I leave you dreaming in row twelve
Run quickly down the escalator
At customs I am first in line
You wake now, it's three minutes later
