All the boys who called their mothers on that day
Were no tough bunch but they had the nerves to go and say
That all your secrets were drowned
with the pioneers who were flooded from this town
They packed their bags only moments too late
With the pounding waves crashing up against the weakened water gates

Cause dire times call for dire faces
So lovely dancer, call and answer
