Seventeen seconds and I'm over it
Ready for the disconnect
Putting on a brave face
Trying not to listen
To the voices in the back of my head

But it's alright now
(It's a distant memory baby)
Alright now
(You know you should just let it go)

Some feelings have a habit of persisting
Even though you wouldn't let it show

Wearing me out
(All this)
Hanging around
(It just starts)
