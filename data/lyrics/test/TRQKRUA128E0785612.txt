I don't wanna wake up in a crowded room
No room to move, clowns to the left of me
Jokers sniffing helium from balloons
'Cuz they got nothin' better to do

You know those days when
You can't hear above the noise
And all your doubts deployed
It's getting late and you're getting bored
With the status you cling to, ooh

Being alive is breathin' in and breathin' out, oh
Being alive is knowin' what you're gonna live for
It's knowing you got something you can't live without, oh
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love
...
