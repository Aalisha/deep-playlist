Deep in the night, when I'm alone
My heart starts to burn, cause I feel for you
I've been away too long from my love
I leave it up to you, to understand

I've got this feeling, deep in my mind
Come back and love me, just one more time
On the ground of an ocean, we buried our love
Far away
My heart's still bleeding
Won't you come back and stay

But I can't understand
Why there's salt in my eyes
And I can't understand
Why your heart's in disguise
...
