They told him not to wander
They told him not to stray
Listen to the warnings
Never lose the light of day

There´s danger in the darkness
And death´s not what they say
Thunderclouds are rolling in
Trouble´s on the way

But you can feel excitement in your veins
No holing back till you stake your claim

Surprise, disguise, better run
Now you realize
The kiss, abyss, knowing that
You can´t resist
...
