Far away the sound of a symphony
Wagner the soundtrack to my tragedy
Broken ribs and bloody feet
Ripped off hair and knocked out teeth
Brutal assault with sadistic methods
Hell-bent for my knowledge
No means are to extreme
But I am not a rat
That will sell out my country
Ill rather die
Than contribute to your
Empirical dream
