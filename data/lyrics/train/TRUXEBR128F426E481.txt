An illusion of reality, look into my eyes
All your lies guard your life, and now you're gonna die!
This pain can not be caged, my pride's been raped
Disgusting me with shame, your blood's now mine to claim

Try to hideout from the truth, you will not show your face
Victory will soon be mine, you will be in your grave
This pain can not be caged, your blood will stain
One mistake gave me this pain, and now you'll fucking die
