Oh, why does she sing her sad songs for me,
I'm not the one
Tenderly bring her soft sympathy
I've just begun
To see my way clear
And it's plain,
If I stop I will fall
I can lay down a tear for her pain
Just a tear and that's all

Oh, what does she want me to do?
She says that she knows
That moments are rare
I suppose that it's true
Then on she goes
To say I don't care,
Ah, she knows
That I do

Maybe she just has to sing, for the sake of the song
And who do I think that I am to decide that she's wrong
