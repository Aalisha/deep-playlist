There's no way to stop the ancient ghost that is
rising from his grave
Spilling a drop of hatred from his bowl
He senses the fear and misery, searching for fresh

Feeling hunger growing in his dark soul

Here he stands ready to sow
Harvest about seeds of his sorrow
As he takes his toll

Far on the horizon
