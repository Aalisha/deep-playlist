You give me for honor (graves)
Where your soldiers lay (graves)
They're so far away (graves)
The home of the brave (graves)
I won't die in your bullshit wars no more
I won't fight to my death for you
I won't watch my poor mama cry no more
Muthafuck your red, white and blue

Thousands of men go to war to fight for
Politics which they don't understand
Murder people who they never met
When they make it home they're
Considered a vet
