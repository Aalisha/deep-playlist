Pointing fingers mark the way the riches and success
Those who couldn't make it won't be satisfied for less
Fulfilling visions dreams where others failed that is our quest
Trademark of a caring soul is to always know what's best

Experience and innocence are currencies in trade
Separate the stupid from the clever with a grade
Ability and character determined at a glance
Do you choose your fate or do you give in to circumstance

Working hard for a cause we've never known
That's not our own, but

In the end
We don't need directions
To understand
What we should embrace
And what we should transcend
When we pass it on ourselves
Remember then
...
