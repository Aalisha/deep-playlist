I want a love I can see. (Ah-Pow-Pow)
That's the only kind that means a thing to me. (Ah-Pow-Pow)
Don't want a love you have to tell me about. (Ah-Pow-Pow)
That kind of loving I can sure do without. (I can sure do without)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I want a love I can feel. (Doo-Doo)
That's the only kind of loving I think it's real. (Doo-Doo)
Don't want to be quoted by something I heard now. (Doo-Doo)
'Cause baby action speaks louder than words. (Ah, louder than words)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
