Standing up above and looking below
I know you thought you seen a halo
Getting down below what I've shown
You'll see just what I've known

It's one more hour 'til daybreak
I know I've had all I can take
I heard a secret that I can't shake
One wing at an iron gate
Jailbird half awake

Well I can't say there's nothing wrong here
with me, with me
She's one step over and one mile older
without me, without me
...
