Keep telling myself that it don't have to be this way.
Yeah, I'm talking about life and everything that we do today.
I'm not falling for the same old lies that I did before.
I'm just telling you now so you know why I'm out that door.

Here comes the future,
I hope that you can, I hope that you can work it out.
Here comes the future,
I hope that you can work it out.

Don't want to do nothing that I did before.
Deep down in my heart I know what I'm down here for.
I'm in heaven when you smile and when we feel this way.
Keep telling myself that I'm just going to live for today.

Cos' here comes the future.
I hope that you can, I hope that you can work it out.
Here comes the future,
I hope that you can work it out.
Mmm work it out, yeah.
