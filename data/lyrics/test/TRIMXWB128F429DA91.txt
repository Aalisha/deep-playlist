The one true resolve of the flame and the bullet is a pile of flesh like an unmanned puppet;
A set of bones gone quietly still.
And in a lab under every flag right now,
Some one's splitting atoms and inventing new breakfast cerals in the shape of their nation's borders
And drawing brand new maps, discreetly expanding their nation's borders

(chorus): It's root root root for the home team
Shout like yoru dad at the TV screen
Tie a dollar bill around a circus flea
