Choo choo train is riding - all aboard!

Riding on a train
think of you again

yor love has got me high
high
high

you know I need you
baby.

Since we've been together our love has been forever young

so don't stop what you're doing
baby
'cause you do it right
right

right.

I have missed you so
don't you know it
babe?
And I can't wait to hold you in my arms
hey
hey

I'm riding on this train for you.

Riding on a train
