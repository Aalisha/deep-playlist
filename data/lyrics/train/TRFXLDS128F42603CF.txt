Once in a while
Someone comes along
That one in a million heart
So pure and so strong

They can face up to the tears
And somehow still find a smile
We only get it
Every once in a while

Once in while
Someone has the eyes
That one in a million look
Never tells lies

They can get you on your feet
...
