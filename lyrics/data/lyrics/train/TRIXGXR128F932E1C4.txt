Halfway around the world
Lies the one thing that you want
Buried in the ground, hundreds of miles down
The first thing that arises in your mind while you awake
Is bending you til you break
Let me hold you now

Baby close your eyes
Don't open til the morning light
Baby don't forget
We haven't lost it all yet

Don't know what your made of
Til the one thing that you want
Id coming with the dawn and suddenly changes
Monday, syndicate meets everyone the same
