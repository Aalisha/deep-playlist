Who would've known
The rain and the sunshine
Would Ooh Baby Baby
Build up these walls of mine?
And I can't see you or breathe you
Cause there's trouble right beneath you
It's all in the night
But ooh baby baby
Come pick me up in your ride 

I'm a cool low Jane
With a skip on my feet
I play tough as nails
With my heart on my sleeve
I'm nothing but a sandcastle
Baby don't blow me away away

Baby I know you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Ooh ooh ooh ooh hoo hoo ooh
Bay ba ba ba ba-by
Don't blow me away 

Baby I know you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile
Ooh ooh ooh ooh hoo hoo ooh
Bay ba ba ba ba-by
Don't blow me away
