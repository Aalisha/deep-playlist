Ladies and gentlemen
Report to the dancefloor, it's that time again
Let's rock

Let's rock

(It's crazy)
What keeps goin' through my mind
Somethin' is playin' with my head

(Crazy)
How I'm feelin' inside
I wish I could see you here instead

(Baby)
It's so fulfillin', oh
 (The way you give it)
Intimidatin'

(But I)
I want more of it
I'm so tore up 'cause how you give it to me

Got me a sip of the hypnomatic
The kiss was the chaser and I ain't mad at it
Followed it up with a little touchin'
Then the next day I don't remember nothin'

Baby, I'm hungover
Dizzy 'cause you got to my head
Wish you were here instead

Hungover
Can't focus on what I got to do
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you

Baby, I'm hungover
Can't even think about the song
The list goes on and on
