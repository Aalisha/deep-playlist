The radio plays a love song
And every word seems to speak the truth
I'm trying not to feel the pain
Pretendin' i'm not listenin'

I know I should keep busy
But, fillin' time - it ain't, ain't that easy for me
(I'm) trying to mend a broken heart
Tryin' hard to figure out
If you give your love, give your love to someone (give your love)
Can you get it back or is it just long gone now?

This is what I need now is the strength to walk away
And rememeber who i am again
This has gotta get better 
Surely time is all i need to mend
When i'm constantly reminded of the love that we had found
Gotta keep my head up high
