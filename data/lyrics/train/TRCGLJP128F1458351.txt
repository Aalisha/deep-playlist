Don't let love let you down
It's been fine up to now
Sahara, I just walked into your world
Sahara, don't walk out on me now

Don't let time tie you down
It's been fine up to now
Sahara, there is life in the desert
Sahara, let the sands run away

But in my heart and in my head
I know that she'll wait for me
Ooh, Sahara brings me down
...
