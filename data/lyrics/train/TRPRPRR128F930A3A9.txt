As I roved by the dockside
One evening so rare
To view the still waters
And take the salt air
I heard an old fisherman singing this song
He sat take me away lads my Time is not long

Rub me up in me oilskin and jumper
No more on the docks I'll be seen
Just tell me old shipmates
I'm taking a trip, mates
And I'll see you one day in Fiddler's Green

Now Fiddler's Green is a Place
I've heard tell
Where fishermen go
If they don't go to Hell
Where the weather is fair
And the dolphins do play
...
