(Don't ever stop)
All right, girls
(Are you shaking?)

Surrounded by sharp-looking eyes
Dancing in a fever
Forgetting all the words of advice
Moving in and closer

What a life we have
What a life we live
And it's smiling right at us
What a life we share
Gonna get it there

So, never let it go
Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
Surrender to the beat up and down
In the heat we'll be shaking, shaking

So, never let it go
Never stop till you know
We'll be reaching for the top tonight
And when the night is over
I'll take you in my arms now
