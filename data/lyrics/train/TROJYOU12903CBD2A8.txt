[[Chorus:]]
And I will hold you forever never let you go
I will row down Jah river right beside you
in my heart is a fire, it never will be through, no

Burn come a come a pretty darling let me turn
let me turn you on and a make you hot 'cause
you are the greatest living soul that I know
Lord knows I never let you go
let's force the power and the bond that we got
and Jah will bless us with higher

Listen good what I tell you pearl
you are the only woman who a rule my world, heh
if night's turnin' ina new day
we gonna melt ina the golden sun sitting by the bay, heh

So come on baby and dance your belly
move and groove it so irie – yes! –
feeling this ya night is blessed,
blessed with sweet caress

And all I want is a lively woman
