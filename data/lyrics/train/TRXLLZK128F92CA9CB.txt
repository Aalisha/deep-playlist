Tell me why there so much pain today
â€˜Cause taking lives is for the gain or so they say
I can't believe it but they feel this way
And that's the way of the world
Tell me why it takes a tragedy to see
To wake us up and bring us down on to our knees
With all the people suffering with diseases

And that the way
That's the way
That's the way of the world

As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better everyday
As the sun burns the ground
There's got to be another way
Is our god looking down
And does it feel everybody's pain
As the world crashes down
Heavens looking better every day
