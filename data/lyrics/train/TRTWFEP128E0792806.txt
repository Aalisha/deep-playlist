If only I could get into that corner of your head
Where things finally match and meet the standards that you set
Oh how I wish I was the treasure that you were lookin' for
Bet I would feel better if only I could find the door

Well I am cryin'
You aren't tryin'
I am melting away

I wait for the words on the tip of your tongue
I'm only as good as the last one
Well you decide and I abide as my song goes unsung
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Things are goin' crazy and I'm not sure who to blame
Everything is changing and I do not feel the same
