sunday night
sunday night
the killer of the week
sunday night
sunday night
the killer of the week
sunday night
I've finally found
I've finally found
something to plug up this snorry mouth
since the day ['cause today?] she said to me (she saw slee smore)
this house moves more than you (show so snow)
so I tell her I sleep (so so still snore)
to keep from thinking it through (bless me)
now it's all I can do (shovel snow)
when you pull the sheets up overhead (sometimes so you know)
and she sends me out
to shove snow drifts in my bed (she sings sun she snore)
you'll reach for the door
arms feel weak
you'll make a mistake
and fly fly ahead
and it's all I can do
...
