Hard times flowing and my eyes couldn't see stars shining
my heart couldn't feel the beauty of the rising sun
and I'm lost like a bottle that floats in the sea forever
will somebody pick up my hope?
will somebody try?
will I realize?

'cause it's broken broken
something got broken like stolen, stolen
like if it was stolen, and hurting, hurting
I have been hurting and now
only time will tell
time will heal

just pieces of truth that I chose to keep and
no matter if now they are gone
No matter if I am alone
...
