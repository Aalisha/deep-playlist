I've spent my whole life surrounded
And I've spent my whole life alone
I wonder why I never wondered why
The easiest things are so hard

I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love
I just want, I just want to love
I just want

Something, something for nothing
Yeah, something, something for nothing
'Cause I'm a beggar and a chooser
...
