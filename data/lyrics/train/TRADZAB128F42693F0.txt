I see you looking and I know what you think
You're getting braver with every drink
But I am telling you something
You ought to know

She may look like a sweet young thing
Talking to him she ain't hearing a thing
If you were smart you'd turn around
And let her go

That girl's a Barbie doll
A Barbie doll
 (She's a Barbie doll)
She's real good looking
She got no heart at all

Puts on her makeup and she drives to the bar
In her boyfriend's, old man's brand new car
She's got no idea
What she does or why
...
