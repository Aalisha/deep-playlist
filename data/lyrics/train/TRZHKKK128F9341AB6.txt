I'm driving through the open roads of hometown
The Junipers are swaying again
It's barely five o'clock and sunlight's on the loch
And nothing's wrong, no, nothing's wrong

I've been working day and night for this moment
Since I shed those leaves of doubt
It's here I want to stay, in the early morning grey
And I can't change, no, I can't change
