Overwhelm me with Your love
And never let me go
Drown away the crashing waves
Leave me water for my soul

Overwhelm me with Your love
And heal my broken heart
Keep me down upon my knees
Till your love is all I see

I have my hope in the beauty of Your majesty
And all that I cannot see

I'm all I am
Because of what You gave up
...
