(Jonas Renkse:)
Once a world, endless and free
Horizons unbroken
Now a world of bounded frontiers
The elders have spoken… Our home

(Daniel Gildenlöw:)
Once a world, eternal and blue
Floating, escaping
Now a world that's blinding my view
Shadows shaping… Alone

(Magali Luyten:)
Liquid eternity crosses through our veins
Liquid eternity nourishes our brains
Liquid eternity, a world that does not live
Liquid eternity, a life that does not yield

(Bob Catley:)
Once a world of fear and dismay
Of fleeing and hiding
Now a world that's peaceful and safe
...
