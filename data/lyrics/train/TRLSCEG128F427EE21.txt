There's a girl in the street, you should see the tears in her eyes
'Cause she weeps for a man who told her lies
And the man that she loved left her for somebody new
And the girl, she dreams that if only they could've seen

Heart to heart, oh, eye to eye
Love is a lie
Heart to heart, oh, eye to eye
Love is a lie
One day he's gonna pay

There's a man down the street
You can't see the pain in his heart
...
