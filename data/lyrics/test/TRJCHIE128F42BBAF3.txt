I gave away my first real kiss
In the rain on a Friday night
To the star of the football team
Underneath the stadium lights
I cried the day he told me he was movin on
And I swore I'd never love again
All summer long

I can still smell the blossoms of those sweet Magnolia trees
I can still hear the Bible stories that my grandma used to read
As years fly by, I'm still the same inside as I used to be
I guess there aint no changing girls like me
