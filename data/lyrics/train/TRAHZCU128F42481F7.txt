Take a good look at agony
Forced, dead, pass down
Time release
I'm inspired to find the lie
Blackless X on the back
Of a soulfull man
I've got way's you understand
Look left, look right, but I'm
Behind you
I never noticed, until I focused
On everything you did, you said,
You lit the fuse inside my head

Thank you for reminding me
Of what I have seeked inside
Thank you for the venom, did
You think it would paralyze?
These scars I scratch, I tear
All them under my skin
Where you've always been
Thank you for reminding me,
