Back in my younger days, I used to go all night
Now I just stay at home, and everything is all right
Back when I first met you, I used to live in a haze

I would do anything, just a stumbling fool
It's a wonder I'm standing here, I've broken so many rules
Now I dance with you every night, and still I'm so amazed
