There's a gentleman that's going 'round
Turnin' the joint upside down, Stool Pigeon, ha tja tja tja
He's an old ex-con that's been away
Now he's back, no one's safe, Stool Pigeon, ha tja tja tja

? If you wanna squeal?, said the F.B.I.
? We can make a deal, make it worth your while?
So he told them all and in return
He got a credit card and a Thunderbird

And the maximum security
Even after plastic surgery
? So, go on and squeal?, said the F.B.I.
? We can make a deal, make it worth your while?

There's a gentleman that's going 'round
Turnin' the joint upside down, Stool Pigeon, ha tja tja tja
He's an old ex-con that's been away
Now he's back, no one's safe, Stool Pigeon, ha tja tja tja
