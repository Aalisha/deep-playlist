Here, here in this heart,
It's cold, cold as stone.
Must welcome these memories as shallow as my eyes have slowly become.
Hearts, frail hearts left broken,
Called and known, for it's bitter agony.
Here are the memories as empty as my life has slowly become,
Sting, crush and bite in my soul, my heart bleeds.
