You have a face for the radio,
But I know you'd like to see it in a show,
Claiming to be the next best everything,
Which way will you go?

You're a little smarter than most of us,
You run so fast sometimes it's hard to see you for dust,
Finding some time for you, it tortures me,
Which way will you go?

Wages on a Friday,
Spent on a Saturday,
Lend me a fiver,
Won't do that again,
Oh your trust is not to strong.
