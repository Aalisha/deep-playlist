I'll fawn over photographs
That you never would get to see
Swallow your own neglect
With your miserable company

Your daughter forgot her memories
Your daughter forgot her
Remember these

I'm over the precedent
Of a false security
No matter how I come back
You can never be proud of me

It's too long to stay gone
...
