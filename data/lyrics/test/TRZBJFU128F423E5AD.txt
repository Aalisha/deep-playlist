(Ba, ba, ba, ba)
(Ba, ba, ba, ba)
(Ba, ba, ba, ba)
(Ba, ba, ba, ba)
At the hop

Well, you can rock it, you can roll it
Do the stomp and even stroll it
At the hop

When the record starts a-spinnin
You chalypso when you chicken
At the hop

Do the dance sensations
That are sweepin' the nation
At the hop

Let's go to the hop
Let's go to the hop (oh, baby)
Let's go to the hop (oh, baby)
Let's go to the hop
Come on, let's go to the hop

Well, you can swing it, you can groove it
You can really start to move it
At the hop
