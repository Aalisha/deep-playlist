Swallow your pride and just let me in
I don't want to hurt you, you know I'm your friend
If this is the outcome of all we've been through
It seems like a waste, I can't take all this waiting for you

I won't wait
I can't wait here anymore

So hard, it hurts
But I'll never learn and you'll never know how much it burns
Won't take it back, I meant every word
But you only hear what you want to hear
