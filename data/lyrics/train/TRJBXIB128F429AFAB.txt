I remember it like it was yesterday... 
Meeting you and going to shows... 
Writing the story of our lives together... 
Seeing snow for the first time... 
Making the same new friends... 

It seems like it was just the other day 
But it is really many miles away... 
It seems like our time is ending soon 
But it is really many miles away... 

...
