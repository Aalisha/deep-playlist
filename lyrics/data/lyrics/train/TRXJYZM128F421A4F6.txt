There's a spark that ignites the internal fire
It makes us strive for the best we can be and higher
Sometimes we stumble and we're back at the start
But it won't matter 'cause we're used to it hard
That's why it won't get us down, it's just the way that we are
It's not just the way that it works out sometimes
'Cause that we have was bought with our last dimes
