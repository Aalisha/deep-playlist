They call me Mr. Carbohydrate
It's the only thing I can digest
Then I focus a general disinterest
Must catch up with all this stuff

They call me a boring fuckhead
Say I might as well work in a bank
I tell them I wish I was
They tell me that I'm sick in the head
They say that I'm sick in the head

They call me Mr. Carbohydrate
They call me Mr. Inadequate
They call me Mr. Paranoia
