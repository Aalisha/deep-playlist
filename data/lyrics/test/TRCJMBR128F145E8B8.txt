Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi
When you're on the top
There's no place you can really go but down, down, down
People on the street congratulate you
They say they love the way you sound, well
When you're on the low
No one wants to chit or chat or even know your name
Your agent's never there
Your manager has ripped you off and gone somewhere
Standing on the top
Standing on the top, top
On the top getting down, yeah
Standing on the top (Yeah), top
On the top getting down, Temptations sing
Standing on the top, top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Standing on the top, top
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
