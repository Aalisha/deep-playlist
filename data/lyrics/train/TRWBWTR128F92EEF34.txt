Back in ten minutes
And I'll just hang the sign
I've got to find a place
To clear my mind
I'm the flyer
With only one desire
I'm the flyer
Nobody's gonna shoot me down
I've got an urgent appointment
And I can't be late
I've got a million things
That'll have to wait
Just hang on a minute
I'll try to hurry back
I hate to make you wait
But I'm going and I'm going fast
...
