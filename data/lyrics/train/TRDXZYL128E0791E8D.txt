It was a story about a man comin' in and find his women in bed with
well listen

It's 2 A.M. I'm just getting in about to check my message,
no one has called but my homies and some billcollectors.
Cellular when somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her she don't hit me back something is funny.

So I called her mother's house and asked has she seen my baby.
Roll my six around looking for that missing lady.
Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news
then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused.
And then I turned the TV down

cause I thought I heard a squicky sound,
somethings going on upstairs
and I know nobody else lives here
"bump bump bump" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear

then I hear my babies voice in my ear screaming out...
You're contagious, touch me baby, give me what you got
...
