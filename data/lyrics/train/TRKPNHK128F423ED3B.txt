I started to feel while I was
Walking down the street
Yes I did, and I started thinking
'Bout my destiny...
And how maybe, maybe just someday
I could repay all the times you sang

All of your warm colors
Have painted all my days
And all of the tragic tears
you took off of my face
'Cause I've fallen off of these train tracks
And nearly seen my death
And I stand here with a song
About to live

This will be my destiny
You will be my song and I will sing
So don't cover up your ears at me
And what I have to tell
...
