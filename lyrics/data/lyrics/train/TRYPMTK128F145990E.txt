I remember when I only cried
when I fell down
everything was either black or white
but it's gray now
Iremember when I learned of love
and the way she sings

like the hurt and the sting
when they're tearing off your wings
and they won't tell you why
but you'll never learn to fly
and if you feel like i do
then you've seen it too

I've seen angels
Iknow time changes almost everything
I've seen angels
without wings

without wings

I remember when the sun fell down
...
