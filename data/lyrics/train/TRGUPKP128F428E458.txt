Lonely boy, where do we go
I'm stuck believing in the other side
stuck on my own
run fast, you're dreaming

no place to hide
safety in things i'm dumb for thinking
'cuz a piece of plastic
is nothing more than a piece of plastic

empty streets under my feet
how did we get so far?
from the general beat
across that great
held fast together in the dying day
oh you are swimming inside the magic hour
oh and when you wet your skin
you can suck up all you need to know
you can suck up all you need to know, oh oh

picture me, how will you picture me when i am dead?
all fast and free, building a fantasy with blocks in my head
a legacy, do these things disapate in the years unread?
i've got a pain just like a knife, and the time has left me
...
