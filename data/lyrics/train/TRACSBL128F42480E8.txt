Oooooooh skat

Am I pleased to meet ya
Picture from the people
Somethin I got to teach ya

Oooooooh crack

You're quite the creature
Girl from the creature feature
Tasty like to eat ya
Thinkin' so nasty

Just got me feelin' so nasty

Oooooooh pop

I'll take you from the eighties
Bimbos rock the latex
Dingos gots the babies

But oooooooh stop

Look we're ready to rumble
Girlfriend can you show me
The way that the cookie crumble
Thinkin' so nasty

Just got me feelin' so na-

Keep it rockin baby
Don't try to hide it none
Give me somethin and I won't try to fight it none
All the troubles in my mind they don't feel so bad
When you got me in your palm slidin' in your hand
