Waking up to the morning through my fishbowl
And I worry is she sleeping?
Is she breathing? Is she dead?

And would I be a better mother to a kitty
Or a puppy, or chimpanzees,
or maybe to your baby

Lord willing...

If I'm alive this time tomorrow
then I'll have more time to kill
and maybe we could rearrange my furniture
to make lots more room to fill
...
