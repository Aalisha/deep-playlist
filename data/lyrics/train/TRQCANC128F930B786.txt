I see you turning, turning away
And we're ready to leave to the bridges of sin, yeah
Seven wonders, we're ready to fly
Like an eagle we're touching the sky

We sailed across the ocean
On the wind of the sea
We're sailing on the oceans of time
We're moving through the twilight
Past the black moon on our way
We're sailing on the oceans of time

As the sun fades to dark light we knew
There was no way to return, yeah
All the stars were passing by
We were riding through the sky
On our endless journey through space
Seven wonders, we're ready to fly
Like an eagle, we're touching the sky

We sailed across the ocean
