I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.
'Cuz I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do when no one else can.
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
