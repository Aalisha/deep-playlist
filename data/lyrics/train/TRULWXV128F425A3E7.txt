And when summer gets to me
And sets the sex on fire
My body is an ocean
Of twisted white debris

And when summer gets to me
And sets the heart in motion
A pain that hides in my insides
Is suddenly set free

And sex is sex forget the rest
The only one that? s free
The only great adventure left
To humankind that? s you and me

And when summer gets to me
And tries to make me tired
I? m living every minute
And dying every three

And sex is sex forget the rest
...
