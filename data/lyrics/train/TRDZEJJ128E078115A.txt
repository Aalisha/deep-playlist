Tell me something I don't know
Cos' these streets ain't paved with gold
but vanity won't release me

If I learn to crash this plane
Oh baby believe me, I'll go down in flames
Just don't leave home on these words

Because every town I pass through keeps reminding me o' plans we used to share
So long fools
