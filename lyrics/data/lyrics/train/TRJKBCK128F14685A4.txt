From the mountain tops
Down to the sunny street
A different drum is playing a different kind of beat
It's like a mystery
That never ends
I see you crying and I want to kill your friends

I hear your footsteps in the street
It won't be long before we meet
It's obvious
Just count me in and count me out
And I'll be waiting for the shout
Oblivious

Met Mo and she's okay
Said no one really changed
Got different badges but they wear them just the same
Down by the ballroom
