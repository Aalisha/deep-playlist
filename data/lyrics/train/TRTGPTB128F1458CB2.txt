The streets of Soho
Ah, that's where your kids go
The streets of Soho
Chinatown or (flaminco)?

Out in the streets
Profane stokers sweat in the heat
(Delilah was born)
A greyhound body punctured and torn
The take-away eats
A grubby chef cooks up yesterday's meats
And a baby is born
But mama gets drunk, dad never comes home
