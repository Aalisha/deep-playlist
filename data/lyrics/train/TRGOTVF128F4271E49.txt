What-what, what-what, what-what, what-what
What-what, what-what, what-what, what-what
What-what, what-what, what-what, what-what

What do you see when you see me?
You see my long blonde hair and the particular way
That my lips are shaped
That my body takes when you talk to me

What do you know when you know me?
Don't file me under categories, you're deceived
You don't know me, I'm not only a surface, a country
What you don't know about me is

I'm a double agent on my mama's side
The shit I hear you say just blows my mind
Everytime, recognize

Though who I am to you is not a lie
I don't have to volunteer and say
That I was born a particular way
I got no uniform, I'm camouflaged in any light

Obviously you can't tell
I'm a double agent on my mama's side

And what do you hear when you hear me?
I hear you crank up Jay-Z, it's your favorite jam
And you talk with your hands like an MC
Betcha never get stopped by the police

You never ask me about me, no, no, no
