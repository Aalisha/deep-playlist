How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?
Won't take my eyes off the ball again

You reel me out then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started?
How come I end up where I went wrong?

I won't take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string
You used to be alright
