There's only one type of girl on my mind
She's always on my mind
When I leave the house, I see them outside
They're always on my mind
I think of a girl that I really really need
That money can't buy
I would never be mean to these girls
They're always on my mind
Oh I want to smile for boring girls
I would walk a mile for boring girls
Oh I want to touch those boring girls
