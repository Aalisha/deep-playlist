You were always cunning like the game you'd play
As your mindless kindless friends would say
You got what you wanted but not what you needed
No matter how hard you pleaded
Your eighteen and you know it all
So how in the hell could you ever fall
For such a thoughtless gutless fool
Who taught you about drugs and kept you out of school
Isn't that right
I am right
I am right
I am right
