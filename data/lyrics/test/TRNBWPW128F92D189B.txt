You can't hide from yourself
everywhere you go there you are.
(repeat)

The truth is a light,
light shining within
When you look in the mirror
do you see a foe or a friend.
You can lie all you wanna
but one day you're gonna,
gonna breakdown, breakdown and let it all out.

You see that
You can't hide from yourself
everywhere you go there you are.
I just got to say that,
You can't hide from yourself
everywhere you go there you are.

Make peace with yourself before you can love another
understand who and what you are before you can go any further.
You can lie all you wanna
but one day you're gonna,
gonna breakdown, breakdown and let it all out.
