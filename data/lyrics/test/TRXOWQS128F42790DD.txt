Never thought I would, find the words that could
Stand up through any weather
Something I could say, you could hear today
But stay with you forever

Just when I was losing my faith
And I was losing my way
It came to me as clear as day

Even if I wake up and find I'm alone
'Cause the whole world's turned to stone
And my God says "It' s time I take you home"
I'll be happy goin', knowing that I loved you

Innocent and mild, must be Heaven's child
Sent to make me believe
...
