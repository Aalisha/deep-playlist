You're the gravity that pulls me down
I'm the satellite crashing through to the ground
We'll throw a parade on the day that I return
Darling will I ever learn? Darling will I ever learn?

All my weakness gets caught up in my knees when you get near
I said I'm on my feet just fucking rising up again
I'm back against old ways (back against old ways)
With an ominous tongue that screams I don't belong here
I'm not loosing any ground just burning up in your atmosphere

Come now and signal the escape
