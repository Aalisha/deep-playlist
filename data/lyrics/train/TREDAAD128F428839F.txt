("Bassy" Bob Brockmann, Babyface, Jeffery Burrell)

My heart has been broken cause of you
One always must leave, that's nothing new
I thought that you'd really like to try to stay
Stay together, let's try again

It's been 17 months on my own
The nights are so quiet all alone
I long to feel you in my arms again
Girl, won't you please come back home
