There you stand united
Attack me is your goal
Attack me your words of Jesus
You can never hurt me
or make me change my ways
We will never be the same

It can't be that hard to see
that Jesus means nothing to me
I was never one of his followers
I walk the path of fire

I can feel your presence
You are ready to attack
You see me as a threat against
Jesus Christ, your savior
Your golden fucking lord
I will never drop my guard
