I didn't want you
Did not need you
Sure wouldn't mean
To kick you down
You know I love you
I'm thinkin' of you
Sure do wish
You'd come around

'Cause you're the kind of sugar papa likes
And when you do it, it drives me crazy (drives me crazy)
And I don't know if I'm
Up or down
Lost or found
With you

You shoulda told me
I'm not the only
Man to love you twice
But since I know now
