Secret Curse 
Anonymous hex on flavorless food and terrible sex 
A day of no rhythm a night of no rest 
And I do not know what sin I have not confessed 

Secret Curse 
Terrible blight I'm deafened by sound and blinded by light 
Caught when I flee and beat when I fight and I'm cocky when wrong 
And timid when right and I don't know what crimes have yet to come to light
