Roll On (Blacksmith Rub)

You, yo, Mis-Teeq
Here we go with the one Blacksmith
Aye, Oh and away we go
You're gonna get your roll on
Here we go again, all, all, all night long
(Roll on, yeah)
Enter, check, check

It's been a long week and we've been
Working our booties off
Sometimes it all gets to you and it's too much
Gonna hook us up a potion
Guaranteed to bring some fun
Mix good friends and some music
And head out to the club
And Roll on

It's Friday and you just got paid
And Monday is a holiday
You know you need to get away
So grab your boo and get your roll on
Let me hear my fellas say
Let me hear my ladies say
So turn your speakers up and roll on

So here we go another another night
Out on the town, we gettin' down
Havin' fun, stayin' young
The whole entourage has arrived
Here on the scene you know what I mean when I say
This world is mine, just sit back and ride
So turn your speakers up and roll on
