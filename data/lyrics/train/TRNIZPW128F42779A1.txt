For all of those who have been took
Then you better take another look
Because they're never really what they seem
Swear never to betray the only honest man
Ever to set foot upon his promised land
Before you take them by the hand

Love has faded
I thought I'd let you know
My true reaction
Cold and jaded
Your true colors show
Are love has faded
To cold and jaded


You cannot pretend
That there's nothing left to defend
...
