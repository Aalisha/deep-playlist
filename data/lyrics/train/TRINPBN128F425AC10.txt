He's too tough
He's too tough
Check it out

He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)

He's too tough for me
I want him in between
Ah, yeah
(He's too tough)

He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)

He's too tough for me
I want him in between
(He's too tough)

When I see those big brown eyes
It really knocks me down
I get rubber knees
When he's around

Every time he calls my name
You know I can't resist
It chills me out
Just thinking about his kiss

My, my, my
I keep on coming
One more time
Back to his arms

He's too tough for me
He's from another scene
(He's too tough)
(He's too tough)

He's too tough for me
I want him in between, yeah
(He's too tough)

People say he'll make me
Bite off more than I can chew
But ain't nobody's business
If I do

My, my, my
I keep on coming
