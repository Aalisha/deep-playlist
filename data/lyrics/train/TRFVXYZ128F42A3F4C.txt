Winger, "Miles Away", from In the Heart of the Young, by Paul Taylor
------ -------------------------
"So this is love, or so you tell me
As you're walkin', out the door
Months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for"
"Some times, just for a moment
I reach out; hope you're still there"

"Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away

Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away..."
"It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
...
