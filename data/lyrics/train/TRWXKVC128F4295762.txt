Ooh lord, ooooh lord
Oooh Lord, Oooooooh
Well, I remember when I used to love someone
That looked just like u
And also I can remember
The smell of her sweet perfume
She used to tell me things that I used to love
She had her way of getting the best of my heart
And also she had a way of
Keeping me smiling, but now she's gone

I used to love someone
But now I'm on the run
She had a hold on me
Stripping the walls of my heart
