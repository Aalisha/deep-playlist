You're walking up with your eyes on me
It's looking good but I just don't know
I need a girl who can keep her head
All Night Long
You didn't come just to see the show
I guess you know what you wanna see
The way you smile lets me know I can't go wrong

I wanna touch you
I wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine

I wanna love you (all night long)
