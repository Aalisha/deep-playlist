You don't know how to start
Just look inside your heart
You know I feel confused
I don't know what to choose

You better take a stand
And find out who you are
You better make a plan
'Cause this has gone too far

When we went to the wishing well,
We thought we saw the light

If you
Start, start, start to wake up,
Scream, scream, scream all you want
See, see, see what you've done
Start, start, start to wake up
...
