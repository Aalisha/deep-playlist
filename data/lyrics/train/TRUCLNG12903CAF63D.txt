We're staring down constantly
With palms open and resting feet
Glancing up once and a while
To find some sense of reconcile

Open our eyes to see what's left
Looking for just one sign of breath
As soon as we think it's okay
We'll head our separate ways

What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
There's knocking at our door

Slowly but surely I'm turning this around
But there is something that I haven't found
Sooner or later you will be finding out
Sitting there waiting isn't so safe and sound
