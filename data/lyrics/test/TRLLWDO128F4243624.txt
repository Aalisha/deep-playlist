Everybody's hurting.
Everybody knows it.
Are you trying to stop it?
Everyone's watching.
What are you gonna do?

Are you trying to stop it? Everyones watching.
Everyone is conversing. Everyone's listening.
Oh, they were apart.
He was apart and she was a part of it
Oh, falling apart, is anyone watching?
Is anyone listening? Are we listening?

And all I have, is all of me.
And it's all that I can give.
Our disappointed hearts will heal.
Our hearts will spill, over you, over me, over this.
