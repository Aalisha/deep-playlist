Been a lot of word floatin' round
'Bout what I do with my life
People talk but I don't hear a sound, fabricated lies
You think you got me all figured out, you couldn't even try
Talking smack behind my back, can't look me in the eye

Chorus:
Cast your stone, dig your bones
Tuck your tail and head for home
