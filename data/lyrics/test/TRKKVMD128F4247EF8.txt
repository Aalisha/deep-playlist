I've got a cold beer in my right hand
In my left I got my weddin' band
I been wearin' it 'round now for way too long
And I'm more than ready to see it gone
And I'm the only one who can set myself free
So I'm takin' off this pain you put on me


I remember when you gave me that ring
It was supposed to mean somethin'
Instead didn't mean a whole lotta nothin'
You don't never even talk to me
I just get to do your laundry
You sit there and you watch the TV
Even when I'm lookin' sexy
