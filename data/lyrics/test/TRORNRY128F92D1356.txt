I'm Mama Feelgood
I'm Mama Feelgood

I can make my lover reach for the stars when the sun is out, yeah
And I can make my man forget what he's thinkin' about, yeah
Now when my lover gotta have it, he don't need a thriller, no
But if he wants some lovin', I can be a painkiller, yeah

In other words what I'm tryin' to say, don't be a teaser, no
Be a love pleaser
Be a love pleaser

Be a love pleaser, forget about the others and all the rest
Whatever you be, gotta be the best
