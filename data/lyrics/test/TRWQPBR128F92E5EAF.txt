I am the chaos that you fear inside:
You're nothing without these pack of lies...
Every second counts the souls of the "damned"...
Old days are dead and gone: 
The sound of the fucking end, our state of chaos, the new breed is dead, when all is said and done!
Without the enemy, (who) stands in front of me
Got no energy, to all my enemies
...
