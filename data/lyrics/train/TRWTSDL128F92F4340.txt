You wanna know if I know where
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil and
Or how one becomes two
I just can't recall what started it all
Or how to begin the end
I ain't here to break it
Just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu
(again and again and again)

I wanna make it
I wanna make it witchu
(anytime, anywhere)
