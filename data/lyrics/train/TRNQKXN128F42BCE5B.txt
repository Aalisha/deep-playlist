Yeah
Let's go
Half a dozen cars at the parking lot strip mall
Sitting on the hood, yeah getting on their yee haw
Hear 'em out prowlin', growlin' through the straight pipe
Heartbeat thumping, pumping, jumping at the red light

East, west, north, south
City street, rural route
Everybody knows what I'm talking about
Talking about non-stop
