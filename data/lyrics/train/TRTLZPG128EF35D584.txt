Step Right Up
Step Right In
The Show's about to begin
You'll laugh
You'll cry
You might watch it all fly right by
You'll never guess who the star will be
Come in, Come on, Let's see...

As the Music
Starts to play
The spotlight shines your way.
Every eye
Turns to you
To see what you're gonna do.
Will you scream and shout?
This crowds sold out!
Come on, Tell me what your show's about?
