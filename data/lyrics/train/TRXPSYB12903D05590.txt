Well, I'm piss and vinegar again
And I hiss and I rattle and shed
And I encircle you like a bird on a school
As you slowly fight your way to shore

Well, I'm piss and vinegar again
And I needed this like a new hole in the head
Hiding out in the drink, floating, waiting to sink
My great white teeth into your white bones

With an ache in my heart and a thorn in my side
...
