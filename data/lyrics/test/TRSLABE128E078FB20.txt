[whistling]
Shorty! Shorty!
Shorty c'mere baby girl! (I like what I see)
This go out to erybody man, a little station identification
And we call this one for all y'all, who be going to buy...

Chorus:

The cheebas, them liquors
The condoms, hit the ass
It's the cheebas, the liquors
The condoms, that ass

Verse One: Mr. Cheeks

Now now now
Met this girl, just the other day
When I was up, on Rockaway
She was in Kennedy Fried (word em up)
A little kill's breast, and I said, "Excuse me Miss...
maybe we can go and jus chat." "About what?"
"About, about this about that."
I bet I put somethin in yo mind
To make you heel it up bring it back come rewind
Now I'm, just a rap artist
Not sayin that I'm the best not the smartest but
But I come up wit things ya never seen
Things you never heard of like money and the murder like
Next thing you know we in the rest
Drinkin liqour, puffin on the buddha sess
I threw on me a Rough Rider
I slid inside her

Chorus:

Wit my cheebas, my liquors
My condoms, hit the ass
