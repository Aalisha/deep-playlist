Time and time again I ask myself why should I believe at all.
You've given no concrete reason.
For me to hasten to your beckoned call,
And so I cry unheard a bitter testimony to my misery.
And so how can I pray to you.
When you take those who I love from me.
I can't believe what's right before my eyes.
We cannot see his promises were lies.
I can't believe what's right before my eyes.
This deity he does not hear our cries.
How can we believe in what we don't see.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
Can't you can't you hear us hear us crying.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
How can we believe in what we don't see.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
