I lie awake
What will they think?
What will they say?
Probably nothing

No walls there could hold me
No walls there could mold me
People step aside
You're wasting my time trying
Teachers couldn't teach it
No ones arms could reach it
You all just abide, and watch
your rights get stolen

Cast away my soul, and begin
Hypnotized by a killing moon
...
