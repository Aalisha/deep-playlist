This room belongs to no one
It once held life for me
Four walls closing in
Is all I see

Momma I'm leaving
Please try to understand
That I've got to be myself
Learn to be a man

Now there's nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide
I'm gonna pack up my things
And leave them all behind
And go away

This life is my own
Right from the start
I'll make it alone
With that spark in my heart
...
