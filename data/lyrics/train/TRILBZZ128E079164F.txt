Love is love, ohh, ohh, check it check it check
Love is love, ohh, ohh, check it check it check
Something you've expected for me
As you laid next to me this morning
As you look up into my eyes, suddenly I realize 
What I've been searching for I no longer have to look no more 
A chance to find the soul mate for my life, has realized the one that I am

There's a feeling no I can describe 
No, I can't describe 
But I know the feeling's here tonight 
Is here tonight 
Desire goes near to my bared soul 
My, my bared soul 
My feelings and my fears I'm letting go, I'm letting go 

Love is love you can't buy love, is a gift not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love, not a game, and should always remain so
Love is love you can't buy love, is a gift not an obligation
It cannot lead you to temptation
Love is love not a game and should always remain so 

Love is to've your heart open
Love is never act like a friend
It's the little things we do, and at 
Time they come from you, uhh 

Laughter, anger, tears, or joy
It's the love that we unknow, me and you
The pictures like the sun, ahh, ahh, love is love
