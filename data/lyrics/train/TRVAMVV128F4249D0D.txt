Went partying the other night
Started drinking and got real tight
We was playing with all our friends
Felt so good we had to play it again

Hey bartender, hey man
(Hey bartender)
Here
(Hey bartender)
Draw a one, draw a two
Draw a three more glasses of beer

Now she was sitting down on the end
I said, "Baby can we be friends
You look as sweet as can be
Cone on down and drink with me"
