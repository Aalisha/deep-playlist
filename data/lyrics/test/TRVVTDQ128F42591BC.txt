Sally used to carry my books to school
Sally was a good ole girl
Helped me with my homework 'cause I was a fool
'Cause Sally was a good ole girl.

If you wanted just a kiss or a little bitty squeeze
She was always willing to do her best to please
Yeah, girls were made to love and not made to tease
Sally was a good ole girl.

Yeah, Sally was a good ole girl
Sally was a good ole girl
No matter what the request
She gave it her best
Sally was a good ole girl.

Oh well, Sally's folks were poor but she helped all she could
Sally was a good ole girl
Hardest working girl in the neighborhood
Sally was a good ole girl.
