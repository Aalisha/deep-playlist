You said you couldn't stay
You've seen it all before, I know
And sold you on their way
Oh honey that's ok

No harm, he's armed
Settin' off all your alarms
When I find out
I hope it's you who set this trap

And stuffers rarely change
At least I'm on my own again instead of
Anywhere with you
Oh tell me it's all the same
