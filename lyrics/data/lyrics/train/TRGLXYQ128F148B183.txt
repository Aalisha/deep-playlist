(Intro: Mannie Fresh)
Treat your throwback chicks right
Ya know what I'm sayin they are people too
Every chick that I used to like
Done turned dike
And every chick that I used to dig hair real is really a wig
And every chick that I used to love (ohh!)
Done turned to drugs
But yet still I keep it real and I'm so in

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
I'm so in love with you
(and I ain't going no where me and you with our guns in the air baby)
I'm in love with you
(and I'm a stay down till these bitches put a nigga in the ground)
(ohh!)

(Verse 1: David Banner)
I remember those days I was broke and a bitch barely up
