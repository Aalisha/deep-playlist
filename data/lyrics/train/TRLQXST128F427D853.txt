The world is Yours and everything in it
Is all at Your command
There is no end to Your domain

The planets shake, the galaxies tremble
They turn within Your hands
There is no end to Your domain
No height or depth You don? t sustain

Great in all the earth is Your glory, oh God
The universe declares how amazing You are
Over history and eternity You alone are Lord and King

The world is Yours and everything in it
