One-two, one-two, girl you could hear me?
One-two, turn me up

I've been a threat since Benetton Gazelles in Valleys
The Icon in graffiti in the Brooklyn Alley
Touch hearts of the Pharaohs in the Egypt Valley
My Engineer can't see me 'cause the booth is cloudy
Still rowdy even though we in BM's and Audis
Lookin like black Saudis in black Denalis
I'ma terrorist attack when I get on the track
If I'm ridin' shotgun, I need one in my lap
I adapt in any habitat, a BK desert rat
It's war, then we sendin' back bodies and gats
Flip the white flag, homey it get worst than Iraq
We know the CIA game was to frame us wit crack
So each bar's more dope, heroin in my pen
Got a? Marvin? back robbin', head 'noddin again
Who you shit on to get on top could make it pop in the end
Who's the flop and what's hot got you locked in the Gym
Tell Jacob I spit Jewels I could drop 'em a Gem
And if he's lookin' for a Diamond I could hook 'em wit Timbs

& (Hell Razah)
I'm hip-hop before +Suger Hill+ signed a deal
Before Studio 54 poppin' pills
It was real when +Kool Herc+ worked the wills of steel
Now we bring the game back into a New York field
I'm hip-hop before +Suger Hill+ signed a deal
Before Studio 54 poppin' pills
I'm hip-hop - (since +EPMD+ +You Gots to Chill+)
I'm hip-hop - (since +Bestie Boys+ +Licensed to Ill+)
