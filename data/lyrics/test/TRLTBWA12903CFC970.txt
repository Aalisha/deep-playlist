(Intro)
Today, we have a serious decision that needs to be made for our family
There's a young cat out here that's growing old
Quick and fast in our organization
And today he must step up and be made
And I think you all know
Who's this guy mayn?
This guy is Silkk, Silkk the Shocker
His contribution to the streets has grown so fast he's grown weak. Kay?
You know what, this decison must be made now and only now
Isn't he young?
He's a stand up guy, he's a born leader, he has my blood
I was also a young when I started
So be it
Godfather, please, let me be the one to tell him he's a Made Man
Not now, let the Don tell him
Dannny Divuchi, bring Silkk to me
Godfather, you won't regret it
Yo Don, what up with this visit to
Okay mayn, have a seat, ju know
I'm here to tell you some good news mayn
You're a Made Man now, everybody stand up

(Silkk)
Last Year I was the help, This year I'm the boss
You don't like it? F**k ya'll, they'll find ya'll niggas lost
F**k with real niggas, mob figures, not tru niggas that's soft
I talking about visiting some of you niggas, some of you niggas is talk
I always been a made man starting I was a teen
