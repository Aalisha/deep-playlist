Hold up... hold on... don't be scared, 
You'll never change what's been and gone. 
May your smile... Shine on... 
Don't be scared, 
Your destiny may keep you warm.

Cos all of the stars have faded away, 
Just try not to worry,
You'll see them some day. 
Take what you need,
And be on your way, 
And stop crying your heart out.
