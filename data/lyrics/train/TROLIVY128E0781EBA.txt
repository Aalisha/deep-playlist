Well, she crept back in the house at half past three
Shook her head to see him snoring in his sleep
"If he really loved me," she said
"I wouldn't have to be so mean..."

He's a heap of junk that pours from his top drawer
He sometimes likes to spread it out around the floor
It's evidence of what he was like

Sha la li, sha la li, la la li
The end is growing near
And we're treading water now
And holding back our tears
And the day is rising
We're sinking
