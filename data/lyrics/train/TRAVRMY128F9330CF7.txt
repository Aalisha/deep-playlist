Yo Rich
How come y'all go ruthless
Turn around and try to be positive?

Look man, people try to tell me that I'm ruthless

So when I'm kickin knowledge I be frontin on the schoolin

But you're wrong

It's just another song

And another attitude that we use to school you

You know what I'm sayin?
A lesson is a lesson no matter how it's told
You can't teach a dog and a cat the same trick, Jack

Don't do it

Hitler was a killer, Frank Ward was the Mack
Felix Mitchell made money in 20 g stacks
Moses split the sea, King Tut wore gold
And Jesus, he's the King, so the story is told
But my posse, we keep jockin the freaks
24 a day and 7 a week
The Oaktown is always poppin
[?] tops, gold tones, the boys ain't stoppin
Not long ago, and brother listen to me
The kid on the block with a Atari
Was the most and he had all friends
They're playin game after game, again and again
But the times have changed and now comes the grind
The mixed up kids have to make up their minds
The slow lane or do they wanna move fast?
The dopeman, they say he ain't gonna last
