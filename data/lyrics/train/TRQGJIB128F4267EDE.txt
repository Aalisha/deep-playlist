when i think about your lovin'
the sunday evenings, the fun we used to share
looking through the memories in my mind
since i've laughed and cried and thought it over
now i realize that it's never over only set aside
oh it's you sweet baby
i will never be free from your embrace
sweet baby
only hopin' it's not too late to try again
it's you sweet baby
ever always been captured by your smile, sweet baby
