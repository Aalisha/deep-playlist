I'm living just to live it up, whoa yeah

Since the day that I was born, I've been rockin' round my block
Just a leather coated lover with a tattoo on my heart, yeah

Now I'm going downtown feel I should strut my stuff, babe
Workin' on one track mind and baby that's not all
Now keep the motor running 'cuz I ain't got time to waste
