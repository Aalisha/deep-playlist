you put me on a shelf how could i possibly have ever climbed so high
no different from yourself theres not a thing that we cant do if we'd just try
oh it feels like i can send my thoughts across the sky
this doesnt make much sense you are deluded with your images of me
we are all present tense there is no restraint on what we all can be
whats wrong with my mind?
sometimes i feel fine but then theres this nagging pain still inside
how can i get by when all of my time is spent on what i failed to do
this seems so strange at times just like im living life in someone elses skin
