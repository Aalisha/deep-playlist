Do you think you're made of gold?
Invincible?
You think you can handle it?
You will learn from this.

I'm telling you friend
this is something worth fighting for.
Does it not seem contradicting
to sit back and watch them take more?
Caught like a deer in their headlights, you're stuck now.
You're bound by your fears
I suggest you break free or
you'll forever be damned here.

We are merely degenerates waiting for you.

They keep marching on
spilling blood like savages.
Taking lives while your cigarette burns, burns.
