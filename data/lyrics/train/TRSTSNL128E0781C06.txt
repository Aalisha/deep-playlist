And the world it shows me up
My clothes they show me up
I never knew this before
My finest hour that I've ever known
Was finding a pound on the underground

And my words came stumbling out
Then I went tumbling out
I've never been hit before
And the finest hour that I've ever known
Was finding a pound on the underground

And I'll keep hoping you are the same as me
And I'll send you letters and come to your house for tea
...
