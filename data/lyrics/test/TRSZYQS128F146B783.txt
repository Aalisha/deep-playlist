The shit that you promote
Fighting, violence
Like you don't want to grow
You're talking so much sex
But you not tell the youths bout AIDS
And you not tell them bout consequence, no
Your talking like you a G
But you are killer killing your own
Your just a racist man's pussy
Tell me who wants to know
What when who where
Or how you lose control

Certainly not me
Certainly not me
'Cause baby personally
I like to be challenged mentally
I've heard it all before
Gangsta's pimps and whores
Quality is poor
A girl like me needs more

It takes more (takes more)
To amuse a girl like me
So much more (much more)
To confuse a girl like me
They've got you (they've got you)
'Cause while you braggin' 'bout your badness your just
Avoiding, adding
To the real shit that's happenin' to us

Now who gives a damn
About the ice on your hands?
