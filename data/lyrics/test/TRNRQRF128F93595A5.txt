You are my treasure and my darling, I possess
The world's greatest treasure, the treasure of happiness
Your smiles are my pearls and your ruby lips are beyond compare
Your eyes are my diamonds and my gold, is the gold in your hair

Earth has it's treasures, of fabulous wealth untold
And who can measure the treasure the oceans hold?
But whether it be, underneath the sea or the sky above
