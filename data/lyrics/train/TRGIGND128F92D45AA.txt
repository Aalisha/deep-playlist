I'm gon' get up in the mornin',
I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gon' get up in the mornin',
I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend, the black man you been lovin', girlfriend, can't get my room
I'm gon' write a letter, telephone every town I know
I'm gon' write a letter, telephone every town I know
