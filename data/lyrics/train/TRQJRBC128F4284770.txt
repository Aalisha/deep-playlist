When my old man he said to me you're growing fast boy there's so much to see
You take a wife, new born, a family, he said you'd see when it comes time
To be a man to do what's right
You'll always find a way to make your way through life
When my old man he said to me treat mankind with dignity
Start with no one finding someone that you need
Wonder where we go, is there really an afterlife
Never growing old, going home will free his spirit

When my old man he said to me the world moves fast boy with no guarantees
