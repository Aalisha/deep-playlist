Deitrick Haddon

Solo: A sinners prayer
A sinners prayer umh
A sinners prayer
A sinners prayer

Chrous: I could have been dead
sleeping in my grave

Solo: oh oh

Chrous: but God blessed me too see

Solo: another day

Chrous: to see another day
even when i did wrong
he was still there
Solo: Still there
I'm so glad that God still hear a sinner's prayer
Solo: Ya'll don't believe that
I'm so glad that God still hear a sinner's prayer

i walked to the church ya'll
on a sunday morning
stood outside contemplating
whether i should walk through the door
you see
