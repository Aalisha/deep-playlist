I tried to read between the lines you wrote inside your black notebook
But your heart is like a worm and you won't let me in unless I'm dirt.
So all day I'll eat the mud you walk upon on your front lawn
The neighbors wonder what I'm doing, have I lost my mind consuming
All the shit that you had left as if you knew I would fertilize your past...

Don't try to warn me that you are an island
And there's no room for fighters
...
