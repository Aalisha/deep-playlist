It's only human to despise the weak
It's only human to despise yourself when you're weak
I don't know why
But that's the way that it's always been
And I play by the rules I don't understand at all

It's only human to be lazy and vain
It's only human to expect a world that's just as vain
I don't know why
I want to believe that it's not that way
But I'm johnny come lately, it's not my place to say
