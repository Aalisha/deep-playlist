Hordes of the rotting dead surround the villagers
Unwary victims mangled and battered
Once buried warriors have risen to kill again
Signs of their wickedness left for a warning

Mutilate
Disembowel
Amputate
Kill and rape

Gratification achieved by dismemberment
Unnatural legions ravage the carcasses
Open wounds targets for evil defilers
Seeds of inquity cover the body parts

Necrosadistic warning
You will not rest in peace
