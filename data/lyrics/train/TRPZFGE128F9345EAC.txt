Nothing satisfies, nothing will cause it won't get a chance to.
Altered spirit and altered mind take a turn for the worst soon.
Fear has struck, fear is stuck maladjusted
Assurance won't sit well at all cause no one is trusted

You've got what you wanted
the reason you came
control the action control of the game
