A thumb goes up, a car goes by
It's nearly 1 AM and here am I
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home by the mornin' light

I've got no fare to ride a train
I'm nearly drownin' in the pourin' rain
Hitchin' a ride, hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home to my baby's side

Ride, ride, ride, hitchin' a ride
