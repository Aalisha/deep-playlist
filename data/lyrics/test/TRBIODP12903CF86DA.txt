Got up early found something's missing
My only name
No one else sees but I got stuck
And soon forever came

Stopped pushing on for just a second
Then nothing's changed
Who am I this time where's my name?
Guess it crept away

No one's calling for me at the door
An unpredictable won't bother anymore
And silently gets harder to ignore

I forgot that I might see
