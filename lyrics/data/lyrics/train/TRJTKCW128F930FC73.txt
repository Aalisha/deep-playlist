Your hands start to shake
But you don't know why
It's subtle and it's gross
But you don't know why
You know you're gonna break
But you don't know why
You hate your life but you don't know why! 
I'm rehabilitation? I'm jungian sessions?
No! I'm red tailed hawks... 
I wanna free tall from it all with my talons lock
I finally unearthed their "greatest story"
