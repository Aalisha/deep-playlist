Mm hey, mm hey yeah (5x)

In my world 'round you,
This I know is true
How can I tell you?
There's so much to give
How can you forget
How much I need you?

Now that we're so close together,
You ask if it's forever

Face to face and heart to heart
We've come too far to let it fall apart
Face to face and eye to eye
Love is the reason that we're face to face
Face, face...

SPOKEN:
