I've got a picture of your house
And you're standing by the door.
It's black and white and faded
And it's looking pretty worn.
See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back.
The memories are gray but man they're really coming back.

I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as i'm the hero of this little girl

Heaven isn't too far away
Closer to it everyday
No matter what your friends might say

How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside them
...
