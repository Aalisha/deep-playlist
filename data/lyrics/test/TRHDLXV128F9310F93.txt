Just roll the soundtrack
Let the lights dim down to blue
They've dressed their voodoo dolls
And named them after you

Burn your every bridge
Sever all your ties
Give confessions where
You serve them all your lies
Does it get you high
Does it make you whole
Does it get you by
As you play your role

You make me so hard
Because you're a star
You dress like the devil
Then you sing like a god
They love when you smile
...
