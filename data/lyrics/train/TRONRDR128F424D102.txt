Kill me... Down by the shore
I can feel it... She is not here anymore
Hear my call... It's born by the breeze
Tell me... To where do I go?

I would beg, I would plead
But you were still going to leave
The message that I couldn't see
Lying on the floor
The writings on the wall

Meet me... In the forest, come alone
See the lights... It's my car coming down the road
I want you... Queen of bizarre
Days of love, like an arrow shot right through the heart
