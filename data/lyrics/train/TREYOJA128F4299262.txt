One, two, three
Counting out the signs we see
The tall buildings
Fading in the distance
Only dots on a map

Four, five, six
The two of us, a perfect fit
You? re all mine, all mine
And all I can say
Is you blow me away

Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
But you picked me

Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
It was difficult to see
But you picked me
Yeah, you picked me
...
