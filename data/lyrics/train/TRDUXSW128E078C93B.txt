There's a burning question in my heart
I see the answer in your eyes
An uneasy feeling without you
There's only peace by your side
Our hearts survive the cold world outside
Somehow this love keeps us alive


I feel it in the morning
I feel it all through the day
I feel the heartache slowly slipping away
