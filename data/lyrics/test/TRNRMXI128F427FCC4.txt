Gigi D'Agostino
Miscellaneous
L'Amour Toujours
I still believe in your eyes;
I just don't care what you have done in your life.
Baby I'll always be here by your side;
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by!
I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes;
There is no choice, I belong to your life.
Because I will live to love you someday;
You'll be my baby and we'll fly away
And i'll fly with you,
I'll fly with you,
I'll fly with you
