...
I wish that we could talk about it
But there, that's the problem
With someone new I couldn't start it

Too late for beginnings
The little things that made me nervous
Are gone in a moment
I miss the way that we used to argue

Locked in the basement
...
I wake up and the phone is ringing
Surprised as it's early

And that should be a perfect warning
That something's a problem
To tell the truth I saw you comming
The way you were breathing
...
