I wanna get high, so high
I wanna get high, so high
I wanna get high, so high
I wanna get high, so high

One draw, one draw
One draw, one draw
Hey, rastaman, hey, what you say
Give mi some of yu sense

Hey, rastaman, hey, whatta say
Give mi some of yu sense
So long I have been searching for a taste
Looking all over the place
Not a thing could I find
To satisfy my mind
So I came to search for the I
To see what the I could do
And just like I said

You send it straight to my head
(I wanna feel high) So, so high
(So high) High, high
(I wanna feel high) I wanna feel high
(So high) So, so high
(One draw) One more draw now
