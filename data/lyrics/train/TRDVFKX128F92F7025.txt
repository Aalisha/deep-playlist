A moment in time
despair and fear
nothings ahead
you are right here
near is the pain 
tragedy changing you dear

Catastrophe
everythings gone
nothing today
was agreed upon

as you watched the curtains be drawn

Hands in the air
prayers and hymns
everyone's here
it's time to begin
all that was there
and what might have been 
is no longer here
it's time to begin
yearning
