That party, that party was the worst thing
That has ever happened to me
Black eye and bleeding, but I'm breathing by myself

Those girls, those guys, they all want me
They all want me dead
I should've never, should've never, no
Should've never said those things I said to her

Well, I think she's on to me
Cause she's starting to get off
Well, I think she's looking for me, for me
She's starting to go

And I said, "Pleased to meet you"
Baby, how do you do what you do?
And I'll forgive you, maybe
If you convince him not to do what he came to do
(A black eye and bleeding, but I'm fine)
What he came to do
(A sucker punch was all he had)
...
