He that keepeth Jah shall never slumber nor sleep
Behold Jah art I keeper
I don't want to call out Jah name in vain
I don't want to call out Jah name in vain
I want to call him for His mercies endureth forever
Call Him 'cause there could never be no other
Call Him now that your pocket's full of money
Call Him before things start get funny

Soon there'll be a weeping a wailing a moaning 
A gnashing of teeth
If we don't at every time,
Practice what we preach
We promise to hail Him
Hail Him Jah Rastafari
