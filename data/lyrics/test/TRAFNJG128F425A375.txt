People get the wrong impression
I wonder if they change their minds
It's an understated sign
Tell me how you see me again

Now we're swinging to the time
It's a meeting of the minds
It's all oh unbelievable, yay
Look to play it, how we say it
If you're meaning to delay it, hang on
'Cause we're moving all around, yeah

Now it's up when the party's over
And we want to free our minds
Now I'm telling you there's no hurry
Uh huh, 'cause we're choosing to groove
It's so cool to dance the night away
 (Aye, whoo!)

I choose to live a good life
Have a good time and enjoy the ride
Turn it up, break it down, move on
High times took a good turn
Spinnin' it around 'cause you got to learn
