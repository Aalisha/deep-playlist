You tell yourself you're not the one
You won't get hurt when the damage is done
You tell yourself it won't happen to you
It's the same old story, there's nothing new

Can't be the one, the one to lose
You're only wearin' someone else's shoes
Can't you read it, it's up on the wall
How can some one so big be so small

You're nothin' without your friends
They'll be with you till the bitter end
You're nothin' and you'll find out
What this world is all about

Standing in this strike zone
Runnin' with the pack
Standing in this strike zone
Ain't no use in turnin' back

You want no war, it's the chance you take
Look easier and the ice won't break
When the sun comes out in the dead of the night
You won't escape from the blinding light
