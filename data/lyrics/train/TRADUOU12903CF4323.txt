If we cannot see then we can't show
We all have ways of finding out the things we don't know
The path or truth some find they hear it in a sound
Well I can breathe it in and see the darkness all around
I see things every day in every way
Unleashed unchained and unrestrained so I can say
the death and hate I see I'll bring it to the ground
I can breathe it in and bring entire systems down
