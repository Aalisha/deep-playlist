Standing at the station, waiting on you
Could you tell me baby, why you overdue?
You see I've been standing, 3 hours or more
I got to go to work honey, you don't even wanna know

Should I wait, should I wait on you?
You better get yourself together
Hey, I don't wanna wait on you

I told you late last night, worries on my worried mind
You took my heart and my money, you wasted my precious time
I gave you my best loving, better than you need
