i believe my dreams come true
Don’t you know the story close to you
I be the one who wants to know
Is there someone else you can’t let go
Now you don’t know whats wrong or right
If you should believe that chinalike
And this is why i sing this song
Cause i don’t believe my dreams get wrong 
I believe in love
I believe in you
I believe can’t get enough of dreams come true
I believe in love
This is what i do
And i can’t get enough of me and you
I believe in love
I believe in you
I believe can’t get enough of dreams come true
