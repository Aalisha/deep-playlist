If you think like a whore then you're a fucking whore.
Plagiarism is the highest form of flattery.
Why would you ever want to be like me?
We are all someone else's terrible idea.
If you catch the evil twin then why would you keep it alive?
If you feel the fucking daggers then why not just step aside?
You are all bastard children and you've taken it all the wrong way.
