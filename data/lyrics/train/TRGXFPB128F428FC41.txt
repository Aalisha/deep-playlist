I will wait for You, oh Lord
Because You have filled my heart with joy
You lift me higher and higher
Youâ€™re my one and only desire

You put a new song in my mouth
A hymn of praise to You
All I wanna do when I wake up
Is spend my day with You

You put a new song in my mouth
A hymn of praise to You
I put my feet on the Rock Lord
I put my trust in You, sing a new song
Sing a new song, yeah

I will wait for You, oh Lord
I will wait for You, oh Lord

I will wait for You, oh Lord
Because You have filled my heart with joy
You lift me higher and higher
