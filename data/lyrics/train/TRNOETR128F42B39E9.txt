Non prophet is another word for hug me, I'm lonely.
Xaul Zan yall
You're gross
Fucking you up since 1968
Let me hear it
Respect the broccoli cock

Looking at my broccoli
It's about that time
Polishing the nasty colliflower patches till they shine (Xaul rocks!)
Try to have phone sex when you call the cops
The holes are too small
Got these huge bald spots
On top of my head emerging like unwanted islands
I'm trying to vote myself off of
By force of nature
I'm pushed off the floor to face a world of war wages,
And girls of all ages (ha ha)
I'm the guy you don't love just yet,
But i write poems with my tongue on your neck- hoping for some sex.
Older than sunsets
Golden boy blue balls
Totally upset but overjoyed by Ru Paul
The bi-polar bear hug,
Got you sick to your stomach
When I hold a beer mug and make you sip from it
Thinking this bug dick could kill the dead silence in your body
I want to be the life of the search party

My heart is beatin' yer face (Come all yall, are yall listening?)
My heart is beatin' yer face
(top ten dance hits) (move that ass)
My heart is beatin' yer face
(you aint gunna be laughing at the fist)
Xaul Zan!
I leave without a trace
(ha ha)

[Interlude]
Now if I monger whores
While Joe mongers
And he mongers whores
While she mongers whores
And we monger whores
...
