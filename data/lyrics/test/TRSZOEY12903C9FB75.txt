cash advances and jenny's back on campus
i can't believe that it's september
jenny what's the story, all the chicks in her sorority
asked her how she spent the summer
said i interned at some law firm, said i got a little sunburned
i saw some raver kid get murdered
and i met this guy, and this guy i met he got me high
and the drum and bass sounds a lot like rollin' thunder
the blue looks beautiful toppin' off the torch
you don't have to go inside to buy, you can buy it off the porch
