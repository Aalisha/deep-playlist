Oh, babe, yeah, yeah
Well, well, well, well, well

I wanna thank you
For your love so true
Your tender lovin'
Keeps my mind on you

I'll pick you up
And we'll go out and dance
You kiss my lips
And we'll have fun, fun, fun

Make it or break it
Got to make you mine
Kissin' and huggin'
All the time
...
