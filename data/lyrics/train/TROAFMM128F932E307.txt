The lights came down
I was stoned at the bar
Showin' my worst weakness
calling for the last pint
but the stronger arms threw me
throught the gates of the hell
i was hailed by the street dogs
and a bunch of wild cats
tearing another part from my bones
I get weak and so old
It was closin' time

I looked at the face before my feet
The raindrops made gray mass
looked like the drunken brain
Inside my head was a doomsday again
And when that face came closer
I almost felt the pain
