Mission of finally destruction successfull completed
Mankind's fate is sealed, unnecessary fear
Resistance is useless, no possibility to escape
Revenge to our civilization for all terrible mistakes

I see the burning lightning
Which your mental heals [out of reach]
That's the reason for that you
Will never feel [with a heart of steel]
