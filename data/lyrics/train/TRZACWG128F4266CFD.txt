(dokken, lynch)

We sold our sons and we sold our daughters
Pretty soon we'll sell our brothers
We took the gold, but the gold was water
I tried to save the world, but I failed her

She cries the tears that I never left her
I left them all behind
You were sitting in your darkest hour
Summer's gone

We tried to make the world so much better
We send our words in a pretty perfumed letter
You sit alone in your ivory towers
I'm just one person, I don't matter
