Spending some time with some friends of mine
Talking to ourselves about it
I was thinking about what they said tonight
How could I begin to doubt it

Because maybe I'd just forgotten
When you used to be around
I just hope we can be the same somehow

Because I finally feel I'm onto you now
I finally feel I'm onto you now
God I feel I'm falling now

So take all that you've learned and all that you've lived to understand
