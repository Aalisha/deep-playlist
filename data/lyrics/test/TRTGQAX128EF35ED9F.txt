Hello baby, it's a long time
I know you're here
I feel you close to me
So much to say but
Making all the words
I save them all inside
Then I see you and they disappear
Like leaves beneath the snow
And life don't wait for everyone
And yesterday, I let you go

I'm watching you tonight
And I waited for so long
I've been living on your memory
In a world where we were one
