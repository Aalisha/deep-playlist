I see the face, the face keeps watching me
I told to stop
But he just keeps on laughing at me
No time to think, no time to rest
I think these pills
Are making my mind a mess
To ease my pain from this f**king dream
I have to ask, are you another me?
And what he says, he asks from me:
Don't you know or are you too blind to see?

This is my life, this is my life
So why do all these
Doors keep on closing me
And then it comes, another flash
...
