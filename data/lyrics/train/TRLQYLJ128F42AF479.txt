He Punches In At Nine, Eight The Breakfast That I Made For Him, Hops In The Seven, He Get Six Figures, When He Gets Off At Five I'm what He's Hungry Four, Three Little Letters And I'm In The Mood (In The Mood), And He's The Only Man That I Give It Two, If Ya Man Don't Be Stressin Ya, Need To Count Ya Blessings, Ladies Let Me See Them Hands Now, Help Me With This Count Down.

[Chorus:]
Ten, So Many Reasons Why I Stick With You
Nine, Mind And My Body Adore You Cause Of The Things You Do
Eight, I Want You Here With Me, Seven Days Of The Week, Six If I Let You Go I'm A Fool,'cause Boy There's Only One You, Five Said I Never Wanna Let You Go That's From My Heart, Four, Ever And Ever Just To Be With You Thats What I Want, Three, No I Never Wanna Leave Your Loves Just Too Good To Me, Two, And There's Nothing Bad You Can Do, That's Why There's Only One You
