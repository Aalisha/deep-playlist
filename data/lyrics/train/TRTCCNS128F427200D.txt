With his arms around your love
Oh no, here comes the pain that you can't ignore

With his arms around your girl
He'll do all of the things you didn't do before
You had every chance, but you closed the door

Now you're just gonna have to take it
(Cause if you didn't know)
She's gonna make you pay for it
(At a price you can't afford)
You're just gonna have to take it

With his arms around your love (x3)

Oh, yeah
