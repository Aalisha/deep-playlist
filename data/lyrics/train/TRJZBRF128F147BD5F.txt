You engineer the stratosphere
You command this hemisphere
But water will still come
Man should surrender

Rearrange forms of life
Battle night with your lights
But water will still come
Man should surrender

Flying boxes through the air
Dropping cities everywhere
But water will still come
Man should surrender

Fire made for all to burn
...
