Branded with irons under black skies
Born with the look of hate in those eyes
Raised on a mountain, like a stray beast
Only desire to kill what he needs

Conquered the wild, angry and mean
Moved to the city, age of sixteen
Fighting for money all over town
Hungry for blood and a heavyweight crown

He's not your average mountain man
'Cos he was born with big ol' hands
There's adamantium in those bones
He's got a jaw that's made of stone
With his barbarian beliefs
It's no surprise that he can't be beat
He's not your average mountain man
'Cos he was born with big ol' hands
