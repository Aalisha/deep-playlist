It is my life, my life.
I need to live my own life to be free,
out on my own is a world that is strange to me.
Let me go lose control my time is now
why can't you see and leave me be.
I never had things go my way, you always had them go your way.
Now I will have it all my way.
I will have it all my way you will not beat me.
HOW COULD YOU RUIN MY LIFE.
