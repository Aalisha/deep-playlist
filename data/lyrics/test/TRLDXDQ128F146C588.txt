Heavens above what have we done
Oh, we've killed off the thing we had so little of
True, love has no truth without a price
But the cost of loving has been blown sky high
Spend on the hope the call The Peacemaker
And pray to their God - the Heavy Rainmaker
Paegans of wealth they dance so freely
As they give away the life that comes so cheaply
