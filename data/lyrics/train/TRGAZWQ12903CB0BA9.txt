Well we had to pull on something
So we’re grabbing at the threads
And now the world’s unravelling
Inside our very heads
Glasses smeared with lipstick
Hungry eyes out in the street
Same old bodies moving
To the same old beat

Had to draw the line
Had to draw the line

All this talk can hypnotize you and
We can ill afford
To give ourselves to sentiment
When our time is oh so short
There are names beneath the lichen
On these cemetery stones
And carnivals of silverfish
Waiting to dance upon our bones

Have to draw the line
