In the dark, in the dark cold night
I am wide, I am wide awake
Thinking about all the things we said
Anger, hey, hey

How you looked when you slammed the door
How I felt when you walked away
And I give everything I have
If you stay, you stay

It cuts deeper than you know
I can't go on like this

Don't care who's wrong or right
Don't care too much for pride
The love between us is all that matters

Won't you come back to me?
We'll work it out somehow
Oh, can't you see that it's all that matters

In the tears of so many years
When I think of the time we spent
And I can't seem to stop the tears
From falling, falling
...
