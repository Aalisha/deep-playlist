If the music makes you move
And yo can dig the groove
Groove on, groove on

If you feel like you wanna make love
Under the stars above
Love on, love on

If there's somethin' you wanna say
And talkin is the only way
Rap on, rap on

Cause whatever
Yu wanna do
Oh, you gotta do your thing

If you feel like you wanna scream
...
