Plastic needles in my skin
Don't ask me what they're for
No clue, except for pain and shock
You tied me to the bed to mock

My eyelids kept wide open
So I can see all that you do
All this liquid in my eyes
Come inside my world, friend, if you dare... the curse

It's cold, I shiver while I sweat
...
