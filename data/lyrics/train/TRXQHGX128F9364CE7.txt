More than an ocean,
Keeps us apart.
I feel a tearing in half of my heart.
A walk on the water,
Is all that I need.
But miracles are not happening.
You're not even listening to me.
Leaving you ain't easy now,
But loving you's the harder part.
You never want me for myself,
And I've needed you right from the very start.
Oh, won't you stay and try to:
Give a little bit of heart and soul.
Give a little bit of love to grow.
Give a little bit of heart and soul,
