Do do, do the juke box
Do do, do the juke box
Do do, do the juke box
Do do, do the juke box

Do do, do the juke box
Do do, do the juke box
Do do, do the juke box
Do do, do the juke box

Come on baby do the juke box jive
Just like they did it nineteen fifty five.
Come on now don't let go
Hold on to me
Come on girl and let me know
You'll do the juke box jive with me.
Yeah yeah

Come on baby do the juke box jive
Just like they did it nineteen fifty five.
