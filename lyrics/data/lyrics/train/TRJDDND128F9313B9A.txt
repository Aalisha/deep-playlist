Who is there like You?
Who can compare or match Your worth?
When I consider the works of Your hands
My heart is filled with awe
In wonder I rejoice and glory in Your power
In worship I confess
How majestic, how majestic, O Lord, our Lord
How majestic Your name in all the earth
How majestic, how majestic, O Lord, our Lord
How majestic Your name in all the earth
