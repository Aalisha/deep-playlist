When I was a little girl
I never dreamt of terror
Is this all now that we are?
Connections have gone so wrong

I never meant to hurt myself
But I don't feel too nice today
And when you got in my way
I never meant to beat you
But now the damage is all done
Here comes the future
And it's not looking so bright
...
