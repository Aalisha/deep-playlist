The weary creak of my bones
Exhausted voice, deathly tones
Arms of lead, skin drawn tight
No long a princely sight
Face is gaunt, pale and thin
Bent and grey and full of sin

Pass to me
Wine and song
For I'll be
Soon long gone

Cast me down, upon the dust
My dry bones remain tombless
From my life, a rose is grown
...
