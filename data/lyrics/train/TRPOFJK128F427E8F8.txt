Highway 51
Run right by my baby's do'
Highway 51
Runs right by my baby's do'
If I don't get the girl to lovin'
Ain't g'win down Highway 51, no mo'

Now, if I should die
Befo' my time should come
I say, if I should die, umm
Just befo' my time should come
I want ya to please bury my body
Out on Highway 51
