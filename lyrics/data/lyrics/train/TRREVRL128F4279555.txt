I want to trace your scars with my fingertips
Follow it's fracturing line
I think you should know how beautiful and brave
You already are

So sick of secondhand lovers carving names on my chest
If I lean in too close, it's to kiss or confess
Promise you won't let on
And I won't let you down

But you're a silent film, all the way back home
...
