Girl I feel like we've been through it
Just remember everything I say
You're still here and I'm still here
So don't worry no longer Coz we're getting stronger

Don't make things so complicated
Analyzing every single move
Firing questions by my intentions
All I will say is I love ya
And you should know that

I wanna make you smile
Make the sun shine baby
Never leave your side
But if you don't believe me
After all I've said and done
Guess you will never know
If that's the way it goes

Rise above the others baby
Don't believe a single word they say
They're just jealous so envious
Waiting for something but getting nothing
...
