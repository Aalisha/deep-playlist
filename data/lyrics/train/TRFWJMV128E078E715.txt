I know it never came easy
Girl, you drive me out of my mind
Your fine and still kind of sleazy
Now I want to make you mine
Somehow, I don't believe you
I really need you now
You know you're so good at teasing
Maybe that's what I like
Sometimes you're hot when you're freezing
Don't want to let you out of my sight
Somehow, I don't believe you
I really need you
I don't believe you
And I really need you
(Hey) You never believe what I say
You're gonna surrender someday
Surrender to me
