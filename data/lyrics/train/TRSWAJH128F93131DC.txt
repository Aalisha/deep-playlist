It's all getting old
and wise men run away so easily
so lightly I can't believe it
so drown into the sea
you'll find me there
I will drain all your fears
take it back, take it back
I can't believe
we didn't kill our (lies)
be quiet ask yourself why
and try
try to reach those heights
cause it's useless business
to tear yourself apart
...
