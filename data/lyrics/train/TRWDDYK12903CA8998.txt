She's a high fashion love assassin
Taking names and playing games is her passion
But her perfect world started coming apart
The day I broke her cold heart

Now she's hungry for the blood of any boy
And she'll get it 'cause she gets what she wants
She's a devil in black stilettos
Don't cross her, she's a fully loaded debutante

Everybody run, everybody run
She looks so sweet when she's having fun
Everybody run, everybody
The homecoming queen has got a gun
