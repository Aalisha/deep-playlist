You thought of us before the world began to breathe
You knew our names before we came to be
You saw the very day we'd fall away from You
And how desperately we need to be redeemed

Lord Jesus come lead us
We're desperate for Your touch

Oh, Great and Mighty One with one desire we come
That You would reign, that You would reign in us
We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice
That You would reign, that You would reign in us

Spirit of the Living God fall fresh again
Come search our hearts and purify our lives
We need Your perfect love, we need Your discipline
We're lost unless You guide us with Your light
