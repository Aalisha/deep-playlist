I've been
Searching

The lights to the poodle shadows that should be as you see a man running
Running through your dream
And you don't recognise him by the look on his face
But you feel that you've met some time some place

That's mean I'm Searching
Searching for the praise of my mind
I'm looking for the face
I'm gonna find it
If it takes every minute
Of every day
This time I won't let it get away

Searching
I've been
Searching

And you hear the elders sounds of weak and you know what it's saying
I'll you what it brings
It aint a bubble fly so high
Can't you see that it's me? 

That I'm Searching
Searching for the praise of my mind
I'm looking for the face
I'm gonna find it
If it takes every minute
Of every day
