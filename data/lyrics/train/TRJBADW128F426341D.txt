Girl I can lace you

If I can do it, I'll do it
The way you want me to
I know that I can work it right
Get on it, get to it
It ain't no need in frontin', you and me we're just alike, oh

If you like it, we'll do it
Just as often as you like babe
Call me up, I'll start you up anytime
Let me be the one who will tell you that
I will lace you

Girl I can lace you
If you like it non-stop
Lick you to the last drop
And you know I make it hot
Make your dreams come true
And you know in your heart I will

Girl I can lace you
If you like it non-stop
Lick you to the last drop
And you know I make it hot
Make your dreams come true
And you know in your heart I will
