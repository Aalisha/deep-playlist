First warm day in all these months
All the sunlight made me drunk
Made me feel like I could run
Made me feel like I was young
So I went out all on my own
I told no one where'd I'd go
Anyway I did not know I only knew I had to go
Out beyond the iron gate
Out there where you said you'd wait
Gotten used to living here
Call it habit call it fear
