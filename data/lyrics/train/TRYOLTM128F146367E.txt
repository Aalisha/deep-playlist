(Great Spirit come)
(Great Spirit come)

Who has chased away the moonbeams?
Who has pulled a blanket across the sky?
Who will sing in celebration
Throughout this land that's bound to die?

(Great Spirit come) oh, that's bound to die
(Great Spirit come)

Who will put an end to all this sadness?
Who hears the Earth that cries beneath the burning rain?
All truth reduced to piles of greed and madness
The accident remains the same

(Great Spirit come) oh, always the same
...
