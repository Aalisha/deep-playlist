In the corridors of institutions,
There’s a putrid smell
Of rotting minds.
That beg for something real to hold,
Instead of processed
Useless lies.
Mothers whore their weeks away.
As daughters learn,
To do the same.

As years wear on, we’ll see the day,
When numbers take
The place of names.

This is the force that marks new breath,
It’s thrashing death.
