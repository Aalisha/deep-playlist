You do it all again
You stop making sense
When everything is all forgotten
Youâ€˜ve got the devil in your eyes
And lips too warm for lies
But every word sounds quite foreboding
See you fading away, see you slip away
And no one knows how you got here
In a sequence of events
I am waiting in suspense
When no one listens to each other
The day never ends 
When they carry you on hands
