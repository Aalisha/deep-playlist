Now let me start by saying sorry
Thought it might be positively too late
Knowing this one word can't change things
But yet it can express the way my heart aches

What about the dreams of cascades
What about the vows we pledged
Are they still alive or dead
And what about the promise to stay
Can I still believe it's ok
Can we somehow talk about these what abouts
