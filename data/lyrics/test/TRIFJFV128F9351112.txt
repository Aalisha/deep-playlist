Tried to take it all away
Learn her freedom just inside a day
And find her soul
To find their fears allayed

Tried to make her love their own
They took her love they left her there
They gave her nothing back
That she would want to own

Gold and silver rings and stones
Dances slowly of the moon
No-one else can know
She stands alone

Sleeping dreams will reach for her
She cannot say the words they need
She knows she's alone
And she is free


Chorus:

Ocean gypsy of the moon
