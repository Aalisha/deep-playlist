I hear you knockin' but you can't come in
I hear you knockin' but you ain't gon' win
I hear you knockin', I hear you knockin'
I hear you knock, knock, knock, knock, knockin'

Workin' day and night
Gotta get up and pay my bills
People want what they want
They don't care about how you feel

You ain't gon' get me today
You better move out of my way
I got a whole lot to live for
Don't wanna hear the blues today

Economy down, said news
'Cause we bought the war
Change comes like the wind
Now I know what hope is for

I see the sun on my face and you won't hear me complain
Hey, 'cause I can't let the dark days
Bring me down, got a lot of things to say
Don't be knockin' at my door
