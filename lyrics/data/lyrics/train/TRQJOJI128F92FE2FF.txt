I don't know what you smoke
Or what countries you've been to
If you speak any other languages other than your own
I'd like to meet you

I don't know if you drive
If you love the ground beneath you
I don't know if you write letters or you panic on the phone
I'd like to call you

All the same, if you want to
I am game

I don't know if you can swim
If the sea has any draw for you
If you're better in the morning or when the sun goes down
I'd like to call you

I don't know if you can dance
...
