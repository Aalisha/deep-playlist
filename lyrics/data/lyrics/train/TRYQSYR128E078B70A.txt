Another day is here and I am still alive
I say these words aloud, they speak from the inside
And everytime I see you
You just walk away
Still the world is turning

I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say
I want to hear what you, what you've got to say, ay, ay, ay, uh
