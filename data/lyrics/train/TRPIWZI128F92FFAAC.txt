When you're feeling down
I'm comin' round
To pick you up
And take you out

It won't be long
â€˜Till those blues are gone
The city's waiting
Beckoning for us
It leads us on
Let it lead us on

It's the perfect night
To just drive on by
Let the dashboard underscore
Everything we've seen
While the world plays for our pleasure
...
