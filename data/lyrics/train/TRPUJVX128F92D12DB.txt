There´s a crowd, talking loud, but they ain´t saying nothing
Slow and stale, weak and pale, while we´re running and laughing
Cause there´s something else, something bright and pure,
Something that you´ve never felt before
Something you can´t touch, something you can´t see, you just don´t believe

AA-AAAA

Don´t you die yet, first class riot
