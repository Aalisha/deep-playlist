Stiggety step right up here goes your pusher
Dressed in black, dealing from bud to crack
But the pusher don't know that I'm trying to scheme
And if he let me get to close I might dope fiend
Making snaps as he serves to the cluck bitches
Rush your spot because I need the mutherfucking riches
He dont know me, but geah I know the fool name
Hooked him up with a hoodrat, y'all know the game
Call me a sneaky little devil
Rush his ass to the spot as I clock him with a shovel
Dont wanna do it but I gots to kick down my kid
And if I aint got what you got, I'm putting in my bid
Jack you, jack your crew in your territory
Crazy mutherfucker but its just another gang story
Make the hit as I creep in the Nova
Mutherfucker, cause I gots to get over
