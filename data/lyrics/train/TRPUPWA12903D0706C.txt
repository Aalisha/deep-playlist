Spring Is Alive

Spring is alive
In Carolina
Deep in the forest
Where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain
Down in a holler
Thunder and lightning
So it goes

Over a hundred years ago
We came to Carolina
Far across the water
It's a long hard road

With little more than courage
We came seeking independence
A little less than nothin'
Is a heavy load

From the heather of the highlands
We have found the Smokie Mountains
Hard work and simple ways
And life is good
life is good

Spring is alive
In Carolina
Deep in the forest
Where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain
Down in a holler
...
