Shooting daggers at me
Letting it be known you're not impressed
I never fail at failing all your tests
Don't be so proud,
'Cause you're still so scared to be alone
You can't change your mind

You won't embrace this
But you'll accept this
You can't let go

Broken stars,
By a single shattered mirror
Seven years of trust
I know you'll never change for anyone
A cold heart never lusts

My mind's made up
And I would know I'd do the right thing
...
