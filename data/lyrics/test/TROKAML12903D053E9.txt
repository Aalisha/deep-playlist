Deep in the night, boundless violence will seethe with the danger
Our laws collide not allowing another contender
When the wine drinks itself, you will burn to a cinder
We're fighting time awaiting the answers

I'll never let them stake you down (Take you down)
I'll fight to find a way

Is there a way to turn the mind of a barbaric stranger?
Eternal days awaiting for you to awake, my avenger
A cruel fate now condemns us to burn to a cinder
Are we too late, running on empty?

I'll never let them stake you down (Take you down)
