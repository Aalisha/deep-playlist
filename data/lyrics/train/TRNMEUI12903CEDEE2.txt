Well I'm long gone to Saskatchewan
Long gone to Saskatchewan
Where the gettin's good if you're gettin' gone
I'm gonna put my boots and my hat back on.
Cause I'm long gone to Saskatchewan
Long gone to Saskatchewan

Well it's a hell of a battle to try to raise cattle
In the prettiest place on the hoof
Oil refiners and lot sub-dividers
Got land prices right through the roof

They got value's distorted and my brow's all contorted
With the words that the banker just wrote
Me and the missus, we love the cow business
Took jobs just to keep us afloat
The old lady's a waitress in three different places
And still can't afford her own car
I've been drivin' grader, I'm a smooth operator
Wonderin' where all the gravel roads are

I like Alberta, but dang ain't ya hearda
How much it can cost to buy oats?
I'll always love her and think kindly of her
But I got no money left over for smokes
