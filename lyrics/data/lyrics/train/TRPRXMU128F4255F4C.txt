It's Russian Roulette with no luck
You could kiss it goodbye
There's no such thing
As sympathy
When the disease is entering

At first glance your instinct says
The stranger is a little dangerous
The cat was killed from curious thrills
Now Christ has left the manger

The taste is so divine
Chemical coma life
Welcome to your vice
Good luck with life
'Cause you can't
You can't
You can't kill me that easily

It's so nice to meet you
...
