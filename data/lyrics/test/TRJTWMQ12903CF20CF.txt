Fading in the night
To end the suffering
The world you've left behind
Adventitious thoughts disclose
The path you've chosen
Darkness shows you light?

Eternal soil
Approve in three dimension
Skin cold and white
Internal self
Transversing through
This terra
Spirit full in flight

A dead eye flashback recaptures
Mentally sensing with subconscience

Once here, once there now
Another life you're living

Destiny, revives the sight awaken
Recall a place that you once knew
Misery, another life is taken
Recall the spirit breaking through
