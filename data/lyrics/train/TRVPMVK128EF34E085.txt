Well you were waiting for me, you saw me, adored me
As I wish the whole world would
You would never hurt me, desert me or work me
For all the things you thought you could
You would lick the tears from my eyes when I cried
Oh how I missed you when I was gone
Hurt me so to leave you, deceive you, I needed you, I believed in you

Oh I, I never meant to let you down
I'll wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart

Now all I have is riches and pictures and stitches
Money could never buy what you gave
