I wonder, wonder who, who-oo-ooh WHO 
(Who wrote the Book Of Love?)

Tell me, tell me, tell me
Oh, who wrote the Book Of Love?
I've got to know the answer
Was it someone from above?

(Oh, I wonder, wonder who, mmbadoo-ooh, WHO)

I love you darlin'
Baby, you know I do
But I've got to see this Book of Love
Find out why it's true
