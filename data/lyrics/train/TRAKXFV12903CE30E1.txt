I don't go to church enough
I curse out loud, I drink too much
I'm more of a sinner than a saint

Got a dusty Bible on my shelf
I just pick it up when I need help
Lord know there's a lot I need to change
And I want to, baby, you make me want to

You tie the knot
When I'm at the end of my rope
You never stop believin' in me
When I don't know who I am
Or what I'm supposed to be
...
