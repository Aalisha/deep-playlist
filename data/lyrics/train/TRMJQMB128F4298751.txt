It's been a while since you last saw me
One breaks down and the other ones fade
These eyes can see the days break
Too late for the other's mistakes

Sit down laugh thinking what have we done
Let me inside
Is it all over before it's begun
Please give me some time

Cause we are running into the sun
Getting close to something into the sun
You know that we're falling
We're falling back into the sun
