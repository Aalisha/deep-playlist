[B-Real]
So whaddya do when the game starts changin fast?
Arrange for your ass to find a way to stay in the class
Sales declinin, downloads are risin
Newbies shinin, and we stuck askin where did ya find him
He ain't a diamond but he really got some incredible timin
So sign him and put him out, he's a star that's shinin
Give him a ringtone deal, a commercial with T-Mobile
Man he can global, depends if he acts noble
Take his photo and put him on the cover of Vibe
Rolling Stone and The Source mag both gave him a five
Now he thinks that his shit don't stink
And every drink's from a bottle of Crist', and he's flyin on mink
He's, young and dumb and don't sync with the drum
But all the little girls love him cause he's number one
On top of the Billboards winnin Grammy Awards
Goin to red carpet events with the media whores
[Chorus: Tek]
Lights camera flash you're on!
Uh-uh uh, uh, uh-uh on!
Time's up, six minutes you're gone!
