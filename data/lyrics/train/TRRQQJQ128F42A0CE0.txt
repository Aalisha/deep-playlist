Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

I've been watching you
Just to see how far you would go
You're gonna have to prove
Make a move and let it show

I know it's getting late
And you gotta go home
But before you go, baby just

Show me, show me what I gotta do
And baby, if you love me
 (You love me)
I'll do anything for you, show me, oh, oh
