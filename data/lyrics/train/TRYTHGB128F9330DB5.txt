Where were you on our wedding day?
I got bad news that you went away
Where were you on our wedding day?
You did me wrong and now you must pay

Whoa oh - give me back my ring - Whoa oh
Whoa oh - I ain't gonna let you keep a thing - Whoa oh

Where were you when I said I do?
Everybody laughed at my in-laws too
Where were you when I turned around?
When your whole family hung their heads down

Whoa oh - give me back my ring - Whoa oh
