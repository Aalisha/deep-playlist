Can we talk about our last conversation?
It was heated I got burned
And please don't act like nothin' even happened
Just listen and learn

We've invested too much time

What if I told you that I never loved you?
What would you do?
Is that what you always wanted to hear?
Your words are so few

This is all that I am
