In a house where no one never sleeps,
lays a man who sees more with his eyes
Picturing the past before him,
in a bed, alone, with clothes on
Paying for a service he doesn't really need

With his eyes, he sees more love and lust
more tears, far too much to handle
Can't tell a soul, not this time, they'd lock him right up
Too much of burning bushes too much for his weak soul

In his mind, oh so jaded, he's gone too far behind
