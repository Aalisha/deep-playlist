I can see it in your mystery eyes
I can feel it on your breath tonight
The yearning for time, the yearning for eternal life

Oh... oh... oh... sucking your blood, oh... oh... oh

Let me look you deep in the eyes
Let me look... into your mind
Let me take you to a room full of life
Let me, let me, let me suck your wine

Oh... oh... oh... sucking your blood
Oh... oh... oh... sucking you, sucking your blood

A Chandelier is our source of light
