I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver linin' behind ev'ry cloud
Just four people that 's all we were
Tryin' to make a livin' out of black-land dirt
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud

Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne
