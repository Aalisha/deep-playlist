Use your fist. Please don't knock. My loose teeth are yours to take. Cuddling our new found freedom in keeping our eyes open without being awake. Kiss my ear. The faint still taunts. Children rejoice, "Once hero, now dead." One last time. I'm really hurting. Just a little taste to take off the edge. I rummage through old love letters and photographs in a desperate reach for a clue into who I am. With only the distant past as a reference, I fail to feel any connection to the bones under my skin. You can cry, but you're still getting sterilized. You can show the sun how to come if you know the sky. He'll let you make a mess if you keep him high. It was a good shoot. The messenger deserved to die for his lies. Make it hurt. Scare me straight. Cursed is he who can't burn by fire. We're all falling. Show me feeling. I'm your designated diver. I can see the cuts on your mind. Your mother made yours. Mine made mine, I know you'd rather be sad then stupid. Genius by day, Junkie by night. By the grace of breeze, I never scraped a knee that didn't help me see bleeding isnt what it seems. Let it steam. Let it steep, `till it screams, "Finally free!" Then, you better leave. I bet that she's gonna kill the king.
