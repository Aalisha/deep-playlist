I'm gonna do all the things for you
A girl wants a man to do
Oh, baby
(Oh, baby)

I'll sacrifice for you
I'll even do wrong for you
Oh, baby
(Oh, baby)

Every minute, every hour
I'm gonna shower you
With love and affection
Look out it's coming in your direction

And I'm, I'm gonna make you love me
Oh yes, I will
Yes, I will
I'm gonna make you love me
Oh yes, I will
Yes, I will

Look it here
My love is strong, you see
I know you'll never get tired of me
Oh, baby
