It's too late now for you to be sorry
It's too late now for you to be blue
It's too late now for you to worry
For I've found somebody new
I've found somebody new

You had a chance, but you misused it
I tried so hard to make you love me too
Now that I'm gone, you find you need me
But I'm all through with you
