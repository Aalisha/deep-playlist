(Snoop Dogg)
Pimp
Its pimp shit, its pimp shit
Nigga said his bitch took him to court for child support
Its cheaper to keep her
Cheaper to keep her
Thats real talk
Cheaper to keep her
Thats real talk, its cheaper to keep her

(Chorus: Snoop Dogg)
Now if you don't think I know what the fuck i'm talkin bout
(What you talkin bout?)
Run down to the Dogg House, and see fo' yo own two eyes
Bitches try to pull snake moves to get a piece of the pie

(Hook)
Its impossible, to stop a ho
So let her go, and get the dough
Lead the way, or step aside
Break a bitch till the day I die

(Verse 1: Snoop Dogg)
Check me out, no doubt, I flip the game and re-route
I check her in wit Magic Man Juan, or Pimpin Ken
I just got back from Milwaukee, the All-Star game
Not the NBA nigga, i'm talkin real playa shit mayne
