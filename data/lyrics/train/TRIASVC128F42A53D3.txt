I said, maybe we'd be better off leaving this town
You said, baby, I don't know how we'd ever get out
Just get into the car and drive
We could be in a whole other world by midnight
In another state of mind

Let's leave out all plan we had for us
When we were younger
Let's run free, baby like we used to and
Take our chances under
Bluer skies, bluer skies
