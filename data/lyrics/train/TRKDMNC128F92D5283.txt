Everywhere I look I see your smilin' face
Every song I sing I sing in hopes you're listening
When the tables turn I learn from my mistakes
I'm only human here after all oh aren't we all

Don't walk away don't say good bye
Don't leave me here no not tonight
Don't walk away like you did the other time

Come on come on
If you want to make it right we can make it right
I said it's been too long to let go now hear me out 
Come on come on
If you want to make it right we can make it right
I said I won't be here when the morning comes

Even with your eyes closed do you hear my voice
Carrying the weight of all we love and left behind
Love's so unpredictable have we been blind
