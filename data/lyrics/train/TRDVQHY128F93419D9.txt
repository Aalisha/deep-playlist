It's not enough to be what you wanted
Stuck in love, fighting your way out
Your string's attached to all my limbs
And I know you're about to let me down, down

Let me tell you, leave behind you
Never ends, never ends

If you ever learn just to walk away
Then kill me with the words that you didn't say
Finish what you started
Push until you feel I'm about to break
Littering into pieces of what you take
Just finish what you started so we can do it again

I know it's bound to happen
