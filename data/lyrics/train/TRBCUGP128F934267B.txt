Midnight, I'm driving in the pouring rain
The thought washed over me
Will I ever be here again on this day or any other day?

Sheets of rain like honey, made it hard to see
Turns of the road ahead fast approaching me
Approaching me, fast approaching me

Ooh, gotta get out of this Rivertown
I'll get a ferry and ride to a higher ground
Far from Rivertown
