See the tree? how big it's grown,
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big...
I laughed at her, and she got mad
The first day that she planted it
Was just a twig...
Then the first snow came,
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die...
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And i laughed 'til i cried...
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb, and kinda smart
And i loved her so...
And i surprised her with a puppy,
Kept me up all Christmas eve,
2 years ago...
And it would sure embarrass her when i came in from workin' late,
...
