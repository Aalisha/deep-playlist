Come together, one and all
And hear what they've got to say
They're here, to save your soul
And come and save the day

The soapbox is open
As long as you've got the cash
A quick speech, a photo op
Take the money man, take the money man

Hey mister who's to blame
If you've got no reasons, got no shame
Your black suit fits you nice
But you'll get nowhere till you
Name your price

They'll tell you what you want to hear
They'll make your problems disappear
Now they've got you feeling fine

But they won't understand
