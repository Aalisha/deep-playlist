Tell me baby what’s a man to do
When he’s in love with a woman like you
Won’t even give me the time of day
I want to love you but you’re so far away
I try to call you on the phone
I want to see ya but you’re never alone
So come on baby it’s gettin’ late
I’ve got to have you and I just can’t wait

I’m sho’ enough in love
Sho’ enough in love with you
Well I’m sho’ enough in love baby
