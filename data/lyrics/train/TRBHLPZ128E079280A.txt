My heart, your hands, gentle my friend
Break me neatly, numb me sweetly

Say you would, say you could
Say you'd come and stop the rain
Say you'd try and hold me tight
And you just give me away
Make me high on lullabies
A melody for me to sway
Say you would, say you could
And you don't do anything

Come down heavy, try and steady
Precious ladies, love you, love me

Say you would, say you could
