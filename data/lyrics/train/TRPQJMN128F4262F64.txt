Sunrise on Sunset Beach
Finds me right where I watched it set
I spent the night inside myself
But I haven't found me yet

But I'm not running from you anymore
I'm not running from you anymore
Oh no not anymore

'Cause I believe that when I call for You
You hear the plea for my rescue
You lift me up above the world I know
And I know that when I speak Your name
You hear my voice and send Your Saints
