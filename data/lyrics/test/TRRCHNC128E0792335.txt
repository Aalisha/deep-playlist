When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till you're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just a touch of the hand
For me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you where I am

So honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
