So listen up girl you know i've got to go
carry on, cause i know, i know
who i was and who i'm becoming
this could take it's toll on me
this pen becomes my sword
and the paper is my shield
i will carry on with the weight of how i feel
(Of how i feel)

Tonight i'll hit the road
with my head against the glass
our story begins
we're never turning back
frustration carried on by
the lack of dedication, no
for you to come home
(For you to come home)
