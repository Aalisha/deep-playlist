Gimme a bet and I'll take it
I've twenty bucks says I'm gonna make it
I've got twenty two fifty in the bank
And I'd bet it all away given the chance

I'm the independent thief
And no one's got a number on me
Everybody's talking while you save this crowd
They water down the drinks and the band plays too loud
