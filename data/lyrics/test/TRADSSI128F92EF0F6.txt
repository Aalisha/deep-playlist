We've all got our burdens, our secrets and our shames
We've all been discouraged and watched love fall in flames
And when we hit the bottom of all we can bear
When we need you

You rise like the morning sun, a pillar in the night
You looked into the void and called it light
And you are faithfully provide for the trouble that we share
When we need you, you've always been there
