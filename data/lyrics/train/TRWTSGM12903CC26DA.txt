Long gone are the days when blood flowed through my frozen veins
Dormant are the thoughts of a complete recovery
And I know it's not the time to let it slip away
When all that's in my grasp turns to visions of a world so bleak
Reach inside, pull out what was once the greatest part of me
Resuscitate this life of mine before the angel calls
Shock my system, wake me up, don't let me close my eyes
I'll gasp for breath if you give me the air
