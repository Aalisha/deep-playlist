It was so easy that night
Should have been strong, yeah, I lied
Nobody gets me like you

Couldn't keep hold of you then
How could I know what you meant

All the cities and faces
But I know how I feel about you

There's a mountain between us
But there's one thing I'm sure of
That I know how I feel about you

Can we bring yesterday back around?
