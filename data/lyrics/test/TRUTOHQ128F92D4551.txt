I wanna start it over
I wanna start again
I want a new beginning
One without an end

I feel it inside
Calling out to me

It? s a voice that whispers my name
It? s a kiss without any shame
Something beautiful, yeah, yeah

Like a song that stirs in my head
Singing love will take us where
Something's beautiful

I? ve heard it in the silence
Seen it on a face
I? ve felt it in a long hour
