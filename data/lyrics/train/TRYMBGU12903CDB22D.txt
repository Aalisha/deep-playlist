awaken on dreamy plains
with time on my hands
remembering better nights
darkness slowly fades
the sunshine was warm and bright
now its face has weakened
I had a flame in my eyes
now I'm cold inside and weak

we promise we wouldn't lose this time
but we both know we can fail
afraid to tread the swaying bridge of lies
...
