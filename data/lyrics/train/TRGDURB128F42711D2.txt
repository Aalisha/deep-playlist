Plug in that guitar get ready to roll
warm up your fingers play with body & soul
Turn up the amps to ten and pound on those drums
electric music played as loud as it comes

I like it loud and clear so don't be shy
give me my music and I'm ready to fly
If it ain't loud enough I don't waste my time
'cause mellow rock is just a bloody crime

It makes your body move
It pounds in your head
