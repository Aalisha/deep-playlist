If I knew the words to say
I'd write you a letter
If I had the blues today
You could make me feel better

I tried to be independent but
I know I'm fooling myself
I know I can only be
Just what you make of me
There'll never be anyone else

I would always be happy
I would always be blue
I'll be your friend or your lover
Baby, it's all up to you

I will be your fancy
(I'll be your fancy)
And I will be your dancer
(I'll be your dancer)
And if you want romance
Just count on me
(Count on me, count on me)
