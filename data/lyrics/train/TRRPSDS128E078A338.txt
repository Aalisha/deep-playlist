I don't want to hurt you
For no reason have I but fear
And I ain't guilty
Of the crimes you accuse me of
But I'm guilty of fear

I'm sorry to remind
You but I'm scared
Of what we're creating
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
Like a long forgotten dream
