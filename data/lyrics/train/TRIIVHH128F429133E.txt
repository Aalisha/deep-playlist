Hong kong, tokyo and singapore
new york, boston and baltimore
they'll take you right down where you don't want to go
if you talk too fast and you walk too slow
shanghaid, shanghaid
been locked up and shanghaid
shanghaid, shanghaid
been locked up and shanghaid
i tried to live by the golden rule
do unto others and they'll do unto you
every time i get turned on i end up singing the same song
shanghaid, shanghaid
been locked up and shanghaid
