Find a piece of land,
A million demands
And try make
It once again, a piece of land
To make it a plan,
Always trying to be one with the making
Waiting for a statement, how will I know
It wasn't my engagement, the scars just grows
Such a slave and a sucker for observation
Just let it pass, no questions asked
Decide and try to find, a step behind
A shape that will assure you how
The essence is defined, it takes no disguise
Don't wanna see yourself in no trouble
It comes to end, with my trust in hand
...
