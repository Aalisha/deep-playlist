Oh sweet lungs don't fail me now
Your burning has turned into fear
Drills me in my every step, i'm moving quick but you're always on my heals

Just one more breath, i beg you please
Just one more step, my knees are weak
My heart is sturdy but it needs you to survive
My heart is sturdy but it needs you

Breathe, don't you want to breathe
I know that you are strong enough to handle what i need
My capillaries scream, there's nothing left to feed on
My body needs a reason to cross that line
Will you carry me there one more time?
