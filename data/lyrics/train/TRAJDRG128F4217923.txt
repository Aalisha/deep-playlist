When a man gets trouble in his mind
He wanna sleep all the time
When a man gets trouble in mind
He wanna sleep all the time
He knows, he can't sleep all the time
He's trouble won't worry mind, won't worry his mind

I'm feelin' worried in mind
And I'm tryin-a keep from cryin'
I'm feelin' worried in mind
And I'm tryin-a keep from cryin'
