Mmm... hmm... hmm... hmm...
This one's for fellas

A million ways to please a woman (Yeah)
A million ways to please a woman (A million ways, a
million ways)
A million ways to please a woman (Hear me now)
A million ways to (Ooh) please a woman

A million ways to please a woman
And when she's down, she needs a hug
That's the time to show her love
Or maybe just a foot rub

A million ways to please a woman
Don't talk a lot, listen instead
You wanna know, get in her head
'Cause makin' love just ain't in the bed, somebody say

Give her candy hearts and Hallmark cards
If that's what she likes
If you didn't know before
Then let this be your lesson of life (Million ways)
