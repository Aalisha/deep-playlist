I felt alive
Take me from the city
Stand up this is a fucking ovation
Stand up, stand up
All together we scream

I thought this was all a part of the plan in the end we walk out
Walk out, walk out,
Walk with me talk with me
I'll take you away from this place
As legends go we are at the end
Here's a column of my own so let's begin, begin
Walk with me talk with me
This place we cannot erase

Forget what they said
You will love me the same way
Let's break the cycle
