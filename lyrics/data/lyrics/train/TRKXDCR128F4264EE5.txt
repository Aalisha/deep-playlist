I'm undecided about you again
Mightn't be right that you're not here
It's double-sided, cause I ruined it all
- But also saved myself, by never believing you, Dear

Everything good, I deem too good to be true
Everything else is just a bore
Everything I have to look forward to
Has a pretty painful and very imposing before

O' Sailor, why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then letting it go by the boards

O' Sailor, why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
