Oi listen, u ring me often nightly at precisely nine nigga never off
u were one time like 10 o clock, but thats life b, and u are my wifey
you look right wit ur head to side blue jeans nice shoes and a yellow top
like tunes from bashment to mel o rock, youre a real chick, dats y i move to u real quick
dis is da real shit. (ugh) (yea) imma settle wit a real chick,
n e time u call ill be there quicker then dorothys heels click
look coz u made me feel shit ive never felt in ma life,
if ever i'd see my life i'd wish u'd ever be my wife coz girl watever u'd be i like.
and i mean everything, i plan to give u many rings, look nd i dnt mean phonecalls i mean any bling
anything u want i try to make it possible, coz i've got fame and fab but without u its like ive lost it all,
ur sexy jamaican routes make u cook dat hot, and not just only dat coz ur south american side brings out ur back half
