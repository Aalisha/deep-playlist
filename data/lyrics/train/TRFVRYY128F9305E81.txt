(Kix Brooks/Don Cook)

I lost her trail on a Friday night
She was gone before I got home
She'd been getting restless
In that big house all alone
I've been up and down these city streets
For three nights in a row
And lord it's hard to find that girl
When she gets the urge to go

It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Askin' bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon
