On the far side of the day
Just before it ends
I’ll show you where the mark is
Like I lost you in the last
I’ll see you in the next
I’ll fumble in the darkness

On the far side of today
Just before it ends
I’ll show where the mark is
Like I lost you in the last
I’ll meet you in the next
I’ll love you til the last breath

Love as a theory
Every single day
...
