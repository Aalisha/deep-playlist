Sittin' at a poker table holdin' kings and threes
So far lady luck, hmm, sure has been good to me
I should quit while I'm ahead, but I'll hang around instead
And the dealer asked: What would you settle for?
And I said: Just a little more.

I need just a little more
A little more than I've got
And I've got all that I can spend and I can't spend it fast enough
But if the truth be known, I can't quit on my own
And I spent all my life waitin' for just a little more.
