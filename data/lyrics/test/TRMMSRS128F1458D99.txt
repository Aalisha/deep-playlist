Besieged in the battlements of Babylon,
still looking for a hat-peg you can hang your head upon -
now you've found a place you think is Avalon:
you can talk to anyone here.
You can throw your arms around your nearest neighbour
and the smiling ones'll tell you that you've saved her,
that she's saved you...
They offer the golden promises,
the instantly divine;
you swallow the golden promises
hook, sinker and line.
