So we're all the letters
In a mystical tale
While the hours of my kingdom
Do rapidly fade
Deep clouds bear thunder
Like a dark poem's rhyme
And now is the dawn of all times

Concealed behind old castle walls
Will the grim one return, will Ithiria fall?
"Bring me the seer, may true words he speak"
As nightfall has murdered
the last rays of light
Oh god, don't let my heart be weak tonight

Now as morning nears
Farewell they fear
There is sadness in her eyes
Out on misty ground, as all gathered 'round
And their banners reach the sky

I hope you don't fear
Neither do I
Bring me my sword
And kiss me goodbye
This time I hold you
Here in my arms
...
