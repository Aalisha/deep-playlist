Let Me Go, Need To No, Let Me Go

I Know You Love Me But The In And Out Has Got To Stop
One Minute You're Here The You're Not
You Got Me Feeling So Confused, So Misled
You Say Its All In My Head I Say Its Us Instead

So Wot You Gonna Do, (About It Boy)
Wot U Gonna Do
(R U Gonna Hold On Or Let Us Be Destroyed)
Let Me Go If Not Not Then Stay With Me
If Not Let It Be (Let Me Know)
