No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving

But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows

Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there

But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
...
