(ad libs for first 10 seconds)

(Chorus: Tony Yayo)
Man I, get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go?
Take two pulls, and then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

(Tony Yayo)
It's the up North title taker, rollin lah
in that Riker's Island bible paper, high as a skyscraper
I'm fresh out of jail smokin pounds of haze
Duckin my P.O., cause I'm high for days
Hydro, weed-o got my mind in the zone
Don't f**k up my high bitch, leave me alone
Let it spread to the head, two pulls and pass
Stop steamin on the weed girl, make it last
I'm so high, Banks so high
Buck so high, Dre so high
We be gettin high smokin chocolate tye
That's why I got the cotton mouth and my throat is dry
