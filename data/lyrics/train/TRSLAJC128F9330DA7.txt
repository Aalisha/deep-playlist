I love Corinna, tell the world I do
I love Corinna, tell the world I do
I pray at night she'd like to love me too

Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
Corinna, Corinna
I love you so

Oh little darling, where you've been so long?
Oh little darling, where you've been so long?
I ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
...
