(bobby whiteside/kim tribble)

Got in this morning at 4 a.m.
You're as mad as you can be
Well I was drinking and talking and you know how that goes
Time just slipped away from me
By the time I knew what time it was
It was too late to call home
Stop carrying on acting like a child
I wasn't doing anything wrong

Guys do it all the time
And you expect us to understand
When the shoe's on the other foot
You know that's when it hits the fan
Get over it, honey, life's a two way street
Or you won't be a man of mine
