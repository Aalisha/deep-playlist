Come back, come back, come back
And I will show you a world of light
Come back, come back, come back
And we'll stay up talking all night
Come back, come back, come back
And we'll bathe in the sunlight
Come back, come back, come back
And wrap your arms and hold me tight
But I'll wait for you to come home to me
And if you're late, I'll wait until you're
ready
And I'm struggling 'cause I miss you
terribly
...
