I'm still waiting for the news dad
That she's gone and never coming back
I can't go on because the strength I had is gone
And I find it hard to get out of bed

Oh yeah, don't you know it's true son
You could never know someone
Even though we sleep together we're alone
And I find it hard to get out of bed

And we operate but
I still feel alone
...
