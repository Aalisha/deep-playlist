Gonna stand on a mountain and shout out loud
Gonna open your heart and sing
And you're not going back to the sheltered wing
Gonna push and you'll shove â€˜til you cross the line
Gonna enter the race and win
And you're not going back to the past you hide
Is there anything I can do for you?
Is there nothing that you put me through?
You're running away and you don't know where you're running to
You're running away
You're running away from somebody else
I can't see where you're running to
Oh, runaway
