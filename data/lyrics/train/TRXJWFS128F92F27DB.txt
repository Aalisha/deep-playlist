Deep within your heart, you know it's plain to see
Like Adam was to Eve, you were made for me
They say the poisoned vine breeds a finer wine
Our love is easy

If you ask me plainly I would glady say
I'd like to have you round just for them rainy days
I like the touch of your hand, the way you make no demands
Our love is easy

Our love is easy
Like water rushing over stone
Oh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known
...
