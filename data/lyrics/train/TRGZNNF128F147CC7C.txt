Don't go looking for snakes
You might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun
You might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?

Oh
Watch the puppets dancing
Yeah
See the clowns fall down
Hey
Tie your tap shoes tightly
Yeah
Wear them into town

See you crawling
See you crawling

Don't go looking for snakes
You might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun
You might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
