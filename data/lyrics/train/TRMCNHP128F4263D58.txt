Virtue, representing
[Incomprehensible] gospel, yeah, 2001
Come on, yeah
First verse

I don't wanna sit and think
About all the things that weigh me down
Not when I know God has been good
Times when no one else understood

Since I put it in the Masters hands
Now I can live again
I don't know why He loves me so
But there's one thing I know

When I think on the things that He's done for me
Danger ahead, that I could not see
My soul cries, "Hallelujah"
Without Him, where would I be?

He's been good, anybody else feel this way
Can anybody else help me say, He's always been so good to me
Well you might as well face the facts, ain't nobody ever had your back
Not like that, He's been so good to me

I'm sure you know
Just what I mean when I say
God has been good
