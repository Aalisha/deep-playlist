I slowly started chipping away at this block of stone
In an attempt to fashion a way to regain your attention.
Why won't you hear me out?
I started out with some paper and pen and my apologies.
But every time I try to write to you,
I just can never find the words to explain.

So I'll build a monument to honor you,
Out of the ruins of the love I knew.
I'll turn your favorite memories into a sight for all to see,
Because I know when you see it, you'll come back to me.

Picked me up the phone and I started to dial your line from memory.
Too proud to ever let you pickup.
