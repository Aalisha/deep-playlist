Music, there are so many things we can do
You can taste, you can touch, you can make moves
Just use your imagination, you are creation, yeah

There are so many things that we can do
Use your imagination
You can taste, you can touch, you can make moves
Use your imagination, use your imagination

Close your eyes, let your expectations fade
I? m your favorite memory, remember me
Never again that you felt this way, lets improvise
If you know how baby, I can be your everything

If you can? t recall
I can show you who you are
I see who you are

I see you, I see your empire
I see you so much higher
It? s time to grow baby
Use your imagination

There are so many things that we can do
