(dokken)

Sun shine on me
You were my sunflower, yeah
Been a long cold winter
Summer's come and gone
Your words were so bitter
My resurrection's just begun
Dead of winter
No pain only borrowed
You drink from my soul
You'll taste bitter sorrow

They say the sun won't shine
Where I'm going
It's too late to change my mind
