Cried so loud the song today
The devil knows I couldn't get far
Went to the beach but I couldn't find the path
Tried to catch a train but it wasn't where I went
Wanted to catch a plane but it wasn't where I flew
All the time I flew [Incomprehensible] tryin' to get back to you

I love your way
I love your way

Wished I had the heart to presume
Or take it out-side
Take it out-side just to catch a little rain
