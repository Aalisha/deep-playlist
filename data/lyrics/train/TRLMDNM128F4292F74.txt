She plays her cards close to the vest
To hide the heart she wears on her sleeve
Sometimes she's caught between the woman that she is
And the one she's expected to be

With an innocent smile and the soul of a child
She's always giving more than she can
When a woman loves a man when a woman loves a man
...
