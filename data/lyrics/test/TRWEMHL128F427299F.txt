Mercy speaks by Jesus' blood
Hear and sing, ye sons of God
Justice satisfied indeed
Christ has full atonement made

Jesus' blood speaks loud and sweet
Here all deity can meet
And without a jarring voice
Welcome Zion to rejoice
Welcome Zion to rejoice

All her debt's been cast on Me
She must and shall go
All her debt's been cast on Me
...
