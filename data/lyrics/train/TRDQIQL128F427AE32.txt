I GAVE IT UP (WHEN I FELL IN LOVE)
Luther Vandross and Marcus Miller

My friends told me all about it
They said I had to see for myself
But I never really cared much about love
I thought I could live without it
Until I met this one girl
And she was so fine
I knew she was the one who could change my mind

Chorus:
See, I used to be such a bad bad boy
And good times were my toy for joy
