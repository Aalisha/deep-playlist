I cracked the code
And I knew what it's all about
We found the loft on Greene Street
Swept that bad boy out
Alsatian wine — playing records way past four
Making some crazy soulful love
on the hard wood floor
(Where did our love go?)

You hung the picture
Of young Dizzy on the wall
According to me
That was the best day of them all
Sweet sweet words like honey from the tongue
Yes there was magic then
in every song we sung

Hey — don't let ‘em kid you
Stay cool it'll be all right
Don't trade today for tomorrow
