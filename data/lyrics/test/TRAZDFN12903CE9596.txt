I have a demon in me
It shows its teeth and escapes
When I am patient with speak
is when I make my mistakes
It seems I'm prone to abuse
Im just like you (I'm just like you)
I keep my mouth shut around
The fools and liars of this town
They're starting fires with their lips,
They'll burn it all to the ground
You know if you want the truth
You'll just end up getting burned too

Will the water wash me clean?
(Will the water wash me clean?)
You can take it all out on me
You can take it all out on me
