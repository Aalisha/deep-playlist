Take a minute just to breathe
Take a minute till I'm wide awake
I am searching once again
And the sun has left the sky
And you're on my mind, you're on my mind

Take a second to believe
Just a second, you won't have to wait
Don't you turn your back on me
I couldn't look into your eyes
And I don't know why, and I don't know why
But I'll try again on another day
...
