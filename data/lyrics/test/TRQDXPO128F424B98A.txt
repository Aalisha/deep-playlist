You sigh, the song begins, you speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies and rush to nestle in your eyes

Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms
When we walk hand-in-hand, the world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows, when there is no rain?
