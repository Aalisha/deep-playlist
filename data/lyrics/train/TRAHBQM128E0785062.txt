We come Fe make the people dem just rock up
Now we come Fe mash it in a different style
Yer you know we come kill the tune just like a ninja
Busting up the place and turn the people dem wild
This is the sound of the band call Skindred
Calling every nation Fe jump as one
Come together in the pit and turn crazy
Then we grab the dollars from promoters and we run,
Co Lord have mercy me say

Now we come in ah de place and we tear things up
We rock out the stage and the whole place choke
Promoter and his idrin dem ah tan up and ah look
Everything in addy place get mash up and broke
This is what the people dem ah want and we ah cook
The DJ starts to rock and the tune get stuck
The music hits the crowd like a ten-ton truck
Everybody in the place they lift their hands and shout

This is what we want,
we want the vibes just sweet and we don't want no negative
This is what we want,
crowd of people in the place lick a shot be co you know!

Rocking in the yard we nor go drop
