To this world I am unimportant
Just because I have nothing to give
So you call this your free country
Tell me why it costs so much to live
Tell me why

This world can turn me down
But I won't turn away, oh no
I won't turn around

All my work and endless measures
Never seen to get me very far
Walk a mile just to move an inch now
Even though I'm trying so damn hard
I'm trying so hard

This world can turn me down
