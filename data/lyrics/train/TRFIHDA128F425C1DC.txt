Now it´s time dance and time to pray
Move close to me and here what I say
It´s torture time my little child
So follow me into the night

Let me drag you down
Let me kiss your neck
Please don´t be afraid I´ll show
Things you won´t forget

Now it´s too late
I bite I suck I empty you
There´s no escape
You have to follow me into

Into the empire of the vampire
Where dreams turn into fright
Into a land called transsylvania
Where life begins at night

A flood of blood is rushing over
The dead are on their way to nowhere
You try to hide you try to run
But this nightmare now has just begun

Morella´s Sleep

Look she moves her arm
Like morella like morella
Look she moves her fingers
Like morella like morella
Like she had morella´s hand

Look how she sighs in her sleep
Like morella like morella
Look how it heaves her body
Like morella like morella
Like she sleeps morella´s sleep

And the moon...
