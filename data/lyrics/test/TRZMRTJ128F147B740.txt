I was in a real bad way
When you turned the power on
And you made me feel for all the world
Like I was the king of all the world

I was on a window ledge
When you came upon me there
Everything was upside for the moment
Right around the time I had to get going

Can't count me out
Cause I've got your number
You make me feel like I'm
The king of all of the world
