Well, it's the same rhythm
That's played in Memphis
The face shows no pain
But the beat is the same in New York

And speed is just a bird in the night
It carries sorrow as it flies no fixed flight
It's heard out there

You say, your name is the same
But you're just not able to live white
You can't believe what is real
Because what's real for you may not be right

And the alleys, and streets stay the same
And you think you know what's to blame
Just ain't right
...
