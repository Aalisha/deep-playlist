[Chorus x2]
We posted up! We posted up from the front to the back
We posted up! We posted up blowing blunts by the packs
We posted up! We posted up with a trunk full of gats
We posted up! We posted up nigga you know where we at

[T-Rock]
I keep my money stash in the cellar
My life is crucial more suspense than a Stephen King seller
Beretta for chedda the bravest rebel living clever
I'll suffer you fellas go get the bullets off the dresser
Never snitch under investigation
Loud mouths can suffocate with no resuscitation
I'm in a Caprice with my player partners smoking mean and drinking Vodka
This is the continuation of the saga running like lava
Gunning and robbers I'm blunted with mobsters
Packing choppers so sophisticated still a shortstopper
Constantly a dope clocker to presidentials
Bitches run up get their vital organs this the symbol
Even my mental is a rebel longer level more psychotic than the devil himself
Resting with death until no vessels is left
Betraying ruthless get 'em bat 'em toothless
