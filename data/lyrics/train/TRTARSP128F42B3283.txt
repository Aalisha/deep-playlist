Pack up all your things
We're gonna be leavin'
Sooner than I thought
Take the things you bought
Clouds are gathering

Say goodbye to all your friends
We're gonna be sorry
For a while that's how it goes
But then again, who knows
About the rain

I'm steppin' out
I'm moving on
I'm gonna see the world
Like a rolling stone
