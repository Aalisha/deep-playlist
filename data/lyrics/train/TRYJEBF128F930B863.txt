Breaking up the line, breaking up in time, you
Get your hands off, I am ready to prove
Breaking down the walls, breaking down to break through
I'm rolling up and down, gonna roll over you

You should care about the reason why
You should leave because it's going wild
You should wonder how I can survive
Take your aim, I'm not afraid to die

I don't feel anything at all, why don't you kill me?
I don't feel anything at all, why don't you kill me?
Kill me
Kill me
