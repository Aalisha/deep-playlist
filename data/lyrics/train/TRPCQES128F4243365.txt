Give me some antiseptic
To take this headache away
Give me a syringe
To inject the pain
Give me something pretty
I hope I'll never be
I'd rather be creepy and very strange

Give me a cake
That I can mix and bake
In a betty crocker oven
That I will BREAK!

Bake it up and we will
STAB! STAB! STAB!
Come on, don't be afraid
We will make you
STAB! STAB! STAB!
My world is evil
