When the road seems too long
And I know where I belong
On the south road
When grief seems to set in

It's the love that I find
But I just don't have the time
It's a wish to be near you
It's being there

Ohh when I want to be there
For ya baby yeah yeah
Be there for you 
All for you

I think of you
When I know
It's gettin' harder and harder 
...
