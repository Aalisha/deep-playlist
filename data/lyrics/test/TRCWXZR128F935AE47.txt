Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Gonna find somebody twice as cute
'Cause you didn't love me anyhow

You ran around with every boy in town
And you never cared if it got me down
You had me worried, always on my guard
But you laughed at me because I tried too hard

Boom, boom
Boom, boom
Gonna get along without you now
