Ohh, Too much of anything can make you sick,
Even the good can be a curse. (curse),
Makes it hard to know which road to go down,
Knowing too much can get you hurt

Is it better is it worse,
Are we sittin in reverse,
Its just like were going backwards,
I know where i want this to go,
Drivin fast but lets go slow,
What i dont wanna do is crash. no

Just know that your not in this thing alone,
Theres always a place in me that you can call home,
Whenever you feel like were growing apart,
Lets just go back back back back back to the start, Ohh

Anything thats worth havin,
Sure enough worth fighting for,
Quittin's out of the question,
When it gets tough gotta fight some more, (Ohh)
We gotta fight fight fight fight fight for this love,
...
