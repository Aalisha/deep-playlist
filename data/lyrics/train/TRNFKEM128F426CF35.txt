One day the train was passin' I caught it crawlin' by
To look this old world over under God's blue sky
My darling stood there weeping as I was looking back
I kissed my baby cryin' in the smoke along the track
Goodbye so long until I come back home you'll be my dream
Goodbye so long there's lots of places that I've never seen
I'll always be a drifter but I'll be driftin' back
To where I left you cryin' in the smoke along the track
