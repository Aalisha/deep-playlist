Why don’t you fool me, feed me, say you need me
Without wicked games
C’mon and hold me, hug me, say you love me
And not my dirty brain

Why don’t you fool me, feed me, say you need me
Without wicked games
C’mon and hold me, hug me, say you love me
And not my dirty brain

I got one Alabama return
That’ll take me far away from you
Cos when you take me in your arms
I turn to slave, I can’t be saved

So I got my cappuccino to go
And I’m heading for the hills again
Cos if we party any more we’ll start a fire
Of pure desire

Closer
Your mind’s flying blind
With your head and your face getting red
And your heart beats closer

You fall on your knees
And the geek at your feet says you’re neat
And the beat gets closer

You die for the thrill
At the kill and your heart’s had its fill
But he still creeps closer

You want it to freeze
...
