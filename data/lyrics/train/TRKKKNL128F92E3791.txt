There's a whole lotta people lookin' down their noses at me
'Cause I didn't come from a wealthy family
There was ten of us livin' in a two room shack
On the banks of the river by the railroad track
We kept chickens in a pen in the back
And everybody said we was po' folks
My daddy was a farmer but all he ever raised was us
Dug a forty foot well, struck thirty six gallons of dust
The Salvation Army give us clothes to wear
A man from the county came to cut our hair
We lived next door to a millionaire
But we wasn't nothin' 'cept po' folks
...
