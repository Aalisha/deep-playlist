Princess Iron Fan's Servants:

奶奶外面有个齐天大圣要借芭蕉宝扇
NAI NAI WAI MIAN YOU GE QI TIAN DA SHENG YAO JIE BA JIAO BAO SHAN
Princess, a monkey called “Equal to Heaven” wants to see you
REPEAT THROUGHOUT

Princess Iron Fan:

八万四千?

How can you be back so soon?
为何泼猴!

You impossible monkey!
再扇三扇 翻转宇宙

I will impel you away again with my fan, churning the universe over and over
REPEAT

芭蕉宝扇,威力无比
BA JIAO BAO SHAN WEI LI WU BI
