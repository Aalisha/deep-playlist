You sit and you stare and you wait and you wonder
You think "Maybe it's me and I'm being a fool."
You start to believe it's a curse that you're under
And you're just a doll for a girl who is cruel
With a pin

So let me out
Or let me in
And tell me how, we can win
'Cause I really wanna know now
Before I begin
To let you go
(To let you go)
So let me know

I'd rather be wandering hungry and homeless
Than here in the warmth of a silent defeat
...
