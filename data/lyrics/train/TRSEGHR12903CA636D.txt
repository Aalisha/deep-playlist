I said it once or twice
I'm not coming down
To show you the way
To live with my hand

Enemy
I know you are killing me from inside
You can laugh, you can laugh but don't waste my time
You pessimistic, you cannibal

Don't believe me
'Cause I'm already dead
Don't believe me
I'll take it to the bitter end
