Ready to go
Ready to go

You're weird, in tears
Too near and too far away
He said, "Saw red"
Went home, stayed in bed all day
Your T-shirts dish dirt
Always love the one you hurt

It's a crack, I'm back, yeah, 
I'm standing on the rooftops shouting out
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back, I'm ready to go
From the rooftops, shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back, yeah, 
I'm standing on the rooftops having it
Baby, I'm ready to go
I'm back, I'm ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
Shout it out

You sleep too deep
One week is another world
