I saw a starfish on the ground
He was half buried in the sand
He was just so out of place, and aah,
we were a long long way from home

I was a long long way from home
And so we talked a little while
Then i shook his hands and I, I was a long long way from home

And everything is wonderful, and everythings alright
So alright, there we were, one less star tonight

Na na na na na na na,
na na na na na na
(repeat)
