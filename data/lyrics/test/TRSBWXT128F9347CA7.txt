Dixie is a scourge and a scar
And a girl in my heart and a state of mind
Jesus is the man with a plan
He's a short haired Mexican friend of mine

This small town crowd should've dragged you down
Can't leave your past behind
Wipers in the rain tap out time
Coming up on a new state line

I wanna be a jailbird
From the prison of my own damn mind
Gonna get me a fast car
Set out and see what I can find

Brick up the well of tears and disappear
Leave myself behind
Gonna be a jailbird
From the prison of my own damn mind
