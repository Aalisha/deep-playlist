Don't do it baby
Don't let the teardrops start
Don't do it baby
Girl please don't break my heart
Don't let us say goodbye
Let's give it one more try
Don't do it baby
Our love is too young too die

Girl just can't understand the reason why
When we had everything that money just can't buy
Why we have to call it quits. Call it a day
Girl I've just got to find a way to make you stay
