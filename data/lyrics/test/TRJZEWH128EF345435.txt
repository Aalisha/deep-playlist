Dismiss the telegram
This is no exhibition
A pile of papers that are bound and tethered
We know the end of man
Will stem from stale tradition
Relaying opinions changing like the weather

And this will never be
And this will never be reversed, an installation
Sending an open invitation

To all the pioneers
Driven by suspicion
The old world is gone
And we keep wishing
For a new frontier to sink our teeth in
And forget what you thought you believed in
