When you're in love
You know you're in love
No matter what you try to do
You might as well resign yourself
To what you're going through
If you're a hard man or if you're a child
It still might get to you
Don't kid yourself you've seen it all before
A million mouths have said that too

I've had my hard times in the past
I've been a husband and a lover too
I've lain alone and cried at night
Over what love made me do
And the loved ones who let me down
And couldn't share my point of view
But this is philomena talking
...
