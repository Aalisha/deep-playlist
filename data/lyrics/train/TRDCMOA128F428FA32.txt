I won't bury you in the basement 
As I've been known to do 
I won't bludgeon your memory 
Leave you crying out for truth 

There's a song we sing together 
The song of me and you 
And I was hoping that we could fix it 
At least just fiddle around with the tune 

But you go right, I go left 
You go forward, I go back 
And we're dancing this waltz alone 
You go up, I go down, lost our grip 
And now we've found ourselves 
...
