I know that she loves me
The way that she touch me
And the way that she carry on
She knows that it turns me on

She knows that I love her
The way that I touch her
And I know that it turns her on
The way that I carry on, yeah

So baby girl, I'm gonna get you undressed
I know you like it when I give you rough sex
Bend over, let me hold you from your neck
Piss me off and let mi get upset

I bet you know what's gonna come next
No fore play, no kiss, no caress
Upon mi shoulder a weh yuh gonna put your legs
We gonna have the best make-up sex

The way that she touch me
The way that she carry on
She know that it turns me on

She knows that I love her
The way that I touch her
...
