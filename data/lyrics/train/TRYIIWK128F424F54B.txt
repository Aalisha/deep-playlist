She flies, I fly, only we fly and know why
And we lay down what we've found
We lay down for you now
Lay it all down!

Sooner or later we will know
Sooner or later we will grow
Sooner or later it will show
Hey, hey! I don't know why I felt so good
Hey, hey! But I always knew I would

You're turning, fearing while concerning,
Dealing with your way down below dawn
You've been way down but it's over own
You're a great learner!
