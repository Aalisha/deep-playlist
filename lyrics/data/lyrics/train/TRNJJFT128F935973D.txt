You left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back and just that day
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did dear, but I do know that you're gone

I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink that is true
I'm hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
