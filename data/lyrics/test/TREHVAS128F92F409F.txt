What's your name you old ball and chain?
You won't roll free tied up this way
It was a good idea when you needed a home
But your best days were spent on your own

Please don't be there the next time that they fall
If anything show up late to let them know
You never would've been there at all
When you're happy with yourself you'll never get much done
