Everybody told me take it slow
But I thought you were the one for me
Times I felt a little unsure
I thought that we could talk it through
Try to mend this love and carry on
You didn't have to break my heart
It could have happened if you wanted to
I was your girl and I fell for you, my love
Why did you have to hurt me?
You won't see the pain inside
Smile when I walk, I let you decide, my love
Why didn't you stop to love me?
Don't go breaking my heart, I fell for you
I can't take it again, no baby
Don't go breaking my heart, it's up to you
Can't move on 'til you say goodbye, oh goodbye
No one showed me how to walk away
I just told myself, I knew it all
