(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)

And ooo, it doesn't matter what you do
And hey, it doesn't matter what you say
'Cause you are invisible to the world
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
And ooo, it doesn't matter what you do
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)

Whatever happened to dreams of old
Where do you start
When there's nowhere to go
Caught in the middle without a choice
You're dying to speak but you have no voice

'Cause you are a creature without a name
(It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter)
And you are a player without a game
