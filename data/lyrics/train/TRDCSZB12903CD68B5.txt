Put me to rest before it spreads.
It's not long until the bugs
Eat through to the castle walls
And besiege my noble heart.
New flags are raised.
Cut off the gangrened limb.
In this case, it begins at the neck.
Save yourself from me.
Save yourself from me.

Please, once and for all.

The impact is dead ahead,
So take the gun and apply the brakes.
I can feel the onset of lust course through my veins.
