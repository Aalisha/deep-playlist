The sun is damning, please let go
Not with the memory, it'll drag you down below
Jump at his dancers out on the ledge
Can't feel the edges, love dragged all her friends

Inside was a melody, she lifted by the wall
Jogged through the memories and traded for the hollow pillow
Innocent Christians no joy for love
No eyes were hoping until love is just without words

Like a river to the ocean
Like a drop of rain, like a weeping willow
Tears falling from her wings
Tears falling from her wings, tears falling from her wings, all these things

Your eyes are smiling, your mouth is crying
Your eyes like poets, you open up every cruel door
...
