There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me
There we were, now here we are
All this confusion, nothing's the same to me

I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is oh so new to me
I can't tell you the way I feel
Because the way I feel is oh so new to me

What I heard is not what I hear
