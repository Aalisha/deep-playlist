When i was 18, you know i fell in love with you
but you were the bitch babe
i guess you'd call it a fatal passion
you try to pull my trigger, always leading my on
makin' up your own rules, i was always the clown
times must change now, you'll see it my way
i just can't take it
what you don't know, i must say
I guess we both had a lot to learn,
uh, huh
you play with fire, you're gonna get burned
don't call me insane, 'cause that's not my game
turn your head, you're dead
from a fatal passion
cross your heart and hope you survive
