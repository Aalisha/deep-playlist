I came from the big bright city, that's where I came from
I've been on the road a long time, been such a long time
'Cos I'm just a natural travelin' man
Living my life the best that I can
I don't want no chains on me
I gotta be free
I gotta be free

Guess that I was born a rover, guess I was
Can't stay in one place too long, not too long
Man in a suitcase, travelin' light
Just like a flower, I'm growin' wild
...
