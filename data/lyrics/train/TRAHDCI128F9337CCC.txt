It seems like our whole life, gets wasted watching others lives
As we sit, watch, and obey, our aspirations fade to gray
Why are we so afraid, to make up our own minds
Each and everyday, KNOW, that this choice is yours

The is choice is yours to make, choose your path

Its in the marketplace on the magazines
Its on your living room on your TV screen
Its the car you drive it's the clothes you wear
...
