I'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby, say my babe, she's so fine,
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby, say my babe, she's so fine,
I love to love my baby, love to love her all the time.

Well I love her, don't you love her, say I love her, do you hear?
I love her, don't you love her, say I love her, do you hear?
Upsets my soul, she whispers sweet words in my ear.

I love the way she walks, I love the way she talks,
She makes me feel so good, just like a young man should,
She never make me cry, that's why, she's my babe, she's my babe.

Nothin' could be better than to see her in a sweater
and a real tight skirt, that don't fit,
Nothin' could be better than to see her in a sweater
...
