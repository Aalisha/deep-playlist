Just this once
Let me tell you you're the sweetest thing
The love in every song I sing
The music in my ears and everything
Happiness writes white
Maybe that isn't true tonight
And things you know you might forget
And other things I haven't told you yet

Close your eyes
Count to ten
Turn around
Back again
Hit the floor
Then once more
...
