[Chorus:]
Bring It On It Culd B Millions
We Gotta Have It, We Gotta Have It
Dnt U Know This Culd B Millions
We Gotta Have It, We Gotta Have It

Six Of Us Crashed In The Bck
Wid Nothing To Lose Not Tonite
We'll Come Bck In A Cadillac
Hotel, To The Motel, To The Holiday Inn
We'll Stay Up All Nite Gambling
Feeling Kinda Lucky Thats The Truth
Breezin Through
