Wherever I go
I take a little piece of you
I collect, I reject
Photos I took of you

Well, times that I passed through
So many faces, so many places
I have got to have a memory

I have never been there
I have never been there
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you

I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you
I have never had you

I can't remember
Give me your reminder
