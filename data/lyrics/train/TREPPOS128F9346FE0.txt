I'm picking up the phone and putting down this pen
To let you know I'm writing you again
But it's not the same, the names have all changed
And my best friend and ex-girlfriend aren't to blame

I did this myself, it's a sick cry for help
But it doesn't mean the situation's clean
Additional stress that will come from the press
The mess I made putting my life on parade
Now the writers can say, "We were right all along
You can't make someone love you with your songs"

And you don't know me but you owe me
A little time to find some piece of mind
...
