Heart is pounding curtain's drawn.
All seats sold out and lights are on.
Cameras flashing to the beat.
Oh yeah!
Hair is teased and makeup's done,
the crowd is getting ready to sing along.
I can feel all eyes on me.
Oh yeah!

So come on, come on, come on and go and get it.
You're on, you're on, you're on this very minute.
