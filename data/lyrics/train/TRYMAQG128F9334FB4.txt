How people tell you lies. I thought you felt the same.
Somehow he thought you'd be there
Help him beat me down, again. It's all I know.
So you want for me, some things we never see.
Left alone to fill time.
So empty all your thoughts now, turn around your hate,
Take a look at me. Hang on security.
It's all been overrated, this life you live, it's not your own.
There no one here to help you.
It's all been unadulterated lies, they'll keep telling you
They'll keep telling you, how I want to...
Raise it on my own, nothing special maybe, nothing special lately
Time to feel it on your own, time you want to take control
So you've told them all, I though you looked the same!
