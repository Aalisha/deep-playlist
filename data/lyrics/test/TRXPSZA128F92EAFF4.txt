He never thought he cared so much about the minute hand
Until he started praying for a second chance
If he could only do it all again
He'd trade the long nights that he spent behind his desk
For all he missed
He tells his wife, "I wish that this moment in this room
Was not me dying but just spending a little time with you"

You only get just one time around
You only get one shot at this
One chance to find out
The one thing that you don't wanna miss
One day when it's all said and done
...
