Hey hey holla holla nigga
What's happening?
I got the biggest boulders right here motherfucker
These motherfucking rocks fat,
Hey, at ten 'o clock I don't wanna see
None of y'all little niggas up on the motherfucking block
Y'all got ta clear this motherfucka off
Curfew nigga, get ta fuck up outta here off my block

1: Bizzy Bone

Who servin' tha fiends
Hundred thousands of green
For the love of money
Cash all around me
Demons can cloud me
While I'm in the county I can die
Flipped up my style-y as we came at the same time
Baby tempted, in the tension
Ouija shit got you demented
Crash the Benz and ending your sentence
Born for criminal defendants
Critical breaking in the ghetto bar thinking
Millenium shit like pestilence war and famine
Animals move animals reputed
Every daily grades let it be the reason
My Cleveland niggas revolve like dead bodies
In Eden leading seeping
And I don't wanna rock the pump
But I doubt it if I have ta pop the trunk
I'ma get 'em when they thinking they miss me what
Nigga that thuggish ruggish fuck them up
Rolling wid my bucks in the biggest snatch shit
All of my dogs all of we lie
Nigga you touched and stuck on murda
Smoking up bud and fucking up blunts
It was the 7th sign regime
Wid the nines and beams the philly and green
Wid a clik tight team and a nigga like me
Ya couldn't go wrong wid we
