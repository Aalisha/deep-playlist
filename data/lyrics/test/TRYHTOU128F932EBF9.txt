You should be wilder
You're no fun at all
Yeah, thanks for the input
Thanks for the call

With dull knives and white hands
The blood of a stone
Cold to the touch, right
Right down the bone

But you give me the electric twist
And it kicks, and it kicks like a pony
And true, you might get away with it
It's a risk, it's a risk, yeah

Picked from a hot grove
Packaged for sale
It drips down the sleeve
Gets under your nails

A loss of the senses
A chip off a tooth
...
