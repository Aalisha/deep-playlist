It plagued me, Like a cancer
If you asked me what it meant,
I couldn't answer...
'Cause I sit here... Alone and searchin'...
Man! I gotta stop complainin'!

(Chorus)
It's been so long,
I don't know what to say to you
The feeling's gone.
I remember once upon a time,
I wouldn't have cared...
Just what I shared with you
But now I'm hiding!
