The mouse is in the house
MEEE-OWWW
The mouse is in the house
MEEE-OWWW
The mouse is in the house

Baby, why you want to do me wrong
Don't you know I got you all done
To my life I want to live long
Lately you haven't been acting like a lady
Know you want to have my baby
You must be goddamn crazy


Kiss me then I'll kiss you back
Love me then I'll love you back
No time, no time
