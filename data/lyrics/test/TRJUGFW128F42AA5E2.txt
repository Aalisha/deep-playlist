Hey little devil that dwells inside
This angel's body, this angel's mind
He said, "All I need is Jesus to fly"

Take a little peak through this head of hair
I know somewhere there are eyes in there
Trying to hide a heart that's shining, so bright

They said, "What makes you different from us?"

We're gonna bang your head down

I've got a dream that's growing inside me
I'm ready to burst and set it free
