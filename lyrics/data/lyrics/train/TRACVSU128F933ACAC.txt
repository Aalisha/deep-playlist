Now when the rumor comes to your town
It grows, it grows, where it started no one knows
Some of your neighbors will invite it right in
Maybe it's a lie, even if it's a sin, they'll repeat the rumor again

Close your eyes, hang down your head
Until a fog blows away, let it blow away
Open up your arms and feel the good
It's a'comin', a brand new day
