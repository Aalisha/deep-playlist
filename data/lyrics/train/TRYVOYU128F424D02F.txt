I realize as I awake
Life's to be taken to a new level
Belief is not the way
Dogma will dispirit your soul

The only road to mastery of life
Is to determine it's extremity
When it shall expire

[Lead: Schalin]

Choosing victim is easy
Enemies are first in line
You are the sworn
Targets for my crime
Expectations are growing fast
Stronger as I plan
