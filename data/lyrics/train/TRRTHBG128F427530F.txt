i pull myself into thinking
remember the times when i was then
i could never ask for more
cause u were there when that was so

then i took a bottle of soap
i drank too much and got too high.
didnt even know when hope was gone
all i am is all alone

singing a simple song all alone
and nowhere to go

where do i go from here
who do i sing this song to
and how do i fall in love
when the only thing i love is gone

where do i go from here
who do i sing this song to
and how do i fall in love
...
