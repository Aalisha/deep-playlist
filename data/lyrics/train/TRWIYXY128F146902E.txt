It was an unbelievable night
She was an unremarkable girl
You may not call it poetry
But it changed my world

It was an unforgettable dawn
She was an indisputable fact
Even if I could have
I might not have it back

It's an unexceptional day
She's an unavoidable truth
Uncompromised elation
Suspended since my youth

It's an unforgivable lie
I have nothing in my defence
There can be no forgiveness
To caution this descent

It wasn't in a dream
A film or on TV
This was really happening
Happening to me
...
