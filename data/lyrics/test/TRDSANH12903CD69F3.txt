When I can't see you
You're always near
Back right pocket
I keep you there
Safely hidden
For all those times
When nothing else at all
Can get me by
Billfold out deep inside
Amongst ID and credit cards
I reach in to pull out
A thousand words of photo art
Wallet-sized, never bent
Or ever torn up in the least
I take good care of you
You mean so much to me
Pictures of you and IThey always make me smile
Even at the worst of moments
They're always what I seek
