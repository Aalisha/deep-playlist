I hate's to see dat ev'nin' sun go down
Hate's to see dat ev'nin' sun go down
Cause ma baby, she done lef' dis town
If I feel tomorrow lak ah feel today
Feel tomorrow lak ah feel today
I'll pack up my trunk, and make ma git away

Saint Louis woman wid her diamon' rings
Pulls dat man 'roun' by her apron strings
'Twern't for powder an' her store-bought hair
De man she love wouldn't gone nowhere, nowhere

Got dem Saint Louis Blues I'm as blue as ah can be
Like a man done throwed that rock down into de sea
Got dem Saint Louis Blues I'm as blue as ah can be
...
