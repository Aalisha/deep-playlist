Well it must have been good
'Cos you said it was love
I guess the day you left me
It wasn't good enough
Now you're calling my number
Say, you wanna come back
Oh baby, baby it's too late for that

'Cos when you see me
There'll be somebody new by my side
Somebody who is sure he is mine

When you see the smile on his face
Just remember baby
Could've been you, could've been you
When he's standing there in your place
I hate to say it baby
Could've been you

Guess I should have been cool
Maybe I was too kind
...
