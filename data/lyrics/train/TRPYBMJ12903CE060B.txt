Shake your head to make your brain free
There`s nothing that i want more
Wake the dead and take them with me
There's nothing that i want more
Breake your back to electric soul yeah
There's nothing that i want more
Tonight's tonight i thought i told ya
There's nothing that i want more

I've got an offer to make to you
come on

From the ocean back to the island
(ba ba baa ba baa baa ba baa ba)
Where electric milk breaks the silence
Why won't you come over here my dear?

Shake your leg to shockin roll yeah
There's nothing that i want more
I like it hot and I like it cold yeah
There's nothing that i want more
Hold your breath and wake your soul yeah
There's nothing that i want more
T-t-tonight's tonight i thougt i told ya
There's nothing that i want more
...
