I Wanna Hear It From You (1985)
I believe there's something you ain't told me
Cause I've heard all the talk that's going round
Lately something's wrong here when you hold me
It's hard to keep a secret in this town

Now I wanna hear it from you if it's over
I wanna hear it from you if it's really true
So tell me the truth, baby, after all that we've been through
If it's gonna be goodbye I wanna hear it from you
