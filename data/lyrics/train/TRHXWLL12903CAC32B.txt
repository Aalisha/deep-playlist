Can you see the air change?
Can you see when a heart breaks?
I know that both do happen
But all I want is faith
Because I can feel this
And so much so I believe it
But still there is a struggle
And all I want is faith
And I believe I'll move the mountains
I think
Or maybe I'll drown in the sea

Keep holding on
All I got is holding on these roses
The thorns keep on digging
But my soul believesâ€¦ please

So here I breathe
