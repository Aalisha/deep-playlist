Does anyone in here get hit with inside fever?
So bad sometimes it's hard to move around.
They'll show you all the things you are not doing
Instead of helping you they'll block ya out
And you're whining you shouldn't waste your money
But the couch fibers kept you inside
Said I'm so sorry I came in late this evening
But all the clocks around the town had died
And all the fruit stores' colors were so bright
With couples smiling, cooking things tonight
And what were all those troubles on my mind?
Oh, I took a walk

(Cough!
Sniff...)
Well, uh, just what I need
Right, the morning light
The room *cough* we all have
No more any (?)
