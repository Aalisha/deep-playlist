View all the colours in your hand
A distinctive red shines trough them all
These rusty nails bear signs of blood
A sinful life will clear it all

You will bear my sin as if you're proud
You'll swear my name and beg me please
A moment to live in, a sequence to heal
You'll find no redemption here

Your heart
