Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?
Now that we found love what are we gonna do with it?

Make daddy shook, make daddy shook
Make daddy shook, make daddy shook
Make daddy shook, shook, shook, shook all over the place

I say, come on, baby, when the music's playin'
I wanna see you dance, dance, dance
Come on, baby!

Say when the music's playin'
I wanna see you dance, get up and dance
Move yeah, I said move, yeaheah
I said come on, baby, let me show you what a, what a man can do

I said music, oh yeaheah
Is there soul into my soul
Rhythm is alright - to the rhythm doop doop doo-doo-day
