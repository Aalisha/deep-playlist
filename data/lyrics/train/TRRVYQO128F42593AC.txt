He said, "I'm sorry I have to cancel the plans we made
I got a weekend business trip bound to LA"
She drives him to the airport

And watches till he boards the plane
Then she hurries to a phone booth
And across town the telephone rings

She's got one for the money
Two for the show
One to pay for the credit cards
And two to rock 'n roll

One gave her the wedding ring
The new car that she drives
But two gives her the feeling she needs
That one's money can't buy

Now she arrives at the honky tonk
Just a little bit late
Parks her Mercedes 'round back
'Cause her name's on the license plate
