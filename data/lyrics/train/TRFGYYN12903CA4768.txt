Time entails the sun to hesitate
Clinging on and off again
Picture all the children as they walk on by
Clean into the front yard

Falling in and out of sync
With him in the ground, I see
Promises I have broken
Shadows creep along the window

The window sill, drowned by the rain
Swallow the pill, it kills the pain

Freeze frame, capture it
...
