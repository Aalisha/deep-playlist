[Joe]
whoahhaoohhH! Yeahheahhaa
Don't wanna beeeee a playahh


[Joe] I don't wanna be a playa no more
[Pun] I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
[Joe] But Big Punisher, still got what you're lookin for
1 - [Pun] For my thugs, for my thugs
2 - [Pun] Uptown baby, uptown
[Joe] Don't wanna be, don't wanna be - I don't wanna be a playa no more
[Pun] I'm not a playa I just crush a lot
[Joe] But you know Big Punisher still down by law
[Joe] Who's down to crush a lot

[Big Punisher]
Hey yo I'm still not a playa but you still a hater
Elevator to the top hah, see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In house beach, french count seats, ten thou piece
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy
Coppin a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico
