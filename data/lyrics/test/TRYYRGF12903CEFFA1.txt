When Ymir lived
A long time ago
Was no sand nor sea
Nor surging waves
Nowhere was there earth
Nor heaven above
Only Ginnungagap
And grass nowhere
The sons of Bur
Then built up the lands
Created the great
Midgard to be

Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came Yggdrasil
Came life
Out of emptiness
Out of Ginnungagap
Came all of what is today
...
