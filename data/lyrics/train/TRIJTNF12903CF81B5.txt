We watch the waters rise,
and let the tides come up to our neck.
With pride taking on the ways
screaming over and over again,
"I never lie, I swear I can swim"
"I never lie" but there I go again.
What have we become?
I feel like we have just begun
Focus I want you at your,
focus I want you at your best
I swear I'll never let go
Focus I want you at your,
focus I want you at your best
Oh we are so smooth.
The way you speak... the way I move
