And to love a god
And to fear a flame
And to burn a crowd that has a name

And to right or wrong
And to weak or strong
It is known, just scream it from the wall

I've willed, I've walked, I've read
I've talked, I know, I know
I've been here before

Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
...
