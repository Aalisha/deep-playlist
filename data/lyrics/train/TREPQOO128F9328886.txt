I wish that I was beautiful for you
I wish that I inspired tiny fireworks inside the way you do
So delicately made
A prayer left unprayed
Before the morning sky fades
Up to blue
And I wish that I was beautiful for you

I wish that somehow I could find a pill
For a quick fix modern tonic that would change me with one swallow I would

kill
Watch folks line up to pay
Stare at me all day
But I'd turn them all away
If that be thy will
