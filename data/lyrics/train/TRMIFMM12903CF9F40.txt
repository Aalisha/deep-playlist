Stand beside, there are no ideas
Can't confide, I run into the fear
Testify, I look into the mirror
What you find, can make you clear
A little bit cryptic
A little bit cryptic
A little bit cryptic
A little bit cryptic
Backwards and forwards, gotta hold of my skin
Reaching, releasing, gotta be a way in
Everyone leading a new scene
Everyone's emotional conflicts (?)
Everyone's flirting and free
spotlight eyes on the endless skies
Everyone's moving at fast speed
Everyone's on the cover of a magazine
Everyone's flirting and free
...
