Tell, tell me it isn't so
You say you have your reasons for leaving
You have to go
I watch you turn, turn and walk away
I'm searching for the right words to say
Hoping and praying you'd stay

Chorus: So I'll kiss your love goodbye
I guess it wasn't meant to be
I gave my all, you've tried
And now I see
The love caught my eye, I went blind
And now it makes me cry
The only thing I can do is kiss your love goodbye
