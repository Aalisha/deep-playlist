And if I never spoke a word again, but this I need to say. I criticized and 
 analyzed you - that's worthless from today on, cause I changed my 
 attitude, forgive me father - I was rude! Man I think I made you feel 
 no good - the victim of my moods! I was such a teenage-little brat, no 
 appreciation for what you did... that's how it seemed to you, but I just 
 needed you to take me in your arms - keep me warm! 
 Forever - you'll be to me, much more than I show you, so much more than you see. 
 Whenever - we may disagree, it's like 
 losing a part that once belonged to me.
