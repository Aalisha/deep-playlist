Her eyes would make an angel smile
They'd call her Sunday
She'll take a man and drive him wild
Her name is Sunday
And one day I'm gonna make her mine
It's gonna be so fine
You wait and see (ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
It's gonna be (ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo)
Just Sunday and me

There's not a star that shines as bright
...
