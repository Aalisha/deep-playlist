Sit back and relax
Sit back and relax, you're watching television in superb stereo
Well it's an interview but it's a second take
There's a questioner but your mind's at stake
It's a room designed for propaganda's sake
He's a rich man now, there's no escape (Sit back)
You can't take it where you're going, you can't take things where you are, you can't take 'em with you
You can't take it where you're going, you can't take things where you are, you can't take 'em with you
Let's break down the formula
Let's switch off the set
Let's break down the formula
Let's switch off the set and be glad we finally met

I could crash my car through your screen
I could take a match to your empire
And teach you how to dream, how to dream (?), how to dream (?), how to dream (?)
