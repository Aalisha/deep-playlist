The love that me and you shared expired
So there will be no renewing our contracts, no, no
And I ain't got nothing since I've been hired
So I can't take you back, oh

And I done gave love and got no commission
(Not even a little)
So give me one reason why I should stay here
(Why I should stay)
I thought compared to all the other guys you were different
But I cried the same old tears
And baby, baby I can't take it, I can't do it, no

This is my two week notice
I resign my position 'cause you ain't treating me right
And I've been working on the job just busting my ass
Pleasing you everyday and night
I get no raises or no benefits to stay with this establishment
I'm gone, this is my two week notice
 (I don't want you back, I don't want you back)
