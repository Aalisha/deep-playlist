There I was I was hanging around
Two Fingers down one to go
Then suddenly from below she emerges
Sultry swingin' from a rope
"You've got something I need so just give me your hand"
Trust is something that I just got to give into
My Black widow or friend?
Well? In the blink of an eye systems deploy
And we are off baby off on the run
Bullets raining on down
