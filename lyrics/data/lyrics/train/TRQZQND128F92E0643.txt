I've gotta big big big heart beat, yeah!
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways?
With good friendly homes

You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
I've never met a girl that
Likes to drink with horses
Knows her Chinese ballet
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains
When you show my purple gaze a thing or two at night.

It'd make me sick sick sick to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
But I'll do that on Mondays
I don't have to work away
I like it when I bump you
An accident's a truth gate
I'm humbled in your pretty lens
I'll hold you don't you go

Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet,
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know

Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
