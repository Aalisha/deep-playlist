When you are sleeping do you dream of me
how strange, how strange
'cause you know what they say
about the visions in your head and what they mean
how strange, how strange
that you should feel that way
I'm not living in an ordinary world
'cause i'm not your ordinary good girl
and i don't believe in playing like i know that game
you're not heading for an ordinary love
'cause i'm not the one that you should think of
and i'm not a prize that you can claim
You know i think it's strange
just a little bit deranged
that you think i'm gonna change to make you happy
if you can tell me why
i should wait around then i
may be coming down
but until then this means
you can see me in your dreams
When you are sleeping do you
when you are sleeping do you
when you are sleeping do you dream
how strange
I'm more than happy in my candlelight
how strange, how strange
that you should come to my dominion
in the middle of the darkest night
how strange, how strange
that you should even try
I'm not living in an ordinary world
'cause i'm not your ordinary good girl
