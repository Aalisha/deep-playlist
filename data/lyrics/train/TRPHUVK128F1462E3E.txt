I'll show you things that you never seen
And I know places you've never been
To where the grass isn't green
Cause I, yeah, I should know
I should know
I should know

I'll show you things that you never seen
And I know places you've never been
To where the grass isn't green
Cause I, yeah, I should know

Playing away from home is fun
This food is cooked but it isn't done
Boy the best is to come
Cos I, yeah, I should know

It's always me that gets the blame
Second single sounds the same
Loneliness is a pain
Cause I, yeah, I should know
