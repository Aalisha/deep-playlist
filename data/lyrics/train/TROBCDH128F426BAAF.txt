If you leave me now You'll take away the biggest part of me.
Oooh I know baby please don't go.
And if you leave me now you'll take away the very heart of me
Oooh I no baby please don't go.
Oooh now boy I just want u to stay...

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come to far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way...

When tomorrow comes we'll both regret the things we said today
