She don't mind how I dress
Or how much I work, how much I rest
She don't mind how much I sleep
Never asks why I spend the night awake

She don't ask for reasons why
I sometimes tell her lies
She makes no plans for my days
She don't try in any way to trick me

She cries just like a baby
She cries just like a baby
