Well, don't you shut that door
Don't you leave so soon
You wanna know where I've been
Well, I'll tell you the truth
I've seen it all before
None of this is new to me

You said that things had changed
And everything was alright
You would wish I was cool
And I'd wish you were nice
Behind your innocent face
Filled with guilty delights for me
Filled with guilty delights for me

With such an innocent life
