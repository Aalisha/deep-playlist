My, my said the beggar man
What you give and what you take 
Are two different things 
Eat up what you've got 
Evil winds that drag your bones to rot 
Evil winds that'll set, set me free 

Suicide of the first division 
Found dead with a noose wrapped around your head 
No one cared to raise an eye 
Don't it make you wanna' scream, scream till they cry 
Evil winds that'll set, set me free 
...
