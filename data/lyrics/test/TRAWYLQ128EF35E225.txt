They do it down on camber sands
They do it at Waikiki
Lazing about the beach all day,
At night the crickets creepy
Squinting faces at the sky
A Harold Robbins paperback
Surfers drop their boards and dry
And everybody wants a hat
But behind the Chalet
My holiday's complete
And I feel like William Tell
Maid Marian on her tiptoe feet
Pulling mussels from a shell
Pulling mussels from a shell
Shrinking in the sea so cold
Topless ladies look away
...
