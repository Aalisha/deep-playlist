Steppin' out, with my baby
Steppin' out

You work hard the way I do
Comfort me when I am blue
All these things you do for me
That's why we're steppin' out tonight

Steppin' out
Just you and me baby
Steppin' out
We're Steppin' out

Steppin' out, with my baby
Steppin' out

I adore the things you do
You make me feel special
Tonight there's just me and you
And we're steppin' out tonight

Steppin' out
Just you and me baby
Steppin' out, with my baby
Steppin' out
