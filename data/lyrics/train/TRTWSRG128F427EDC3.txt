It's what I've become that I fear the most
And I never thought it could get so wrong
I believe there's a part of me that I cannot beat
A part of me that I can't defeat
The side of me that just doesn't belong

Judging by the weight of my fucked up world
I think maybe I should take a step back
From this I need to quit pushing, just let it roll

The waves that you made
(Push me, push me)
The things that you say
(Push me, push me)
The waves that you made
(Push me, push me)
So I'll play God now
Blow you, blow you away

Yeah, it's what you've become that I took today
You never thought I could be so strong
You can see there's a part of me that you cannot beat
And part of you will always remember me
When you look around and you are so alone
