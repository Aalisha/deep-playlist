Baby Girl
Oh nah nah
Zagga zagga zagga zaaah
Ooo Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Are you ready for this? yeah

Wheneva I got no money (wha)
She is still my honey (wha)
And there is a reason to be funny
Cuz, I, I, I said
I don't care what you say
But you can say girl

Keep on sayin your thing, yeah
And I don't care what you do
But you can do girl
Keep on doin your thing, yeah
And I don't care what you shake
But you can shake girl
You have my head a spin, yeah
And I don't care what you kiss
But you can kiss girl
You have this brotha a sing that
People keep on tellin me that
you are here to stay
Brother keep on tellin them that you will go away
Cuz, wha, two wrongs can't make no right, naw
Ain't nothin wrong with a good old fight

It's alright
If you feel it boy (Feel it, feel it)
