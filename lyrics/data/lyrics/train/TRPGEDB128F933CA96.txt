What did you learn today?
I learned nothin'
What did you do today?
I did nothin'
What did you learn at school?
I didn't go
Why didn't you go to school?
I don't know

It's cool to know nothin'
It's cool to know nothin'

Television's on the blink
There's nothin' on it
I really wanna really big coat
With words on it
What do you want for tea?
I want crisps
Why didn't you join the team?
I just didn't

It's cool to know nothin'
It's cool to know nothin'

Take a look, take a look, take a look at the
Kids on the street
