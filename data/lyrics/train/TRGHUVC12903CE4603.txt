Guerilla Soldier born in Santo Domingo
U.S. Marine down from his home up in Maine
Big Red Machine rolls in patrolling the jungle
All of them baking under tropical rain
Six long months in a foreign wasteland
Scenes of terror so fresh and ripe
Found a place to come face to face
Like the gutter-snipes
Whether you like it or not
There ain't no end in sight
...
