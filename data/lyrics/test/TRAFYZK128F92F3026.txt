Screams in the night woke the whole village up
Their cattle is getting attacked
The fences are broken and blood everywhere
Horses are lying there slack

Fenrir divided, a horde of greywolves
His power inside of them all
Feasting on the guts of both stallions and goats
No animal in there stands tall

The people were struck by terror and fear
While beasts intruded thei ground
Like the flow of a storm that none can control
Cascades of blood in the pound
...
