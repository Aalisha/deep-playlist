Lady have you known me-
The perfect love machine,
I'm Virgo, My Leo's rising
Venus made me King
That trail of broken hearts
They all belong to me
Magic runs through my fingers-
One touch you'll see

L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine, oh
L.O.V.E. All I need's my love machine tonight
