I can see that you've been crying
You cant hide it with a lie
Whats the use in you denying
That what you have is wrong

I heard him promise you forever
But forevers come and gone
Baby, he would say whatever
It takes to keep you blind
To the truth between the lies

Oh, I will love you more than that
I won't say the words then take them back
Dont give loneliness a chance
Baby listen to me when I say
I will love you more than that
