Golden dreams, sick sick sick
Infatuation, blood red lips
Whips and chains, nice round hips
I show no mercy, bet you love the tits
Hypnotized, got no clue
You wanna love me black and blue

I am the one you want (you want me)
I am the one you crave (you crave me)
I'm the one you need (you need me)
And you will be my slave (crave)
