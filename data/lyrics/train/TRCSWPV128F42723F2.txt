Do you remember the great train robbery?
How it all happened, back in '63
When Johnny Rainbow took his band of brave men
Went down to the crossing to meet that train

Bound to steal, steal it all and run
Johnny wanted to keep it peaceful
But Wilson cried and though it might have died
You know they had to turn and run

The life of a thief
