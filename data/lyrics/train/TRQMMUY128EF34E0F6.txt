I see the faces on my picture one is you
I see the reasons why the picture just ain't true

I'm going home
I'm gonna be there one of these mornings
Gonna break away on the thirteenth of july
I'm going home

Going home

The dust collector keeps on banging at my door
Tales of the wild west, I can't mean it anymore
