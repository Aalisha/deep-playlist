Yes I like it
But I don't need it
Cause' I like it
Don't mean I need it

Yes I like it
But I don't need it
Cause' I like it
Don't mean I need it

I like the way you move
I like the way you talk
You have such a sweet way
I like to spend my days
With you always the same
Such sweet consistency
But it's cool don't mess with it
Leave it this the way it is

Baby with you it's quite alright
So much better than its been with the other guys
But I don't need a label just leave it alone
Don't wanna tie you down your free to go

Baby with you it's quite alright
So much better than its been with the other guys
But I don't need a label just leave it alone
Don't wanna tie you down your free to go

Yes I like it
But I don't need it (I don't wana be your girlfriend)
Cause' I like it
Don't mean I need it (I don't wana be your girlfriend)

Yes I like it
