Don't you ever let me go
Don't you ever let it show
I will cry in the Sea Of Love
The stars will always shine
And I'm gonna make you mine, tonight
Tonight (repeat x2)

I belive in rainy weather, some days (haaaah)
But when I'm down and feeling blue,
you come and say:
Have you ever really seen the rainbow
Have you ever really touched the blue blue sky
Have you ever really seen a falling star
Here me cry tonight

(ref:)
Don't you never let me go
Don't you ever let it show
I will cry in the Sea Of Love
The stars will always shine
And I'm gonna make you mine tonight
