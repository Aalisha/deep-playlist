Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and gray
At night it was the bright of the moon with me
Time just floating

Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a bit of a-tumbling
And time just floated away
We watch it and stay and we can listen

Oh rainy day, come 'round
