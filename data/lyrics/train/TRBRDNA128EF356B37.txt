Missed me, missed me, now you've got to kiss me
If you kiss me, mister, I might tell my sister
If I tell her, mister, she might tell my mother
And my mother, mister, she might tell my father
And my father, mister, he won't be too happy and he'll have his lawyer
Come up from the city and arrest you, mister
So I wouldn't miss me if you get me, mister, see?

Missed me, missed, me now you've got to kiss me
If you kiss me, mister, you must think I'm pretty
If you think so, mister, you must want to fuck me
If you fuck me, mister, it must mean you love me
If you love me, mister, you would never leave me
