It was a Saturday
I came home early drunk with love
And other things
I must confess I love it all

Pretend that I can hardly wait
To wipe that smile off of your face

It's only when
On that you can depend
Later that afternoon
My paranoia got the best of me

I knew it would, it always do
I made the call

Pretend that I can hardly wait
To put that smile back on my face
It's coming soon
I'm going to the moon

You pretend, I imitate my friend
...
