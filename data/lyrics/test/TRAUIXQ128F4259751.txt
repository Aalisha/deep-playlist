Well, I know what I'm thinkin'
Is the direct result of drinkin'
In a heavy mix of intimate atmosphere
And I pray what I'm feelin'
Is insecurity revealin'
Lack of happiness
Cause I need a body here
And I would be much safer honey
If I could get this stuff for money

(Chorus)
Cause I'm hooked on love
