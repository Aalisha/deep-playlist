Welfare check one, welfare check two
That's right we gon' give it to 'em
This yo' favorite DJ's DJ, DJ Jelly
And I got me a new member of the Oomp Camp
DJ Unk (DJ Unk hoe!) But I ain't gon' talk no more
DJ Montae, Oomp Camp this shit, niggahhhhhh!

(scratched repeatedly:) "DJ Unk hoe"

(Unk:)
Yo
Yo, yo
