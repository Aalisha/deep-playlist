So I pop the question
Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
Who will be there

We need each other more than we ever did or will
We got to get together
We got to do what Jah Jah will
Or get burnt within the fire, that's not my desire

Who will be there
[Incomprehensible]
Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
