All night, staring at the ceiling
Counting for minutes, I'm feeling
This way, so far away and so alone

But you know it's alright, I came to my senses
Let go of my defenses
There's no way I'm giving up this time

Yeah, you know I'm right here
I'm not losing you this time

And I'm all in, nothing left to hide
I've fallen harder than a landslide
I spent a week away from you last night

And now I'm calling, calling out your name
Even if I lose the game
I'm all in, I'm all in tonight
...
