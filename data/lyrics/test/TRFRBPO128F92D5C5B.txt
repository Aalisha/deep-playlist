I want to be your jacket
Your shelter now
I want to be your laughter
When you're feeling down, down

It's cold out there where you are
You're just getting by, so far
If you just try with me
Maybe in time you'll see
I want to be everything you lost along the way
The song that you used to sing
And your favorite dream
I want to be everything you lost along the way
I want to be everything you lost along the way

I want to be your island
Your rest and peace
