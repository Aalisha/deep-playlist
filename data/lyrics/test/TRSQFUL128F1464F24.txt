It's over, there's nothing more to say
Silent comes the night time, ends another summers day
I can just remember or is this the dream that never goes away
Understand me, I'm calling
Understand me now, can't you hear me call?
Understand me, I'm calling
Understand me now, can't you hear me call?
Night time, surely it's a lie
No-one ever told me, I just let the chance go by
Wishing there was time enough, you tell me there's no time but I can try
Understand me, I'm calling
Understand me now, can't you hear me call?
