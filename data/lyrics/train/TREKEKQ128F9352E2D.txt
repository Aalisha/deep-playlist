Lies, lies, you're telling
Me that you'll be true
Lies, lies, that's all
I ever get from you

Tears, tears, I she'd
A million tears for you
Tears, tears, and now
You're loving someone new

Someday, I'm gonna be happy
But I don't know when just now
Lies, lies, breaking my heart

You think that
You're such a smart girl
And I'll believe what you say
But who do you think you are
