YO KEYSHIA!
YES!! (Whoo!)
Fire. (uh-huh)
I like this one right here
This one for all my ladies y'all
Holla!
Uhhhhhhh-huh
Let's go!

I don't want'cho maaaaan, cause I got it like that
But it ain't even gotta be like dat, eh-heh-heh-heh-heh
Yo' man he be callin me back
He say I'm fine and a matter of fact - heh-heh-heh-heh
He ask how I do that that fit my jeans over Baby Phat
Listen, I don't know the type of tricks he playin
But I should warn you, I don't want yo' man (c'mon)

I understand why you wanna try
To make him stay home late at night
But if he wanna go, he'll be GONE no lie
I can't explain how many times I tried
How many times I cried
Thinkin about mine and where he might be
(Baby, I don't wannaaaaa know)
Remember when I gave everything I've got
Couldn't get deep down inside
How you love someone who didn't love me? (c'mon)
But now I get if he don't wanna
Love you the right way, he ain't gonna
It ain't where he's at it's where he, where he wanna beeeee

If he ain't gonna love you, the way he should
Then let it goooo
