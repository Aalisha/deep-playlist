No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try
You can't stop me now
Yes, my skin is black
But that's no reason to hold me back
Oh think about it, think about it,
Think about it, think about it
Think about it, think about it, think about it.

I have wants and desires just like you
So move on aside cause I'm a-comin' through
Oh no matter how hard you try you can't
