Theres a war comming down between my brothers and I
I don't want no war going down, going down tonight

Stop this war
Stop this war

Civilization ha I call it as I see it
I call this bullshit you know, I still cannot believe it
Our evolution now has gone the way of hate
A world evolved, resolved in this stupid fate

Stop this war
Stop this war

All so different yeah, I say we're all the same
All caught you know, in the division game
