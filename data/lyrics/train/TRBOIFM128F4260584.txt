Can't Stop thinking about the things you do...
Wanting you...

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind

(Coko)
Boy I can't seem to get you out of my head
But theres something about you that makes me smile
Don't change I like the way you make me feel
Can we take our time and do this for awhile... yeah

(Brian Morgan)
Girl, I never thought I would find somone to love me
Now you're the only one I want in my life
And the special touch you give comes from you only
...
