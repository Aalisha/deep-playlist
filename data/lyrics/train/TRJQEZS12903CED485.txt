Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free
Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fullness over me

Underneath me, all around me
Is the current of Thy love
Leading onward, leading homeward
To Thy glorious rest above

Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus
Deeper than the deepest sea
The love that led my Christ to die
Is the love that set me free
