Wooaah yeah
Woah yeah
(Wooh!)
Everythin', everythin', everythin's gonna be alright this mornin'
Ooh yeah, whoaw
(Yeah!)
Now when I was a young boy, at the age of five
My mother said I was, gonna be the greatest man alive
But now I'm a man, way past 21
Want you to believe me baby
I have lots of fun
I'm a man
I spell mmm, aaa child, nnn
That represents man
No B, O child, Y
That mean mannish boy
I'm a man
I'm a full grown man
I'm a man
I'm a natural born lovers man

I'm a man
I'm a rollin' stone
I'm a man
