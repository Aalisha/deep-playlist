(Rebecca Lynn Howard/Kim Williams)
 
 Well I washed my Mustang just last nigt
 Filled the tank full of freedom
 I've been waiting on eighteen, eighteen years
 And now that it's here I'm leaving
 There were tear to cry you know good-bye
 Was the hardest part of the deal
 So long Mom see ya Dad

 I got Tennesse in my windshield
