You can’t trust that sand
You’re sleeping in all the time
You’ll see me on the screen
Through all the other souls that I’ve bought with this oil
Mexico says: good night!

The tape machine is bust
From all that spinning round and round
I’ve scratched all my reels
And bitten all my nails to the bone
Like a stone, you’ll come back when thrown up
Away from the tar
And away from the drills
But kid I’m a pilot
...
