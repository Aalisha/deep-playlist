Jimmy, crack corn, and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn, and I don't care,
Jimmy, crack corn, and I don't care,
My mastas gone away

Rod-a, he ride him and he jumped a ditch,
He ride-a, he rode him, and the pony did pitch
The pony, he felt a little bit shy,
‘Cause he's bitten by that blue-tailed fly

Jimmy, crack corn, and I don't care
Jimmy, crack corn, and I don't care,
Jimmy, crack corn, and I don't care,
My mastas gone away.

When I went down in Louisiana,
I stayed a little while in Texarkana
Every once in a while, I felt a little bit shy
‘Cause I was bitten by that blue-tailed fly
