Kool thing sittin' with a kiddie
Now you know you're sure lookin' pretty
Like a lover not a dancer
Superboy take a chance here
I don't wanna, I don't think so
I don't wanna, I don't think so

Kool thing let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I'll be your slave
Give you a shave
I don't wanna, I don't think so

I don't wanna, I don't think so

Yeah, tell'em about it,
...
