Cut my wings, I'm growing them back today
Tomorrow's not changed, tomorrow's a bribe, tomorrow's not today
So I don't want to feel alive
I don't want to cheat my mind
Everybody trip, everybody slip
Come down, come down

I know our time is fading
And I know you're here to save me
I've been patiently waiting
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
I know we're up and fading
I know there is no escaping
I've been patiently waiting
It's alright, it's alright it's all...
