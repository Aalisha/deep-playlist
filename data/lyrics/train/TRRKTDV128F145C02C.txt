(Stranger, stranger, stranger, stranger)

It's hot here at night, lonely, black and quiet
On a hot summer night
Don't be afraid of the world we made
On a hot summer night

â€˜Cause when a long-legged lovely walks by
Yeah you can see the look in her eye
Then you know that it's

Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight, tonight
