Was it all in real time or was it just in my min?
Was I just a ghost passing through you?
Clinging to the wreckage till I got the message
Hanging at the edge of the room
Give me something that's real
Give me half of your bitterest pill

Something from under the surface
You actually feel
We say these words again and again
But they still sound the same

It was in your eyes, in your eyes
...
