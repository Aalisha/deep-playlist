Here i am
Still roaming through the streets of forbearaent
a gust of innocence has made of me the stoog of life
but i'm still patient, still aware of what we missed
i've found disillusion an ambiton
Here i am
Still listening to the sound of ignorance
my lust for weariness has made of me a fool of life
