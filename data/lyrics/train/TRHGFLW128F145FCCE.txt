I said to me da, I said to me da, I said to me da
I'm not fit for soldier
I said to me da, I said to me da, I said to me da
I'm not fit for soldier
I said to me da, I said to me da, I said to me da
I'm not fit for soldier
I said to me da, I said to me da, I said to me da
I'm not fit for soldier

For the king he say, the king say
For now you fight or I'll take your land away
For the king he say, the king say
For now you fight or I'll take your land away

So over the seas, over the seas
To kill a man that I have never seen
Over the seas...
