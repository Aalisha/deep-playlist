Round, round, wanna go round
Wanna see the rock of ages
When my body gives out
Gonna read the final pages

Oh, my mother is gone
She told me I should meet her
Someday streets of gold
Gonna guide me on to greet her

Once my father sat down
And told me of the prophets
Mathew, Mark, Luke and John
Theyâ€™re gone but not forgotten

Round, round wanna go round
