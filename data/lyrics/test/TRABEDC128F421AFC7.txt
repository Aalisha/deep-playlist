Build a mighty edifice to lean against the sky
Carve your name upon the gate in letters ten feet high
Brick, steel, paint and glass, this one thing will last
This alone survive the wrath of the wind's mighty path
Winds howl, flood will rise, earth will open wide
Smoke and thunder fill the skies, there'll be no place to hide
Time is just a shadow on the surface of the sun
Life is just a place to stand until your time is run
