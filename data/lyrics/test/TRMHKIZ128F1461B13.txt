a stick, a stone
it's the end of the road
it's the rest of the stump
it's a little alone
it's a sliver of glass
it is life, it's the sun
it is night, it is death
it's a trap, it's a gun
the oak when it blooms
a fox in the brush
the knot of the wood
the song of the thrush
the word of the wind
the cliff, a fall
a scratch, a lump
it is nothing at all
it's the wind blowing free
it's the end of a slope
it's a beam, it's a void
it's a hunch, it's a hope

and the riverbank talks
of the waters of march
it's the end of the strain
it's the joy in your heart

the foot, the ground
the flesh and the bone
the beat of the road
...
