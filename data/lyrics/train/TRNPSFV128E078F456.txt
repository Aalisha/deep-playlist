Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused
For being strange
Our love is no other
Than we alone
For me all day
Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused

All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now, lay me down

Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused
For being strange
Our love is no other
Than we alone
...
