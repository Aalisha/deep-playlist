i see you passing by
i dont know where
i dont know why
you chose to go the way
that I shall go
you've been a friend of mine
for many years
for anytime
you just arent you today
so whats on your mind
and you just wont speak about it
think about it
be about it
gotta make yourself aware
that you're gone astray
your trying so hard to fit in

what ya need is something genuine
what ya want is something real
what ya need is something truthful
i know ya do, i know ya do, i know ya do
cuz i need it too
whatcha need whatcha need
whatcha want whatcha want
whatcha need whatcha need
o yea-is something genuine

you cry yourself to sleep
sleep at night
but once the night is gone
and you prepare to face a brand new day
you hide yourself behind your mastermind
your in desguise
