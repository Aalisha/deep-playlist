Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in
Our love is a flame, burning within
Now and then firelight will catch us
Stumblin' in

Wherever you go, whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
I've falling for you, whatever you do
'Cos baby you've shown me so many things that I never knew

Whatever it takes, baby I'll do it for you

Our love is alive, and so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table
Stumblin' in
