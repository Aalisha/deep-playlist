I'll just waaaait
Oh-oh

I'll just wait, wait, wait
I'll just wait, wait, wait

Feel your hear beating fast
Hold me close, make this last
We knew this day would come

Take a breath, breathing in
I'm so scared, of you leaving
Wish we could both just run

Wish we could put it off
But we can't stop time
Seems the clock is running too fast
And now I'm feeling lost
And I can't read your mind
So you don't have to ask

You know I'll wait for you
If it takes a lifetime to do
Yeah, I will wait for you
You're the only thing worth holding onto

No matter how far,
You know I can't live without my heart
I hope you come home soon, soon
