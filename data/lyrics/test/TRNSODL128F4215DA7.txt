Come and dream an S Club feeling
I've got that summertime feeling

Slow down cos you're movin' too fast
Close your eyes and let the day go past
Feelin' the sun and the breeze in your hair
Let the waves take away your cares
I'm feeling good today
I just wanna listen to what the flowers say
See if the cool wind carries my dreams
Not too cold in the sun beams

I've got that summertime feeling
Come and dream an S Club feeling
I've got that summertime feeling
Come and dream an S Club feeling

So I'm takin' a drive today
