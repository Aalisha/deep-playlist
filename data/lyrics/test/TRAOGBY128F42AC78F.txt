Well the sun rises behind you when you walk a westbound road
And the light sometimes reminds you of someone you used to know
She had eyes that used to touch you like no eyes you ever knew
But there's something about a highway changes sunshine into dew

Well the darkness is leaving as the sun comes to the sky
And the dew clings to the barley as the tears come to your eyes
As the night like all your friendships must come to meet their ends
