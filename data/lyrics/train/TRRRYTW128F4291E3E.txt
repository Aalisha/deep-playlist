The kids are right from doing wrong

Check him in, check her out
Check that chick is passin' out
I'm checkin' out
Before I piss my money down the drain

A sacrifice to get salvation
I built it up on aggravation

Why the kids are right from doin' wrong?
Everyone I've seen was better that me
Well, it gets alright from doin' wrong
Everyone I've seen was better than me, yeah
