We await the silent empire
The timeless domain of disinherited ones
We do believe in silence
All that is hidden and hushed serves our quest

The spaceless kingdom of ones that expect
The nameless worshippers of future to come
When the courier's sign glimmers in the dark
We rise our eyes in wait

Our heads - that's where it dwells
Our hearts - that's where it ripens
Our hopes - that's where it reigns
You'd better never antagonize the horn
...
