You want her to try new things
She reminds you she wears your ring
and after a couple drinks she's a little scared of you
A good friend is hard to find
You wish you could spend more time
towing civilian lines, but they're all scared of you

It's not the time that makes it go bad
It's not the thought of what you could've had
It's not the way that her figure has changed
It's just that a soldier gets strange

You know she's a real good girl
She reminds you that every curl
