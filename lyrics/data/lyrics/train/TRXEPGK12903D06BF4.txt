I don't get what people do.
They lie and they cheat and they steal from you.
So I, I made my own world.
I'm not sayin' I'm perfect yet, I've got my share of regrets.
But I, I'm doin' my best.

You make me feel like I've gone halfway around the world.
And you let me know that I'm not such a crazy girl.
All that it takes to make you happy, whatever you need to know
that you make me feel like I've gone halfway around the world.
