I will fuck the system!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!
Sick to death! sick to death! sick to death!
I'm sick to death like I've never been sick before!

I wanna destroy!
When you touch me I wanna cut you
And you suck for more!
I could die for you when you put lipstick on my brain!

DIVING THRU THE NIGHT...
GET CAUGHT UP IN AN ENDLESS FIGHT!
I WANNA BE THE MOVER TO REAL ANARCHY!
