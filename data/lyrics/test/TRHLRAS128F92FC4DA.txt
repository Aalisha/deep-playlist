Visions from beyond
Dance before my eyes
Images of death and power
Filling my mind
Haunting me, seizing me
Compelling me in dreams
Epileptic fits
Triggered in the brain
My body convulses
As they enter our domain
Supernatural, eternal
Watchers in the dark
Spirits dead, enter me
Lead me to my destiny
Dig a grave for the morrow
Voices old, speak through me
Words of blind iniquity
Revelations through seizures
