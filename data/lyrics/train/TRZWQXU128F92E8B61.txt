This moment right here is one we can't suspend
Your breathe and mine tells me just where I have been
You know the song of long lost cause
We're running in circles and coming back again

Now could I go the long way
Taking the easy way down?
If I was wrong would you show me
Where all that I lost can be found?

'Cause you can shoot me straight
Straight to the heart 'cause you already have it
Say what you wanna say, we're coming out of the gray
...
