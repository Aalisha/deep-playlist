Paths illuminated by hells fires
Floating onward to ends demise
Turn to see the once was
turn to see what was
This spirit flails with twisted motion
Another claimed by god's delusions
This spirit flails with twisted motion
Another claimed by god's delusions

With a weary heart
Accepting defeat
Soiled from within
Tainted by existence

Softly speaking with tongues of anguish
...
