Been watching you for a long time
You look so good, got my eyes on you

I've been watching you for so very long
Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong
I really want to meet you but I'm kind of scared
'Cause you're the kind of lady with so much class

I get my thoughts together for the very next day
But when I see you lady, I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk, it really turns me on
Ooh, you really turn me on, come on, come on, come on

Come & talk to me, I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you? I really wanna know you
Come & talk to me, I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you? I really wanna know you
Oh, oh oh oh oh
