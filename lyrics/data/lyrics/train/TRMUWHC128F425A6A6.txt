Baby I'm a knockin'
So you better get your rockin' boots on
You better ask your daddy for the caddy
And we'll motor on
Drive on baby to an all-night diner
Jive on baby we're in Carolina
Baby we're rollin' on
Wonderin' where we're gone
Reelin' and a rockin'
On a rock and roll honeymoon
Rock and roll honeymoon
