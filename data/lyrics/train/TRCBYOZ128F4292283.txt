For this bleeding sunwalk
We laid down besides
And a screaming sky walks
And a trigger by my side...

Drowing karmic networks
Sad machines inside
See the radio sky talks
Under a searing heaven...

Swallow the bitter taste you once craved deep
Swallow your christ, your veil, your sun
Swallow in bitter blood you lay your sleep
...
