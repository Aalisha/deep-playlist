so you think
you can hold the world up by a string
with all that you have
and i would hold every part of you i could... hold
-
and i'm on...
and i'm on again
brace yourself
with all that you have
and oh, i'm in love again
brace yourself
now...
-
so you feel anything and everything could be
all that you wanted
stay with me
i'm in no condition to be
alone
-
