Well, like I said before
Pay up your money and you ask for more
But there's no reason
Yeah, no reason

I can't say goodbye
Tried all too hard and it made you cry
Yet, I've been cheating
Yeah, I've been cheating

Like before you threw me out the door
And I couldn't see behind me
Like before when I asked for more
I couldn't be myself

Still singin' this song
Baby can't you do me wrong
Music is my food and life
Don't take it away

I want the world to see
I don't care when it will be
There's no doubt
I wanna go to the sun, everyone
