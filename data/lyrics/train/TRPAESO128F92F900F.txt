I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the eagles flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry
Don't blame this sleeping satellite
Did we fly to the moon too soon
Did we squander the chance
In the rush of the race
The reason we chase is lost in romance
And still we try
To justify the waste
For a taste of man's greatest adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the eagles flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
