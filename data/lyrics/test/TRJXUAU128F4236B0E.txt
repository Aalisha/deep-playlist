Hey man, just roll me another Christmas blunt.

I was gonna trim the tree, until I got high
I was gonna buy you a DVD, but then I got high
My presents ain't wrapped up, and I know why
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I was gonna hang my lights before I got high
I was supposed to book my grandma's flight, but then I got high
She's sleepin' at LAX, and I know why
'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I was gonna send you a card, but I got high
Put a lighted reindeer in my yard, but I got high
My jack-o-lantern's frozen, its still outside
'Cause I get high
Because I get high
'Cause I get high

I was gonna clean the chimney flue, but then I got high
