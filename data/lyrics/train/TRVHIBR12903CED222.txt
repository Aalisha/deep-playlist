We drank 'till the sunrise
Rode away singin' Johnny's back again
maybe i'm wrong - maybe i've really just been away too
long

There a few who remember
Fewer still who remember why
They ain't still ready to fight but i've had the world
at my feet
And i know it's right

I wanna crawl from the wreckage again
Feel the kiss of twisted metal
Like a drink running hot in my veins
I've got a score to settle

Black leather and glittering Steel
They're calling me back
So i'm turning my head to the wheel
...
