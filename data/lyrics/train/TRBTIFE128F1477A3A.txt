I could never love another (After Loving you) Lyrics

Girl i can't believe my ears
Are you really telling me goodbye
See you're taking away
My reason for living
And you won't even tell me why
Before you walk out the door
There's something i want you to know

That i could never ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will i share
Cause none can compare
After loving you

It was only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
Baby you said
Long as the rivers flow
...
