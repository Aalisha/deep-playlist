I could use a day on my own, make it one, make it two, make it three, by the sea
I would get away from it all, drift into the silent summer
I could use a guide in my life, make it one, make it two, make it three, make it four
We can climb out 'far on a limb' with the eyes of a beginner

I'd rather be where the chicken farmers run
Chasing in the sun, knowing all the secret summer
I'd rather be where the waters turn to wine
On the riverside, take me down the endless summer
