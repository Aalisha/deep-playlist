Two faces playin' with my trust in you
You cover all your traces
And watch me relax with you
Insidious, creep away and do your deal
Return what you think is you
It couldn't be further from the truth

Cruel, keeping this a secret
Fool, you surely are
It's so you, blind to all the damage done
You go too far

Couldn't you have told me before
I would have loved you so much more
Couldn't you have told me before
Feeling like an outlaw

So you got some, you brought another person
Uncanny how he looks like you
