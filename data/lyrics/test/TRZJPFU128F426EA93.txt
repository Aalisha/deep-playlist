Well you know I don't get off on workin' day after day
I wanna have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when it's goin' my way
And there's nothin' like a party when it's kickin' into gear

I'm gettin' ready for a party tonight
Yes I'm gettin' ready to cruise
And if you've got somethin' for me
I've got somethin' for you

Baby
It's a party and nobody cares
What we're doin' there
Baby, it's a party as long as you're there
It's a party, party, party!

I can't believe it when some people say
That it's a sin that way we live to die
