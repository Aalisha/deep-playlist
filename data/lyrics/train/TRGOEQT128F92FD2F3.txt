Comes the time of fear and pain
The human race is bleeding away!
The earth covered by ashes and flesh
Dying in terrible decay
Freezing winds freezing it all
What fire hasn't burnt
Blackened blood flooding the graves
Messiah will never return!

Unholy words of ancient prophecy
Now come true - the dead rise from hell...

Toxic storms attack from the sky
Spreading the light of deadly pleasure
Nuclear mutants buried alive
In blasting dust of dying world
...
