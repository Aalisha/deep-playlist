No matter how I started
no matter how I try
things don't seem to get better
I just give up and die
it seems to be forever
since life was working well
I can't believe there's difference
between my world and hell

No bodies stand in my way
they drag me down so far
i'll pull myself up from it
but I don't know how far
a kick against the system
a paper enemy
devoid of energy
I hate what you've done to me

But I... will fight... this time
so long... as i'm... alive

...
