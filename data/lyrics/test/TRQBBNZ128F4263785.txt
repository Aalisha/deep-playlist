My name is John O'Reilly and my father worked the fields
In the hills of old Kilarny where I helped him turn the wheels
My arms grew hard as iron for a boy of 17
And I used my fists for gambling in those wet Kilarny streets

Well the ship left for America and I brought my pack aboard
Said goodbye to my dear Ireland said a prayer to my dear Lord
But I fought those sorry guineas in the kitchen they called hell
Well I fought them for their dollar and those guineas paid me well

Fair thee well fair dover
Fair thee well your seasons turn
For my pockets will be jingling on the day of my return
The day of my return

Well I fought in New York City and I fought the Jersey shore
