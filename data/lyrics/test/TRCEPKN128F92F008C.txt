My bluebird, my blue bird can fly as far as I can see
My bluebird has everything I need
My bluebird, my bluebird knows my deepest desires
My bluebird, my bluebird will catch me just before the fire

I'm down on the river baby, but I'm stuck on the other side love
From a rope my heart is hanging, water rises on a lonely soul
