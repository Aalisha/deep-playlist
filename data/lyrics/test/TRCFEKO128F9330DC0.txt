It started late last night, seclusion took its toll
Discarding everything,
the quiet place is where in fact my story would be told,
but you’re not out there
I traced the problem back to where it all went wrong;
why nothing turned out right;
it’s hard to see where both of us belong

Another failed attempt has brought me to my knees
I cannot call out ‘cause no one’s listening
