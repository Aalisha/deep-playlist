By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune,
Honeymoon keep a shining in June,
Your silvery beams will bring love dreams, we'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon.

Act two, scene new, roses blooming all around the place;
Cast three, you, me, Preacher with a solemn looking face.
