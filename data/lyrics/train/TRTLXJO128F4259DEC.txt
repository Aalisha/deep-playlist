Show me your company
Come and tell me who you be
I'll try and take things easy

I'll be loose I'll be carefree
I'm living for tomorrow not today
Gotta make my plans so in case
I'll be prepared when I see you you smiling

(Chorus) 'Cause I feel so high, I'm reaching out for your sky
I've boudless energy too. I feel I could run a million miles
I'm riding on the wheel of fortune, taking me to places far and free
