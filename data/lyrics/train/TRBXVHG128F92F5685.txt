This is me and my desire
Taking all that I require
Such a pretty sight to see
And there? s nothing left for me
Well you know it? s wery funny
And I don? t have much money
Change my colour it? s a dare
Change my face and my hair

Don? t want to be a moving part
Back door ladies rearranger
Don? t want to feel the cold nights bite
