Been a long time, you say you missed me
Word gets 'round, you shouldn't have dissed me
Step back, don't try to kiss me
Right about now I'm 50/50

I heard it through the grapevine that you were with him
Just the other night
I don't know why I try hard to keep you so happy
When you don't love me, don't love me

Been a long time, you say you missed me
Word gets 'round, you shouldn't have dissed me
Step back, don't try to kiss me
Right about now I'm 50/50

I heard it through the grapevine that you were with him
Just the other night
I don't know why I try hard to keep you so happy
When you don't love me, don't love me

Are you calling me a liar?
Are you saying that I'm not tellin' the truth?
Denying what she told me
You know you got way too much to lose

You're claiming they are rumors
You say you got nothin' else to hide
How come she told me
She saw somebody by your side?

Been a long time, you say you missed me
Word gets 'round, you shouldn't have dissed me
Step back, don't try to kiss me
Right about now I'm 50/50

I heard it through the grapevine that you were with him
Just the other night
