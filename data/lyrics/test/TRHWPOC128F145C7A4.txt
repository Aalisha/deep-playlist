What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I can't keep up and I can't back down

'Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to lose

And I don't know why I can't keep my eyes off of you

All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right
I'm tripping on words
