Think about the place behind your eyes
Then think about the darkness, when you turn out the lights
Think about the space between the notes
Well, that? s the Danchiva, don? t ask me where it goes

Rollin', rollin', shifting like the sands
Rollin', rollin', twisting in the wind
Never looking back again
