I made a rule about you
I made a plan
for getting my feet back on the ground.
Bury my face in teh clouds
for hours on end
but time only flies when you're around

It was cold and dark the last time I saw you.
Your hair was lond and falling in your eyes.
You said my hands were warm and that I was special
to you

Valentine,
You know that I'm fighting this love in vain
the sun's been shining for a week
but it still feels like rain
Valentine.
I know you're not mine
...
