Flying High in the friendly sky,
Without leaving the ground,
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
And have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger waits -
And its bound to forsake me.

So stupid minded,
But I go crazy, when I cant find it,

In the morning I'll be alright my friends-
Soon the night - will bring the pains again
...
