Hmm, hmm, hmm-mmm
I was raised an only child
My folks died when I was four
They were trapped in a fire
Way up on the fourteenth floor

Well, my lovin' granny raised me
'Til I reached the age of ten
But the good Lord took her too
And left my dog Jeff, my only friend

Oh, baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me, ooh

I've lost everything I've ever loved
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you, baby
I've lost everything I've ever, ever loved
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you
Ooh, baby

So, all my love I gave to Jeff
