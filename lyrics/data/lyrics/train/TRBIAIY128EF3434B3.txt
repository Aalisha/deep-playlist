(Lil' Wayne)
Hey mama
Kick him out da bed I'm coming over
Got something to show ya behold ya eyes
I jus' wanna hold you, just hold you tight
Like a four leaf clover I be goin' through
Your flowers baby, your gardens open
A sight for sore eyes
Good lord I'm focused
I can hardly notice anything other then a woman with a face of my future baby mother

(Robin Thicke)
I'm a big man she's a big girl
Put on them heels and put on that skirt
She wants to get naughty we can get bad
She's a good girl with the good girl dance
I'm ice cream shes a hot swirl
We can get married and live in our world
Lets play rough, we can get wild
I could go home but I'll stay
Cheat but I won't

(Lil' Wayne)
So I go by Weezy, love me or leave me
I hate to leave her
I think I need her
She's such a teaser
Such a diva
I could park it right here baby the f**k ya need a?
