(Dream home)
It's a beautiful morning
(It's a beautiful morning)
(Dream home)
It's a beautiful day
(It's a beautiful day)

(Dream home)
It's a beautiful morning
(It's a beautiful morning)
(In our)
Dream home
(In our)
Dream home

Straight life
Away from alternative culture
Transient people
(Straight life)
Coming in and out of our lives

Straight life
Painting our walls and wiring the circuit
Gradate advisement
(Straight life)
Building it up by the sweat of our bows

Home improvements
In our dream home
Home improvements
We're not moving

Straight life
Visiting sites of local interest
Walking the hillsides
(Straight life)
Playing games, bringing back souvenirs

Straight life
...
