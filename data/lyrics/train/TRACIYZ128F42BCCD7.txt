There's a light, in your eyes tonight
You know I know that look anywhere
You got plans, and I'm one lucky man
Before we get so carried away
There's just something I've been wanting to say
When we make love
It's more to me than just an affair
I want you to know how much I care
When we make love
Oh, it's such a precious time
