(Inspectah Deck, (Unknown singer))
(Baby...) Bitch! You know what I want!
(Sweet love.) I wanna talk to Sampson.
(Girl... sweet love. feel.)
I want yo' sweet?
(Yeah, baby. Sweet love.)
Yeah, BBC status. (Girl.)
Mockin' birds like Zorro
(Feel... baby. sweet love.)
(Girl... sweet thing... feel what I feel?)

Ghetto princess told me she settled out in Flushin' Meadow
Fly chick rockin' size six Skiletos
Drapped-out in tailor made leather and suede
A serenade for the moment, then we part ways
What a child girl, quiet at home, huggin' the pilow and phone
Now you're grown, rollin' bones, holdin' your own
I admire, attire be bold just like her attitude
Jewels from head to toe, glowin' natural
I'm after you, your style's what I'm attracted to
Realize it and keep it movin' when you do pass thru
Knowin' when we bump heads, we will soon bump hips
To be swimmin' in an ocean of love that sunk ships
Homin' with the tight grip, come thunderous
To wake up reminicisin' and spark the blunt clip
Have you lovin' it, wonderin' if I shall return
