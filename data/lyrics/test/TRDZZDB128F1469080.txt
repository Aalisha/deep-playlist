I walked right out of it, couldn't give a damn
I'd rather go hungry
I watched a generation wash it's hands of war
Then sleep in it's laundry

Wonders of the world and there's eight in all cos
It's a wonder that the wonders have such wonder at all
Fat men in business with will to succeed
Mouth off their stories of children in need, I call it

Murder, When your life is on the line
Murder, Why don't you take this hand of mine
Murder, to all the ladies giving birth
...
