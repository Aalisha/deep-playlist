Late in the Day
By the side of the road
I got a pocket full of nothing
And I know what I know
I know what I know
I don't know nothing else
If you could teach me something
I'd sure appreciate the help
And it's back and forth
Forth and back
Around in a circle
Now how do ya like that?
How does it feel when you're going nowhere
Won't you start sometime
Let me know
Won't you start sometime
Let me know
Some time ago
Somebody told me something
I can't remember what they said
