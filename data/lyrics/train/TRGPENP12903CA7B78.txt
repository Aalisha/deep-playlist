If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
Leave it up to them to fill up their steeple
Leave it up to us to fill up on our friends

If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
I would do it over and over again
I live in my mind that I know there's no equal
When I'm falling out, yo they pull me back in

It was long ago
And we were younger so
And our lives we part wrote
Feel it, feeling
Yeah

And I remember everyday
Sometimes it's too much to take
I break down, without heartache
And I mean it, and I mean it

If I could spend the rest of my life with my people
