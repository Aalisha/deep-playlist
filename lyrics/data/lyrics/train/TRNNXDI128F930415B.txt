I am exploring the inside
I find it desolate
I do implore these confines
Now as they penetrate, recreate me

I'm hovering throughout time
I crumble in these days
I crumble, cannot, I cannot find
Reflection in these days

If you listen, listen, listen
Listen close, beat by beat
You can hear when the heart stops, I saved the pieces
When it broke, and ground them all to dust

I am destroyed by the inside
I disassociate
Hope to destroy the outside
