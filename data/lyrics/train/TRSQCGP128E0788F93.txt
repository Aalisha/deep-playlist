What I want is for you to be with me
Loving you everyday would be easy
What I know is that we will never be
But that doesn't stop me from wanting the dream of reality

What I want is for you to be with me
Loving you everyday would be easy
What I know is that we will never be
But that doesn't stop me from wanting the dream of reality

I saw you this morning
As I left my house on the way to work
You were wearing the same old attire
The pin striped suit and shirt
If only you knew the things we could do
As we cross round the corner at the photo booth
Don't think I can see you're lusting for me
Cos I know you're down with OPP
