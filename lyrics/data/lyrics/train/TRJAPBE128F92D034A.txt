got nobody left to listen to
got no promises to keep
something's gotta be out there
fine a world for me out there
no more livin' half asleep

there's an island in the misty night
little platform by the track
I dreamed I saw a light for me
a face, a place so right for me
that I'd never think of lookin' back

through the shadowland
like a siver band
got no kind of plan
I ride the border train
somewhere new to be
light the way for me
moon and memories
...
