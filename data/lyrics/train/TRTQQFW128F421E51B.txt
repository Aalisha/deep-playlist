My fire's burning low
As my song grinds out on the radio,
I just want to move you slow and low
And shoot my eight-ball in the corner pocket hole

"Life's a gas" or so it seems
You know I blow a fuse when you come in my dreams,
I've got this fear no kiss can cover
I know we need no help to hurt each other
