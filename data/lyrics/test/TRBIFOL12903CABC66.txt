Grown up, now it's my turn
Dare me to make my move
Nowhere to go and I still don't know
But I'll make it through

Times change, change like the wind
I'm blown away again
Goodbye to my friends, new life begins
Without you

But these were the days, the choices we make
Decide who we will be and where we go
As we say goodbye, the look in your eye
Is screaming silently, remember to never forget
...
