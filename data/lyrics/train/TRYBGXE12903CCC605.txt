She came calling
One early morning
She showed her crown of thorns
She whispered softly
To tell her story
About how she had been wronged
As she lay lifeless
He stole her innocence
And this is how she carried on
this is how she carried on
Well I guess she closed her eyes
And just imagined everything's alright
But she could not hide her tears
'Cause they were sent to wash away those years
They were sent to wash away those years
My anger's violent
But still I'm silent
...
