Strange fear I ain't felt for years
The boy's comin' and I'm close to tears
I can't let go
Of you now

Imagination's playing round for free
In my world I take him out for tea
Oh my god
He can't say no

Skippin' school, gonna walk for e'er
I just had to get out of there
I'm on overload
In my head

Train comes, I don't know its destination
...
