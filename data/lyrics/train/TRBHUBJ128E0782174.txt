If someone tells you there's no other form of life

And you believe in that too.
I'm gonna tell you 'bout the other night

I swear that true.
A cloud of white and gren and flying ships I've never seen

Came into my view.
Was I frighted
was I scared

Was I thrown into confusion.
As they glided down so silently

It wasn't an illusion.
Oh
no doubt about it.
