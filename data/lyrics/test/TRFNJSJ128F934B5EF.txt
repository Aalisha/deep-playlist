~{ Weave Their Barren Path }~


Redefining wishes of your past - behold the realm.
Dream by hellspawn withering the mold.
We do not dare the distrust but a wielding life,
Scourged from these displeasing eyes.

No more shelter given from their path.
Disclosure draining skywards - onward and never to be stopped!
I was born to reign and weave their barren path,
A solitude eternally bereaved.

// Chorus
