How are you feeling? 
What are your reasons? 
Do you feel love or a lack there of? 
Love is a bond without reason
A cry for connection
A light in your eyes
Love is a reason for living, a reason for trying, a reason for life
Forget the feeling
Get all your of reasons
Life is love or the lack there of
Love is a bond without reason
