Here I go again
Cold and lonely nights
And where's your body next to mine
Just imagine you're here holding me
The thought of you just burning me inside

People say you'll end up hurting me
If only they could see what I see
They'd know

Your love
One thing in life that I'm sure of
Light of my life baby, shine on
Make me believe you're the right one for me
Soon you'll be, forever be
Light of my life
