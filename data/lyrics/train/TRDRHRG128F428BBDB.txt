Woke up this mornin'
Sunlight shinin' in my eyes
Woke up this mornin'
And I cried, Lord I cried all night

Pillow's drippin', soakin' wet
From dreams of you, baby
And tryin' hard to forget
But what's the use, I'm hooked on you

And I miss you, baby
With all my heart and soul
I, I, I miss you, baby and I need you too

Day in and day out
...
