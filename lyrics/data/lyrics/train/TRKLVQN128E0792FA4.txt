Sue him now and I'll tell you how
He's gonna milk like a cow
And if you want to fill a bucket
Simple as pie if you care to try
Just look him in the eye like you're high
And you want to die to cry
Fuck it
He's stuck it
Where it's ripe and I can pluck it
And it's a jewel
And it's cool
And hell I ain't no fool to school the rule

Business as usual
System never fails
Everybody's constitutional
Bargain back room sale

Bought and sold don't you catch a cold
It's going around I'm told
And it's survival of the healthy
Early to rise gonna win a prize
...
