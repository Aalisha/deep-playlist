Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I can take the pain
Won't you stay another day
Oh, don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss
Oh, won't you stay another day

Don't you know we've come too far now
Just to go and try to throw it all away
Thought I heard you say you love me
That your love was gonna be here to stay
I've only just begun to know you
All I can say is won't you stay just one more day

Baby if you've got to go away
