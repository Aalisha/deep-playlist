"Put Me On"

All I wanna do is make you dance right
Another B. Cox joint, uhhh
Oh, yeah, uh
Uh-huh, 2003
Latif
Yeah
Come on
Yeah
Come on
Yeah
Come on
First verse, uhh

You're hotter than, all your friends
Looking good, do your thing
I couldn't pass ya, had to ask ya
Did you get it from your mama
I done a quite a few girls
None could tie the shoes on you girl
I'm not gaming so don't get me wrong
There's something I think you should know

Are you the one
You're just something I'm tryna get with tonight
But I want
Nothing serious, tell me are you feeling this
I'll take you home
Uh, huh, bet that shorty wanna ride with me
So put me on, girl
Put me on, ma

Hey, hey
I know these fellas in the club
Been sweatin you all damn night
