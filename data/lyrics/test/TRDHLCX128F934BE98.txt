Eternal wastelands lie in front of us
Just as we wished for
We're breaking the boundaries
Between reason and hubris

Now stand and receive your failure
As the flames burn out
The ashes sums up
Your revelation

Attack for freedom or defend from what?
Disintegrate or manipulate
The lesson of violence is the fall of an empire

A conflagration, a superior state
Suffer the children and make no resolve
...
