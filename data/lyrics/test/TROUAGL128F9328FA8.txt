It's late, your eyes crossed with someone,
a pretty picture with a crooked smile,
she'll take everything you have away, away, away.

You bite into your lip until it bleeds,
you taste your fingers... maybe shes still lingering,
its not so easy, no its not so easy to wait, to wait, to wait,
I don't feel no remorse,
And I don't feel sympathy,
well I don't feel anything, but right now I'm feeling you.

I guess there's always something killing me,
I guess there's always something killing me some how,
I guess there's always something killing me, so it might as well be you.
