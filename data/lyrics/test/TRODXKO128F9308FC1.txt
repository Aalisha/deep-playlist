Follow the lover into the waves
Follow desire, a chained-up slave
And the tiny heart tears apart
But that's okay
That's okay.

Follow the shadow into the dark
I chased ghosts until I fell apart
And my tiny mind just unwinds
But that's okay
That's okay.

I just pump my pumps
Run 'em on the floor
As the bass bin blows
Run 'em on the floor
As the needle jumps
Run 'em 'til I claw at another slump
Another slump yeah.
