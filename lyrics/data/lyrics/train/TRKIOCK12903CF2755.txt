The writing on the wall
The words that I can't read

Three years, is a long, long time
Your heart beats close to mine
There's no wrong or right
When it breaks
It breaks so miserably
I'm leaving constantly
You always said that
"I feel dead, nothing left for me"

The writing on the wall
The words that I can't read
I refuse to let this bury me
