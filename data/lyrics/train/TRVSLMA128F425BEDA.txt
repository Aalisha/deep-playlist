An alcohol whore is what I was before,
Low-life day's ereased in a purple haze,
Maybe, just a craze, a phase we were going through
(Between you and me... the habit continues)
Sobriety's deserted me once again,
Surrender to the bender and no saying, "When."
Chewing on a bottle of ignorant bliss
And needs must at times like this

CHORUS
