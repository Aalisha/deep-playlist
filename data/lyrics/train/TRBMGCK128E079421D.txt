I'd run but there's no where to go
'Cause heartaches will follow me I know
Without your love, the love I need
It's the beginning of the end for me

'Cause you've taken away all me reasons for livin'
When you pushed aside all the love I've been giving
Now wait a minute

Didn't I teach you right, didn't I?
Didn't I do the best I could, didn't I?
So don't you leave me

Standin' in the shadow of love
I'm gettin' ready for the heartaches to come
...
