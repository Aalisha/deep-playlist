Dear Mariella
I am twenty-five
I live alone
I think I might have found love
But I just don't know
There's something wrong
'Cause he has another love
And she's been buried a year
And there might be a passing resemblance
But... Dear Mariella, how can I compare?
To the girl, to the girl
To the girl, to the girl who was too beautiful?
It's not fair
There's a ghost in his house
In his room, on his bed and this chair
And all my friends say it's not right
But I don't care, I'm gonna change my hair
'Cause he wants her
...
