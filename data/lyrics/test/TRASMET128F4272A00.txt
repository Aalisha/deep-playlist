Well I left my home down on the rural route
I told 'em all I'm going steppin out and get the Honky tonk blues,
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Well lord I've got 'em,
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.
Well I went to a dance and wore out my shoes
woke up this mornin wishin I could lose
them jumpin honky tonk blues,
Yeah the honky tonk blues
Well lord I've got 'em,
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.
