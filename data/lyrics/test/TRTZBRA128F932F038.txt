Ooh aah ooh ooh ooh ooh aah
Ooh aah ooh ooh ooh ooh aah

(CHORUS:)
Come on and shine (shine), shine like a star (ah-ha)
Shining so bright (ah-ha) like the star that you are (ah-ha)
Oh oh oh oh shine (shine) into the future (ah-ha)
Spreading your light (ah-ha) wherever you are (ah-ha)

I burn like a fire left in the rain
As I run the race, oh yes I feel the pain
From the resistance I'm feeling the strain
Now the realization is that we are all born the same

(CHORUS)

I reach for the moon and I reach for the stars (ooh ooh ooh)
With the strength from within me yeah, the further and faster I run
