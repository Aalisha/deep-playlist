You picked me up when I was down with nothing
And gave me something, I can't face the world without
You showed me just enough to fuel my fire
My desire, never wanna live without it

Both of us need something like we had before
We can't keep fighting like this anymore
This love affair is breaking my heart

All the pushing and the shoving
When we know that we ought to be loving
