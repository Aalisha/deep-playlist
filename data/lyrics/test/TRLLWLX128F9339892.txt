And the whiskey was free
If that ol' car in the parking lot
Drove home automatically
If every night 'neath the honky tonk lights
Didn't start those memories
Wouldn't it be a wonderful world
For somebody just like me
How long can a girl keep goin'
Like every day's the last
I've paid off the rent and the government
Maybe I could pay off the past
If the jukebox took teardrops
