Silence - After the battle all is still
Slaughter - Yet another mission is fulfilled
Now we begin our journey to our home
Crossing the oceans with sails set abroad

Dragonships, they carry us
From coast to coast
Where have we been, what have we done
What have we won?

As our struggle for this time is over
Know that we must depart soon again

Dragonships, they carry us
They take us home
...
