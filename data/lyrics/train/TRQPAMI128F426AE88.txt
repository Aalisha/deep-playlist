Spinning like a wheel round and round I go over you
Too good to be real, how you're moving me
I'm lost in a whirlwind so this is how it feels
Spinning like a wheel so in love with you

Falling like the sand
Deeper than I ever have before
When you take my hand
You take me to forever

A sweet touch, a heart rush
...
