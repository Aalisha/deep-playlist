(Jeff Lynne)

One way love, it never sleeps, it just grows deeper
One way love, it pulls you in, it takes you down
And I wish I knew what I had to do
To get into your life, to get close to you
But baby, it's a one way love.

One way love, if you could only see me as I see you
One way love, you'd feel the way I feel tonight
And I can't go on living other lives
Making other plans to keep the tears from my eyes
Oh baby, it's a one way love.

So don't turn away, and don't say it's over
