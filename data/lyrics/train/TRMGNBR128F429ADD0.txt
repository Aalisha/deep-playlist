I try to talk to you
But the words all come out wrong
What would I say to you
That's why I sing my song
There's no connection
Just feelings of regret
That I didn't talk to...

1-2-3-4
I try to talk to you
But the words all come out wrong
What would I say to you
That's why I sing my song
There's no connection
Just feelings of regret
That I didn't talk to,
That girl in the green jacket!
