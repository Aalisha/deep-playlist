['93 Demo Version]

Substantiate the right to hate
Violent shape takes on meaning
Passed down through the ages
Genetic spiral mutates
Growing affliction slices fate
One need, one soul, out of control
Wanders the world in search of hate
Genetic spiral mutates
Violence instilled
Aberated need to kill
No rational reason
To explain your bleeding, bleeding
