speak to me with
golden lies well
I won't ever leave you down

took away this golden life well
don't you ever let me drown
don't turn around
oh don't you let me down
see through my porthole
when i'm done
and I won't cry oh

oh when you
speak to me
my angel
tell me that
you'll be fair
where will you be
when I need you here ah
