Everyday people like, you and me
Just want to live naturally
Time told you, and you told me
Nothing gonna get us down
Can't you see

I said
If it don't matter to you
It don't matter to me
If it don't matter to you
It don't matter to me

People all around
Making sounds and all kinds of noise
If I could only get there
Then I could enjoy
Who they trying to be
Who they trying fool
