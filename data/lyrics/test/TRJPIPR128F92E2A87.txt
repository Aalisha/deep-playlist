Dont try to deny, my faith is your agony
So what if my appearance might graceful magazine
Oh baby give it up, dont try to control me
I bet youve had enough of fear in my destiny
Stop thinking of you
And start thinking of me
Cant give you my love unconditionally
Cause its all or nothing
(All or nothing)
I cant be here for you
If you aint got what I need
So make up your mind or youll better believe
That its all or nothing
(All or nothing)
So why criticize my lifestyle of luxury
Its so clear, interference is a waste of energy
Well, baby give it up, dont try to control me
I bet youve had enough of this stupidity
Stop thinking of you
