(Kye Fleming - Dennis Morgan - Marie Tomlinson)

I can smell the pines, sweet Carolina's on my mind
I still feel that mountain breeze, whisperin' through the trees
Tears fell from her eyes, I held her as we said goodbye
She knew I didn't want to go but here I am tonight alone.

Dreaming Carolina dreams in Tennessee
And someday soon I'll have her here with me
Until then she knows I miss her and tonight I'll go to sleep
