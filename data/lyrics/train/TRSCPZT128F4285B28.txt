Wait and see what it's all about
Never fear was it really in doubt
Watch the tears from the garden flow
Poison rivers into flowers they grow

Mirror shines in a world of hate
See the reflection and you know it's too late
Am I a fool to believe in man?
Take tomorrow I just do what I can.

Is it true that the things they say
Never make a difference anyway?
