I'm not saying that I come from poverty
I had a salad in my lunchbox if that means anything
I'm not saying that I'm from Chelsea
(He's not saying that he comes from Chelsea)

Posh boys play better, because they had the money to pay for lessons
I've got a case of middle-class hereditary depression
Mum and Dad's inheritance cash will pay for the Mosley sessions
Go! 

It's not easy, I turn over a new leaf, I'm a man
Pull your socks up and let's become an issuse
