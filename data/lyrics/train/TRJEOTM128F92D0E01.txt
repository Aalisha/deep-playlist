I want you here with me
Come on inside my world
Let me share my love with you
Be with me everyday

I want you here with me
'Cause you're so far away
I need you closer so I can love you
Love you in every way

Why don't you come on
Come on, come on, come on to me
This is where you belong
So I can protect and love you
Love you the way I know you should be loved

And if by chance
I'm movin' a little too fast
And you've got some other plans
That don't include me

But if you feel the same way
The same way I do
Then you ought to pack your clothes
I'm comin' to get you

I want you here with me, baby
(You and me)
I want you in my arms
Here we are talkin' on the phone for hours
And we could be together

I want you here with me
I need you by my side, oh
