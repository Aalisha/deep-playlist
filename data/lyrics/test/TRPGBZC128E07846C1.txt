Somehow the words just seem to pass you by
You never understand me
You build me up so you can knock me down
So far down they cannot find me

I've tried so hard
I've played my part
Console this heart

So the years move on
I'll never love the way I loved you
So the years move on
You'll never know the way I loved you
