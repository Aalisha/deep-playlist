You alright baby? Don't worry 'bout it
It's gonna be alright

He don't treat you like he use to 'cause he got somebody else
Girl, I feel for you 'cause you're all by yourself, yeah
Don't you shed a tear, be strong and don't let this nightmare get to you
'Cause some men gotta have two girls and that ain't cool, so

He won't hurt you again, he's never gonna hurt you again
'Cause you got a friend in me
He won't hurt you again, he's never gonna hurt you again
All you gotta do is believe in me
