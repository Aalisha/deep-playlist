I thought I had my girl but she ran away
My car got stolen and I'm gonna be late
For work this week
Make that the fourth day straight
But I'm fine with it
(You don't have to worry)

I thought I had it all but I gave it away
I quit that old job, now I'm doin' okay
Those material things
They can't get in my way
'Cause I'm over it

But whatever she may be...

She could be money, cars, fear of the dark
Your best friends or just strangers in bars
Whoever she is, whoever she may be
One thing's for sure
...
