Thank God I woke up just another damn day
First thing I'm gonna do is fall on my knees and pray
We all eyewitnesses to some pain and suffering
Emptyin' our souls to sin to keep on struggling
All these fine materials fancy clothes and gold
Ain't gonna keep me happy forever so I just don't know
Have I reached the point of peace to keep that happiness alive?
Only God can change this bad feeling inside
I'm gonna live and I die smile and I cry happens today hey
I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde

I'm gonna see you on the Flipsyde
And it don't matter if it's right or it's wrong
As long as it is and it's all good and we're gonna get grown
And everyday we face a battle inside but it don't matter if we win or lose we all gonna die yeah

Push comes to shove step with weapons and mean mugs
The worlds at war no discussion just draw your sword
What happened to peace all the angels are now deceased
They fell to the beast they was murdered for trying to teach
Lessons we learnin' a' have us burnin'
We failed to listen to the opposition and that's why we twisted with terrorism
Ain't no repentin' steady takin' but never givin'
So cold that I'm shiverin' frozen hoping that I keep on living
I'm lost in the system cut and bleedin' but bustin' back and stay on attack + Spittin' wickedly kickin'
