The power of love is a curious thing
Make one man weep, make another man sing
Change a heart to a little white dove
More than a feeling, that's the power of love
Tougher than diamonds, whips like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girls dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love, it keeps you home at night
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden, and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
