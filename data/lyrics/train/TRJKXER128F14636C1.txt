It's been a year since I last saw Mary,
When she said goodbye
She casts a spell on my intention
That's the reason why
I'm taking my thought from a bottle lately,
And breaking them up in my mind,
All my problems they don't look pretty,
Oh but it is no surprise

Well it's so hard
To take what you're given
Well it's so hard,
To give what you've got

After the love goes
here I go,
there's no easy road
