Yeah yeah
Your love, your love
Is so good to me

Every time I think about
The changes we've been going through
I think of how losing you
Would be the worst thing I could do

'Cause no one makes me feel this was
This calm, this warm, this whole, this safe
You humble me in every way
With every single word you say

You make me wanna sing, you make me wanna shout
You make me wanna know, what love is all about
You make me wanna try, you show me I can fly
I'm so faithful to you

And though I'm just a girl caught up in this world
I want you to know I'll let all that go
To you I will be true and line my life to show you
I'm so faithful to you

Love is patient, love is kind
For me your love comes right on time
