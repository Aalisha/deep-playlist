It's on this road that I'm drawn back to you
As the miles remember me as I go
It's in the silence of a night's dream
That I recall the words of devotion we spoke

And I can't remember where our bodies roamed
I can't remember all alone
How our love got lost out in the cold

But you're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

You're the only song I hear
In this great wandering mess of my years
You're the only one I know
Who brings me back to the middle

I separated all I thought I knew
