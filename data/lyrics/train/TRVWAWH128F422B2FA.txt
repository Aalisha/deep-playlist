In wheels of no return
And dreams that fade along the way
Never to grow old, and change
Shades of long memories
The times that I've been on my knees
I try to believe in somethin'
But i call out to no one

You know that I'll wait for you, I will follow
Gor a million years
To lead me through this world of sorrows
For a million years
...
