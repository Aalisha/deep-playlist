They called him crazy on the streets
Young and angry, one bad seed
He wore the colors of his call
He'd be the baddest of them all
Shoot out came down in a police raid
By a Smith and Wesson thirty eight
At seventeen he met his fate

Fallen hero
What were you trying to prove?
Fallen hero
All you got was front page news
It's too late, tough break, read your epitaph
Fallen hero
How many others will follow in your path?

He had a lady, she cries alone
It would come to this, she's always known
She remembers how he used to say
"There ain't no future anyway"
Sirens echo in the night
Now his name is the battle cry
Of another boy who lives to die
