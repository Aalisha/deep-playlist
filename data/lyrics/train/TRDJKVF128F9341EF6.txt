I got so many thoughts jumping out of my head
And I can't sit still
I'm thinking about the universe
I'm looking at life on earth
I can't shut the camera shutter

I stare at the clock, the years slip away
And I stay confused

I'm dreaming about *la raison d'Ãªtre (*the reason to be)
I'm frightened by the toxic threat
I can't stop the motor running

People saying I should learn some self-control
But I just want to exorcise my soul

And Walk Like A Man, Walk Like A Man
I still feel like a boy and you feel like a girl in my hand
I'm gonna Walk Like A Man, Walk Like A Man
I'm still waiting on the revelation
Here in never-never land

I got so many things jumpin' out of my brain
...
