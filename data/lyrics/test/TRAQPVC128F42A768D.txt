PreLuderS - Born to love you forever
We’ve got a secret only you and I know
We’ve got a language only we can speak
I want you to be wherever I go
It keeps getting better every time we meet
I feel it deep inside it can’t be denied, oh
Refrain:

I knew the first time, when we were together
I was born to love you forever 
Nothing comes between us
No one will ever Baby; I was Born to love you forever
