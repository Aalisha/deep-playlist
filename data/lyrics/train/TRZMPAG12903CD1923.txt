How I regret what I must do
But you left me no choice
Though I still strain
I can't recall
The beauty of your fey voice

Now that I've heard come through the walls
A song I've heard many times
I must return all you gave me
In the company of swine
We had found
Sacred ground
Oh, we had found
Sacred ground
You burnt down

I thought you sang
So tastefully
But now I see I was wrong
Your serenade turns to filth when I leave
So please, cut the love song
