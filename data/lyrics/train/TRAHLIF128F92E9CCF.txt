Take my hand
And walk with me awhile
Because it seems your smile
Has left here

And don't give in
When you fall apart
And your broken heart
Has failed you

I'll set a light up
On a hilltop
To show you my love
For this world to see

You can borrow mine
When your hope is gone
You can borrow mine
When you can't go on
Cause the world will not defeat you
If we're side by side
When your faith is hard to find
You can borrow mine
You can borrow mine
...
