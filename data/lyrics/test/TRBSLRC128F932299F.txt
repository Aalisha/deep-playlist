Restless from the cradle
I've been living like a burning flame
Betting with my life
That love will play out like any other game
No end in sight
It's just another night

I can take a bullet
I can prove it
I can take a bullet
Watch me do it
Just like a work of art
It's coming trough my heart
And breaks it all apart
But I can take a bullet
...
