Struck is now the Sun, he's bleeding so hard
And tainting the sky, with this brand-new red dawn
Now slowly he just fades, fading into the night
Ravashed by the darkness, the dusk's purest of lights

Blood is now spattered, across the whole dark sky
Dusk shall now wash it, with darkness and with night
I watch him perish now, I see his slow demise
And smile toward the Heavens, for this great gift of thine
