I have got so much to give, I swear I do.
I may not have nine lives, this one feels brand new.
Yes I've lived a good one.
I have tried to be true.
There are some things I never realized, till I met you.
How the wind feels on my cheeks, when I'm barking at the moon.

There is no home like the one you've got, cuz that home belongs to you.
Woo Woo! Here I come.
