Bring it all back now

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you

Hold on to what you try to be
Your individuality
When the world is on your shoulders
Just smile and let it go
If people try to put you down
Just walk on by, don't turn around
You only have to answer to yourself

Don't you know it's true what they say?
In life, it ain't easy
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop trying

Don't stop, never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you (Bring it all back now)
Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you (Bring it all back now)

Yeah, yeah

Na na na na na na
Bring it back
Bring it back
