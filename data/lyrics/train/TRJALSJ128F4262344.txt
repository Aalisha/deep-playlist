Hey, can you turn it up a little louder, please

Marlon Brando on a motorbike
In the black leather heat of a Saturday night
He said, "Whaddaya got?"
Ya got nothin'

Dollar in my pocket burnin' like Rome
There ain't no place that I call home
All alone in the big bad city

Hang around this town, man you're better off dead
I'm flyin' like a rebel flag, goin' outta my head

Yeah, we're gonna rocket tonight
We're gonna tear it up twice
Shake it up, break it up, tear it down, larger than life
...
