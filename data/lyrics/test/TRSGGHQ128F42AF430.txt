one side of the story (4times)
uh

tell your mother
its allright.
tell your sisters and brothers
its ok
your friends are on the way
tell them calm down.
cause they dont even know
we gon'work this out.
cuase thats how it starts right there
telling everybody, round here.
whats going on between us
we cant let them all in here.
cause everybody aint for us,
specially me, when they over here.

one side of the story, and thats your side of the story.
and they make up every story, i wonder what would happen'if they,
only heard my story.
that i love you only, baby cant u see?
