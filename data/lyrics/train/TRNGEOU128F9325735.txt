I remember summers, you and me lasting forever
Holidays come and we'd never, never ever be apart
I remember spending, all of my time, every minute
The two of us we had our own rhythm, intune with
The beat of my heart

Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter (what I do)
Since you went away, since you went away
Now in the summer (I miss you)
And in the winter (I miss you)
It don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I say
You left it

You took a holiday from us
Took a trip and left your love
If your heart wan't down forever
You should have told me where it was
You took a holiday from me
I guess you needed to be free
Would have loved you with no measure
And now you got me asking
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?)
Where (where did you go huh?, where did you go huh?) did you go?
