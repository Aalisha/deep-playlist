You got your eye on me
Scanning me
All over
Don't flip your switch to heat
Easy into it
I'll show you what I can do
Before you play with me
You should know that I'm queen be
I'm down for you so make damn sure
Be careful of what you're wishing for

I'm gonna please ya
Let you getta deep ya
I'm gonna freak ya
Ya ya
I'm gonna please ya
Let you getta deep ya
I'm gonna freak ya
Ya ya
I got the love
I don't wanna waste it
I got the love
I want you to tast it
I'm gonna please ya
Let you getta deep ya
I'm gonna freak ya

I'll keep it on the low
Nice and slow
So tasty
I'll let you take control
If that's your goal
Do what you gotta do
Before you play with me
You should know that I'm queen be
I'm down for you so make damn sure
Be careful of what you're wishing for
