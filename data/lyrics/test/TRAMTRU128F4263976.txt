Do you know this place,
Do you know this face,
Do you see the space i live in now?
Well i've done my best,
But i've failed the test,
Cause i see the pain upon your brow.

And
We're just creatures,
Creatures of habit now,
We're all creatures,
Creatures of habit, we are

Did i say it wrong,
Did i come on too strong,
Did i pull the rug from beneath you now,
It's a lame excuse,
