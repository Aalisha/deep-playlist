(Peplove talkin')

(Opio)
MC's they diss but want to be subtle
what can I say to disgruntle
Heiroglyphics but then the rebuttle
that's trouble
don't want to get caught stuck on the mic
I know what it's like
I seen some niggas be victims last night
a pitiful sight
all four of them, they tight
.(Phesto) Disguise it between the lines, man, it'll be
aight...
write rhymes in the limelight
can't afford excitement
gotta be careful
down low when I recite it

(Phesto)
Cause you niggas are weak
immune to freakin shit surpressed 'em
quarrenteened to malpractice
but mics you need to be arrested
bribery, for your recitals that suck
dick infested, with your misconceptions
you can duck, the mic with digress and babblin'
disestablishin' the fact ya wack ass backwards destined
unimpressive, much too lacking, you divulgin'
exposin'... ya posin'
comin from no new angles
the same flows that keep us dozin'

(Peplove talkin')

(Opio)
Got 'em terrified
let's clarify this shit, who bit
prepare to die for that _______
you crossed me you gets clips
sendin' 'em shockwaves
