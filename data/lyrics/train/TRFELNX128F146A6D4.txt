Tell her I'll be waiting
In the usual place
With the tired and weary
And there's no escape

To need a woman
You've got to know
How the strong get weak
And the rich get poor

Slave to love
Slave to love

You're running with me
Don't touch the ground
We're restless hearted
Not the chained and bound

The sky is burning
A sea of flame
...
