Stir in darkness through the chamber of disgrace
Malicious cellar, abhorrence place
Evaporating stench of rotting body parts
Nailed to the wall, mutilated and deformed
Fridge with chopped heads, vermin flies and crawls all over
Carnage temple, necropolis
Bodies fused as heaps of putrid waste
Tubful with innards
Skull stacked as an altar, candles burning
Carnage temple, necropolis

Resurrection of the savage within
Eruption from the beast of sin
Dead fills a monstrous call

The beast crawls as the mask falls

Skull crushed by my axe
Bones splinter, decapitation
Sockets empty, eyes sucked out
...
