I can't feel, and I can't see
I'm falling down what's going on with me
Lord in heaven why am I here
Do I live to rise or rise to fall to shed another tear

One more time I feel that I'm alone
I can't describe it cause it's better to be shown
Feel the darkness covering the spite
Hear me screaming when it's pounding deep inside
