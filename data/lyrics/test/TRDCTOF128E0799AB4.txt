What's the name of the group?
Boyz II Men
What's the name of the group y'all?
Boyz II Men
What's the name of the group y'all?
Boyz II Men
What's the name?
Boyz II Men

Everybody sing, come on

Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, and not too soft

It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin'
We got Boyz II Men, A B C, B B D
The east coast family
Never skipped a beat, hell no
