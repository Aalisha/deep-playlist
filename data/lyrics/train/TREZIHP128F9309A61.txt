I know what you want
I'm gonna take you to a midnight show tonight
If you can keep a secret
I got a blanket in the back seat on my mind

And a little place that sits beneath the sky
She turned her face to speak, but no one heard her cry

Drive faster, boy
Drive faster, boy

I know there's a hope
There's too many people tryin' to help me cope
You got a real short skirt
