We awoke in the midst of a vicious cycle,
Becoming the satellites whose transmissions are static served.
As of late, it seems my audience has been lacking.
I can only pray that you're tuning in during a moment of clarity,
Just to hear me utter these spiteful words before the signal fades.

Here's hoping this becomes the soundtrack to your misery,
The hook that rips right through your chest.
Enjoy this constant reminder of your fickle nature,
And the hideous facade you wear so well.
