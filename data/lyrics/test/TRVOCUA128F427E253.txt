Slow down girl
It's a funny old world
We've got everything but we can't have it
It's true you know we're passing through all alone

It wasn't so long ago
That we were afraid
Afraid that life would keep us waiting
Afraid that we would keep on taking
Back seat rides through our home town lies
Where every trip's a dead end street

And baby here we are
How did we get this far?
Before we closed our eyes and prayed for faster days

You try to escape
