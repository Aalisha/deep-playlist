It's not how fast you can go
The force goes into the flow
If you pick up the beat
You can forget about the heat
More than just survival
More than just a flash
More than just a dotted line
More than just a dash

It's a test of ultimate will
The heartbreak climb uphill
Got to pick up the pace
If you want to stay in the race
More than blind ambition
More than simple greed
More than a finish line
(More than a finish line)
Must feed this burnin' need
(Must feed this burnin' need)
In the long run

From first to last
Peak is never passed
Somethin' always fires the light
That gets in your eyes
...
