Howl of a coyote wakes up a man
A haggard shadow in this wasted land
Vultures rise with the scorching sun
A dry wind blows in a silent town

Some Whiskey to clear his head
And some for the brothers who are dead
Another day, another chase
Vigilantes will meet their fate

Saddle your steed
We are riding tonight
Be ready to kill
Don't flee from a fight.
Pillaging is in our blood
We bow to no one and no one at all

Stone cold metal in his hand
