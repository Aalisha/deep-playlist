I'm missing you so much, I'll say you die tonight
Just so I can get to you before the sun will rise
I know these times are hard and I feel this too
None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you

And I'm wasting away, away from you

And I'm wasting away, away from you
What have I gotten into this time around

I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again but I didn't have to

You had me at hello.
