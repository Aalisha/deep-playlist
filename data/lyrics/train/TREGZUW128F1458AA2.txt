They tell us that
We lost our tails, evolving up
From little snails
I say it's all, just wind in sails

Are we not men?
We are Devo
Are we not men?
D E V O

We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all
Jocko homo

Are we not men?
We are Devo
Are we not men?
D E V O

Are we not pins?
We are Devo

Monkey men all
In business suit
Teachers and critics
All dance the poot

Are we not men?
We are Devo
Are we not men?
D E V O

Are we not pins?
We are Devo
Are we not men?
D E V O

Jocko homo
