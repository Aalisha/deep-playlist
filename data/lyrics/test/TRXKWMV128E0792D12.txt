This little girl of mine
I wanna say she's so fine
And each and every day
I make sure she has her way

Now, we don't feel tied down
Although our hearts are bound
I don't have to chase her all over town
My baby, she's always around

The girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright
Listen, the girl's alright with me
You know the girl's alright

Now, she's so good to me
I guess that's why I feel fancy free
...
