Steppin' out on the great lawn in the new green shoots of a crop
There was a wind in the wild rough grasses and a broad swelling heat when it stops
Standin' at the edge of creation at the base of the throne of the sky
By the mouth of the Tennessee River where the birds of another world fly

Well I must be on my way the share croppers say there's barely even work for them. 
I'll come rolling back to town when my fortune comes around. 
Come and see your daughter again.
