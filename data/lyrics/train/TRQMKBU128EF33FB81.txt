Better parted
I see people crying
Truth gets harder
There's no sense in lying

Help me
Find my way from this maze
I can't help myself

When I see tenderness before you left
(Forget)
That even breaking up was never meant
(Forget)
But only angels look before they tread
(Forget)

(Living in another world to you)
(Living in another world to you)
