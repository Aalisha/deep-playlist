Nobody like
Nobody like You Lord, You Lord
Nobody like
There is nobody like You Lord, You Lord

I can look throughout this world
And yet I know I won't find
I can search eternity
And I'm sure I won't find

No one loves me like You do
I'm for sure this is so true
There is nobody like You
So I take this time to say that there is

Nobody like
Nobody like You Lord, You Lord
Nobody like
There is nobody like You Lord, You Lord

No one loves me like You do
I'm for sure this is so true
There is nobody like You
Put Your hands together now

Please believe me
There is no place on this earth I can find
There is no one
