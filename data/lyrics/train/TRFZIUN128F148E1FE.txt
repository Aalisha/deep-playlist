People said that together we were both sides of the same coin
And we would shine like Venus in a clear night sky
We thought our love could overcome the circumstances
And my ambition wouldn't allow for compromise
I could see in the distance all the dreams that we didn't mean
And every choice I had to make left you on your own
Somehow the road we started down had split asunder
Too late to realise how far apart we'd grown
And how I wish I (wish I)
Wish I'd done a little bit more
Now shoulda, woulda coulda means I'm outta time (I'm outta time)
Shoulda, woulda, coulda can't change your mind
And I wonder (wonder)
Whatta, what I'm gonna do
Shoulda, woulda, coulda are the last words of a fool
People ask what it feels like to live the kinda life others dream about
