Ese Lil Rob's back in the clean black Cadillac
Hittin' the fronts and the back see I'm still ridin' like that
Ese Lil Rob's back in the clean black Cadillac
Hittin' the fronts and the back see I'm still ridin' like that

This shit is easy it comes natural to me
But that's no reason for you to be an asshole to me
Just because I'm that vato that be bangin' on beats
I don't wear no jewelry that shit's too fancy for me
I just wear my t-shirt with my Davis' on
I'm drinkin' beer even when the charger game isn't on
I'ma kick back type vato but they got me on the go go
Enough to drive me loco, loco in the coco
Loco in my low-low, scrapin' because it's so low
Hyna's wanna go low meet me at the holo
We party like the raza do, don't know what else to do
Dealt with you too many times the first time that I dealt with you
More bounce than a trampoline
But I stay creased and clean
Homeboy said I couldn't rap, hasn't hurt me recently
Vato wants a piece of me I'm the one he just can't see
Make him wish he never did 'cause it's too embarrassing
