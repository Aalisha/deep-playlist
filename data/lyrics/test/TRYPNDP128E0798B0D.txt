We're gonna miss you, poppa yo
And you know I speak the truth
I learned that two years ago now my lady
And I've had to find a way to make you mine
Remembering the summer, I was twuneanunda (twenty and under)
Had to take it one day at a time
Had an angel and a subject at the same time
Sho ya right
They crossed passed at mahogany
I tried to make it work, remember I said, let's (let's) try (try)
This life without you is not for a brother
That's why I'm here trying to find my some kinda...

Love! Love la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la- Love!

To be continued [x5]

Move to the drum, my L.A. babies
Where the night life is young,
You will find your soul
Holla! for your man's
It's addictive baby
I don't know about you
But I can't fight it
