Yeah...

Took me twenty years to stand up straight and tall
Took all of twenty seconds
For everything to fall
I don't worry about my pride anymore
Pride is something
I just can't afford

I'd go begging in the rain
If I could spare you any pain
When it comes to you
I have no shame
No shame
No shame

There's no life by your side I wouldn't live
There's no sin you could commit
That I would not forgive
I don't try to understand anymore
Because I just know my world begins at your door

If I could keep you from the cold
If I could make your tears my own
I'd do anything
I have no shame
