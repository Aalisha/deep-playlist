Come on, let's waste another thousand years
Sitting around your kitchen table
We'll turn the brandy into beer
Later they'll say, what a miracle

You say all you need is a right position
'Cause nothing in this world helps you to see
You say that you never do it
Unless someone gives it to you for free

You say I never listen to you
Well, you're right about that
