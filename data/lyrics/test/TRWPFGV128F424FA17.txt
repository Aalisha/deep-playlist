Enter paradise, the snake will find the way
She is lilith, fallen from the sky
Fall into our world, the snake of paradise
(You're the) maid of wisdom in (the) songs of orpheus
She's the wisdom, she's the truth: the eternal sophia
Perennial, beyond the time, she is the one
You're the river, you're the womb
The perennial
The sophia
Sophia is here
Do we need to fear?
