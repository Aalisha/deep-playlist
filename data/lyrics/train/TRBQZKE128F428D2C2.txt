It's just another summer
You hear a different drummer
You're lookin' for a way to check out from this line
You wrestle with temptation
Your job is your frustration
'Cause there's a lifetime chance you've got to find

Still you wonder if you've got the clout
To make it happen in this cold-hearted town
And you're feelin' like you're trapped
You wonder should you just stop tryin'

Take the message from the man
Who's not afraid to come on strong
When there's magic in the music
It's the singer not the song
When it's comin' from the heart
...
