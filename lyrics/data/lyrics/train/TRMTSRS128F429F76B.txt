First I get cold then hot
Think I'm on fire
But I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love.

There's nothin' I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm goin' through
It must be love.

It must be love
It must be love
I fall like a sparrow
Fly like a dove
You must be the dream
I've been dreamin' of
Oh, what a feelin'
It must be love.
