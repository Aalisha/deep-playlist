Look at the hottie in the tight jeans
Look at the pipe dreams
Look at the fat man burst at the seams
Look at the captain with the galaxy, right off his balcony
Look at the science and the alchemy
Look at the sirens on the cop cars
Look at the pop stars
Look at the convicts filing the bars
Look at the wife
Look at the knife
Look at the pom-pom prom queen scream and scream and run for her life

It's always right, the perfect light in the dark of night
