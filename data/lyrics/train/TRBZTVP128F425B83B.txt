come close,
and listen to the story
about a love
more faithful than the morning

the father gave his only son
just to save us

the earth was shaking in the dark
all creation felt the fathers broken heart
tears were filling heavens eyes
the day that true love died
the day that true love died

when blood and water hit the ground
walls we couldn't move came crashing down
then we were free and made alive
the day that true love died
the day that true love died
...
