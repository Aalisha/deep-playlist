I have a van
It's a special van
It has a couch in the back
So I don't have to stand
I've covered the walls
With egg cartons and foam
Soundproofed my home
So you and I can be alone

I am a man
I'm a frightening man
I'll do things tonight
You won't understand
Fogging the windows
With my eager breath
...
