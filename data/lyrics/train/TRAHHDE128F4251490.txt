Lost in a dream, finally it seems
Emptiness and everlasting madness
See the sadness grow, watching as we know
Long before our journey for the world

Call for us
The power in all of us
So far beyond the blackened sky tonight

Glorious
Forever more in us
We are victorious
And so alive

We'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
Our journey on towards a brighter day,
Silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
Across the endless sands,
Through the fields of our despair,
Free for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
Rise above the universe tonight,
...
