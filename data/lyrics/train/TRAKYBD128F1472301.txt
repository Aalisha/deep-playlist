Well, as a kid, I had the chicken pox
The German measles and the scarlet fever
And I don't ever want to go through that again

I had to tell my little broken heart
I had to tell it I'm immune to love
'Cause I don't ever want to go through that again

You can't have it once you've had it
You can't have it once you've had it
