You say you don't wanna run and hide
A face that no-one knows
And everyone ya meet, you're gonna show
You're nobody's slave, nobody's chains are holdin' you
You hold your fist up high,
And rule the zoo

Oh, you just got to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin me
Cause I, I got the guts to be somebody... to cry out

I wanna be somebody,
Be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody
Be somebody too
...
