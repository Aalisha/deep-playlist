Take me in your arms
Hold me for a little while
Hey, baby

So I know you're leavin', leave me behind
I'm seein' you, darling, for the very last time
Show a little tenderness before you go
Please let me feel your embrace once more

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, darlin'
(Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while)
Give me just a little while

We all must feel heartache sometimes
Right now, right now, I'm feeling mine
I've tried my best to be strong, I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child left in a cradle
