Lock yourself behind an iron gate
To keep the intruders off your way
Sleep with a rifle in your bed
But still your screams keep you awake

'The madman's hiding in the night'
Searching for you
'The thieves are approaching your house'
Always out of sight
'The murderer's on the loose tonight'
Waiting for you
'Defend your piece of paradise'
Playtime's over
...
