Closer than this
It burns her heart like a sun-struck desert plain
Closer than this
Lost this soul in the sand that knows no rain

More bitter than this
A taste that's sour for years and she can't lose
More bitter than this
Cross my heart and hope to God you

Stop!
We brave the strength of our emotions all our lives
It turns creation and elation into strife
