I don't care about life
Or the world around me
I've got a place to go
I don't care what you say
Words cannot harm me
You're going down below
Come and join the fun on the way to heaven
Come and talk to god on the party line
If you can't be bothered, we don't need you
We're going to live for a very long time

I don't care for your views
Or your style of living
You're going to fail the test
You can argue all night
I have no misgivings
And I never get depressed
