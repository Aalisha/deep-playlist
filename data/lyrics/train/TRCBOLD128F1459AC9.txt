You asked me to you house to join the party,
You say it's meant for me and only you.
On my way there wondering what's in store for me,
Knew you sexy body would take control of me.

A private party...
It's meant for only two
A private party
It means me and you
A private party
With no one else around
A private party
I don't need no guest when love comes down.
