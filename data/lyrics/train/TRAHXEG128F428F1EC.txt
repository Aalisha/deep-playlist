Yeah
You wanna be successful
You wanna be the president
You wanna be the life of the party
Everybody's friend

You wanna be original
Make a difference in this world
You wanna be my everything
Baby no matter what else you do
First of all, most of all
Just be you

Be crazy, be real
Be anything you feel
But just be with me
Say you'll be with me
Be mellow, be wild
Be a man or a child
Baby can't you see
All you really need is to be with me
