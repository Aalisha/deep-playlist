We stand accused but you lie
Varicose-veined finger
Prejudiced evil mind
The young get stronger
Free living fast
But you're a sapsucker
You ain't gonna last, No

Your twisted mouths feed the
minds of babes
Taught from birth it's crime that pays
One man's fortune is another
man's pain
But that's how you play the game

I ain't the child of your disgrace
You're mudkickin' into my face
I've healed the wounds, been crucified
Mudkicker kick
Ha! here's mud in your eyes

Ladies and gentlemen and members
of the jury
All rise, cause here comes the boss
He's your big brother the silver
tongue's doublecross
...
