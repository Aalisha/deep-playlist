(Dickie Peterson)
Help me please, Doctor
Doctor, won't you please
I need your pain killer, Doc
Shot inside of me.
Well I ain't got no money, child
But I been here before
Cash me in, Fill me up
Why don't you throw me out the door!


Well help me, Doctor
Well why won't you
Why don't you
C'mon and help me please
Won't you please
Whoa, I need your good living
Shot inside of me, Yeah!
