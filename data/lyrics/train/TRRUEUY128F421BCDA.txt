Invisible faces
Whisper to me in the night
They're speaking of places
Men have spent lifetimes to find

As if out of nowhere
Their shadows appeared
Fathers and sons in search for the one
Souls of eternity

Into the night, Reach for the sky

Guide me: You are the wise
Take me away to your kingdom of light
Time will prove to us all
...
