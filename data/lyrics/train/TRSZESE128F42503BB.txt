I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feelin' for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then come on, oh come on

Let's get it on, ah baby
Let's get it on, let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, whoo-ooh-ooh

We're all sensitive people
With so much to give, understanding, sugar
Since we got to be
Let's live, I love you

There's nothing wrong with me
Lovin' you, baby no no
And givin' yourself to me could never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful
...
