I'm kissing your hand, I'm kissing your hand
I'm making you smile, why am I doing that?
I like you a lot, I guess I forgot
I don't like you much now

I'm kissing your hand, I'm kissing your hand
I'm making you smile, why am I doing that?
I like you a lot, I guess I forgot
I don't like you much now

La la lala. Words go too far
Why can't we say when it's dark
The sticks and stones do play their part
Why can't we say? (Why can't we say?)

Hey!
