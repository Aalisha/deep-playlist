You're the youth bangers, fight forever more
Raise your golden hammer, bring it down like Thor
Ooh, the force is going to bring us victory
No foe or rival will stop the energy

It's a vital mistake
To try to brawl with the brave
The storm just breaks out in rage
Oh then it's time
To release the martyrs on your mind

It's the march of the saint, march of the saint
March of the saint, march of the saint
