By the hand of Your Spirit
Play the strings of my heart
And reveal all my hidden songs
By Your love let me hear it
When the song in my heart is not for You

Hold me in Your hands
Receive me as I am
And take, take me away
I wanna be in the Secret Place

Lord, I worship You

On the waves of Your mercy
I will sail on Your sea
