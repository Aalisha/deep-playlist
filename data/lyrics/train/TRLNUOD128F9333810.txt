[Tony Mack:]
Ooooooooooooh!
Ooooooooooooh!

[Devin the Dude:]
Well, hello again!
My weed-smokin' friends, I'm glad you came
With coffee / Coughee in your cups, if I went up
I'll do the same
And you can pass it to someone you've never met
And let 'em get just as high as you
You're eyes red as shit mine, too!
We about to start the show
Who got an Optimo?
A swisha suite
A zig-zag and bitch that'll kiss my meat
This cordless mic, I know what they like
Continue to rockin' the show that'll slow up a fight
And I know of dyke
Who wouldn't mind
Gettin' some of this dick from behind
But, I'm gonna chill, y'all
'Cause she might wanna start wearin' my draws

[Devin the Dude (Tony Mack):]
And oh noooooooooo! (And oh nooooooooooooo!)
Don't want that shit to happen! (Don't want that shit to happen!)
(Ooooooooooooooooooooooh!)
Get it twisted just because I'm rappin' (Get it twisted just because I'm rappin'!)
Don't want that shit to happen!
(Oh nooooooooooooooo!)
Don't get it twisted just because I'm rappin'
