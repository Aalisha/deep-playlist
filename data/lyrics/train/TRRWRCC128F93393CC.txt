G Love And Special Sauce
G Love And Special Sauce
I Love You
I guess I'm lucky
It's in my blood I've got you and us two
That's what I'm thinking of
so you're moving into my place
That's a 24 hour taste
That's no can that's a case
This feeling I sure can't sense

I know it sounds old
But I love you I love you
I love you

So we seem a little young we have fun
