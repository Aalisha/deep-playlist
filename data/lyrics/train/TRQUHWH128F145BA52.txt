(Kim Carnes)

Did she tell you it's over
Did she throw you out in the night
And here you come to your other lover
Thinkin' that a restless heart
Will get you high again

But I've change the number
Of my telephone
You won't find me when you come callin'

And I'll say
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
Must be a case of mistaken identity
I'm not the girl you want me to be
...
