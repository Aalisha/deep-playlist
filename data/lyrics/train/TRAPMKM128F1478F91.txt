Yesterday and tomorrow
New born baby, no more sorrow

I feel the charge of shooting stars when I'm near you
Cosmic rays shoot through my body while we play
I'm forever changed when I'm all alone with you

I'll never get over the thrill of this love
I'll never get over the thrill of this love
I'll never get over the thrill of this love
I'll never get over the thrill of this love
