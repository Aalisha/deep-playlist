This is part of your makeup
To look as though to call
With eyes in front of your mirror
You taste as rough as the shore, you know
Lay on your back to let go of,
Think it over
Call out your name and see

Feeling nothing but heaven
The world colored you like she does
Without them who always curse you madly
Well what have you done in your corner there
...
