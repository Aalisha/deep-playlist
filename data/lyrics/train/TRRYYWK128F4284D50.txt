She don't know about, what you
You've been doing with me, oh yeah
I feel bad about it
What would you do if you were in my shoes, baby, baby

I should've known right from the start
When you said she was just a friend
I should have ended it but instead
I just pretended not to know
That you're running back and forth
In and out of my life
But still I just can't seem to let go, oh no no no no

I know it's wrong
But I will never wanna let him go
Inside I'll know
That he's got another girl at home
I can't help but think what if it was me
Shouldn't have fell in love with someone
Who put me in this situation, no

You say you love me
But then you turn around and hurt me, baby why? Oh why?
I can't handle it, so baby, things are gonna change
I'm gonna take my love away
