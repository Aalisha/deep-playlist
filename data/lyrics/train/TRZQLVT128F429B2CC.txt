What's my name,
R-U-L-E,
Blowing back on Mary Jane,
And analyzin the game,
The game done chose me,
To bring the words I can't say, it's one in the same,
Ever since you told me,
Theres only room for two, I'll be makin less room for you,
Only God can hold me,
Judge me, the only man that help is above me, holla,

I met so many men and,
It's like their all the same,
My appetite for lovin,
Is now my hunger pain,
And when I'm feelin sexy,
Who's gonna comfort me?
My only problem is,
Their insecurities,

Tired being alone... yeah, yeah
Sick of arguin on the phone... yeah, yeah
Tellin all your friends... yeah, yeah
But you men don't understand... my love

Cause I'm real,
(the way you walk, the way you move, the way you talk)
Cause I'm real,
...
