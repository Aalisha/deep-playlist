Chorus:
I can? t live without your love
I can? t live without your love
If there? s just one thing
I? m so sure of
I can? t live without your love

I? m sorry for the things that I said
This is the time I know I? ll regret
Every step I take is further from you
Oh what can I do
It? s just another day
I let you slip away
Oh you know it? s true

Chorus:
I can? t live without your love
I can? t live without your love
