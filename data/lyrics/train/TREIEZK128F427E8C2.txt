You better now close your eyes
We're traveling deep inside
You face your real emotions
To get through to the other side

I wonder now how you survive
With all these feelings that you always hide

Tell me just a reason, I won't run away
We don't look back for yesterday

Right here and right now,
There's no way out we're talking soul to soul
Right here and right now,
We're standing face to face
Take me by the hand and we're flying
Until the end of time
Cuz right here and right now,
We're talking soul to soul
