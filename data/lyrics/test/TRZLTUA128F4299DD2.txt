Blue, I'm gettin' kind of close to you
Like a shadow I can't lose
Hey, you've been hanging with me everyday
Now you're gettin' in my way
I know you understand me
But don't you think maybe it's time to move on

What's up lonely?
Seems you're my only friend who wants to share my pain
Tell me heartache, what's it gonna take
For you to leave me alone today
Just when I think that you're gone
You're in the mirror looking back at me
So what's up lonely?
Lonely, ooh

Sometimes, I wish you weren't by my side
Can't you find another shoulder
'Cause I, I wanna leave this broken heart behind
We're both wasting too much time
Find someone else to rain on
I'm really gettin' tired of singing this sad song
