the world don't seem to fit me
I'm always starin'at the stars
a better life for me in some other galaxy
I wanna get off this world of ours

I got a telescope on the roof
I'm always searchin' the stratosphere
'cause breathin', breathin' it ain't easy
in this loveless atmosphere

you, you could be anywhere
somewhere, so far from here
wherever you are, like a fallin' star
come back to planet earth, burn out with me
