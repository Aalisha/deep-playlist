You've got religion on you side
Thats why you tell so many lies
Every kiss is just a kiss
And nothing more and nothing less
Hold your breath were going down some

I'll stick a fork into your side
Just to make sure you're alive
Jeopardise our friendship
But you've always hated that
You say no they're gonna stone you

Cut my fingers off
And make my hand a ghost
So put it in your head
Excuse my thoughts
Why can't you say

Sometimes I live a lonely life
Such a pointless life
God knows I like to criticise
The only way that I'll get by
Yes, I need common sense
I really wasn't born with it
Shoot me in the face
