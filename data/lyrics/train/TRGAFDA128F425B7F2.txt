From the museum of sleep
Unliving eyes see death's subtle jest
In my sorrow they mourn the past
Yet celebrate their eternal rest

Relieving the worlds pain
In a church of misery
Dampening the lantern flame
Upon your bended knee
Painted skulls
Painted skulls

Warm and close the air runs hard
Around the loyal gravesite
Wailing moon in a putrid sky
...
