Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of cities
Lonely as I am
Together we cry we cry we cry

I don't ever wanna feel
(like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)
I don't ever wanna feel
(like I did that day)
Take me to the place I love
(Take me all the way)

I drive on his streets
Coz he's my companion
I walk through his hills
coz he knows who I am
He sees my good deeds
And he kisses me windy
...
