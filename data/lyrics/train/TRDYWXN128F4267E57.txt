Well, I'm tired of tryin', so tired of tryin'
You know I'm tired of tryin', well I'm so tired of tryin'
So tired of tryin', tryin' to get along with you

You put salt in my coffee
Sawdust in my brew
I'm just here to cash it in
Don't you think that's mighty rude

Tired of tryin', so tired of tryin'
I'm so tired of tryin', tryin' to get along with you

You always told me, mama,
You don't need other man
