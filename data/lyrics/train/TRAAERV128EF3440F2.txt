Save our love (x3)

Do you remember
All of the joy we found last spring
Oh baby
So good together
We never worried about a thing
No no
But now I see such a distance in your eyes
And the seasons come between us
I can't find my paradise
Without your love I'm a little child lost in the world
Mmm, come on baby

Say it's not too late
I know there's time enough
Help me darling
We got to save our love
Save our love
Stay close beside me
'Coz the sky is stormy now
Come on baby, come on and save our love
Save our love

Save our love (x3)

Walking in circles
