I, Common, IiI, common (*repeat 4X*)

I'm writing in my book
Wit a simple pleasure
Or is it necessary
Just to document this measure of time
Whether defined or not
I'm gonna find the top
Of my personal climbing rock
Take a verse of what I'm about
Break it down
I just rhyme about den
And da secrets I'm finding out
And dats alright ain't it
Look how bright I painted experience
Gain it, maintain it
Same heinous crimes Of Sam Hein
They won't wane
Eh pay the fine
And sometime I campaign
Champagne and Rap
You're bottling flat dude
Forget all that
It's concentrate on the great
We gonna do this
Tough like Buddhist
Who this fool sitting in big chairs
Spot light blew it up
Smooth as cup of Caffeine
Chapters got snatched up by Napster
Jimmy Caster
Use to get wasted away like Jimmy Buffet
And I'm dam sure
It wasn't cool
Now I ain't buzzin fool
Like That
Light that Rit
Bite that bottom lip
I gotta be a somebody
Even if you gotta trip

[Chorus]
We are floating in the sky
Here today and gone by Niiiii
We all try but don't know why
There's no answers it's all liiiiiiiiiiiiiiife. Liiiiiiiiiiiiife
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiife, Liiiiiiiiiiiife (I common IiI common)
It's the Magnitude
Liiiiiiiiiife, Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife (I common IiI common)
