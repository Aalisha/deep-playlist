Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'll never go in the wrong congregation
Woh, woh, woh, woh rastaman a burn pagans, so

I'll never go where the pagans go
Never do what the heathens do
Cuz rastafari give I the guidance
Never say what the idolaters say,
for Emperor Selassie I
I trust and obey
Rasta words are pure substance
Never go where the pagans go
Never do what the heathens do
Cuz rastafari give I the guidance
Never say what the wicked hearts say
Neither will I walk in their council no day, hey
Haile I, Speak no guile, so

Mythology and illusion i'll be always burning
Corruption and confusion, will be thrown in the ash-bin
Can't full rastaman with your false doctrine
Your false teachings, oh wat a sinting
Justice in the sky, is it salvation that yuh seeking
From the throne of David it obvious dat you're drifting
You ave' no raspect for the king of all kings
Oh his name I'll be always exalting, so
