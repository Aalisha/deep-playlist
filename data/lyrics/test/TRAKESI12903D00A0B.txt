For years I’ve worked this city
Where the streets are cold and gray
I’ve let some clean ones walk
I’ve put some dirty ones away
But nothing could prepare me for
The case I caught today
And if I have my way

There will be nowhere to hide
There will be nowhere to hide
Once I’ve picked up on the scent
On his capture I’ll be Bent
