i can strum a little, i can hold a chord
this ain't the gospel and i ain't the lord
i'm no holy roller, but for what it's worth
my freedom's a train ride to heaven on earth

it's not just a train
it's saying goodbye, saying hello
to where we have been, where we might go
it's what we have passed, what we might see
it's not just a train, it's freedom to me
