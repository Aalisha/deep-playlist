On the left on the right honey, it's all the same
People everywhere are still playing the same old game, yeah
For a dime they put you down lay you in your grave, yes they will
They put you down when you are not around it drives you insane

That's why I gotta get some changes made
Honey, want to rearrange some day
C'mon little baby, my mind is getting sick of today
I said come on right now

Uptown downtown acting just like you should
Even if you play their game it won't do you no good
There's too many creeps out there hungry for your blood, yes they are
