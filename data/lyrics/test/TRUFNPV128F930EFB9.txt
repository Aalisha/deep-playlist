Never mind the dishes
Piled high in the sink
Never mind the weather
Or your work day
You been running
All day long
Trying to be everything
To everybody
Everything to everybody
Lets be still and see what a
Little silence can bring
Go on and lose yourself
For just a little while
Right now no one
Is aiming to impress
Right now more is less
...
