I'm waiting for you
Rain fills the sky
Yet the sun is always there though it seems too hide
Waiting for the right moment to brighten up your life
Just like a mother's love
A child can rest there and be secure
I can be that and much more
If you only give Me half a chance
Standing here with outstretched hands
You've got understand
If you only look My way hear the words I say
I offer you My love
How long must I wait

I am here (right here, right here waiting for you)
I am here (with love unconditional, yea)
