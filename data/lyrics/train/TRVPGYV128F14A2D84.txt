This just in... where to begin
Grin and bear it, it's bare and grim
Adoration, titillation, I'm the victim now
Because she's figured me out
She lights my candle, she has a handle on me
It's going well but I'm scared as hell
That she'll figure me out
She thinks it's sacred to be naked
But I don't care, 'cause she's had me there
You see she's figured me out
And I wanna shout at the top of my lungs now
But oh my god if she hears me she'll come running in...
