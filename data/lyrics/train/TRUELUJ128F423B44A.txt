What you don't know
Is that your scars are beautiful
What you don't know
Is your imperfections are what make me whole
What you don't know
Is how I spiral down
Cause I can't speak whenever you're around

And it's not like me to hide behind a wall
And it's not like me to fear the fall

What you don't know
Is that I lay awake
Wishing you were here tonight
What you don't know
That I loved you long before we were alive
Cause how would you know, how could you know
So now I'm gonna tell you everything
