I could write the book of you
And illustrate the pages
Ya shouldn't read it
I'm the one that you put down
It was written in a hurry
Slipped through your fingers

I do everything I should
I still gotta learn
How to be good
You got two strong arms I see
Can't ya bring'em around?
Wrap'em around me

Lay my storms down at your feet
Maybe you'll build a shelter
Maybe do my heart work for me
Oh I kick and scream but the job is mine
