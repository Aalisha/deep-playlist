I'm proud to be an outlaw
I'm proud to be a rock n' roller
Just don't want to get judged by the color of my skin
Or the beer that I'm drinkin'

Don't fuck with me 'cause I don't look like you
We can be brothers and wear our different colors too
Don't fuck with me and I won't fuck with you

Some people got a problem with a man in long hair
I don't care
Some people don't like a poor boy 'cause they think you can't win
For the thoughts that he's thinkin'
