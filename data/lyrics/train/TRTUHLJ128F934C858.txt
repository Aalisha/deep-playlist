Well now, Crow Jane don’t make no sense to me
She left me hanging from the poplar tree
No I never ever felt so free
Look at, mama, what you’re doin’ to me

'Cause it ain’t no difference which way I smile
I ain’t good lookin’ from a quarter mile
Once had a women called me angel child
My reputation keeps me on track

But who’s gonna save me from myself?
Gotta lay the blame on someone else

Somehow I ain’t got no hope
'Cause I’m still runnin’ from the sheriff’s rope
My shoes don’t fit me 'cause they filled with dope
Crow Jane quit me and I just can’t cope

But all I know is that I’ll still run
And pledge allegience to the settin’ sun
I must've lost 'cause Crow Jane won
I’ll never learn from anything I’ve done
