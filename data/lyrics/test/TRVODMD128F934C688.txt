For every life I take, an ecosystem I create
Blood and guts consumes my life
I am the "brutal gardener"
I - "quantity controller"
...no more insane than Jesus Christ.

Forgive my humble abode
Rotting bodies clogging the commode
Please pardon the stench and the trunk of a man lying on the workbench

Out by the shed are buzzing hives made of human heads
The gestation of larvae tells us
the time of death

Decomposition - An exhibition of life that springs from tragedy
