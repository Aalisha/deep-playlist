I had a lust,
I had a firecracker,
I had a love for the sound of this world

I'm still in love,
It's just a stab at laughter,
It's just a mark of the people we are

But don't be daft, no,
It's just a monkey business,
They're running signs no remainders of since

We deal in abstract,
No pain and no deliverance,
This a punch i'm not punching up against

Oh, it's all just mirrors life and smoke,
We are livin' in some tiny joke,
And I'm hear to show my lust,
And be shown the...

To kick the walls,
Smash the lights,
Rip the shades,
Burn it all,
Firecracker, firecracker,
I will not complain at all
