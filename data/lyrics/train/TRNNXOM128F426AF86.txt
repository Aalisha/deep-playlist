After all these years
after all these tears between us
still i couldn't find
someone half as right as you
and each time i stop to think
what it is i really need
here's what i conclude
all i really need is you
Just say what you want to say
you don't have a chance in the world
can i, knowing how i've tried
still come close to losing you, girl
