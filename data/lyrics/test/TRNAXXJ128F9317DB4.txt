I am absolutely now prepared to pay the price
Even if I ultimately pay with my own life

Where did you give everything, to sacrifice it all
And without the will to die I know that I can't win

No mind, no pain, nothing can hold me back
Now I stand without fear in the valley of death

I'm willing to die, die, willing to die

Die, willing to die, like a Samurai

Deep within my self is a decision that I made
