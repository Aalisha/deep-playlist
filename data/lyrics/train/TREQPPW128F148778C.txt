Got a job that's okay
But they got me working night and day
Punching in, punching out
Is this really what life's all about?

(What'cha gonna do, what'cha gonna feel?)
I don't know
(What'cha gonna feel, what'cha gonna do?)
Ooh, won't someone tell me
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna do?)
There's only one thing left to say
(What'cha wanna say, what'cha wanna say?)

(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)
Oh, yeah
(C'est la vie, c'est la vie)
That's just the way it goes
(That's life)

Baby's gone, all alone
Are you sad because you're on your own?
