The turns you had to take still keep you awake
Down come the walls where you once stood
From constant changes you have made
You'll keep inside 'til you have a say

We change as we get older
We're not to stay
The days we walked are over

Now we just drive away
From everything I know
You're counting days on the back of your hands
You turn the pages 'til you have no more plans

The only time you had to think of all the things involved
Came when you were least expecting
...
