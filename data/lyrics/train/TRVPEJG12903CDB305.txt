Talking on the phone and watching "Cribs"
He doesn't know what kind of guy he is
He's got a gold-plated ceiling and a TV show
A broken heart and he doesn't even know
He's glad to see you, yes, he's glad to see you
Open your arms and sing
The world's been waiting, they've been waiting for years
And they've just gotta hear it
