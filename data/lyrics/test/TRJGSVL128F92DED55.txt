Freddie: Feeling's gettin stronger
Larry: Music's gettin longer too
Rose: Music is flashin me
Sly: I want to take you higher
Baby baby baby light my fire

All: Boom shaka-laka-laka Boom shaka-laka-laka

Freddie: Feeling's nitty-gritty
Larry: Sound is in the city too
Rose: Music's still flashin' me
Sly: Don't ya want to get higher
Baby baby baby light my fire.

All: Boom shaka-laka-laka Boom shaka-laka-laka
