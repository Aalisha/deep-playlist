I´m a wanderer and I wear the mask of mystery
from a prisoner waiting for the last request
when I got the will, then I got the chance,
he said: certain mistakes of my fiends
make the wish fulfilled
Now – that – I – see – I – can – be – free
I – will – give – you – all my pain
And I wish you where here
I wish you fear – I wish you well
and that you´re burning there
in hell instead of me
and I wish you where here I wish you amen
I cause your all-inclusive pain
All the walls inside try to speak with me
beautify this spider´s home
help the fly to rest in peace
...
