Slick p, my brim on lean.

Hoes on scope yeah they keep me on their beams.
They like the way they old school look when it gleam.
Step up in the club pullin stacks out
4 logs in the bottle watch a nigga black out(fo real).
Next thing you know I'm standing on a pile of cash.
Shorty shakin like she got moracas on her ass.
Glacier for a wrist, got a glacier for a chain.
The human chandleir I'm a freeze him off main.
The bread come fast and we quick to let it go.
