It's crowded and we're bored
The chamber maid: she snores
The drummer's gone to tune up all her toms
I laid my head down and now my wallet's gone

Hooplas involving circus tricks
At addresses way out in the sticks
The pixies in tight green little skirts say it's so much better now that is hurts
The tides that pull you down in the river
She touched my knee and that made me quiver
Winks with her eye, 3.14 (pi)
Is there anyone who knows the whole thing?
