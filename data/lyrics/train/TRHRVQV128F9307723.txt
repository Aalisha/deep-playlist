I can see that you and me will have a terrible fallin' out,
No-one at the barbers' ball will know what it's all about!
They'll hear a shot, and see you duck, and when the smoke has cleared away,
Then the band will crawl from behind the stand, and then you'll hear me say;

When i get home i'm gonna change my lock and key,
When you get home you'll find an awful change in me!
If i don't change my mind, another thing you will find;
That your baby maybe has got another baby on the pullman line!

You did your stuff, so get yourself another home,
...
