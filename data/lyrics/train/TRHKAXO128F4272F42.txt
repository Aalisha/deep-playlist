If you want your soul set free,
lift your voice and sing with me
(scat).

If the Devil grabs your hand,
Here's one thing that he can't stand,
(scat).

Walkin' down to the river, sing'n' a hallelujah song,
Oh Lord!
Up jumps the Devil before you, just keep ploddin' along!

Tell old Satan how you feel,
Get the Devil off your heel,
...
