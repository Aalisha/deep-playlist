The hour of reckoning draws near
Judgment day is here and gone
Sweetly she draws me into her arms
A liquid embrace to chase the day away

Sedate, numb, deaf and dumb
Stumbling into solitude
A clouded judgment day is fueled
Take me under your black wings

Mark my words and remember me
So sweetly she sucks away at my time
