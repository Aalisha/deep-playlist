I just don't know what to do
I just don't work right without you
I get busted up,
need fixing up now baby

My senses stop making sense
No wait, that don't make no sense
I get thrown off by my own balance, baby

These city lights
only shine down for you
This place is just too big without you
I just don't know
what it is about you
I just know that
I'm no good without you

Girl you gotta know
