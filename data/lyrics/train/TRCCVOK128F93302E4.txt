It´s a lovely day, I don´t wanna play
minigolf or go to the zoo
I don´t wanna go to the swimming
pool cos Dad would see my tattoo
today I´m in the mood again for
p party in the park
playing football with the lads
and singing to the stars

Remember years ago,
we couldn´t get in the disco
do you like to go to
Kannenfeld Park?
We were just happy lads,
in the light of the street lamps,
babydo you like to go
to Kannenfeld Park?
