I turn the other way
I'll never turn you down
You turn me on
Don't speak out every meaning
I don't belong to you
You don't belong to me
So don't hold on too tightly...

Let me know when you're lonely babe
Let me know when you're lonely babe

Happier now than I've been in the past
Gone are the days
Gone are the tears
That was a girl I used to be

The girl that you now see standing in front of you
Could keep going on
Because she believes
In setting you free

So let me know when you're lonely babe
Let me know when you're lonely baby
...
