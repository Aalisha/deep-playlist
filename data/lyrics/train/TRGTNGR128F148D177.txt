Maybe you want another world
One where heaven doesn't weigh so much
Maybe you'll find another girl
One you can feel when you do not touch
Well I've got something
Warm inside me
It won't let you fall
'Til I see
Somewhere better than this place
Some night you'll open your eyes and live far away
Somewhere better than the world
