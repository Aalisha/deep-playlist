The current is strong from what I've heard
It'll whisk you down the stream
But I never seem to have the time
So my toes just touch the water
My toes just touch the water

I daydreamed on the bank again
I was swimming with the fish
And I thought this time that it may be true
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
