Love is all pain
There was a time when I adored you (um)
But I was too blind in love to see (see)
That it wasn't real it was only me
Giving in to every word that you said (you said)
I'm loving you but my heart can't pretend
When your feelings just haven't been there (oh yeah)

So if you want to go
I wouldn't follow you
Guess I'm not the one
To make your dreams come true
If you weren't my love
I've got to let you go
Cause your loving is the deepest hurt of all

Where was the life we had before (before)
There was a place in your heart I could go home
Now I found my place has gone to somebody else
I can let you go because I can't take no more (oh)
I'm loving you but my heart can't pretend
