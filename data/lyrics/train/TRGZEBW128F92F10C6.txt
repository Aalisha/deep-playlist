Accordin' to my heart
You're the one for me
The one love of my life is here
When you're with me
If someone stole your love
My heart would beat no more
For you're the one
My heart is always longin' for.

Well I don't know the reason why
My dreams don't turn out right
But I'll keep listenin' to my heart
...
