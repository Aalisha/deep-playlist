[Part I: Wanderer of Time]

So mysterious is your world
Concealed beyond the stars
Far away from the earth
It flows one with time and dark as the night
Million shapes and colours
Are storming inside your mind
Creating endless dimensions
Forming universes without walls
Walls

Let go, of the stars, the stars that fell into the sea
Let go, of your thoughts and dreams
What can you see now

You cannot save them anymore
Wanderer of time
It's too late now
Creator of Dimensions
Destroy the walls of time
Hands of the blind are holding your fate
Tides of life will take you away, will take you away

Starchild
Visions are born from the unknown force
It dominates the way of time
The dream only ends, when the worlds come to an end
