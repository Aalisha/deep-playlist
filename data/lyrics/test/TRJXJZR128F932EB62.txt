We're buying and selling your history
How we go about it is no mystery
We check it with the city then change the law
Are you looking forward?
Now you want some more

We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping
We're S-H-O-P-P-I-N-G
We're shopping

It's easy when you've got all the information
Inside help, no investigation
