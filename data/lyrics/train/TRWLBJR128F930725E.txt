(*Prod. by Exile)

I wake up in the mornin' with a appetite*
For money, gotta make sure that he right
Best weed keep me higher then a satellite
Where I'm from, life's a gamble, grab the dice
'Fore I leave, pray to God, then I grab my Nikes
Remember those times I knew I had to fight
Nigga might run up on you at the traffic light
Wind up in some heavy shit if you packin' light
Now a days, strap up, they ain't packin' nice
Streets made of ice, slip, that's your life
To live and die in CA, from the home of PA
Guaranteed to make it pop like a fuckin' briefcase
Come where I stay, not too far from the Bay
About two-hundred-twenty miles from LA
