HEART AND SOUL
THE CLEFTONES

I transcribed these lyrics from "Heart and Soul" done by the Cleftones.
I took transcribed them off of the second CD of the
soundtrack to "American Graffitti" Copyright 1973 MCA Records, Inc Universal
City, CA

Heart and soul
I fell in love with you.
Heart and soul
the way a fool would do
madly
because you held me tight
(Held me tight) Held me tight (Held me tight) Held me tight
(Held me tight) Held me tight (Held me tight)
And so the kiss bear in the night.
