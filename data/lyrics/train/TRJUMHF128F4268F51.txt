Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
You'll never know how you run me down
and i don't even need you, no
and still you keep me holdin' on
just for dear life
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
If you live a loveless life
just blame it on me
on the count of oblivion
i'm guilty
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
No we've never been away from here
so we'll try to lose ourselves again
...
