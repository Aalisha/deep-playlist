Atari Teenage Riot
60 Second Wipe Out
The Death Of A President D.i.y.!
Pussycat pussycat! kill! kill! kill! (x4)
How far can we go? kill! kill! kill! (x2)
Pussycat pussycat! kill! kill! kill! (x2)
Kill! kill! kill! how far can we go?
Kill! kill! kill!

We bring the chaos to your house!
It's a death trap!
My life? - your life? what you gonna do?
We don't scream for total control!
Just a start but we move fast!

And if you steal this record... we don't care!
And if you buy this record... be aware!
They want to cut an advert out of your dreams!
No! what do you say? no! what do you say?
