In the dark of the city backwoods
Something stirs then slips away
Law and order in darkest Knights bridge
Crime and punishment at play

Hey Mr. Policeman won't you come on over
Hook me up to the power lines of your love
Jump start, tow me away
Jump start or tow me away

And through the bruised machinery
[Incomprehensible] smoking haze of industry 0.49
Another day with ball and chain
