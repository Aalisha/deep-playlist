Love, I am so different
Love, I am so different
Love, I am so different than before

Love, can I be loved?
Love, could I ever really be loved?
Love, if you ever find me I wonder will you try me?
I'm so different than before

Love, the kind that I've dreamed of
Well, it starts right here inside of me love
Love, if you ever find me I wonder, will you try me?
I'm so different than before
Love, I am so different than before

Love I am so different
 (Love, I am so different)
Love I am so different
 (Love, I am so different)

Love, where are you waiting?
In dark and smoky rooms I hear you singing to me
Love, let my voice take you and the songs we'd make
Would be so different than before
