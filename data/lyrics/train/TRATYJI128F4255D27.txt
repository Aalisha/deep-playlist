Teri to, Teri ta, hamesha yaad sataave
I don't know what you're saying
All I know is that I came to party
Teri to, teri ta, hamesha yaad sataave
Dhoom macha de rang jama de
All I know is that I came here to
Came to party!

Aaja baby meri kol
Aake gal tu dil di bol
Ainve na tadpaaya karo
Main taan karda teri wait
Khol ke dil de gate
Milne kade aaya karo

Hey If you really want to get down
Aaja baahon mein hum ghumein around

Round we go, round we go
Round we go, round we go
Round we go, round we go
Round we go, round we go

Teri to, teri ta, hamesha yaad sataave
I don't know what you're saying
All I know is that I came to party
Teri to, teri ta, hamesha yaad sataave
