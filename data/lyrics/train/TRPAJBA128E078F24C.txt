I couldn't breathe, I couldn't see, I couldn't think, I could not believe
How good it felt when we touched
I couldn't fight, I couldn't try, I couldn't hide, I could not deny
That lightning can strike more than once

Finally I know anything is possible
Finally I know that some things are beyond our control
Finally I know all is fair in love and war
Finally I know there's no need for keeping score, no need to worry

I didn't see, I didn't want, I didn't need, I did not recognize
That love was there inside your eyes
I didn't say, I didn't act, I didn't complain, I did not resign
