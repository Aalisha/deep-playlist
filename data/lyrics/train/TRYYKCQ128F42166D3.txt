Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen, Brian Regan!: Cheering:
Brian: Alright, How ya doin' folks?: Feedback:
It's like you're al sittin' there, "Hey pal, you got some jokes?": Laughing:
"Why don't you start crankin' 'em out, circus boy?: Laughing:
It's good to be here.
Just tryin' to go through life without looking stupid...: Laughing:
It's not workin' out too well...: Laughing:
Sometimes you'll say the wrong thing at the right time and feel stupid.
Somethin' like, "You tow!": Laughing:
I was gettin' out of a cab at the airport and the ddriver goes, "Hey have a nice flight!"
"You tow!": Laughing:
"You too, you have a nice flight too, in case you ever fly someday.": Laughing:
"Don't even look at me, I'm a moron.": Laughing:
Don't know when to say the "You too" phrase.: Laughing:
Can't handle it.: Laughing:
I never learn, you know. A waitress will bring my meal. "Hey, enjoy your meal."
"You tow!": Laughing:
"But you don't have one, do ya? I'm a dufus!": Laughing:
"If you do eat, enjoy it when you eat it if you have a break or something, later!": Laughing:
"If you get an opportunity, that's all I'm tryin' to say!": Laughing:
"That's all that I'm drivin' at, really! If you think about it...": laughing:
"...That's all.": Laugihng:
You ever start to say somethin' and in the middle of what you're sayin' you decide to say somethin' else, completely?: Laughing:
You know, there's already words out there.: Laughing:
