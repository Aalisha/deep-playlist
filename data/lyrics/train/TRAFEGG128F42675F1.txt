Why do you lie, why do you cheat
why do you try and deceive
always twisting around what you say
you better change your foolish ways
this world does not need
always finding new friends to betray
payback now
why do you lie, why do you cheat
why do you try and deceive
always twisting around what you say
you better change your foolish ways
this world does not need
always finding new friends to betray
payback now
Gonna get yours
what's coming to you
gonna get yours,
it's the big payback now
see what you've done to me you fool,
i payback now
backstabber, payback now
I can't find reason to believe
any word you say is true
always living surrounded by lies
unless it comes from deep within
