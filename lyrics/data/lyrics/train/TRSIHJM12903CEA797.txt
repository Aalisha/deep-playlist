Well the heart only breaks so many times
So many times before it becomes wise enough to know
That time will heal
And the will to walk never gets run down
When the thief inside finally figures
Finally figures out
Thereâ€™s nothing he can steal

But never in my life have I ever felt so alone
Than when I offer you my hand
And your face told me something so wrong
And I keep asking everyone around
And all they got is I don't know
So how do you break a heart of stone.
