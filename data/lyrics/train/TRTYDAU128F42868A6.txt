Don't bother giving me your best apology but give your father and mother
All the best from me.
This move will be good news for them, so they deserve to know.
Mrs. M will tell her friends that her daughter's come back home.

And if you wanna go then say goodbye to me, I won't stop
You from chasing trouble down the street. I won't say I told you
To go, then say goodbye to me, I won't stop you from chasing trouble down the street.
