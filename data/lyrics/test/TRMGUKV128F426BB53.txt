Come on and do it
You make me feel so good
Ain't nothin' to it
When rythm takes control
Come on and do it
You make me feel so good
Ain't nothin' to it
When rythm takes control

I'm b-b-b-back in town
Excuse me babe if I'm too proud
But what I gotta do is to go for it
Gotta make you feel like you're in to it
Bang bang bang hear the drums get slammed
Just shake it to the jam
