You say you wanna be the one
But still you leave the job undone
You only call me when you're free
But you know that it ain't good enough for me

You're always dippin' with your friends
As if you're out there making ends
And now you're knockin' on my door
Well, I guess you were too busy before

You better make time
If you wanna be with me can't you see
Show me I've got everything you need, everything
Don't think twice, if you wanna be with me, be next to me
If you wanna take the ride, you'd better make the time

You better make time
If you wanna be with me can't you see
Show me I've got everything you need, everything
Don't think twice, if you wanna be with me, be next to me
If you wanna take the ride, you'd better make the time

There's other places I can be
If you're not careful you might see
Me out there with somebody else
If you do you can only blame it on yourself

I'm feelin' you without a doubt
