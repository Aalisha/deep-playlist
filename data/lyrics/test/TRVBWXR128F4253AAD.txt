The spinningwheel: to eilly and teesa in philly

Mellow the moonlight to shine is beginning
Close to the window yound eileen is spinning
Bent over the fire her blind grandmother sitting
Is crooning and moaning and drowsily knitting

'tis the ivy dear mother against the glass flapping
Eilly I surely hear somebody sighing
'tis the sound mother dear of the summer winds dying
(chorus)

Merrily, cheerily, noiselessly whirring
Swings the wheel, spins the wheel while the foot's stirring
