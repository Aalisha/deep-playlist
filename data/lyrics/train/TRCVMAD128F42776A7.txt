Warning

Yo, wanna rumble with Pun hah?
Shit on the whole industry
Yo who puff more Owls than Pun? Pile on more styles than Pun?
Who the only one with over a thousand guns?

Runnin' up in niggaz cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the fire starter
Hit your wife with the sawed-off from the shower powers I devour

I'm all about the fundamentals like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper, a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mental's compatible with the radicals
My odyssey type, qualities allow me to poli' with animals

Niggaz is cannibals and the ghetto's a jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles
Or struggle on the simple and humble
My niggaz'll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran
Try to imagine what they can sacrifice for twenty grand

Niggaz'll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
And pound out we jettin' to the ground uptown
Up in the Boogie Down, bitches swallow the team, pile on the green
Surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
