You only want me 'cause you can't have me
I was there for a while just waiting
I moved on and now you're wishing you had the opportunity

You only want me cause you can't have me
I'm sorry I am not for the having
You sadly failed to see
Now you are wishing
Wishing

You could have had a taste
Love was staring you in the face
But you chose to walk away
Walk away
