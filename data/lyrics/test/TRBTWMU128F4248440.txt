The lies are hard to spread thin
But it's so easy to control
Weakness is your savior,
But there's nothing left to save
This is family tradition passed on in fear
Unconditional love for a fuckin' stranger?
Nails driven in me, for I have sinned
Your ambition bleeds on a cross
Security bleeds on a cross
