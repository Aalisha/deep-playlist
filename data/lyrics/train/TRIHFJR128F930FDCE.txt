Chorus:
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh
Uhh ahh

The love I have right next to me
Is here and always will be
I'm caressing your body emotionally
As you can feel and will see

Oh tell me why can't we go all the way to the top
The fullest extreme
The sounds are here when you're with me
Express the way that you feel
And you say...
