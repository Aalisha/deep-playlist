No more days slipping through my hands
No more wasted nights
I've come too far to deny my heart
This dream I hold inside

I want to know the depth of God's love
'Til I have it all, I won't have enough
No matter how deep, I'm jumping in it
Whatever the cost, I'm gonna give it

I want to go
Where no man's gone before
I want to go where I can love Him
More and more and more
...
