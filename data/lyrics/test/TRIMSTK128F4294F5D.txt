Can you hear that lonesome moanin'
Is that you or is that me
My broken heart ain't aching for nothing
That I can't touch or I can't see

And do you hear that lonesome cryin'
Thought I made it stop it's singin'
But my hands lay there on the bottle
And I just drank till my heart would be
Too drunk to dream.
