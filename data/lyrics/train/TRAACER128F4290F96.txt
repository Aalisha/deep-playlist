First off let me say you look so tired
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition blankets the sky
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight, you're right, you're right, you're right

So drop the gown the game's over
Just push your face into the fight
And it breaks my heart
Like dancing up all night

Ride so high, we both start thinking
'Bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong
...
