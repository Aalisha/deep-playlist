What's the matter with your face?
What's the matter with they way you talk?
What you doing with that spoon?
You should be eating with a knife and fork
Take a look at your body
Take a look at your state of play
You've had your fun and now it's time to pay

I'm doing O.K.
Well look at me, I'm doing O.K.
