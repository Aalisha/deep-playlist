After years of expensive education,
A car full of books and anticipation,
I'm an expert on Shakespeare, and that's a hell of a lot,
But the world don't need scholars as much as I thought.

Maybe I'll go traveling for a year,
Finding myself, or start a career.
I could work with the poor, though I'm hungry for fame.
We all seem so different, but we're just the same.

Maybe I'll go to the gym, so I don't get fat.
Aren't things more easy with a tight six-pack?
