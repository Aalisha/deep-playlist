Stop and go on an empty crossing
The lights keep changing to only their hum
And standing in line along the kerb
The bin bags wait till the morning comes

You hear yourself walk echo lonely
See shadows move in every door
Are you sure that's your own footsteps behind?
Is there really nothing to turn round for?

And you feel that you're always gonna walk
The city streets all on your own
The night is dark as a car crawls by
And the road goes on and on
...
