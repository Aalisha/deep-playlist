Everything's cool yeah
It's all gonna be okay yeah
And I know
Maybe I'll even laugh about it someday
But not today no
'Cuz I don't feel so good
I'm tangled inside
My heart is on my sleeve
Tomorrow is a mystery to me

And it might be wonderful
It might be magical
It might be everything I've waited for
A miracle
Oh but even if I fall in love again
With someone new
It could never be the way
I loved you
