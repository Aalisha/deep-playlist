OMG, did you hear I'm dating a Jonas Brother
It's SOO hot!
That didn't work you shoulda known better
It's gonna suck when the camera stops rolling
And you find out soon
That the treatment wasn't worth it
They're all the same, they all want the money
They're all insane, they live for fame, honey
They laugh at you when you're not even bein' funny
Well I've been
Here before
And I've seen
First hand and front row seat
This little thing they call
A video girl (girl, girl)
Video girl who rocked my world
For a whole two seconds
And now I know
I'm not about to be another victim
Of the video girl syndrome
Get out of my face
Get out of my space
