Don't wanna push no narcotic revolution
don't wanna push you down Dead End Street
don't like to see you run around in circles
don't wanna turn you into a piece of concrete

get down to the real thing
get down to what you honestly feel
you better do it from the heart
don't you do it from the head
you better do it from the heart

Hate to see you fade away
