Tieng my own noose, digging my own grave
They told me to do it before it is too late
Pale faces in the night told me the truth about life
They told me facts that I could not deny

Picking flowers for my own funeral
Building the coffin to sleep in
Sharpening the blade to slash my own throat
Loading the gun to blow my head off

Twisted faces in (my dream)
Screaming out their (hatred)
Ill-being (inside me)
