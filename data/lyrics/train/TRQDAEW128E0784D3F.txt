Let me paint the picture

I was up in the club with the homies (with the homies)
More shawtys, more hittas
Then I saw a pretty girl lookin' lonely (lookin' lonely)
You must be from other (?) cause I never seen you around
And I think I remember a pretty face when I see it, oh

Let me buy you a drink

One and a two
Two and a three
Three and a four
Four and I don't think you can take much more

It's my cute awalk home and go to sleep
She look me in the eye

And I swear that she can ring my mind
She take me 'bout here
I swear to gotta go

Cause when you ever mind
She say "Hell no", and now she say...
Mercy mercy baby

Can you take me home
...
