CHAPTER ONE

Check the vertical damages
We'll wrap you up in bandages, for real
My heart is made of flesh
My tongue of steel
irradicating the nervous system
spinal cord retraction
head lock
we flowin' rugged and nappy like jamaican dreadlocks
eclectic episodes
these cat's is maulin' on blocks
and i'll have you spinnin' like a dozen of beers crawlin' on rocks
and ya state of self corrodes, it's like i told you before
you can't walk through the profits without livin' the raw
knockin' on doors
sometimes i had to sleep on the floor
with nothin but steady oxygen and spit flows for dinner
we'd be burnin in the summer
freezin in the winter
we'd be rockin' the latest flip flops to avoid the wooden splinters
from the depths of the grimy earth until i reach the heavenly borders
from the depths of the grimy earth like four dogs without water
and yo i peeped it from the get
i saw them coming through peripheral lenses
military action for my defenses
take ya chances with these dogs and this fortified gate
and if you think ya rhymes are phat you better gain some weight.

CHAPTER TWO

sleep in my wounds
crawl through
attend to the hives
