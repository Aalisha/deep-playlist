Uh-huh, yo let me get some of that man
Look, I think I can fuck something
I'm tryin' to find out what's up with you
See, for real
What-what

(Chorus)
Seem like a thug to me
You know I like what I see
Can you see yourself creepin' with a girl like me
I like it rough on the hush so nobody won't see
(Repeat)

(Verse 1)
You say you like it thuggish
I'm as thug as it gets
I see you checkin' me out when I pull up with the clique
I seen the others but I'm like yo what's up with this chick
Sized you up by the slightest? touchin' yo hips
See that's my big brother yep I learned the game from him
So whatever I give to you look the same to yo friend
