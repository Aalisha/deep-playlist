One or the other
One or the other
One or the other
If it's gonna be her, you gotta set me free

If you think you're gonna have the time
To make up your mind, you shouldn't even try
I'm tired of hearing all of your lines
Just tell me that you're mine

You know I'm better than she'll ever be
It's very clear to me, no more
I'll let you mess with me
But baby can't you see

You can only have one or the other
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me?
You can only have one or the other
If it's gonna be her, you gotta set me free

You can only have one or the other
Is it gonna be her or is it gonna be me?
You can only have one or the other
If it's gonna be her, you gotta set me free

Let me tell you that it hurts so bad
When you're the last to know, my friends told me so
My heart was always just for you
But now you want her too
