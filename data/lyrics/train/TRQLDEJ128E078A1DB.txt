No I don't lack ambition can't you see what I hate?
That it's you who is sinking locked behind iron gates
You should know you're falling into fiction
I can tell you're on some foolish mission

And you're black eyed soul you should know
That there's nowhere else to go
My black eyed boy you will find
Your own space and time

You call me superstitious tie me up with your deceit
I could never be malicious though I seem so bittersweet
You should know you're falling into fiction
I can tell you're on some foolish mission
...
