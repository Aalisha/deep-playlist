Would you like to know a secret?
It's just between you and me
I don't know where I'm going next
I don't know where I'm gonna be
But that's the other side to this life
I've been leading
But that's the other side of this life
Well, my whole world's in an uproar
My own world's upside down
I don't know where I'm going
But I'm always bumming around
And that's another side to this life
...
