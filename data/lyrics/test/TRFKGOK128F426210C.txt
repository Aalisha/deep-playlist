Over and over
Again and again
Keep my head down
It's my friend
Other wonders, I can't explain
As I fall into this life again

When it's over
In the end
My head's all empty
It's my friend
Withered under slated rain
As I fall into this life again

Prayin', I just can't get enough so I keep on
Prayin', I just can't get it up, so I keep on
Prayin', I just can't get enough so I keep on
...
