As your eyes start to bleed, you realize it's too late
And as your sky starts to fall, you realize you're standing alone

The time has come for this to bleed
The opening of what you've always known is growing near

All you've feared here
Looks you in the eyes
We all fall down

Skies are falling tonight
As you run and hide
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust

The wrath of your hate has returned
...
