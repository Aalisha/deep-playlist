Staring down the boulevard
Crescent heights the city lights the way
To another wasted day

Shiny cars and shooting stars
California dreaming in my ear
I just wish that you were here

I'm dealing with scars
Just trying to see who we are

Nobody said it would be easy
Fighting your way through another day
I think I know how you feel

You're looking for something that matters
Keeping it together when it's all been shattered
We all want something real

Summer's on a holiday
Pills to chase the blues away
