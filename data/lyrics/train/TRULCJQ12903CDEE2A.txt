She ain't got no money
Her clothes are kinda funny
Her hair is kinda wild and free

Oh but love grows
Where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

She talks kinda lazy
And people say she, she's crazy
And her life's a mystery

Oh but love grows
Where my Rosemary goes
And nobody knows like me

There's something about
Her hand holding mine
It's a feeling that's fine
