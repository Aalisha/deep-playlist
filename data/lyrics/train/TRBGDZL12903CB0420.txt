Every day you're working like a slave
Sweating buckets hoping that you get it right
Will it be as tough tomorrow
Have to wait and see
Life shows no mercy
Every day your love is getting warmer
Just look at her and love her did you get it right
Will she soothe your brow with kisses
Only meant for thee
She'll show no mercy
She'll show no mercy
...
