[Verse 1:]
Is This Is A Dream?
Is My Car This Mean?
Am I Imagining Things?
Diamond In The Back
Of My Cadillac
If This Aint A Fact (Oh No)
Don't Wait On Me (Oh No)
Who's This Girl?
And Who's This Girl?
Together Like Plural (Oh No, Oh No)
Say You Wanna Ride With This Super Fly
How Can I Decline I Can't (No Way)
If This Is Dreaming I Don't Want To Be
In Reality, No I Don't
I Must Be High On Someone's On Supply
'cause My Mind Is Tripping
Or Am I Pimping
