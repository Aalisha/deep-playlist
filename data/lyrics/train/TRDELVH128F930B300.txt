If I had a nickel, I know what I would do,
I'd spend it all for candy and I'd give it all to you.
I'd spend it all for candy and give it all to you.
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby.
That's how much I love you, baby.
If you were a picture, I'd hang you up on the wall,
Sit back where I could see you and I'd never move at all.
Sit back where I could see you, never move at all.
'Cause that's how much I love you, baby.
That's how much I love you, baby.
