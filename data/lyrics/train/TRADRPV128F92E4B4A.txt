She says she loves me more than I do
And she says she's sorry
She promised me everything too
She tells me not to worry

But listen baby, make up your mind
Or both of us you will lose
Listen baby, we got to find out
Which one of us you will choose

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste mine

Take your time if you want
But don't take mine
Waste your life if you want
But don't waste mine
...
