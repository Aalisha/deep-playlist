Now, this tune here should be easy for you to deal with
All you gotta do is, is remember back home, you know what I mean
When you was sitting out behind the house
Or practicing on your old guit fiddle

Tryin' to get things together
And you couldn't make in up your mind
You kinda half-way knew what you wanted to do
But, but you didn't have it all together, you know

But you didn't know you wanted to travel
Ain't that right!
Yeah, I remember them days real good
I know

Didn't have really many clothes
I didn't know nobody to call, to sing for you
So you had to get out there in no time
You know, so

You don't make no tiffanies, you say, "I'm goin'
