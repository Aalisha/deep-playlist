Ride your pony
Get on your pony and ride
All righty

Ride your pony
Get on your pony and ride
Oh, you're riding high
Now stay in the saddle

(We're gonna ride)
Way out West where
The grass is green (ride)
California, you know what I mean

(Ride) New York City
And a Detroit too (ride)
On to New Orleans
The home of the blues

Ride your pony
Get on your pony and ride
All righty

Ride your pony
Get on your pony and ride
...
