So put a spanner in the works,
Of your mind,
It's easier to work,
But I don't mind,
You're better in defeat so,
Just don't try
To take away all the things
I'll do in my life.

I have to break down all
The corners of the world.
Don't heed this praise on me,
I know I don't deserve it.
But what's so this I see?
Yeah you're leaving right beside me,
And I miss you, and I need you.
I do.

But don't go, take my love,
...
