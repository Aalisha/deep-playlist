I'm merely standing on holes in the ground
If I fall over, they'll never know I'm found
I may leave, but I'll never go back there
I'm only stumbling on the things that I air

Like those days on the porch of your house
Tell you wrapped in the clothes of herÂ ?

All those times you sent my brother down your road
Holding on to the dope that you sold
I knew then that we could never be blessed
I know it this way and I know what I confess
