I'm a teenage Jesus superstar
Without a mighty cross to bear
And when Mom complains about my hair
I say, "Hey, Mom I just don't care"

I'm in Hell and the angels cry
'Cause I'm trying to sell my soul
And when Mom complains about my clothes
I say, "Hey Mom, leave me alone"

Come on little girl, it's gonna be alright
