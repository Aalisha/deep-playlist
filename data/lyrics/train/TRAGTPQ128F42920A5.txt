The stormy winds
and the raging seas
the driving rain
it lashes my face
it breaks all my bones
and burns my skin
and delivers me to this place

You bind up my wounds
with your healing hands
you wisper sweet words
all in the dark
you raise me up
and you calm me down
you're starting the storm in my heart

A storm in my heart
a storm in my heart
you're starting the storm in my heart

The ghosts are there
...
