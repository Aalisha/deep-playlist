Late at night when I'm all alone
I think of you and I'm feelin strong
I'm Wishin you would just look my way
Let me be the one
My heart is achin for that special girl
To come on in and to share my world
Someone to love and someone to hold
Let me be the one
I Love You

Chorus 1:
I need you girl and I need you now
I'll get you lookin at me somehow
