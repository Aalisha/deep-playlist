(S. MacKinnon/M. Johnson)

I'm going 'round the bend like it'll never end, here I go again
I'm going round and around; you know I'm losing ground
Just keeping on and on

There's a light up ahead, it's burning bright in my head
Time moves fast once you leave your bed
(Like a streetlight on an empty road)

You know I can't see the shine in the silver lining no more
It seems we aint got the time to make the rhythm rhyme
Just keeping on and on
...
