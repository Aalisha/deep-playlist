Say it's not the end
I try to make amends
I say that we can take our chance
I'm dying since you went away

Pain, I've had my share (I've really had my share)
Waiting for you in vain (I've been waiting for you)
But now, I found myself
I've got to break my chains

No more tears to cry
Hope will free my mind

I can't understand
Why you want this to end
I know i got to take a stand
