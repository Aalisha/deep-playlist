This old town is filled with sin it'll swallow you in
If you've got some money to burn
Take it home right away, you've got three years to pay
But Satan is waiting his turn

This old earthquake's gonna leave me in the poorhouse
It seems like this whole town's insane
On the thirty-first floor a gold-plated door
Won't keep out the Lord's burning rain

The scientists say it'll all wash away
...
