You can run and you can begin'
In a place where you don't fit in
Love will find a way ...yeah

When you're down, you can start again
Turn around everything you're in
Love will find a place yeah

If you got one heart you are followin'
One dream that keeps you wandering
Love lights your way through the night
One wish that keeps you tryin'
WhatÂ´s your silver lining
Loves lights your way through the night
