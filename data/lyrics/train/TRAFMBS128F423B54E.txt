If you were meant to be together
Then you would know that it's right
After all this time, you'd be by his side
And if it were meant to be forever
You'd still be living in that dream
So it seems
So for all the times you cried
And the many times he lied
I'll tell you 'cause I know
You can make it on your own
So your heart belongs to you now
