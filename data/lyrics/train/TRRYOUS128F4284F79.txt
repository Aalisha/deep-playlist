My life is extraordinary bare
i fought the fear and chased the pain
like nerd in my brain
my life doesn't need to be explained
just swerve in the lane
i chose to walk the line as one
like a jungle cat on the run
sometimes i live upon my island
cut off from emotion and its brain
(ad libs) ohh, yuhyuh that's when i'm tempted by the waters
the waters that i can take me far away
(ad libs) oh yah yah oh yah yah
So i'll just keep on walking down this open road
and before you know it, i'll score a goal
hoping someone somewhere sees me
like thierry my boy henry or
perhaps like a giant bumble bee
so i'll just keep on walking down this open road
talking to the man who knows me
like a fire bee
yes he knows me, the man is me
