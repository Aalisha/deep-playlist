Shut up and sleep with me
Come on why don't you sleep with me
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on uh huh and sleep with me
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on why don't you sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on uh huh and sleep with me
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on why don't you sleep with me
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on uh huh and sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on why don't you sleep with me
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on uh huh and sleep with me
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on why don't you sleep with me

Shut up and sleep with me
Come on uh huh and sleep with me
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on why don't you sleep with me
Shut up and sleep with me
Come on uh huh and sleep with me

I love your body
Not so much I like your mind
In fact, you're boring
Pretend not being of my kind
