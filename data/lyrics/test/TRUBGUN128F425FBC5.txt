Girl, you thought you found the answer on that magic
carpet ride last night
But when you wake up in the mornin' the world still gets you uptight
Well, here's nothin' that you ain't tried To fill the emptiness inside
But when you come back down, girl
Still ain't feelin' right

(And don't it seem like)
Kicks just keep gettin' harder to find
(Oh, you don't need kicks, girl)
And all your kicks ain't bringin' you peace of mind
(You just need help, girl)
Before you find out it's too late, girl
You better get straight

No, but not with kicks
You just need help, girl
...
