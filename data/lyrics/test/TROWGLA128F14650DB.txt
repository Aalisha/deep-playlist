I've been thinking about it lately, tired of being at home
Waiting as I watch the world go by
Are you thinking about me to boy or am I all alone
Better answer soon there's no more tears to cry
Wont you live my life completely and I'm willing to fight so please hear me

Chorus
You're my earth and you're my sun
But you don't know what you've done
You're my moon and you're my night
But you still hold her tight
And I don't know how we got here
But I really want to go
