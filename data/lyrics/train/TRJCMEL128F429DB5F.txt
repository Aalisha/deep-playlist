it's 11 o'clock and the last time that we talked
he said he's busy and he'd call me but he never called me back (no)
and now i feel like somethings going on
but i feel crazy every time i bring it up so i don't
he told me there's no one above me
and all my friends are telling me different and something seems funny

tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
I can still hear voices in my head like

[Justin Timberlake]
I'm tryna tell you little sister
he's running around on ya
like some Casanova lover
at the expense of your heart
you need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
you need to find another
coz he's playing a part

[Esmee Denters]
why didn't I see it from the start
how was I to know
it would bruise my heart
so fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
like a wave you took me under now it's so hard to breath

[Esmee Denters] (Justin Timberlake)
and I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
