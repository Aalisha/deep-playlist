I envy the wind 
That whispers in your ear 
That howls through the winter 
That freezes your fingers 
That moves through your hair 
And cracks your lips 
And chills you to the bone 
I envy the wind 
I envy the wind 
That whispers in your ear 
That howls through the winter 
That freezes your fingers 
That moves through your hair 
And cracks your lips 
And chills you to the bone 
I envy the wind 
I envy the rain
