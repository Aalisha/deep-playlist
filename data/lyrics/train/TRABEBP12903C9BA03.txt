God damn, holy diver
You made it right back to my bed
Manifested lips that whisper kiss
That whisper kiss

Hey, Hey, Hey [x8]

Pull the shades
I'm gutted
Guilty, plagued
And lonely

I admit you wont see me again
My end is desperately engaged
Dark, departed, hollow
You see I'm just a shadow
This ravenous beast is chasing shame
A shadow he remains
