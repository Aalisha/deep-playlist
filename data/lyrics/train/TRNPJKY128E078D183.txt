I hear something in the sounds that surround me
That only seems to remind me
That I'm lost and longing for a different place and time

I wanna be walking down the avenue
Tall buildings staring down on me and you
But all I have is pictures running through my mind

Sunlight dying
People rushing madly all around
Sirens crying
Gotta grab the next thing back to our town
Before the whole thing crumbles to the ground

Do you remember the promise I gave you?
The one I swore I would hold to
You're there, I'm here and everything I said was wrong

So we're not out with the crowd nights
Not walking under the bright lights
All I can do is dream about it all night long
