Behind the black forest
Centre of the rotten field
There's a forgotten evil grave
Concealing enormous evilness

The bones have changed to dust
A coffin there never was
The tombstone is knocked down
God made this all properly

Six feet under lies the corpse
Flesh was simmered, only skeleton was left
...
