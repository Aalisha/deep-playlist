Two thousand
Nextasy
Two Gs

Remember when the first day, when I met you
I looked in your eyes that's when I truly knew
Could not say a thing, 'cause I felt the same
I didn't even know your name but I had already claimed

You were so nexcellent, magnificent, so eloquent
You must have been heaven sent
You were so marvelous, so damn mysterious
Got me delirious, make me wanna get serious

So turn off the lights, oh

'Cause right then I knew it was on
I knew it was on
'Cause when we kiss
Oh, it was on, it was on, it was on

We fell so deep in love
We fell in love with one kiss
And when we touched
Baby, baby

Oh, we were makin' love
Makin' love, makin' love
Until the break of dawn
We fell in love with one kiss

We fell in love with one kiss
We fell in love with just one kiss
