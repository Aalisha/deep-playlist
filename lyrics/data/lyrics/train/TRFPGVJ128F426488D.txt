Ooh ooh
Ooh Yeah

More than money
More than anything I need
Oh no
More than silver rengles
Into every room my dreams you go

Don't be hard on yourself
The way you love me like nobody else
And that's enough

That's enough

Could have been moon light
Could have been music
Could have been the summer night
Could be a news van
Could have been a crazy love on a Paris street
You're all that I need
You touched the woman in me

You touched the woman in me

There were moments
When I never thought I feel the same
