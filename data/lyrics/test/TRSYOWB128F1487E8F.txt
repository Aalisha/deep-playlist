Hey Mr. Big shot
Wanna take it out to the parking lot?
Hey Mr. No Show
Come on out now bring out that ego

Don't think we won't get to the bottom of this

Say whatever you want to
Lookin' on the bright side
Actin' like you're alright
Oh No, this won't be the last time
Say it like you mean it
'Cause you're never going to get it
