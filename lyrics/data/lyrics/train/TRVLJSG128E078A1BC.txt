Somebody told me it was over
Nobody told me where it began
No one believes in you
I understand

Like a blind man
Who's lost his way
No one hears a word
Of what you say
I forgive you
Would you do the same

I would believe you
If only you'd be true
I would believe if it were true

Cause everybody wants to be a winner
Nobody wants to lose their game
It's the same for me
It's the same for you
...
