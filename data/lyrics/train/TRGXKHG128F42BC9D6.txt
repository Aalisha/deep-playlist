(Keith Stegall/Carson Chamberlain)

I called my doctor on the telephone
Help me Doc there's something wrong
I can't shake it it's gone too far
He said tell me what your symptoms are

I said my hands are sweaty and my knees are weak
I can't eat and I can't sleep
It's turning me every way but loose
He said it sounds like love's got a hold on you
No doubt love's got a hold on you
