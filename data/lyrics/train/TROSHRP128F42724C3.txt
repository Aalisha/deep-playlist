You and me, we can make it last
You and me must forget the past
You and me, we can build
A brand new life together, oh

I know your heart has been broken
In pieces, pieces and pieces before
Baby and you swore to never, never
Never love another man, another man anymore

Baby, don't blame me for the things that he did
That he did to make you feel this way
Can you find it in your heart
Baby, please, baby, please, oh, put your trust in me

It may seem hard sometimes
But we can make it through
I'm counting on you
