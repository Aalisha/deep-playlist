Tell me a secret
I hope you can keep it
I hope you can keep my secret close
Don't tell a soul
They'll tell a soul
I've been waiting just to say this
I've been waiting to let this out
I know she sees this
I can see it in her eyes no doubt
She makes her way downtown
She makes her way downtown

All I ever wanted was something real
All I ever wanted
All I wanted was something real
Just so I could feel

Tell me
Don't you know what I think about at night?
I'll tell you something
I'll tell you something
I think of you
