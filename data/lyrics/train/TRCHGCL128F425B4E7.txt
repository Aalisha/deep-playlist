And I've been thinking 'bout it all that time
Going over in my head
And it's all useless
Well, it's been years since I've seen home
There'll be plenty time when I'm dead
And it's all useless

There's a lot swimming 'round
Swimming 'round in my head
And it's all such a mess
There's a lot to be done
Now I lay me down to become
And it's all such a mess

So give up - this ain't what you dream of
We'll take it slow
And even if you're never home
Even if so
