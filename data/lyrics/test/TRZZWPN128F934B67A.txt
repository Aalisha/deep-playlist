Many lessons learned
Take this with everything you've got
Think twice to change your mind
Breathe in and open up your eyes

Revelation is what you've got to fear when time takes over
Revelation and we'll end up with the lord

Feels like a break through it stays here for a while
The second everything moves on
Don't make me stare at the sun to long
Hope will go blind we'll be around to stay
