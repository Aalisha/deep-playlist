Christmas, Christmas, Christmas

Well, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground
(Christmas, Christmas)
Well, it's Christmas time pretty baby
And the snow is on the ground
(Christmas, Christmas)
Well, you be a real good little baby
Santa Claus is back in town

I got no sleigh with reindeer
No sack on my back
You're gonna see me comin'
