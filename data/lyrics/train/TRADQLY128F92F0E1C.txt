Fivefold angles of Degrees
72 in number binding within
Inverted chaos
As spears impale wings

Shattered wholes, scattered remains
Corporeal ruin enstitched
Remnant altar
Worship made weapon in triptych

Occult machinery invoking
Warsouls bound to the penetrated inverse
Graven sigillum heralding flight
The path of Detonation
