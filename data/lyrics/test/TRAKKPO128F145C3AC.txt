[sintax]
hebron hill sighed with heavy heart, the night to set aside
shepherds stargazing, turning pages in the sky
planets paraphrasing, speak the language of the cosmos
laying flat upon their back to feel the black engulf the globe
stuff of prophets' prose published in the firmament
got tagged with fatty marker just to make his message permanent
palestine wind blows promising her billows
west bank blanket shelter shepherds in her meadows
from the sandal to the shelltoe, velcro to fat-laces
man has walked a million paces but he still can't find the road
but one night the light flash of angel flight was cast
illuminate the plan, the lamb would shepherd man at last
from the now until the everlast, i want to be god's servant
like that virgin riding bareback on a pharaoh beast of burden
from capernaum to bethlehem to ad infinitum
yo, i write em in the wind so my children can recite em.

hook:
so poetic, expressing the styles, shooting the gift
uplift, tear down, bare down in ziontif-expression
