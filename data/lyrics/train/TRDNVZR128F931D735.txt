Keep this on your mind
Keep it within your eyelids
Keep this on your mind
Keep it within your eyelids

We have ascended countless stairs
Perhaps it has interrupted our thoughts
Regret is an inception, regret is a beginning

Miles and miles of wires build the apparatus
But don't mistake power lines for shelter
I forgot and it will more than likely happen again, happen again
More than likely happen again
