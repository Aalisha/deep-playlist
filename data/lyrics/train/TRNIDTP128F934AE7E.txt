Color distorts logic
Envolkes hatred
Dividing man
Religion a tool of war
Thou shall not kill
Except for me

Politicians
Behind their jovial faces
Making secret deals
In secret places
Money changes hands
Life is never spared
The weak are opressed
The leader turn away
The kids are being sold
The game is called control
The homeless are a problem
Crime is the answer
