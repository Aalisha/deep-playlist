Baby, I'll tell you why
I’m so in love with you
Baby, I’ll tell you why
I’m so much in love with you
Of all the girls I know
You are number one
And believe me I ain’t lyin’
Of all the girls I like
And all the girls I’ve had
Only you bewitch my mind

I swear by the stars above
My everlasting love
I will never hurt you
I wouldn’t dare deceive you

My first affair
My first affair
