Carpe diem...
Seize the day before your life fades away.
Reach for the skies - for the distant sun
and keep on hiding from the gun.

No! You need to sell your soul
for it's great to lose control.
Can't you feel that growing desire
to go down with the blazing fire?

You need to burn and reach to the point of no return.

- Waste no time dreaming in vain!
You and I aren't built to last
...
