End of the night, all I see are lights
Sweat and smoke mixed with absinth
This is what I always seek
When the demons
Blurs in neon
Life begins just before the race

Ghosts
We can never be like you
Our day has passed
It can never be day again

Ghosts
We don't want to be like you
We are fashion slaves
Driving in the wrong lane

Dreary eyes, even sleepy still
...
