To some, I am a blessing, to others, I'm a curse
I'm a writer, not a fighter, I'm a person, not a purse
I may be just an easy touch and taken for much more
But I just came to leave a little loving at your door

Ooh, show me some affection
Ooh, give me some direction
Ooh, know you're my connection

Just a jet-age gypsy looking for a gypsy queen
...
