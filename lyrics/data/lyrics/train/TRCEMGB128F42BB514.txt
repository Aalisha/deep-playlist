No more upset mornings
No more tired evenings
This American dream
I am disbelieving

When the gas in my tank
Feels like money in the bank
Gonna blow it all this time
Take me one last ride

For the lights of this city
They only look good when I'm speeding
I wanna leave 'em all behind me
'Cause this time I'm gone

Long gone
...
