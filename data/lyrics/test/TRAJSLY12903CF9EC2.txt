What a miracle is life
the fields are high and fruit is ripe
so hold out your hands
yeah, hold out your hands
And you're the same as me
you breathe the air I breathe
and we don't understand
yeah, we don't understand

And if you don't ask questions
you won't know why
so say a prayer for the dying
while there's still time. So

Pray for good and pray for love
...
