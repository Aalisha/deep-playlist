Cats are cryin', gates are slammin'
The wind is howlin' 'round the house tonight
I'm as lonely as a boat out on the sea
When the night is black and the tide is high
Oh, on nights like these, feel like fallin' to my knees
Feel like callin' heaven please

Find my love
Find my love
Find my love
Find my love

Well I turn the dial on my radio trying to find an all night station
I want to hear a song I know, song about my situation
Oh oh, on nights like these, feel like fallin' to my knees
Feel like callin' heaven please

Find my love
Find my love
Find my love
