Man's inhumanity towards man
Stop them when they first began
Tell them this road's to die on
It's nowhere land
They're never supposed to reach
Or be kindly received
They're just dropped to their knees
In a nowhere land

And in the orphanage
They run for their beds
They run from the man in the building
And the allies just watch
...
