What the fuck is this world?
Running to, you didn't
Leave a message, at least I
Could have heard your voice one last time
Daily minefield, this could
Be my time by you
Would you hit me?
Would you hit me?

Oh
Oh, ow

All the bills go by, and
Initiatives are taken up
By the middle
There ain't gonna be any middle any more
And the cross I'm bearing home
...
