Your cruel device
your blood like ice
one look could kill
my pain, your thrill

I wanna love you, but I better not touch
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison.
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison...
I don't wanna break these chains.

Your mouth so hot
your web, I'm caught
your skin, so wet
black lace, on sweat
...
