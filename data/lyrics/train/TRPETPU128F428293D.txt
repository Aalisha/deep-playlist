Baby watch your back (x4)

I watched you come and go and never noticed
like daily papers, faces, knick-knacks
But now I've seen you
And you are my focus
Baby watch your back
I went my days and nights
Not knowing of you
But now you fill my every minute
And I can't stop myself for my thoughts
Of you are infinite

I watch you
You hate me
