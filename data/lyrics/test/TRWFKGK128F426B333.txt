Seed of doubt
It exists
And it grows
A glimpse of life from somewhere deep within
Awake and understand

Is there anyone else here, somebody's screaming
Please help me
Let's find out now that I am not dreaming
Welcome to my damnation
Here it comes, the real me

I didn't know, I couldn't hear the answer
My mind was blank, I should've known
Hold it back but somehow
There is someone else
Another stranger me
Another stranger me
That's when the ice will break away

I can't get out of here anymore
