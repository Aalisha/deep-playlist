I never got that particular feeling
I’m doing better now than how I’ve been
Then again I never really ever get anything right

I‘ve got a scab that I can’t stop picking
Things that I though I’d forgotten
Things that I thought got better over night
So what’s shaking, a complication

I though by now I’d be 5’11”
I’d be hanging out with the top banana
Executive access to upper classes
Run and get me some of them big sunglasses

Better gather up what I left for dead
All the pieces needed in a level head
All the information that I’ve taken down all on my own
