[Halford]

Congress shall make no law
Respecting an establishment of religion
Or prohibiting the free exercice thereof
Or abridging the freedom of speech
Or of the press
Or of the right of the people peacefully to assemble
And to petition the government for a re-dress of grievances

Revoke this verbal mental muzzle
Protect the freedom of the mind
Speak out against the prejudicial
Extinguish ignorance by mouth

War of words
