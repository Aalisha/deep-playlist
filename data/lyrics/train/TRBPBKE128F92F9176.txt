Now it's day and I've been trying to get that taste off my tongue.
I was dreaming of just you, now our cereal, it is warm.
Attractive day in the rubble of the night from before.
I can't walk in a vacuum, I feel ugly, feel my pores.
It's the trees of this day that I do battle with for the light.
Then I start to feel tragic, people greet me, I'm polite.
"What's the day?" "What are you doing?"
"How's Your Mood?" "How's that song?"
Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone.
I can't lift you up cause my mind is tired.
It's family beaches that I desire.
A sacred night, where we'll watch the fireworks.
