From within genetic memory
A hunger arises
To master all skills
To wield unlimited power

Dreams are blown away like autumn leaves
Rain will keep on falling when I'm gone

To leave a mark and make it last
Explore every way to excel
Nothing will stand in the way of perfection
Leave natural weakness behind

Greatness comes with great pain
Sound of reason must be silenced
One man can't change evolution
...
