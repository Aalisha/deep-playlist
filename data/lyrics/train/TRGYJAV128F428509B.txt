Maybe we'll never be seen together
At night on a crowded street
I may never reach across your body
And kill the light when you're asleep

Maybe I'll never watch you dressing
Or sound too familiar on the phone
But I can touch your hand that's against me
And take that moment home

That's as close as I'll get to loving you
...
