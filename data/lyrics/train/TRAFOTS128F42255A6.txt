Early in the evening
just about supper time,
over by the court house
they're starting to unwind.

Four kids on the corner,
trying to bring you up.
Willy picks a tune out,

Down On The Corner
out in the street.
Willy and the poor boys are playing
bring a nickel

Rooster hits the washboard
and people just got smile,
Blinky thumps the gut bass,
and solos for a while.
Poor boy twangs the rhythm out
on his Kalamazoo
Willy goes into a dance
