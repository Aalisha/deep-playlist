(Johnny Wright - Jack Anglin - Jim Anglin)
Red Foley & Kitty Wells

One by one we've broke each vow we made
It was you who lied, it was me who paid
As sure as there's a heaven beyond the sun
We'll pay for our lies one by one.

My plans and hopes have tumbled down
My castle of dreams plunged to the ground
How can you face me after what you've done
...
