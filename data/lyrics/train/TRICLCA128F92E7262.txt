Tell me baby in the night do you think of me?
(When you open up your eyes am I there?)
Are you standing by my window when I'm asleep
(Why you quiet when you know that I'm near?)

You know I love you
You thought I would leave you
But baby I've got you still
You think you want to be by yourself don't you?
But baby you never will

If this is love
Then I don't wanna know what isn't
I won't say another word
If this is love
Then I'm about to hit on this
Were both going to get hurt if this is love
(If this is love, yeah)
