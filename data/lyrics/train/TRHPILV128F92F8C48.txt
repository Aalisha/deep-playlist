The forefront of the blackest lie is upon us
A vile agenda to rid this world of the humble and pure
Where disease has every right to infect
Where scum is placed on the highest of thrones

Human rights abandoned before a true meaning was given to it
For it is our misery that they relish in

Yet they are lost, brain dead
Mind control, time control,
Making them slaves

This age is coming to its end
Our destined future to end all futures

They advance further into global decimation each day... unknowing
...
