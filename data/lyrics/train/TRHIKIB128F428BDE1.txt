Hey…Hey…Hey

You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself

Girl, I'm a walking plane-crash to your moms and dads
Ostentations and crass pulling the gauze off your scabs
Bitch, I negate the myth of the ‘great black boyfriend'
In the Polaroid at the get-together
Wearing a corduroy vest-sweater
So Don't get that engagement ring engraved
Cuz before we met you thought that hoodrats laid eggs
And that rappers were just sky-pirates with peg legs
But I kick it with you simply for the shits and giggles, playful innuendos
You thought, "he's just an uber-dred for the federal fiscal cap"
But after brunch, you'll need
2 Sudafed's and a disco nap
After I drain your insides with a crazy straw
You ain't my baby-doll
"cuz nigga you reek of coffee-shop blend"
My baby's a lollypop that caters to the miss polyglot's whim"
With addictive agents that outweigh oxycodones
And our phobias perfectly fit
It takes a quirky chick with curvy hips to petrify this working-stiff

You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself
