I'm in a pool of black bile
It seems like every second
Is like a door that opens
To allow in
What has not yet happened

I'm not the sanguine type,
related to the blood
I think my head will fall off
If I don't stop it
From Turning around

I'm like a cat on a wire
Bï¿½lacing so carelessly
Unafraid and in expectancy
Of something good
And never seen

I won't be so pleased
The next day
Right now I can't
...
