Brand Nubian function
A junction of three
Collaboration in a style that's like funk
To slap palms, swing arms
Tap a soul
Cause no rock rolls down our hill
Yo black it's kinda ill
We don't roll no rocks we just fill

Heads with knowledge, pure foundation
Showing and proving through the manifestation
Of our name which is "Brand Nu"
Brand Nubian and we've come to

Make the people aware that black means first
400 years and we're made to feel cursed
But now it's our time to rule
Student of the old, teacher of the new school

My inspiration is the Five Percent Nation
As I cram, education was born
Like a thorn in your side I have sworn
Never to divide with Brand Nubian

You have to stand as a black man
Brand Nubian

From the Sudan plus I never ran
I'm from Africa, the central region
