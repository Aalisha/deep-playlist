This game seems to be the trend
You can say, you? ve won
The nightmare? s coming to an end
And I can see the sun

I know that? s you haunting me
Take what you want
I don? t owe you anything
Take what you want

I don? t owe you anything
I know, I? m not wrong
I know what you want from me
Take what you want

Truth will rear its ugly head
Now that the fight is on
Cruel and brutal words you said
Then you say, you? re done
