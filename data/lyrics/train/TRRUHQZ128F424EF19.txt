From the primordial soup
Out of the dim and the gloom we came
We are animals
By any other name

From the primordial soup
Out of the dim and the gloom we came
We are animals
One unbroken chain

I need to get you out of your cave, man
I need to let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

Out from under a rock
From a prehistoric sea, we crawl
We are animals
Animal, one and all

Out from under a rock
From the prehistoric sea we came
We are animals, animal
