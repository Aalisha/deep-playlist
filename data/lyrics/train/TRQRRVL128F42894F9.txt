Am I the snake inside your garden
The sugar in your tea
The knock upon your backdoor
The twist that turns your key
Am I the sweat you feel on your head
The shadow on your face
The tune inside your head that put you here in the first place
Well I don't want to be
I don't want to be
I don't want to be your sweet temptation
I don't want to be your new sensation
It's just a delicate distraction
With just a hint of satisfaction
Look me in the eye and let me know
If you can't love me that let me go
...
