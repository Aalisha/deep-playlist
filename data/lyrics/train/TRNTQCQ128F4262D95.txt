Yes, I live in a single wide
To get up here takes a 4 wheel drive
And a mean old dog whose name is Sic Âem Sam
Got a motor hangin' from a tree
Got a satellite dish and a trampoline
But that don't make me what they say I am.

Chorus:
'Cause there ain't no trash in my trailer
Though they might find an empty can of beer
There ain't been no trash in my trailer
Since the day I threw you out of here.
