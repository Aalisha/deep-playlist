Politician puppets a-preaching in high high place
Trying to hide the fear written on their faces
Facing a future
Liquidating hope
Freezing the fire
Your dreams go up in smoke

Carry the weight of this world
You're gonna do more harm than good
You're gonna lose yourself in responsibility

Don't blame your heart
Don't blame your soul
Don't blame your lack of self control
Lay the blame on me
Don't blame the sun
Don't blame the sky
Blame yourself and I'll ask why
Lay the blame on me
