Take your hand
And place it in my pocket
Flick your eyes back in their sockets
Put those thoughts away
Sometimes they're much to loud
I'll take a breath
And cradle your sweet head
Should've stayed at home in bed
Put that face away
I'm melting for you

I know, I get cold
Cos I can't leave things well alone
Understand I'm accident prone
Me, I get free
Every night the moon is mine

But when the morning comes
Don't say you love me
Don't say you need me
I really don't think that's fair
...
