Tonight was just great, she taught us the sign for peace
Now she's made us some popcorn, we've turned out the lights and we're watching movies
I don't understand and she tries to explain

She sits on her hair and she's tall as my dad
And she tie-dyed my shirt and she pierced her own ear
And it's peace, man, cool, yeah, the babysitter's here...

Her boyfriend is Tom, but we call him the king of romance
He wears an American flag on the butt of his ripped-up pants
And will they get married with kids of their own?

And he kisses her, oh...
