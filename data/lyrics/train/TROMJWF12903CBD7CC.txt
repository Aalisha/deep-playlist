If I could crawl into a shell
Then I would a mile away
Things are heavy enough already
And I really do think that's 
The best that I can do
Stuck here and all
And I really do think that
Don't care at all

Take a step forwards
Don't be afraid
Take a step backwards
Don't be afraid
So go on 
So look back
Stuck inside a heavy shell
Try to walk and not be pushed

And the man with no skin
I would not let him
Would not let him sign off
'Cause nobody wants to see
A beating heart 
...
