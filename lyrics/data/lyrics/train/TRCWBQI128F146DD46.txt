And the same when autumn comes
Cold air I breathe in my lungs
Something's new but nothing's changed
Familiar feelings just the same

Soon too the warm air comes by
Lie back and stare at blue skies
Thinking back away and from
When I'll be here and you'll be gone

Further, further
Further, further
Further, further from me

God's love will save our light and we'll come shining bright
...
