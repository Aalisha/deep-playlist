Throw the covers off my head, shake my body out of bed
Stretch my arms up and look out the window
Sun is rising, birds are singing
I am greeted by the gift of another new mornin'

And I know, tonight as my head hits the pillow

Did I tell my friends, how much they really mean to me
At the end of the day, did I really push myself
Or was I too afraid to give my heart away, at the end of the day
