Yay, though we venture through
The valley of the stars
You and all your jewelry
And my bleeding heart
Who couldn't be together
And who could not be apart

We should've jumped out
Of that airplane after all
Flying sky ways overhead
It wasn't hard to fall
And I had so many crashes
That I couldn't feel at all

And it feels like I'm seventeen again
Feels like I'm seventeen
...
