You're just trading heartbeats, baby
You're just changing the person between your sheets
You're just trading heartbeats, baby
That's fine with me

Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah yeah

Tell your friends not to speak until they're sober
They would slip as their inhibitions lower
My lips are sealed but you still speak in fiction
So keep telling your stories even though I'll never listen

I heard the bad news, I heard all about you
It's not what you did, it's just what you do

You're just trading heartbeats, baby
You're just changing the person between your sheets
You're just trading heartbeats, baby
That's fine with me
