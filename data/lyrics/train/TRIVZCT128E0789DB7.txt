Heat Up, Heat Up
Jet Le, Wiley, Breeze gonna eat the beat up
Scratchy's on the beat let us eat the beat up
Let's get the boys that are bout to heat up
Roll Deeper.
Jet one, Jet two, Jet three
Jus got a strap, people guarded by me
But hear i got a story to tell
See the life of leisure child, wonderin why things so foul
You can 1st one, and Im gonna get the next
Next one will give a stone cold supplex
I'ma top boy, who seen alot of cold things
Sha-Shoot-Shot-Sharp cold tings
We Roll Deep but we never judge though
Cuz we get that cheddar but the rings still slow
Backwards and forwards and left, right go
Jus let Wiley make you get your dou

Row Row Row ya boat gently down the stream
And if you don't want holes in ya boat
Don't Roll on the Roll Deep team
No No No You don't, you only Roll Deep in ya dreams
If that's what your tellin me you must be my enemy
You ain't heard the word on the streets

Well half this, half that there
But, nah Im not a mixed up breah
Hell No, not a half up here
They should know I fully run, don't care
But I got stuff to share
Got a noog shot for ya old dear
Empty the clip, I got a few shots spare
I shot the Sherriff but I don't shot gear
Call me chemical ali
Bust bare face, cop no bali
Cost contact, not to pali
Run around town, but you can't keep a tally
On me, and you know what i carry
