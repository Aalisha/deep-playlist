It's coming through the air
For all of us to hear
Could it be the sounds of liberation
Or just the image of detention

We want the airwaves back
We want the airwaves back
We don't just want airtime
We want all the time
All of the time

We want the airwaves back
We want the airwaves back
We don't just want transmission
We want
ow

What frequency are you getting
Is it noise or sweet sweet music
What frequency will liberation be
What frequency will liberation be

It's coming through the air
