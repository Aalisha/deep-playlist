Tonight I hold the one I love far from the one at home
I picked her up some time ago and I never feel alone
I held on tight too many years to ever set her free
And though she's not a lady she still means the world to me.

Chorus:
She's no lady but I love her, she's been known to be untrue
She's been knocked around and picked on, even dropped a time or two
She's been passed around at parties, sat on everybody's knees
This old guitar's changed hands a time or two but it still belongs to me.
It still belongs to me.
