Hey, hey hey
well yuh done know seh bad man nah watch nuh stripe
no matter the color or the type
from wah day mi some boy a move hype
But yuh know weh mi tell dem
Weh Frisco Kid tell them

When we bus wi things wi nuh run weh
Police nuh come deh
worse when mi under mi chalice
nuff radio car wi mek drive weh
helicopter fly weh
poor likkle Seargant Wallace

When we bus wi things wi nuh run weh
Sunday to Sunday
worse when mi under mi chalice
nuff radio car wi mek drive weh
all Easter Friday
poor likkle Seargant Wallace

Hey
A weh police a guh and dem nuh know bout di war
some likkle soldier boy with them old SLR
dem hear "raaarhhhh" and di whole a dem run guh far
guh hide underneath Mr. Ruddy ole car
Bad man in di street lay flat pon di tar
a lick it up and bus it like some ole movie star
