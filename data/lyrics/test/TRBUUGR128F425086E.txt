so when we're in the dark
you won't even look me in the eye
i got surprises girl that you won't really like
but under motorways and on scaffolding
shared all our big ideas
but if it's not the way s'not the way

she'll be gone by tomorrow nite
don't dare look her in the eye

when i found you it was yesterday
