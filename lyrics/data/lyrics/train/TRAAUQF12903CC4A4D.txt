The box sites on the bridge
The crowd is waiting
The chains are locked across my chest
There's no heart breaking

I've done this show a thousand times
This trick's so easy
As they lower me into your waters
There's no escaping

There's a secret passage out of here
But I don't want to reappear
I just want to stay with you in here

In Houdini's box
Close the lid
And tie the knot
...
