Scarlett lips, a silk embrace
But there's no laughter in her face
A crowded room is a lonely place full of lies

A wicked smile a shifting glance
The passion light you feel at last
Her pleasure somehow eased the pain
Too late to chance it all again

Before we kiss the world goodbye
It's only a breath away
One more dance before you die
So tender as the music plays

There's no emotion
Only passion in your crime
Killing the love that drives you out of your mind
When you dance with a stranger

A spinning room a cool caress
A try to hide my loneliness
...
