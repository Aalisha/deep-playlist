Hm - falling rain
Hm - falling rain
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain.

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
telling me just what a fool I've been.
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
and let me be alone again.

The only girl I cares about has gone away
looking for a brand new start
but little does she know that
when she left that day
along with her she took my heart.

Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
for her to steal my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my
heart's somewhere far away.

The only girl I cares about has gone away
looking for a brand new start
but little does she know that
when she left that day
...
