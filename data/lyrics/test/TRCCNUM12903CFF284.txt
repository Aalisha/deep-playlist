Hello, good morning from the top of the food chain
Your thoughts and calls are most important to me
You voted me in to bring back the good times
So just relax and leave it all to me

I'm walking the walk, I'm talking the talk
I'm kissing the creche, I'm pressing the flesh
I'm wearing the clothes, I powder my nose
I'm calling the shots, I'm liking it

God is my buddy and we talk all the time
