Look what jah jah gave me
New life, a brand new little baby
Look what jah jah gave me
New life, a brand new little baby
In my life, there is now so much more
New meaning, in this bundle of joy
This precious gift you've given me
I'll hold close to my heart
Now my life is so fulfilling
Look what jah jah gave me
New life, a brand new little baby
Look what jah jah gave me
