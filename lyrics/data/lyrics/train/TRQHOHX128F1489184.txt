I can see it in your eyes
And feel it your touch
I know that you're scared
But you've never been this loved

It's a long shot baby
Yeah I know it's true
But if anyone can make it
I'm betting on me and you

Just keep on moving into me
I know you're gonna see
The best is yet to come

But don't fear it now we're going all the way
...
