And the funeral screams the song that it sings
The memories feel what was everything
The sound rings loud from a sick shotgun
What can never be fought can never be won
It can never be won, it can never be won

So sooner or later, I gotta believe

That she's getting, that she's getting better
While my heart bleeds, while I can't forget her
That she's getting, that she's getting better
While I'm runnin' away in my burden of shame
...
