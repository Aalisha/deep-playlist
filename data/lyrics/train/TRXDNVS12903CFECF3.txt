Instruments of torture, of death and of pain
They're coming to take you away
Locked in a chamber, bound up in chains
Hid from the light of the day
Terrified victims screaming with fright
The walls made of stone now entomb
A glint of steel shines in the night
Confess or meet your doom

Blades begin to slice the flesh
Slowly bring you to your death
Ropes stretch at the skin and the bone
Cry out for help, but still all alone

Cries of torment echo from the grave
Satan laughs, your soul cannot be saved
Instruments of torture
