(Ohh) (Yeah yeah)

Admit it
We're finished
You don't want me no more
(No)
Like a night mare
I lived it
It was too big to ignore
(Ooh)
I hear the sounds
But they pass me by.
My hazard lights are flashing

Somebody, anyone -

Help cause it's an emergency.
Someone just wounded my heart.
So help
Its like a bad surgery
And now it's time to recharge.
I'm starting over
Taking
One, two, baby steps.
Three, four, baby steps.

Five, six, baby steps.
I'm starting over again.
