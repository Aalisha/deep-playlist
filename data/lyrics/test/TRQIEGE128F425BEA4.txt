Happiness, togetherness, lovingness, foreverness, its love I guess that's why I blessed with peacefulness
Happiness, togetherness, lovingness, foreverness, its love I guess that's why I blessed with peacefulness yeah

Folks tend to say when I'm not with you I'm sad they aren't aware of all the rough times and all the tough times that you and I shared while we stayed together through all thick and thin ill last til the end caring for you sharing with youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

(Chorus)
Happiness, togetherness, lovingness, foreverness, its love I guess that's why I blessed with peacefulness
Happiness, togetherness, lovingness, foreverness, its love I guess that's why I blessed with peacefulness yeah

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

As time passes by all of our worries just die we tend to wear a smile on our face that shows no disgrace for the love that we've had as we've managed to carry on through all thick and think our love will not end caring for you sharing with youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
