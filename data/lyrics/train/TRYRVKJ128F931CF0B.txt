Peace (peace)
No peace (no peace)
No friends coming back from Greece
No bombs to ensure there's a ceasefire cease
And no cascades
No savage detectives to evade
And you will never see the alligator's glade
Where Agamemnon drowned the violent night shade

Peace
No peace
No crystal cathedral to lease
No no dancing in the basement must immediately cease
By the order, by the order of the Grand Diocese

And the important event to behold (to behold)
Is when we purge the terror in your bones (terror in your bones)
