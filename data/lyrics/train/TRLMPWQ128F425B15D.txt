You're old enough to know well
The better things are all uphill
Bitter songs are never sung
In the highlands where you belong

In the smoke of cannons below
Men, they bury each other in rows
People come, people go
Work in numbers and leave alone

There's a light making it's way
On up the mountain night and day
And you'll get tired and you'll get weak
But you won't abandon your masterpiece

Off to sleep you'll go
...
