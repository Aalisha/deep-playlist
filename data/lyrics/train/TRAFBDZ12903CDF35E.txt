Selfdefense or murder of first degree.
Tell me who are you to pass judgement.
Raise my hand in anger,
a just cause, to pacify the aggressor at all cost.

So what is the law?
When all else fails, there's nothing left.

So what is the law?
When all else fails, there's nothing left.
Given a choice.
Stand back or suffer the consequences right now.
