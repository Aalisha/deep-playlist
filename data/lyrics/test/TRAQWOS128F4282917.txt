Babylon feel no way while I tell you of a story
But its a serious accusation of how you treat my daddy
I lay there in my bed didn't know that I was dreaming

Seh papa was no murderer
Daddy was no murderer
Papa was no murderer

I see the lights flashing down our place one night
So I get up turn on my bedroom light
