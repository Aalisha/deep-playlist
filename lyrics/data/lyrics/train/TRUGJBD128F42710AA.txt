Don? t you let the heat out of the oven lord
It takes awhile to build a fire
Don? t let? em cool you down
Don? t let? em cool you down
Cause it? s some hot cookin? that? s goin? on tonight
And the temperature is risin? just right
All I got to do is keep this fire burnin? bright
And I think I might
Cause if you put the fuel into the fire
And you start a chain reaction
Which is burning me
Tossin? turning me through the night
The temperature is risin? fine
