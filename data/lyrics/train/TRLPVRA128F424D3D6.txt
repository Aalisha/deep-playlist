Hails to the chancers
As boredom kills like cancer
We need dreams
For the romancers
And I'm looking to you

Well, the life's so lonely
I need my one and only
If you know love
Come on and show me
Now I'm looking to you

So come closer, come closer, come closer, come closer, come closer
My resistance is low
...
