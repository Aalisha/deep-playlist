Let's go... We've got work to do
Let's go... All you chosen few
With our words we will strike
Don't need you to set things right
No more... Media in control
No more... Lies, stats and polls
Reading trendy magazines
Lazy writer's fuckin' up the scene... No!

MOVE, MOVE, MOVE... Destruction of the underground
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE... You've got a voice why don't you write it down
MOVE TO PRESS, MOVE TO PRESS... For the truth
Don't let them dictate what's best for you
...
