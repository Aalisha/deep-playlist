Here comes that same old memory
Like a movie in my mind
You told me you loved another
And then you drove off through the pines
And I swear it feels like yesterday
Though it's been a long, long time
I can still feel those cold chills
Runnin' up and down my spine

And I've been fightin' back the memories
I've been fightin' back the tears
And I'm fightin' back the hurt I still feel
After all these years
If I had the strength I'd fight
To make things like they were before
But I'm just too tired to fight it anymore
