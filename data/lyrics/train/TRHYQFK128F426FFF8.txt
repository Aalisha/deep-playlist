They have slept for centuries
Rising to enthrone... the... abominations
Realm of decay, malignant stench slowly escapes
From the sufferance below

Mutilated servants of a truthless god... god...
Awaken they begin to thirst the blood
Of what is holy
And reclaim the throne... of a beheaded messiah...

Thrones of blood
...
