It doesn't matter
If you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference
If you're black or if you're white

All men are equal
Till the victory is won
No colour or religion
Ever stopped the bullet from a gun

Out in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out from the skies
A thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

It doesn't matter
If you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause
They want to fight
...
