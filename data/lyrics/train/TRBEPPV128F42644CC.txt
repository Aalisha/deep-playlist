Written by Al Anderson and Rivers Rutherford

I've tried Tequiila, tried Mary-Jane.
It got me no-where, it just drove me insane.
Single dumb an' stupid, baby, wasn't I a fool?
Ain't nothin' better than lovin' you.
Hey!

I've meditated on a single drop of rain.
Heard one hand clappin': there was silence in my brain.
It showed me somethin', baby, I already knew:
Ain't nothin' better than lovin' you.

I been high a time or two.
Those days are done:
Now, you're the one I'm turned on to. (Whoo!)
I know, now, what I'm gonna do.
