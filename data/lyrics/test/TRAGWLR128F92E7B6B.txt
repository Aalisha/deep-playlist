She made the night
But the dark's all right
And his heart became the hunter
A deadly bride
It's suicide
So take it slow

Waiting alone for the witching hour
Feeling the shock and the surge of power
She's come to know
She makes her way to the door forbidden
Tomorrow she'll say that she did not really go there
To neverwhere
Neverwhere

And then the child
Strange free and wild
...
