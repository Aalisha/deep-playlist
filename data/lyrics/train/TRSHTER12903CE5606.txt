Her name is Noelle
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour

Oh, how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me

Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me
Ooohoo Hoo Hooooooo

Her boyfriend's a dick
He brings a gun to school
