Get down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Get down, deeper and down
I want all the world to see
To see you're laughing
And you're laughing at me
I can take it all from you
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
Down down, deeper and down
