Relax in time,
from the pain you've been.
I don't know anything,
but I can read what's on your face.
Just on moment,
just one more to struggle.
We all want everything,
but we all can't fit in the door.

Seven tries,
head to wall,
hurts your head.
Sort of trust,
that you'll get.
What you paid for soon.
Seven tries,
head to wall,
just to get cut.
