As I see the light in the sky
Memories travel far back in time
Our journeys among these mountains
in this land of a thousand tales

Thoughts fly far in my past
Everything has gone so fast
Time just flows around me

If I could travel back in time
Would I try to change my life?
Or would I do it all the same

Sometimes I wish that I could be there
Right beside you, guide the way
Now I'm helpless and I'm waiting
...
