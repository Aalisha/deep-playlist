When we were growing up you always looked like you were having such fun
You always were and you always will be the taller and the prettier one
People seem to love you
They gravitate towards you

That's why I started to hate you so much
And I just completely ignored you
I don't know why I felt the need to keep it up for oh so long
It's all my fault I'm sorry you did absolutely nothing wrong
I don't know why I felt the need to drag it out for all these years
All the pain I've caused you
The constant flowing of your tears
Believe me when I say that I cannot apologise enough
When all you ever wanted from me was a token of my love

And if it's not too late
Could you please find it deep within your heart
To try and go back, go back to the start
