I can see a hurricane tonight
It keeps from my valentine
This voodoo's doing me harm
Raise the alarm

Maybe this is the moment to pray dear
But I'd rather lay by your side
'Cause millions are fighting their way hereÂ…

Tell me, when did the water surround me?
And tell me, is that love in your eyes?

New Orleans will tremble tonight
...
