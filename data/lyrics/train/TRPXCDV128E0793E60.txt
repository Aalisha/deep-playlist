I've seen your severed head at a banquet for the dead
All dressed up for dinner looked so fine
Your shining silver salver so tastefully powdered
With the finest military quick lime
Now try and picture this as I gave you a kiss
The apple in your mouth slipped in mine
The orchestra played the sweetest serenade
We laughed as we put away your wine

So raise your glasses here's a toast to wasted lives
May all their ghosts come back to haunt you
And tell you how they died
