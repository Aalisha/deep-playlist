It's time to fake what you say, as you're turning away
Though it's hard to be fake, facing you every day
With regret, with remorse for the things that were said
But you know how alone we'll end up in the end

Cause I don't want to see our lives destroyed by dismay
In these times of try, we live or die again

(Chorus)
You're my summer that fades, to these cold autumn days
You're my keepsake, my friend, and my fears
You're the strength that's inside and I swear on my life
I will always be there by your side
