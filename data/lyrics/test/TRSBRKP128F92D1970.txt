Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

There's a star in the east
Over pyramids at Kingstown
There had once lived a girl, she ruled the world
Then down the Nile he came with a smile

He was a king, she was the queen
Under the moonlight
Your eyes won't believe what your mind can't conceive
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...

Nights over Egypt
Nights over Egypt
