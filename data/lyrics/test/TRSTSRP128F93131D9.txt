When you lie,
Wandering what can be
Lost behind your eyes.
The sun's so clear but you're still dark.

It was you begging killed for so many years. Tragedy.
I lost a shadow, made him see a (merry o dity).

But as you can see
It's better if I don't know anything.
Cause you can do it by yourself.
Just like I used to do in these days.
Been wandering what can be.
And so you're stuck inside my memories.
