Yea children

Small people one day will get big
And those who they call minority
Are most of the people that you see?
Don't you ever abuse humble man?

Don't be afraid to wake up
Don't be afraid to wake up
Don't be afraid of another day
Iya get ready, oh yeah

Walking down the street
Can't afford to rest my feet
I just can't agree with my environment
I would like to see what can be done about it

Hey, I'm not afraid to wake up
I'm not afraid to wake up
No I'm not afraid of another day
I am ready, oh yeah

Mmh, mmh, mmh
Woe, woe, woo, woe
Mmh, mmh, mmh
...
