Verse 1
I don't believe in a fairy tale love
But I always thought that is could be us,
We spent some time togetha, we started goin togetha
Through bad stuff we weathered togetha baby,
You know I'll always love you,
Cause real love don't go away
I'll do whateva I need to do to please you,
Because I need you baby

We talk, talk, the outcome still the same and,
You won't stop, you gotta complain baby, and I
Twistin and turnin every night, can't sleep
So if you think it's alright

Chorus
You think that everything is fine
I want you know baby right now that it's not
Girl you can see that I'm hurtin inside
You be like you see and if not that it's alright
You think that everything is fine
I want you know baby right now that it's not
