Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up

Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up
Never stop never giving up

Give it up, feels so good to be together
Spending some time, makin' love
Makin' plans to last forever
Stayin' true until the end

True, there ain't a minute in the the day that's without you
Hoping that you feel it too
What you want? What you're feelin' I am feelin' too?
Never stop never giving up
