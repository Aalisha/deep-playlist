So divine, bird of feather
And the line you crossed crossed kept us together
As the candle burns at both ends it divides
Suffering that's how it gives
Like it is with you
Torn between the two now
And it's hypnotising
Taking quite a toll
It's time

But I'm only trying to make it better
Is there no other way
No other way to go

And I'm only trying to make it better
Is there no other way
When you're so far away
I feel I'm paralysed

Reading the news in the mirror
So far away
...
