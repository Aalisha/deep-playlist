[Wagner/Wagner]

It's been a long night and it's cold there, outside
As I watch the break of day
It's starting to rain like the sky is crying in pain for me

I hear the sound of people running around
Life is there, beyond the door
I was with them, I know, just a few days ago but it's over

Dust in the wind
There is nothing lasting long
One thing must pass, the other's born
Dust in the wind
There is nothing left behind
