Out my window it rains 
It cleanses through you upon you 
The eyes of a closer kind 
Can only see this through 
After all it's just a lifetime 
Fifty yard line the great divide 
Once again we looked into those 
Days of wrong and right 

This drink has just drained me of my disguise 
All right 
It's what i've been waiting for this time 
Weight of this time 
I'm out of my mind 
Shipwrecked here within reach of my peers 
Should i set myself adrift 
Any way out is fine 
She lives this through 
He lives this through 
...
