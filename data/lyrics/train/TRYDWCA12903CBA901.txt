Everybody? s lookin? for some way in,
I? m lookin? for some way out.
I? ve been wastin? my time standin? in line
If this is what it? s all about.

All I got is a job that I don? t like
And a woman that don? t understand.
So tonight at the bar,
I? ll get in my car
And take off for the promise land.

Drinkin? and dreamin?
Knowin? damn well I can? t go.
