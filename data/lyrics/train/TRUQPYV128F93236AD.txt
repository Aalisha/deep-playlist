Well, there're two ways I can say this
And one would be: fuck you!
And there're no two ways around it
Because one would be untrue.

Because I love everything about you.
But I don't want to be around you

If you control my heart will you control my brain?
If I give in to you, will it still feel the same?
'Cause I want nothing more than to be here with you
If you fulfill my dreams, will that fulfill you too?

I need a second.
I need a second to think.
I need a second.
