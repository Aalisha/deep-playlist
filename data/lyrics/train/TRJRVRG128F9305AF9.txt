ya gotta give me a scene from your battle sky zone [scars, oh?]
i don't know
go blur the things that matter to me most
friend or foe [from the foe?]
your fume, baby
soon, baby
kaboom, kaboom, kaboom
tonight I'll dig tunnels to your nightmare room
and if there's one thing I can't stand
it's up
and if it's one thing I can't stand
it's up
should have known better than to do that stuff
...
