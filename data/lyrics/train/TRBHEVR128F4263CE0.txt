I never thought you'd hurt me
I guess you live and learn
That when you're playin' with fire you're bound to get burned
I've been mistreated, I've been used before
I get kicked in the face still I come back for more

But I won't cry no more 'cause the tears are all in vain
We can pick up the pieces and start it all again
Let's just get back to the way it was before
Oh, girl I can't take anymore
