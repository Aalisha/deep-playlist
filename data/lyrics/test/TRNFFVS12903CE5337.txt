I'm the type of guy who's into getting high
On a Friday afternoon
So now you know I'm a regular Joe
I'll tell you what I like to do

I like to make the scene
In my machine
I like to make the scene
I leave 'em in another state
Whenever I accelerate

I live for cars and girls, cars and girls
Car, cars and girls
Cars and girls, cars and girls
Car, cars and girls
There's nothing else in this crazy world
Except for cars and a good, good, good girls

I got a lot of good sittin' under my hood
But it doesn't make me feel alright, alright
The only time I'm feelin' fine
Is when my baby's sittin' tight

I like to get it down
I like to feel the sound
