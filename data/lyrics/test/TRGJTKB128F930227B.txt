Well I think it all happened, when I was three years old
The running man showed me a step, that made me loose control
So I used it as a boy... and when I grew up...
I never thought this running motion would bring me such luck
So I skanked it in the morning and I skanked it in the night
It was then I decided that SKA would be my life
...
