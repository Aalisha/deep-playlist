Once bit, twice shy
Just the average kind of guy
Loved and lost felt the pain
The need to start all over again
Heart broken, on the mend
The loss of that special friend
The look and feel of despair
War and love where it's all fair
You just want a place to hide, (place to hide)
Don't show the hurt you feel inside
Keep your feelings bottled up, (bottled up)
An abandoned ship you won't give up

Sing me a love song
Song of pain
Sing me a love song, (sing a song of pain)
They're one in the same, yeah

Started young and innocent
All the good times that were spent
