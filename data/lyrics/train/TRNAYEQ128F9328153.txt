Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
Well I went to see the gypsy
To have my fortune read She said "Man, your baby gonna leave you
Her bags are packed up under the bed,"
That's right

Have mercy, have mercy, baby
Have mercy, have mercy on me
But if you leave me baby
Girl if you put me down
I'm gonna make it to the nearest river child
