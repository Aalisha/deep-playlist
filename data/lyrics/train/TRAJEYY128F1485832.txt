To be or to have,
that's a choice to make.
To be or to have,
to love or to hate.
Ownership is an illusion.
Ownership is an illusion.
It's our world, a place we all belong.
it's not mine.
I'm on borrowed time,
something burns in me,
something turns in me,
something yearns in meâ€¦

I'm my own sun.
I'm my own sun.
I'm my own sun.
I'm my own sun.
