Light up, light up this afternoon
Somehow I've found myself with you
Start up, start up our getaway car
I'm in too deep we've come this far

So bright, so bright you're a blinding sun
No need to hurry, we've just begun
Call out, call out your ocean''s move
The water's warm I'd swim to you

Come on, get in
Let's go, jump in
I must confess
I like us best
