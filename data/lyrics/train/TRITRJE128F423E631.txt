Chorus:
If I can't dance
If I can't dance
Oh, baby, if I can't dance
If I can't dance
If I can't dance
Then I don't want any part of your revolution

A new dawn waits for us tonight
If you play the cards, you're holding right
I swear I'll keep in party line
Cross my heart and hope to die
If I lose myself to rhythm
Doesn't mean I lose control
...
