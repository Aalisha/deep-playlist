it's to high to measure
it's to great a treasure
longer than forever
its inconceivable

big enough to live in 
deep enough to swim in
breathing out just to breathe in
its overtaken my soul

how high 
how deep
how great is your love for me
its making my heart sing

chorus:
Your love
your perfect love has found me
covers and surrounds me
your love is better than life
Your love
