Well, it is po' Black Minnie
She ain't got change in clothes
Lordy, stands in her shame
To see a woman I know

Lordy
Stands, now
See that woman, now
Oh, that woman, now
Lord, that woman got
Lord, that woman

(guitar)

Well, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
7, 8, 9
Say you, count down blues
You count them women's a-mine
