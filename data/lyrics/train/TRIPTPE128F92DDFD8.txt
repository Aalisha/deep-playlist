Come go with Me behind the veil
take my hand and I'll lead you there
Come go with me, behind the veil
Caus in his presence we'll prevail
There's a call to the remnant, you've been chosen to trevail
Hear the cry of the Spirit, to enter behind the veil
Come broken in spirit, purged in truth and Holiness
Bow down before His Glory, blood washed in righteousness

Come go with me behind the veil, come take my hand and I'll lead you there
Come go with me behind the veil, cause in His presence we'll prevail

Cause Satan has no power, no entrance behind the veil
All our fears are taken, peace and joy now prevail

So, come broken in Spirit purged in truth and Holiness, 
Bow down before his Glory blood washed in righteousness

His Holiness is his essence,
His Glory fills this place,
His Power surrounds us,
His presence we embrace,
As we bow down and worship,
Jesus Christ our Sourverign Kin, and were eternally grateful, 
He's the allowed us to enter in

Come go with me behind the veil, Just take my hand and I'll lead you there
Come on and go with me, behind the veil
Remember, because in his presence that's where we'll prevail
There's a call to his remnant, we've been chosen to trevail
Hear the cry of the Spirit to enter behind this veil
So come broken in Spirit Purged in truth and Hholiness,
Bow down before his glory, blood washed in righteousness

Come on and Go with me, go with me, behind the veil, take my hand and I'll lead you there

Come on and go with me (3x's)
Can't you hear the Spirit of the Lord cryin out?

Come on and go with me (2x's)
The Spirit in the back says come (2x's)
Come go with me behind the veil

It's a place, where Satan can't prevail
Ah, there's no entrance for Satan, 
behind the veil

So, come on and go with me
Come on and go with me (2x's)
go with me (2x's)
