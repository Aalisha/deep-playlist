Shabba dabba doo
Bad Azz, this is another Dogghouse experience
Feels good in here, baby

If a busta ran up on you
Bad Azz, tell me what would you do
We get ready 2 bang
That Dogghouse Gangsta Gang

Psycho like no Dogghouse niggaz
So fire up the doo-doo
We get ready 2 bang
That Dogghouse Gangsta Gang, Westcoast

Holla at a playa when you see me in the streets
I'm often traffic tryin' to get it 'cuz a nigga gotta eat
We can holla if it's 'bout fillin' my plate
I feel like killin' somebody when a nigga ain't late

It's about weight when you workin' smart shit it don't flip right
Put the wrong ties and dees, it won't slip right
Get the wrong blunt for the weed it won't hit right
And money don't grow on trees so what I look like

Make moves, can't lose if I do it that way
Fuck a fight, ain't nobody fin' to put they gat away
