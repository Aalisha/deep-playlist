Oh yeah
I'm pretty good at takin' care myself
I always get enough to get me by
So if you're askin' for a little love
Well, baby, there ain't nothin' I won't try
You got me knockin' on wood
I never knew that you could
Well, if you want me to stay for the night, it's alright

It's alright if you want me
It's alright if you need me
Girl, if you want me to stay for the night
Girl, if you want me to stay satisfied
Girl, if you want me to stay for the night, it's alright
