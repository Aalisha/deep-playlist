you wanna leave it but you can't forget about it
you wanna leave it but you can't forget about it
you wanna leave it but you can't forget about it
you wanna leave it but you can't forget about it

it's just the state of mind
it's just the state of mind
and mind is in state of incomprehension
a lack of meaning and lack of attention

it's just a waste of time
it's just a waste of time
cause time is running out and i worry about you
i've got the feeling i'm hopeless around you

you wanna leave it but you can't forget about it
...
