Descending! Into madness
Sanity falling away
Nothing remains from the world you have known
Enter the realms beyond the gate

Twisting masses taking form beyond the murky black
A scream breaks the silence and the skies begin to crack

Eyes burst forth from the body
Their whispers seared into your brain
Beckoning your descent
You stare into the void and it calls your name...
