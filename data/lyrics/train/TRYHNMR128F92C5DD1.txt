I saw a spider
I didn't scream
Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me, and
I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
Cause they just get in my way

The way
You look at me is kinda like a little sister
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
And not one of the boys
...
