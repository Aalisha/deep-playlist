Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah

So you're wishing that you never did all the embarrassing things you've done
And you're wishing you could set it right
And you're wishing you could stay the night
But then I go again, wishing never solved the problem
If you wanna get it big time, go ahead and get it, get it big time

Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah: Ah-Ah
