The heavens are burning down tonight
To the end of the world we have arrived
But as constellations pass us by
Civilizations shall once more rise to die... rise to die!

Evolution and insanity
We've been building our own destiny
We can no longer see the lights inside
Evolution and insanity
We've been building our own destiny
There's no reasons left behind
...
