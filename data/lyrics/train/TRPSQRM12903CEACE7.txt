They met in 1980 at the school disco
He kissed her for the first time on the last bus home
He said ‘you be Dirty Harry, I’ll be Joey Ramone’
She saw shooting stars flash by
The moon exploded in the sky
Her heart flipped when they kissed
Star dust on her lips
Special pact in the dark
Getting pissed in the park
She’s in love
She’s in love
And when they walked downtown all the people would stare
They used to laugh at her clothes and the color of their hair
She was 17 and she didn’t care
Cause baby’s gonna take her everywhere
Cause he said they’d live in New York
And the stars would be their own
She was dirty Harry and he was Joey Ramone
