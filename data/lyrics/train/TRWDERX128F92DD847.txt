Pleased to meet you, pleased to have you on my plate
your meat is sweet to me
your destiny
your fate

you're my life support, your life is my sport

I'm a man-eating machine X2

you won't hear me laughing, as i terminate your day
you can't trace my footsteps, as i walk the other way

i can't get enough prey, pray for me X2
(i'm a man-eating machine)
corporate cannibal, digital criminal
corporate cannibal, eat you like an animal
