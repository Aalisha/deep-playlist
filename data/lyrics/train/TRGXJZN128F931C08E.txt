Fathers are pleading, lovers are all alone
mothers are praying--send our sons back home
you marched them away--yes, you did--on ships and planes

bring the boys home (bring 'em back alive)
turn the ships around, lay your weapons down
Can't you see 'em march across the sky, all the soldiers that have died
tryin' to get home--can't you see them tryin' to get home?
