Offer your trust to a friend who is not what he says
And you know when you're dry, what you're thinkin'
Trout in the brook, you're about to get hooked
To a greedy false un-Catholic knave

The black book you took
Was permanently diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why
The black book you took
Was permanently diversified
Cousin why, cousin why, cousin why
