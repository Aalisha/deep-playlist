If I ever die, I'm begging you, please come with me
We're gonna groove, into the blue
All the parasites, oh just leave them, pigs can't fly
There's no tomorrow, no regrets, no goodbyes

I will fly, into the sunset, way up high
Don't be sorry, nothing good I leave behind
You don't worry, evil lasts a 100 lifetimes
It won't happen to me
...
