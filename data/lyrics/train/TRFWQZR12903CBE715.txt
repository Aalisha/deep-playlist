We live in slavery
To a past we cannot escape
And I say it's worth it
To just start again, again

We've focused so long
On ideals of freedom
That it is this very belief
That oppresses us

We all want to be free
Yet we find ways to forfeit liberty
To our own impulses
To our own consumption

So I say it's worth it
To build a new foundation
A new foundation
A new foundation
A new foundation
It's a past we cannot escape

This vacancy
Will take everything
This world can offer

But what is control
Once we have let go
