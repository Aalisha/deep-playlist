This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart
Climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay
The last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in God and my trust in you
Now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

Wish there was something real
Wish there was something true
