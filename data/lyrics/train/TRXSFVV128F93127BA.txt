I'm not your slave, never was, never will be
I gave all i had and you took what you needed
It's out of gods lips into your ears
You act like you ain't gotten laid in five years

Powertrip
Powertrip
Why can't you admit you've been pussy-whipped
She's on a powertrip

Bitchin' comes off me like water on oil
