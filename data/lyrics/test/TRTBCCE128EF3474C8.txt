Well, I never felt more like singin' the blues'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear, why'd you do me this way
Well, I never felt more like cryin' all night'Cause everything's wrong, there ain't nothin' right
Without you, you got me singin' the blue.s Now the moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
