Tell me that we still belong
Tell me that the will is still alive
There must be another chance for us tonight
'Coz everyone who's walked upon
Trouble or lies, they come and go
We can be the lucky ones
And find love, after the storm

Don't let go
'Coz it's just a step from heaven
And the strength of love is on our side
Soon you'll find
That our faith will take us higher
'Coz we're just a step
Baby just a step from heaven
...
