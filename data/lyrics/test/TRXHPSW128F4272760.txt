Down in Louisiana
Down in Cajun Land
Folks got something goin’
Goes something like
Folks go a git’ chat tootisie

I wants to ‘tie ya puppe ‘tame me
Gonna dig ya on a scoobydoo
Gonna gotcha on a scuba die
Ooh boog-a-boo you
You ooh boog-a-boo you, little boy
Get hip to the consultation of the boolawee
