You're a fish out of the water
On the wrong side of the tracks
Gather up the boys
To come and take your back
We stand all together
Against the opposed
We'll die for our brethren
That we have chose
On the wrong side of the tracks
On the wrong side of the tracks
Education
War in the streets
Catch one suck
and he gets beat
What you see
Is what you get
Soft, phony suckers
Will soon meet their end
...
