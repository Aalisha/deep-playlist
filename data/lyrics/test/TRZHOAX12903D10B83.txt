Billie Holiday
The Quintessential - Volume 4
Me, Myself And I (are All In Love With You)
Irving gordon / allan roberts / alvin s. kaufman

Me, myself and i
Are all in love with you
We all think you're wonderful
We do

Me, myself and i
Have just one point of view
We're convinced
There's no one else like you
