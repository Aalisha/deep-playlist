Into the night I go day for night ...
I know what you talk about in your sleep wrap yourself around me
Not just a passer by I'm gonna stay awhile,
I like your peep show magnetized I saw you in the window,
I've been watching you don't know what else to do,
Trust me I'm sensitive intensitive I'll never let you go,
...
