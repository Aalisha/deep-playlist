Let's shake this town, baby, come with me
I need a little loving company
Come on now, I know where we can go
This is the time to stay out all night
I've got a fire like a heavenly light
Come on, baby, well, let's take a drive

Come on, baby, let's do it right
Time to dance in the magic light of the desert moon
