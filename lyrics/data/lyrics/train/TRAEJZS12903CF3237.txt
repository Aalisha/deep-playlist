Somebody told me that
I'm the one I'm the one
Who'll follow you, I'll pull your through
We're in the third time around time around
But that's okay, 'cause I'm here to stay

Give it up, give it all you've got
Make it count, make sure you're not
Taking chances, don't walk out the door
'Cause it's too damn cold
Give it up 'til you lose control,
Looking up, looking back we'll know
That everything's worth waiting for
And we got so much more
