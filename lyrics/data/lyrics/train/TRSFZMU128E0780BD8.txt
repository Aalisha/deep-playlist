Talk:
Have you ever seen some that you thought was so sexy?
And even though you had a man, he was still turnin you on?


Moods feelin' right, and i, see you standin' there, like an ordinary nite
feelin, lust is in the air (HEY) the way your body looks, its turnin me on
the way you lick your lips slow, makes me want you even more.

whooooa your turnin me on, whooooa your turnin me on.

CHORUS
so attractive but could this be wrong, to feel this way you come on so
strong, ill take my time because you might be gone, i dont know your name but
ur turnin me on.

whooooa your turnin me on, whooooa your turnin me on.

all alone tonite, and i, got my man at home, i cant, get u out my sight
i kno, this feelin is so wrong, (HEY) i wanna approach u, letchu kno how
