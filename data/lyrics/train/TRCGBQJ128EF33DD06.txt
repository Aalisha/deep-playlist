Sometimes you get lost in the world
Get out of touch with your heart
Then one day you wake up
Did we drift to far apart?

Are we gonna pick up the pieces
Just wait 'til our lease is up
What about all the things we lived for
No one wins if we walk on out that door

If we don't stay together, we're foolin' ourselves
Without you, girl it's a livin' in hell
Who's foolin' who...
