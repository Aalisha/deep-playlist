I haven't seen you since that brooklyn night
i guess it's been about a year by now
cold and rainy, in a poets words
Dark and crimson in a drunken way

i was frozen in a window pane
kind of like i was on a movie screen
your hair was darker than i remembered it
i was as awkward as i could have been

so much has changed 
it seems nothing ever changes
