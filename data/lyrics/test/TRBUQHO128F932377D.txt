Bimbo beauties beckoning
Fizzy banger
Said she's a sanger-screwdriver
Mrs. Phillips gives head for bottlecaps
On the ceiling painted frescoes never lie

Wild flowers growing on
Happy hour

A dyed blonde sacrificial lamb
Died during happy hour
How far would you drive
How far would you drive
To rock in another man's grave
