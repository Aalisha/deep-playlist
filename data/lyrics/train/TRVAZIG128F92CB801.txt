Flower's bloomin', mornin' dew
And the beauty seems to say
It's a pleasure when you treasure
All that's new and true and gay

Easy livin' and we're givin'
What we know we're dreamin' of
We are one havin' fun
Walkin' in the glow of love

Walking, ooh, whoa, ho... oh... whoa...

Smilin' faces, goin' places
It's a wonder, it's so clear
By a fountain, climbin' mountains
As we'll hold each other near

Sippin' wine, we try to find
That special magic from above
As we share our affair
Talkin' in the glow of love

Oh, oh, ooh...
In the glow of love
Ooh... ooh... ooh...

(Here in glow of love) You're a shinin' star
(Here in glow of love) No matter who you are
...
