VIVA!

Into the Dungeon with evil men
The people have risen we're free again
Come out of the closet
Come out of the hole
Come out of the woodwork
Come into the fold
Rebels and fighters, a license to kill
Unite with the bandits down from the hills
Open your windows
Open your doors
Open your minds
To a freedom of thought

Viva la revolution
Viva la revolution
Viva la revolution
Viva la revolution

Raise our voices, raise our flag
Smash the symbols of the life we've had
Long live the future
Long live the scheme
...
