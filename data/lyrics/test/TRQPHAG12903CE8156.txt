I ain't much on Casanova
Me and Romeo have never been friends
Can't you see how much I really love ya
Going to say it to you time and time again

Oh Casanova
Casanova
(repeat)

Every man deserves a good woman
And I want you to be my wife
Time is so much better spent baby
With a woman just like you in my life
So let me love you
Fill you up inside
I want to hold you baby
So let me squeeze you
Don't you know that I'll get down on my knees for you baby

Ya see
I ain't much on Casanova
Me and Romeo have never been friends
Can't you see how much I really love ya
Going to say it to you time and time again

Oh Casanova
Casanova
(repeat)

Everytime I wanna see ya
