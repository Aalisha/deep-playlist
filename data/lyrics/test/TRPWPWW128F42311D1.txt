It's, not, how you start, it's how you finish
And it's, not, where you're from, it's where you're

at
Everybody gets knocked down
Everybody gets knocked down
How quick are you gonna' get up?
How quick are you gonna' get up?
Everybody gets knocked down
Everybody gets knocked down
How quick are you gonna' get up?

Just how are you gonna' get up?
Like Ali in the jungle
Like Nelson in jail
Like Simpson on the mountain
With odds like that, they were bound to fail
Like Keller in the darkness
Like Adam's in the dark

Like Ludwig Van, how I loved that man, well the guy

went deaf and didn't give a fuck, no...
