That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,
Marching down freedom's road.
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me,
From marching down freedom's road.

Hand me my gun, let the bugle blow loud,
I'm on my way with my head a-proud,
One objective I've got in view,
Is to keep a hold of freedom for me and you
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching,
Marching down freedom's road.
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me,
...
