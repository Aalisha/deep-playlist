When my gal and I go on a date
We always come in kinda late
When I say goodnight at her front door
I always beg for one kiss more

Give me more, more, more of your kisses
I want more, more, more tender kisses
And when I finally go
You can hear the rooster crow
Oh please give me one more tender kiss
