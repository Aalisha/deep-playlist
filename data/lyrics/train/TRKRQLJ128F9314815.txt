I'm just a girl
That doesn't like the thought of being alone
I need to be loved and held real close
I'm the kind of girl
That needs to be caressed and kissed so soft, yeah
There's no better way to turn me on
I need a man who
Who's gonna treat me right
I need a man who'll be with me every night
So I've gotta

CHORUS
Find me a man
With sensitive eyes
One who understands
Love is stronger than pride
