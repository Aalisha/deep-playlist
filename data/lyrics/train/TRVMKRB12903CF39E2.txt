Woy! Desperation has return
Sodom and Gomorrah no deh yah so!
Woy desperation has return over yonder
Sodom and Gomorrah no deh yah so!

Wild one, you are like the Prodigal Son yeah
And if you're the Prodigal Son, my friend
Then you're the one, you
Left taking your only possession
Your culture
To enter a world known for hacklings
In abundance, yeah
The hustlers of life
Have hooked and drained you from the man
Form the man that you used to be, turn your back on us
