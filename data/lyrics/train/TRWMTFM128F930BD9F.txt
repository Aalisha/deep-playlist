When the hand of fate will slap you
All has gone array no more bargains
Death comes out to play
With a loss of vision control
All has gone away no more compromise
Death comes out to play
In the darkened boneyard
Aint no other way
I will be your captain
When death comes out to play
When the hand of fate will drop you
You have gone astray no more worries
...
