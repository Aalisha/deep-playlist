(phesto dee)
Master of emcee slave trade
Pullin' chief executive chains on his muppets
The prime minister of shattered dreams
For these young black kids
Itchin' for this rap status
But he never could add up these b-boy mathematics
His pragmatic toys made him money magnetic
The abrasive weight of his unevasive vendettas
Made him keep two barrettas with his industry contingents
Ninjas, paid protection and fringe benefits
He rolls from the stretch benz limited edition
Caught between a sinister smoke screen and henchmen
Straightened his lapel ignited his cigarette
And shoved the knot of his tie and awaited his death wish
Reckless manslaughter left him breathless
Mashed his chest it's a crash in the intersection
A fraction of a second
Spun out on the sidewalk
He couldn't pull his gun out
'cause instantly
He was f**ked in the industry

(opio)
Is it real or imagery?
Senseless acts of savagery
Could it be you got f**ked in the industry?
See it
You got f**ked in the industry

(chorus)
(tajai)
Cause niggas get off in this business
Tryin' to come up
Awestruck, starstruck
But you know how they end up
See it
You got f**ked in the industry
