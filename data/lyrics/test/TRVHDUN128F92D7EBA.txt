Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
This aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
Cuz this aint about KJ this about you

They said why's this kid on the mic man
He's from Florida he's Christian and he's white man
They said there was nothing in my life man
That I could ever offer except Christ, man
He said now give me everything you got
Ill take that little bit and turn it to a lot
I don't care what they say or even what they thought
I can make a way even when they say there's not
But they said just for me to give up now
They said that I'm a be messed up now
They said there's no way to get love
I was better to drop out or just sell drugs
But he said I got a much better way
If I'd let him in and just let him change
If he got a chance He would take away
Everything from the past so I wanna say is...

Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
This aint about me this about you
Push up a five push up a 2
Push em up high this is what you do
Push up a five push up a 2
Cuz this aint about KJ this about you
