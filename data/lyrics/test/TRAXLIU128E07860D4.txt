Let's knock it out that's all, oh we gon' do it
Now get the fuck out put it down
But it gotta bang
It has to bang ya know?

I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing

I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
Do my motherfuckin' thing

I speak for the meek and the lonely, weak and the hungry
Speak for the part of the street that keep it ugly
And niggaz couldn't wear my shoes
'Cause the places that I walk, most catz couldn't bear my dues

Or pay the tolls of the roads I done kept on, crept on
Walk 'til I got tired then curled up and slept on
My journey has earned me the right to reach
I burned so I earned the right to teach, what to eat

What niggaz been gettin' fed is pork
What you niggaz been gettin' fed, shouldn't be even on your fork
Let's talk, about this, and about that
Yeah, we like this or we can do it out back

Keep the bullshit for the rodeo
'Cause on the real, you cocksuckers don't know me yo
Hit you wit' something for frontin' that'll end your life
Then hit your crib and bend your wife

I'ma bang, hit the block pitchin' slang
Bang, hit the rock spit the game
Bang, get the glock spit the flame
