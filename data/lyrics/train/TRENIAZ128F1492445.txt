There was a place
And the name of the place escapes me
When I can? t remember
It irritates me

Could be I can? t remember
Could be I choose to not
Let? s move along the song
And try to find the plot

There was a girl and I don? t know her name either
She gave me love and I swore I? d never leave her
If I did I? d come back someday and find her
Maybe I will, I should write down a reminder

One day
One day who knows
Someday
Someday I suppose

There was a verse that I was gonna write
I haven? t yet but there? s still a chance I might
An open book that I still wanna close
I? ll find the time someday I suppose

A place and time I wanna be and spend
A storyline that? s happy in the end
Plans are made with promises, so certainly uncertain
I can? t wait to set things straight before they close the curtain
