I don't care anymore
if I let you down
I believe that I need to be free
I'm so used to my life with you around
I don't know anymore the real me

And I thought that I found myself today
and I thought that I had control
all the change in my life just fell away
for a moment I didn't need you

all these tears that I cried
you must be tired of
...
