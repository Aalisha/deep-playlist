Take it and run
I promise I'll find you, just take it and run
Take it and hide, it will kill you on site
And I stay here and wait
When they come I will fight every last one of them
Yeah, I'll sit here and wait for my Nemesis, babe

'Cause the chances are one in a million
That I'll ever find a love like this again
