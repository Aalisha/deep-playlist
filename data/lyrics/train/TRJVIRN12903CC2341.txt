My eyelids are shaking
I can't sustain this conversation
All this talk and no decision
This can't be how you envisioned it

Free water
Clear water

I'm feeling the weight on us
I'd like to help you but I don't know where to push
So much fight and no remission
Call forth the water and immerse in it, oh

Wash myself down
And find a way to get back
Free water
...
