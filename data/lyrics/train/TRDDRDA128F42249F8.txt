So wild, so beautiful and pure
All elements divine
The essence of all life
So vast, extensive and remote
Unbridled and erratic
Savage but glorious

It bursts; its energy is stirring
It calls; its drawing power will enchant us with its might
Its massive spirit's bright
Let it flow!

Its endless beauty will evoke
A timeless sequence we all share
...
