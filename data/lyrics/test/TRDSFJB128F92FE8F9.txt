Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills,
Lived my pappy and he had him a still.
He brewed white lightning 'till the sun went down,
And then he'd fill him a jug, an' pass it around.
Mighty, mighty pleasin', you're pappy's corn squeezin'

Searchin' for the place where he made his brew.
They were lookin', tryin' to book him,
But my pappy kept on cookin'
White Lightning
