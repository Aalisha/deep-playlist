I'm a long way from home
I don't know where I'll go
I a'int slept in days
And the water's running low

Got a posse at my back
And bullet in my side
Lord I gotta keep on movin'
Find a good place to hide

Well they tried to take me in
For shootin' down a man
He got what he deserved
They'll have to catch me if they can

I feel my blood runnin' colder every day
...
