I'm a wanderer I'll keep drifting on
Can't see honey why you done me wrong
Hard luck sure has got me
I can't sleep a wink
I'll just have to face it from now on

CHORUS:
Sailing o'er the sea of dreams no one cares for me
And we're drifting oh so far apart
You slam the door of love on me
And found a new daddy I could see
By that unwanted sign upon your heart

Break (fiddle)
