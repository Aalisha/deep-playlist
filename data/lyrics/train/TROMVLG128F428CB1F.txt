Slumber in death, we are unborn, absent of mind, time is a womb
Darkness
Out of the dark, into the light, luck and a chance
Spawning of life
Born into this uncertainty by chance, from origin inception of matter 
Itself, all forms of life, born to be dead to live again
Then die
Constantly change evolution, born to be dead, dead to be born
Evolving is in harmony with death
Insuring the progression of all life
