Would you believe me
If I said My head is spinning without you
Would you believe me
If I just want to let you know how I feel about you

Now I want to know what I can do to make you stay with me tonight
'Cause I do
Would you believe me if I leave you, cause here I go

Am I reaching you now
I'm just trying to tell you that I'm letting you go
Am I reaching you now
Dearly departed now that you've started, I'm going to finish it

Would you believe me
