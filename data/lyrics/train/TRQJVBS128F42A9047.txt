Now everybody's beautiful
When they're young
And I should know
I've had more than my share of fun

There's all this fascination
With the impossibly thin
With the surface of things
Airbrush Photoshop creation

In all that we are losing
Aren't we just confusing
Youth with beauty?
Truth with duty?

There's something on the telly 'bout North Korea
Some war broke out don't trust the media
I'd like to get a suntan
Some dude was shot in Pakistan

The track's got noddage
Moves my boddage
The track's got noddage
The track's got noddage

They've got those bombs up in the planes
They've got those bombs up in the trains
They've got those bombs up in my face
Don't wanna talk about it
(x 2)

I was walking through the city
