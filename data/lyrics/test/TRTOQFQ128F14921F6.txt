They say your love will surely fade girl
When things go wrong and trouble calls
But they don't know that your sweet sunshine babe
Will never fade when darkness falls
They say that when the chips are down girl
Your love won't stay so long my friend
But they don't know that your sweet lovin' babe
Has been around through thick and thin

And I'd be a fool right now
If I should hurt you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
If I should leave you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
If I wouldn't love you girl
And I'd be a fool right now
On the outside looking inside

They say your love is surely goin'
Just like a snowman in the sun
