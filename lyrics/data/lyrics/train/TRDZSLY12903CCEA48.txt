Another child born to the house - I hate children
Raise him right so he won't be a mouse - I hate children
I hate it when they make lots of noise - I hate children
And i broke my neck tripping over their toys - I hate children

(Chorus:)
Shut your mouth you stupid little brat
what you need's a smack smack smack
If i had my way i'd give you all away
