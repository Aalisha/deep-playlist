Get on your mark, get set
Ready or not, here I come
You've been looking for love
Well, honey, I can give you some

When your world is standing still
I can turn it around
Put your head up in the clouds
And pick your feet off the ground

My love, are you ready for my love, my love
My love, my love is ready for you
If you're looking for a heart that's always true
Only to you, then my love
...
