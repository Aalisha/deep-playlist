In caustic butchery
I parent my dominion
In the food chain
I create the missing link
Cold temerity confects
This splintered for age
Infantile corruption
Taken to the brink

Making hash of the
Spumous crubescent
All natural compassion removed
The newly fully developed
Boiled as sprouted fodder
Martilinear murder
Cordon bleu

As salubrious pet food
Human midden is consumed
