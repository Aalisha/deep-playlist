I choose my friends only far too well
I'm up on the pavement
They're all down in the cellar
With their government grants and my IQ
They brought me down to size
Academia blues

Louise is a girl
I know her well
She's up on the pavement
Yes, she's a weather girl
And I'm staying up here so I may be undone
She's inappropriate but then she's much more fun and

When she smiles my way
My eyes go out in vain
She's got perfect skin
