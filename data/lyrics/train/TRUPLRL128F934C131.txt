Hey, everybody, throw up your hands!

I am here to save her life
Because you told me to
Because I must obey my
obey my master

Even when danger strikes
T1000 is here
He knows where to find us
So you must come with me now

Come with me if you want live
Come with me if you want live

We must run
We are no match for him
