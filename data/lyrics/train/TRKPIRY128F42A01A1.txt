Hello, what the hell am I doing here?
That's a really nice suit, this is a really comfortable chair
See, I don't know if you can help me or not.
Cause I don't feel sick, no I don't feel sick

But the pains in my head have almost put me underground

I don't really care if I am healthy or not
Just clean my head up, doc, I'll give you anything you want
See, I don't know why I don't fall in love
Well, maybe I know why, and maybe you could make it stop
