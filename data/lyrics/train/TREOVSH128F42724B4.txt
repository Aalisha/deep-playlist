Can you tell me how we got in this situation
I can't seem to get you off my mind
All these ups and downs
They trip up our good intentions
Nobody said this was easy an ride.

After all, we're only human
Always fighting what we're feeling
Hurting, instead of healing
After all, we're only human
Is there any other reason why we
Stay instead of leaving, after all?

Can we get back to the point of this conversation
When we saw things through each other's eyes
'Cause now all I see is ruin and devastation
We all need someplace we can hide inside
