Break the chains
Crazy ways on the streets, its a freak show
Times have changed since I was day one old
There he lies on the ground with his torn up clothes
Gotta help this man but he is not alone

There got to be a way, that's what I say to myself
But if I try too hard, I'm right back on that shelf
You give and give and give, you think you've won this race
People crying - people dying, seems like its lost in space
