[Intro: U-God]
Yo... yo... yo... yo, yo

[U-God]
Time to knock 'em out, cut 'em with the glass hand
Time to shut 'em down, I'm coming out the badland
Oscar the Grouch, kid, jumping out the trashcan
The last man that violated, got chopped with the sword
Send him a one way express ticket to see the Lord
You think we falling off, the beef's internal
All that bullshit we going through, it don't concern you
I'll thermonuclear burn you, you'se a human sacrifice
Cuz I be smashing mics with the Passion of Christ
Stay fully loaded, equipped with action devices
Kid, stashing these stripes, join the force
Honey, take ya flick, lift and point to the boss, soon
As you blink, your coins is tossed
It only takes four bars to get my point accross
And I'm coldest with the frost, on top of the mountain
Elijah, was the prophet, along came Malcolm
And I'm scalping niggaz, taking devil's heads
Money generated niggaz, taking heavy bread

[RZA]
I was born in a barrel of razor blades
Right next door to haze, I used to be afraid
Of the devil, as a boy, but now as a grown man
I have realized, he is just a toy
A graphic image, I'm that magnificent splendid
