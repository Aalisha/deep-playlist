Listen to me cause I'm not faking
This time it's real and I can't take it
Hold me gently cause I might fall apart
There were no bullets so stop searching
The cause is you and all your making
Stop pretending that you're innocent

Cause now I remember that...

I saw you with the murder weapon
You see me as an enemy
Choke on your tongue as you pray that
this is all just a dream
And fall before me

I'm down but I can still comprehend
How this broken two step dance went
You shot me
...
