I keep tellin myself that itll be fine
You cant make everybody happy all of the time
I find myself in a place that I never been
A place that I thought that I could never be
Theres people looking back at me

I keep having this dream; Im at a party
Theres people throwing drinks and
screaming telling me that I dont belong
...
