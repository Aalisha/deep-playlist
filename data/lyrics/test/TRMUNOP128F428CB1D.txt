[Music by: Appelhanz, Turner]

Individual characteristics, fatal birthing right, overpopulate
Inefficiency leads to misery, human circumstance
Deadly consequence
World we dominate, mass obliterate
Inhumanity breeds unconsciously, cosmic injury, Earth deformity,
World survival rate, man's uncertainty

Why can't you foresee it? Our future to be
Escape, it's too late, destiny, certainty, tragedy!

Counter measuring this atrocity, unintentional hell-bent accident
Biological life dysfunctional, mental stimulant, unintelligence
Man's diversity, disharmonious, past calamities unforgettable
Homosapiens inability, uninhabited man monstrosity

Set ourselves up for this, we reap what we sow
What more will you rape? How much will you kill?
