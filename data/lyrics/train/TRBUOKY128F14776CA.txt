Lonely, you on my mind
How could I let you go
All that we've been through
I still need you next to me
I said so many things
I did not mean to say
And although we tried to talk
The words, they got in the way
Now that I realise
I need you with me
I've got to find a way to make you see

This time, it could be forever
This time, it could be so complete
It's time for us to be together
Now I know what you mean to me

Now that I understand
Through all this loneliness
I need no other man
So here I am, I'm still needing you
As you were leaving
