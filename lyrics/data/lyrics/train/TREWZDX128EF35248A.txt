When I walk away
And I see your face
And you're staring down at me

Then I turn away
Your eyes are in disguised
Baring down on me with all

But when I turn away
Your words are delayed
Scattered all around my head

And then I make mistakes
When I think about
All that sounds that were said to me

(I walk away)
She's broken
She's broken
She's broken
She's broken
She's broken
She's broken
She's broken
She's broken
