Outside the rain
The heart skips a beat
Are you lonely
Creature of the night
It's been almost a week
Could you love me only

Look at me, for a very long time
Long enough to know
Love is a word I've been trying to find
Words don't matter
They don't matter at all

Maybe it's only a dream
I don't want to feel that
Well it's one more link in the chain
I don't believe that
...
