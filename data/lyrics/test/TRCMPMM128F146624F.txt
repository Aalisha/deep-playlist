Just as the day time turns into night time
I know that I can turn to you
And as the river runs to the ocean
I know that I can run to you
Just like the rich man needs lots of money
Listen, woman, I need you
Just like the hunter stalks the hunted
In a jungle of lust, it's true

I've got an animal heart when I see you
Animal heart, I'll do anything you want me to
I've got an animal heart
This love for you never changes (animal heart)
No, no
