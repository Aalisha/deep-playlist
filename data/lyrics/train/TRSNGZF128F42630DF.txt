Oh, how time flies, since we said hi
But now it's time we said goodbye
Oh, how time flies, since we said hi
But now it's time we said goodbye

Here we are, look how long it's been
We come far and I remember when
We were young havin' fun, dancin' 'til the dawn
Now we're grown on our own, everybody's movin' on

Everything is changin'
Nothing stays the same
Even though we're leavin'
We'll be comin' back again

Oh, how time flies, since we said hi
But now it's time, we said goodbye
Oh, how time flies, since we said hi
But now it's time, we said goodbye
...
