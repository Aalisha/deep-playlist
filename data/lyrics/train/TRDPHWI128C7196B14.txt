Ooh, every day there's something new
Honey, to keep me lovin' you
And with every passin' minute
Ah baby, so much joy wrapped up in it
Oh, Heaven must have sent you from above
Oh, Heaven must have sent your precious love, oh
And I, I've got a song to sing
Tellin' the world about the joy you bring
...
