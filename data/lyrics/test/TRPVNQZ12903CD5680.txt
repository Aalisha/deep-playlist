We`re the forgotten people
here we were left after the bomb
well they put something strange in my daddy's water
and that's where we come from


me and my two brothers
we gotta eat everything that we can
we take the trees and the cows
we feeds of each other
Take the walls of your caravan


Refrain:
And the hills have eyes
we`re looking at you
there ain`t no escape
...
