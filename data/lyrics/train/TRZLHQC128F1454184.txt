Babooshka
Babooshka

She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made the worst move

She sent him scented letters
And he received them
With a strange delight
Just like his wife

But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter

All yours
...
