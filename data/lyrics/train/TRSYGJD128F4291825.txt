Alright
Baby, you're alright
Ooh honey, you're alright
Farther on down the road
You will accompany, oh yeah
Farther on down the road
You will accompany, oh yeah
When I think back
Your love was like a sun
I don't remember the cold days
I just remember the warm
Farther on down the road
Girl, you will accompany, oh yes, you will
If a fusing life that I had before
I'd rather be, oh yeah
I'll be glad to learn from you and I know, good and well, honey
