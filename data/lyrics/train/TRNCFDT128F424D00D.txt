Suffer through your death
Because of the life you lead
Pain will be intense
You will never rest
Seas of fire and blood
See the millions dead below
Life torn from the flesh
Carcass just remains
Now the time has come
Ripping of your flesh
Sever bone from skin and meat
Tear your heart from your chest
Make you watch it beat
Screaming out in pain
