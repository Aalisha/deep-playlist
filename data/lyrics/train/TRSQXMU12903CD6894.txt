Tonight, don't you wanna come with me
Nasty?
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me?
My own little nasty world

Girl, girl, girl
Dance, dance, dance
Tonight, don't you wanna come with me?
You think I'm a nasty girl

Oh, oh

That’s right, pleased to meet you
Still don't wanna tell you my name
Don’t you believe in mystery?
Don’t you wanna play my game?

I’m lookin’ for a man to love me
Like I never been loved before
I’m lookin’ for a man that’ll do it anywhere
Even on a limousine floor ‘cause

Tonight I’m livin’ in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don’t you wanna come with me?
Do you think I’m a nasty girl?

Tonight I’m livin’ in a fantasy
My own little nasty world
Tonight, don’t you wanna come with me?
Do you think I’m a nasty girl?

I guess I’m just used to sailors
I think they got water on the brain
I think they got more water upstairs
Than they got sugar on a candy cane

That’s right, it’s been a long time
Since I had a man that did it real good
If you ain’t scared, take it out
I’ll do it like a real live nasty girl should
