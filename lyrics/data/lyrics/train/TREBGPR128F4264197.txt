I'm helpless

I don't understand
How I lost command of this entire situation
I do as I am told, when you take control
I'm giving in to the temptation
I've lost control, I don't know what to do
I'd sell my soul if I could stay with you

Can't get enough without your love
(I'm helpless)
I need so much without your touch
(I'm helpless)
I want you so, don't let me go
(I'm helpless)
Gotta have you, without you
(I'm helpless)
