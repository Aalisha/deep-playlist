Yeah
Uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, yeah hey, hey yeah

Whoo!

Sometimes I walk a little faster
In the school hallway
Just to get next to you
Some days I spend a little extra
Time in the morning
Dress to impress you

Guess you don't notice
Guess you don't need this
Sad you're not seein' what you're missin'
On the outside shyin' away
On the inside dyin' to say

I'm unusual
Not so typical
Way too smart to be waiting around
Tai-chi practicing
Snowboard champion
I could fix the flat on your car
I might even be a rock star
