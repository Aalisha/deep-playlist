Everybody claims that they want the best things
outta life, (ha) but not everyone, not everyone
wanna got through the toils and strifes.

Like this particular fella, walks around
all day long singin' this song
sha na lah dah dah lah dah dah dah dah

Harry Hippie, lies asleep in the shade,
life don't bug him cause he
thinks he's got it made.
He never worry about nothin' in particular
Oooh he might even sell free press on Sunset.

I'd like to help a man when he's down
but I can't help him much
when he's sleepin' on the ground.
