I have my thoughts to position
but do i know how to act?
i have no silent ambitions
but does that make me a man
until i learn all i can
and mean all i understand
as a way of living
i'm a piece of the earth
i take no offence
i can be who i am
i have no pretence
only to what you can be
if you want to be
...
