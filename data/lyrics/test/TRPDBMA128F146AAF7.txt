Informal surprise
Inforvivious
A dusty green disease
Distract and shuffling our feet
Try got to fit in where we need
Start falling in love with these things
Don't wanna know you, already know you
Already know your needs

Listen, we are go for the old ride
Listen, we are go for the old ride
Listen, yeah

No, I never get tired
Of killing time
I want a good ride
I'm go for the old ride
