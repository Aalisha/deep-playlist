Once I was lost hurtin' inside
Dangling over the edge
But the history of pain
Barely remains

Once I was blind but could it be
That the excess of light
Is shading the weary past
With the shadow it cast

And as sin gives way
To atoning blood
And a debt is paid
With the riches of love

There's a hope that I see, there's a freedom in me
There's a comfort in death and in life
...
