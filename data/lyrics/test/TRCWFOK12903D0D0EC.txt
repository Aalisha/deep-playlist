When you gaze into your polished metal plates
You picture the face of a man who longs to see his soul
But claws are claws, whether sharpened or painted or blunted
From hours of bounding, one-track-minded, through the snow
I have arrived, an exile too inferior for your highness to fight
Armored, not humored, and prepared to seize your life
The prisoner I came to rescue sits down to watch the fight
With tears in her eyes, 

Who knew a tongue could do so much harm
Lying in one's mouth?
Dancing to music that wasn't really there
Muttering about moments we never even shared
Your twisted jaw moves
But you've lost all sound
...
