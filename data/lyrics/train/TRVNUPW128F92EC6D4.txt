A year at sea, your letter came
To shatter all my plans
You set me free, changed your name
I stretch out these cold hands

On board ship the rumours ride
And no-one meets my eye
I've thrown your ring out on the tide
I pray my curses fly

To haunt you
Haunt your bed
Tap the windows, awake in dread
I'd pray that you'd loved me instead
But I'll haunt you

I've walked alone upon this deck
A thousand times or more
Half a year from my return
These cries fly back to shore

You promised me our love was strong
You said that you'd be true
Go tell yourself that I'm long gone
'Cause here's what I will do

I'll haunt you
Haunt your bed
Tap the windows, awake in dread
Pray that you'd loved me instead
