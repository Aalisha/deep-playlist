Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ooo-oh

Won't you come see about me
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out

And love's strange, surreal in the dark
Think of the tender things that we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart, baby

Don't you forget about me
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't you forget about me

Will you stand above me
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling
Rain keeps falling
Down, down, down
Will you recognize me
...
