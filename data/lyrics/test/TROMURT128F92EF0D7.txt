I come to the altar and I bow before You
You are everything my heart desires
A friend that is closer than any brother could be
I'm so amazed I can call out to You
And You hear me

Salvation has a Name
Mercy has a face
Holiness was crucified, rose to give us grace
Salvation has a Name
Mercy has a face
Jesus, our holiness
