Cab fare to nowhere
Is what you are
A white line to an exit sign
Is what you are

All that I saw in you
Now I see through

Don't shed a tear for me
My life won't end without you
(Without you)
Long as the night will be
The sun will rise without you

A locked door on a candy store
Is what you are
(Is what you are)
A slim chance in tight pants
...
