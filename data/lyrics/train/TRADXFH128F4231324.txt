One two cha cha cha, three four cha cha cha
One two cha cha cha, three four cha cha cha

I know a place where you can know all by yourself
With pretty ladies to below all by herself
It doesn't matter if you don't have much to say
Cause I've hearded more all simple matter anyway

Another cha cha!
Por favor, queremos sabor!
Another cha cha!
One takes you crazy and everyone sayin' is hot
Come on, it's hot

(Woah)
You can say: you've been working very hard (oh no)
