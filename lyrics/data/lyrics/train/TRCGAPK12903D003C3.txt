Release me
Release my body
I know it's wrong
So why am I with you now
I say release me
'Cause I'm not able to
Convince myself
That I'm better off without you

Yeah, it's perfectly clear
That it's not what you need
I tell you that I don't care
But I don't want to
Anything that you say
I hear myself agree
And I don't recognize
What I've turned into

I don't know why I want you so
'Cause I don't need the heart break
I don't know what love addictive hold
You have on me I can't shake
No, I'm not in control
So let me go

Release me
