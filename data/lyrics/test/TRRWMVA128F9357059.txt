I send for my baby and she don't come
I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
All the doctors in hot springs, they sure can't help her none

And if she gets unruly, things she don't wanna do
And if she gets unruly and thinks she don't wanna do
Take my 32-20, now, and cut her half in two

She got a 38 special but I believe it's most too light
She got a 38 special but I believe it's most too light
I got a 32-20, got to make the camps alright

I send for my baby, man, and she don't come
...
