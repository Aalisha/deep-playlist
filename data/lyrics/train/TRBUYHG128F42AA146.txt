I sing this song for you, please listen,
It's the only way I can speak to you,

Let your feelings stay so hidden,
Now you telling me: we're thru

I don't believe what I hear,
I just can't work it out.
I gave you all I had,
No questions, no doubts.

Through the door, kissed my cheek,
Waved her hand.
In the distince she cried out:
Please don't take the blame.

I'll always love you,
She said: dont look back,
Don't look back,
Don't look back on me.
