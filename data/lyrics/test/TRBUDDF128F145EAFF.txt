I won't cheat on you
I won't do it no more
Like I did before
I can't do it no more

I'm faithful to my baby
To cheat on you would be crazy
I can't cheat on you
I can't do it no more

I've been a cheater
Ever since I was 12 years old
Baby-baby, yeah, baby
But when I first laid eyes on you
I knew it was over for the other cuties
Oh, lady

I could see big girls from Amsterdam
But I'll never take the chance
'Cause I really love your, your style
There could be fine naked girls in the room
But I'm comin' home to you
'Cause you know I love you

Girl, I love your big eyes
I'm faithful to my baby
You're my one special prize
To cheat on you would be crazy
I won't cheat on you
I can't do it no more

To get respect
