Look at the mountain, look at the river
Look at the city and look at it glitter with you
'Cause every second counts in love

It's time for a shake up, so deal with your break up
And quit with the makeup just watch me take up with you
'Cause every second counts in love

Here I go
(Here I go)
Here I go
(Here I go)

Here I go
(Here I go)
Here I go
(Here I go)

Here I go
(Here I go)
Here I go, yeah

Look in the mirror, everything's clearer
You get what you're given, it's not a decision for you
'Cause every second counts in love
