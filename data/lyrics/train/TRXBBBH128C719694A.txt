All is fair
Im tryna make you notice me but you dont care

You play me like a broken game of snakes and ladders or cards or piano or a record thats been thrown in the trash

I like you, I've liked you since I saw you walking down my street
I like your little vibe
and your clothes and feet
and your hair and your eyes
and your nose and your face
and your life...

Chorus
I know your name
And I've got your number
...
