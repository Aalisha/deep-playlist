If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay

She said I Won the battle but I lost the war
And now my head is sore
And If I try to sail back in
She's gonna push me from the shore
Now I won't ever get the time of day
No way, no way, no
Not for what I said but for what I didn't say,
What I didn't say, so

If you see Kay
Will you tell her that I love her
And if you see Kay
Let her know I want her back
If she listens, say I'm missing
Everything about her
Make sure you say I'm sweet FA without her
If you see Kay

If you see my friend
Doesn't matter where or when
Tell me if you see Kay
