twenty-nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile,
coffee smell and lilac skin, your flame in me.
twenty-nine pearls in your kiss, a singing smile,
coffee smell and lilac skin, your flame in me.
i'm only here for this moment.
i know everybody here wants you.
i know every body here thinks he needs you
i'll be waiting right here just to show you
how our love will blow it all away.
