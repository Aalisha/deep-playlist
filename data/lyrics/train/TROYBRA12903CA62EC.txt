I'll wipe that smile right off of your face! 
You'll always be nothing except for a fake! 
I'll wipe that smile right off of your face! 
I'll carve you a new one with this shiny little blade! 
I'll wipe that smile right off of your face! 
You'll always be nothing except for a fake! 
Lets hope your not planning on running away from this!
