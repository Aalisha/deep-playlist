Love hearts on an old stone building
Have no relevance now
And sherry bottles in a bus-stop litter bin
Remind me of you somehow

And you look so young, it's frightening
Life's been good to you
But strike me down with bolts of lightning
If I wasn't good to you too

Throw me away, throw me away again
'Cos I don't mind, I'm still satisfied
With just a hatful of rain
...
