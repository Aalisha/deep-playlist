You, do you remember me?
Like I remember you?
Do you spend your life
Going back in your mind to that time?
Because I, I walked the streets alone
I hate being on my own
And everyone can see that, I really fell
And I'm going through hell
Thinking about you with somebody else

Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that one day you will see
That Somebody's Me
