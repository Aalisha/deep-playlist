I'm showing my hands and I'm showing my arms
Keepin' it all down here, so don't look 'round

Yes, it matters, yes there's truth
Showin' me failures, I know it's you
Swingin' like a baby, caught like a man
Mary Jesus, they call me back

Deposit insect, hand me a King
I'm going down there like a silly Joe bag
