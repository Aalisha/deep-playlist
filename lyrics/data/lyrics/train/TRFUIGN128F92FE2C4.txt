There's one man, he's like
The wishful thinking in my life, I see so
And he's like the wine on the weekend
And though he is like the sea, and it's right he'd be so
If I hold tight he'll wash over me

There's one girl I like, she's a smile on a Monday
And she'll fight to stay so
And she's like the sun on the weekend
And though she is like the sea, and it's right she'd be so
...
