I can feel the time is slipping
And there is nothing I can do to get through to you
Night after night, fight after fight
Is every inch of hope gone, or is it hiding in you
Through the laughter there's always been pain
There's only heartache and no one's to blame

[Refrain:]
I feel the change of heart
Burning inside me
It tears us apart
