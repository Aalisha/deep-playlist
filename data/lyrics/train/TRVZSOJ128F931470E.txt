I'm here to control your life
Go in and outta your life
Maybe just rise up the price
And drive you crazy

I'm here to control your life
Go in and outta your life
And if I give you a slice
I'll drive you crazy

And everything that you like
Well, do it my way
And everything that I like
Will stay the same way
And if you're willing to pay
I'll let you change me
For one day baby, baby, baby, baby

I know, you know
I'm sexy, what would you do?
Would you sacrifice it all for me?
How would you like if I woo, yeah
I need an all American cowboy

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-oh
I'm too much for you, boy
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-oh
I'm too much for you, boy

I ain't in here snapping for show
