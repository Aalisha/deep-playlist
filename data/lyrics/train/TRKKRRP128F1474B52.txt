Where the hell did you get that smile
I haven't seen one of them in a while
Cos these days, I'm such a bore,
I mope around
Like I seen it all before, but something has changed, I used to be an open heart
What have you done to me

It could have been anyone, it could have been anyone
It could have been anyone, it could have been anyone
But it wasn't you and it wasn't him, it was me who felt like a fool right then.
And I won't be the only one
It could have been anyone, yes it could
Yeah, Yeah
