What does this ship bring to me
Far across the restless sea
Waiting for the sirens' call
I've never seen it here before

There she plies a lonely trade
Cutting through the breaking waves
Drifting slowly from her course
She is lost forever more

We all want some kind of love
But sometimes it's not enough
To the wall and through the door
With a stranger on the shore

I won't desert you
I don't know what to say
I really hurt you
I nearly gave it all away

I've got it all wrong
...
