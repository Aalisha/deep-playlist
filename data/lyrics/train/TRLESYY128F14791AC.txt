Mesmerize
You're like yourself
Upon the way up high
Yes, you are
On my mind
Is this a spell I'm under
From the time we first kissed?
Fragile is the beat of my heart
Quicken up the rhythm, spark it to your touch
Every single bit of me
Wants to wake each morning besides your love
All I want
Yes, you are
All I want
Is what you got
'Cause you got sensitivity
It's all I want from you to me
Oh, oh, oh, sensitivity
