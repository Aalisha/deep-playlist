Walk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me
The more we walk together, love, the better we'll agree
We'll agree

One hand in your mouth and your finger in your eye
Undertakers bow their heads as you go walking by

Walk awhile, walk awhile, walk awhile with me
The more we walk together, love, the better we'll agree
We'll agree

Here comes another Sunday, ringing on the bell
