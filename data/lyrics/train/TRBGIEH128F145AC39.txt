Dear miss lonely hearts
I had to write this letter
To tell you how I came to meet her
She was sweet but I dated her sister
That's how I made my mistake
And I can't forget her
I felt depressed
Till a friend of mine suggested
That I write to this address
So unless you can find a cure
For my loneliness
It will persist, it will persist

Lonely boy
Looking for another
Lonely girl
To love one another
Lonely hearts
Turn to each other
Lonely souls
Lonely souls

Dear lonely boy
I doubt if my reply
Will bring much joy
It seems from your letter that you lied
Or strongly implied
That you were satisfied
To take her sister by your side
I became distressed
At your total lack of tactfulness
So at best
All I can suggest
