Screaming in silence
fast on her feet

nervously feeling fear on the street.
No moving traffic
only the odd wing in the air

a shaft of light
a strand of hair
no time
no time to despair.

There's a cat among the pigeons
there's a pain in her chest

while the cat's among the pigeons there'll be no rest.
