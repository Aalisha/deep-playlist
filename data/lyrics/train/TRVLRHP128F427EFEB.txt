And my confession would have you on the floor
- if you knew the truth
But that's the way they want you -
Everyone's a sucker for the haze of youth
We're all prairie children, brought up on the lies of the past
So it's no surprise then - you will have to ask...

Watch out Billie 'fore you go to fast
You say it couldn't hurt, but then it couldn't last
You get fifteen minutes while they're watching you
...
