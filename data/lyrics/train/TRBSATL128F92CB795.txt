Mark your body with the symbol of agony because I am the truth
Bend your head and lower your eyes because my light will shine upon you and will burn your sins
O humble man, dance during the macabre journey of your life
I'll be the only relief for your sufferings, since evil has reigned over your soul eternally
I am the saviour with the blazing sword that crashes the dragon's power
My prophets with their black cloaks will travel along the winding ways of faith
The mother's time is now over
I am the only father of this world and I will put my scals on the ancient temples
My brave warriors will cut down the profane and cursed rocks and the enemy's messengers will burn
Never more idols in the cursed forests but only shelters for your weak soul
