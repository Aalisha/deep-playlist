World out of control on the evening news
We're all screwed up and psychologically bruised
Kids killing kids make society pay
Just blow up your school and have a nice day
Reality today's much stranger than fiction
A sick fuckin' world with a violent affliction
It really, really bugs me
And it really fuckin' kills me
Live your life to the fullest and fuck everything
