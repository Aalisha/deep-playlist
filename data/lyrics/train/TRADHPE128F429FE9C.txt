Baby, ask me anything that you want
And I'll look you in the eye now
There can be no surprises
If we mean what we say
I've been around the block
And I've done some things
That I ain't so very proud of
Darlin' help me leave this cloud of
Rolling lonely behind

Naked
I'll stand naked
If you stand naked with me
I'll stand naked with you

In the morning when I look in the mirror
