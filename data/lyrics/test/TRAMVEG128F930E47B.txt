Could be she got lost
or maybe, she just watched
a little too much tv
it's hard to say, but anyway,
it's plain to see
And so she goes on
like a drifting satellite
but tonight
Chorus
angels hold her hands
when she walks in the dark
angels hold her hands
when she's falling apart
God could keep his own half-acre
...
