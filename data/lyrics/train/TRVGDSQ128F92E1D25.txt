You make me dizzy
Running circles in my head
One of these days I'll chase you down
Well look who's going crazy now
We're face to face my friend
Better get out
Better get out

You know you make me breakout
Make me breakout

I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
Know you make me breakout
