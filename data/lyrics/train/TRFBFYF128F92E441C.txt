Never letting go-o-o-o-o-o...

[CHORUS]
Never gonna let you go
Cos you're my baby
Worth more than a million in gold
Now that I've got you back
I'll never let you go
Won't be a fool anymore

Time has come
For me to open my eyes
Blinded from
When I let you go boy
Now I see a new light
I got you back in my life

Oh yeah

[CHORUS]
