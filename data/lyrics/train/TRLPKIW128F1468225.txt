Hey, oh
Hey yeah
Hey baby, hey baby

The phone is ringing
And I'm running late
I've no time to get it
'Coz I'm expecting you at eight

Heard your voice on the message
I'm surprised you called
Said you're all tied up
And you ain't comin' at all

If you're not gonna love me right
Baby don't love me at all
You're just gonna make me crazy
If you're not gonna love me right
Baby don't love me at all
If you're not gonna love me right, oh

(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)
At all
(Baby don't love, baby don't love me)
At all

Another box of roses outside on my porch
Twelve long excuses none of them stop the hurt
Where's this going, do you really care?
Is this real love, I don't know anymore I swear
