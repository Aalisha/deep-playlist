Twisted like a turnakette tighter tied around my neck
Its not just what you do it’s a lack of respect
My friends are callin' me everyone’s tellin' me
What you've been doing who you've been screwing

Here’s that last chance you get your failing every test
I can see right through you, you just don’t know it yet
But you won’t let me leave you want to strangle me
Take everything that good I want you back

Your twisted
As a liar your gifted
Cant believe you’re so twisted
Like an actor in character
I don’t know how I missed it
No matter what you do no matter what you say
I can see it more every day, every day
But I won’t take it I won’t be jaded
You think I can’t resist and that’s because
Your twisted
