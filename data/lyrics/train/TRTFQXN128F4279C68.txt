Intro: Xzibit, (J-Ro)

1996, dysfunctional member
Of the Alkaholik family, yo

Rule Number One
Always be aware of your surroundings
And peep all exits
Stay and move to the next shit
Rule Number Two
Love no one that don't love you
And if the shit come down
Then you know your way around
Rule Number Three
Realize it ain't about size
Or havin' gats and guns
Because it only takes one
Handle your business
Don't let your business handle you
It's a lot of motherfuckers tryin' to do
What you're doin' right here, right now
Same color, same style
Tryin' to claim worldwide
And ain't traveled but one mile
In these shoes, I paid dues
With nothin' to lose
Live by the rhyme
But I'ma die by the booze
Xzibit breakin' down niggas
Who got somethin' to prove
Here we are face to face
Nigga make your move
You're in the wrong place
But at the right situation
Cause i was waitin
Hotter than Satan, never perpetratin

Chorus:

I treat my enemies like friends
...
