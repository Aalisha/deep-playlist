Ooh I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
(took me by surprise I must say)
When I found out yesterday

(when I found out yesterday)
Don'tcha know that I
Heard it through the grapevine
(woo... woo...) Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh (woo... woo) I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah

(heard it through the grapevine)
not much longer would you be my baby (ooh-ooh-ooh)
