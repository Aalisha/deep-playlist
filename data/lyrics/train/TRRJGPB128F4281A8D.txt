Well, you can stay all night if you want to
You can hang out with all of his friends
You can go and meet his mother and father
Hmm, you better make sure that's where it ends

'Cause baby, there's one thing that you gotta know:
Let him read your palm and guess your sign
Let him take you home and treat you fine
But baby -
Don't let him waste your time
Don't let him waste your time

'Cause the years fly by in an instant
And you wonder what he's waiting for
