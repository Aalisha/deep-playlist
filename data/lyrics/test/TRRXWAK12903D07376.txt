Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga
Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga
Ooga-Chaka Ooga-Ooga………

I can't stop this feeling
Deep inside of me
Girl, you just don't realize
What you do to me
When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let me know

Everything's all right, I…
I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
That you're in love with me
