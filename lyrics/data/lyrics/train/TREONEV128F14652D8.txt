You want to know what's all inside of me
Well, just give me your best shot
You try and take it all away from me
Well, here you go

I hate to say I told you so
That I'll never fucking let it go
I'll tell you something
That you outta know again so

I fucking hate it when you let me now
All your problems fucking let 'em go
I'll tell you something that you outta know again so
