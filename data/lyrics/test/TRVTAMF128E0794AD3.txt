When it comes to lovin'
Has it always let you down?
Every time you've fallen in
Did someone else fall out?
I know about that
That's the only kind of love I ever had
Ooh, I need somethin' to hold on to
How about you?
Could you tell some stories
About stories you've been told?
All the lines your heart's been thrown
