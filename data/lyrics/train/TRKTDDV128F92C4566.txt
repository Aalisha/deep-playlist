Man cock that shit
Yo man, this nigga Cassidy frontin'
Oh that nigga think he sweet
Yo not for nothin', that video shit and all that
Fuck that

Where my niggaz at? Huh, cock that yo
Squeeze them triggas back, huh, pop that yo
If I gotta, I'm a pop a nigga, lay a nigga down
I ain't playin', I'll spray a nigga, lay a nigga down

Where my niggaz at? Huh, cock that yo
Squeeze them triggas back, huh, pop that yo
If I gotta, I'm a pop a nigga, lay a nigga down
I ain't playin', I'll spray a nigga, lay a nigga down

Niggaz ain't ready to die, they ready to tell
That's why my squad ready to ride and ready for jail
They'll give you every in the shell in the K
A couple rounds from the pipe'll make it sound like Independence Day

And I could talk that gun shit 'cause I done shit
My nick name should be Diarrhea how I run shit
And I done seen niggaz guns spit over dumb shit
I got a young bitch named Nina that you could tongue kiss

When it come to this gun shit, I'm the man son
Niggaz gon' show me respect 'cause I demand some
I play with bullets 'bout as big as my damn thumb
And I'll spit the AR handgun till my hand numb

I ain't a hypocrite who spit shit he never did
I'm a speak the truth whether positive or negative
Don't get me wrong, I put songs that was conscious out
But I'll still grab the Thompson and blow you conscience out
