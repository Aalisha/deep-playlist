[sample: Richard Pryor]
I was on the Chain Gang... Chain Gang, Chain Gang
Always on about the Chain Gang... man, the Chain Gang
That was a hell of a thing

[Intro: Hell Razah]
Renaissance Child... dedicated to Nat Turner
A true Maccabean rebel... yo, let me tell ya this story

[Hell Razah:]
They had us handcuffed on them sea ships, since the days of Egypt
Now it's sitting in a racist precent
Black Hebrews from centuries ago, young Negros
With dark skin and afros, who built castles
White halo's on black Anglo's, who were sold
Like Joseph, by his own brother, later on, to free his own mother
We only suffer cause the God love us
Give it to the hands of blood suckers
A lost tribe that was undiscovered
Until the British came and bumrushed us
What you think my desert eagle's for?
That's why Moses told Pharaoh, 'let his people go'
Until this day, that same evil grows
From oversears, the Ceasars, the black CO's
In the prison cell, living hell, naked and cold
You feel the chills when you hear them keyholes
All your freedom get closed, in the end, we all reap what we sow
