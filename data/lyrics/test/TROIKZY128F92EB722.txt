Yeah...!
In a world of hate pollution
We can't breathe anymore.
We've to leave and this time you
The pawn, have won.
On our quest for nowhere island
We set off to the sea.
You call surrender what we call a calm
Before the storm...

Pounding thoughts of home they make me know:
"I will return! I don't live my life for you.
It's too short to get burned.
Stand upright and face the wind!"

Time to go back where I belong...
No one can prevent me
From raising towers in Babylon.
Time to go back where I belong...
No one can accuse me
For I do not fear
Babylon!
