Sh, sh, ahh, Sh, sh, ahh,
Sh, sh, ahh, Sh, sh, ahh,

Ridin' along on my pushbike, honey
When I nowhere near you
Round down town, in a hurry honey,
Now, I've got my sights on you
You look so pretty, she was ridin' along,
You look so pretty, She was singing this song,'.

Ahh,
Sh, sh, ahh, Sh, sh, ahh,
Sh, sh, ahh, Sh, sh, ahh,

Puttin' on speed, as I tried catchin' up but you
Were pedaling harder, too
