Over the sea and far away
She's waiting like an Iceberg
Waiting to change
But she's cold inside
She wants to be like... the water.

All the muscles tighten in her face
Buries her soul in one embrace
They're one and the same, just like water
Then the fire fades away

But most of everyday
Is full of tired excuses
But it's too hard to say
I wish it were simple

But we give up easily
...
