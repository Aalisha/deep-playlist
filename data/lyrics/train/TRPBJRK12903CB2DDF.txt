Now we have come into the party
to occupy
a space provided by the public eye
cuz you've waited and waited
and finally
we've returned with a funky beat
that'll go up yo spine
grab yo brain
relax yo body
easy any pain
but we're here in gold, and red and black
you guessed it
THE FAT BOYS ARE BACK
The fat boys are back
And you know they can never be whack
The fat boys are back
fat boys are back
And you know they can never be whack
the fat boys are back (do you lie to the fat boys?)
I'm starving I'm in the mood
plain and simple I NEED FOOD
Eat some beans and very soon everybody in the place
will leave the room
for some reason I can't reveal
pass a bananna so I can peel
slide to the kitchen
stuff my face
leaving not one crumb in the place
I can bust riff rafs back to back
...
