Where did you come from?
High in the sky, you're the sun
I've been waiting for someone like you
Where did you come from?

I came from the wind, came from the seas/
Came from kings, came from queens/
Provided means to express what's seen/
I'm the hope that will gleam/
When things seem useless/
Futile, fruitless/
I'm hoping you can use this, the truth can be ruthless/
You're launching your attack, then you need some theme music/
Expressing your emotions in sync with the oceanic/
Tide -- believe but gonna grind, don't panic/
I could be frantic or maybe mellow and soothing/
No matter what tempo, with form I'm still moving/
I move Bob Marley and I moved Etta James/
Then they claim when the fire breaks out, I'm to blame/
Same people who raised hell in their youth/
Now they got all types of advice to tell you/
Do what you feel if your actions are real/
Then you shall find glory when the truth is revealed/
Just follow your call and when your visions are done/
Then wander ...
