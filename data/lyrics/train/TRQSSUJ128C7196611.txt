Tied to the tracks and the trains just coming,
Strapped to the wing with the engine running,
You say that this wasnt in your plan,
Dont mess around with the demolition man,

Tied to a chair, and the bomb is ticking,
This situation was not of your picking,
You say that this wasnt in your plan,
Dont mess around with the demolition man,

Im a walking nightmare, an arsenal of doom,
I kill conversation as I walk into the room,
...
