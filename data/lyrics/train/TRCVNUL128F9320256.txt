From the corners of the country
From the cities and the farms
With years and years of living
Tucked up underneath their arms

They walked away from everything
Just to see a dream come true
So god bless the boys who make the noise
On 16th Avenue

With a million dollar spirit
And an old flattop guitar
They drive to town with all they own
In a hundred dollar car

'Cause one time someone told them
About a friend of a friend they knew
Who owns you know a studio
On 16th Avenue
