Doesn't it make you nervous
At least you could have tried
And if it doesn't disturb us
Couldn't we just sit by
And make a pact to ignore it
All of our secret needs
Becoming connected further
Giving a life to feed on

You let them decide
The course of my life
And you just stood by
You threw me aside
