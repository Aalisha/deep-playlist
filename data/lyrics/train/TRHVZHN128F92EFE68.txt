To steal him's been your number one ambition
But sister here's one safe that you don't have to crack
I'll hand him over under one condition
A deal's a deal and you can't give him back

Cause he's a good ole boy
Good for nothing
Good at lying, good at loving
Good at leaving
When the rent comes due
He's a good ole boy and I'm a good ole girl
So I'll give him to you
...
