Ooh ooh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ooh ooh

Old river and your
Restless wonder and your
Graceful leisure rollin' to the sea
How many men have
Stood like I am?
Gazing out and wishing for someone
And some are living and
Some are dead and
Some are hidin', waitin' for the sun

Nature is the law, baby
Nature is the law, now baby now
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh)
Nature is the law, baby
Nature is the law, now baby now
(Ohh ohh ohh ohh, ohh ohh ohh)

Aaa aaa aaa
Ohh ohh ohh

The old river with your
Restless swagger and your
Graceful wonder flowin' to the sea
 (Ohh ohh ohh)
(Ohh)
I am beggin' you to
(Ohh)
