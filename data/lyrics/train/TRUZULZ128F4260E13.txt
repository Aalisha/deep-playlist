Some stupid chick in the checkout line
Was paying for beer with nickels and dimes
And some old man had clipped coupons
And argued whenever they wouldn't take one
All I wanted to buy were some cigarettes
But I couldn't take it anymore, so I left
I hate everyone
I hate everyone

I hate everyone
I hate everyone

All the people on the street
I hate you all
And the people that I meet
I hate you all
And the people that I know
I hate you all
And the people that I don't
I hate you all
Oh, I hate you all
