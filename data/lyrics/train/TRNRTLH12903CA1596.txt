Boy I never knew I could feel
The way I felt, when I felt the way
you were feeling me baby
I'm so out of control yeah...

Everytime you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes
Of yours, I'm helpless baby

What I wanna know is
Are you willing to try
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night
Ohh...

Baby I love you (love you)
Baby I need you (need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you babe)
Can't be without you (be without you)

Baby I love you (yeah...)
Baby I need you (need You...)
...
