As we lift up our hands
Will you meet us here
As we call on your name
Will you meet us here
We have come to this place
to worship You
God of Mercy and Grace

It is you, we adore
It is you, praises are for
Only you
The Heavens declare
it is you
it is you

Holy, Holy is our God Almighty
Holy, Holy is His name alone
Holy, Holy is our God Almighty
Holy, Holy is His name alone

It is you
We adore
