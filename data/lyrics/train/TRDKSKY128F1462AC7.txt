Ready, Steady, Go
I'm not in love with television
I'm not in love with the radio
I'm not in love with the Kings Road
Because I'm in love with Cathy McGowan - she said

Ready steady go - all things she said
Ready steady go - wasn't it fabulous
Ready (ready) steady (steady) go

I'm not in love with Juke Box Jury
