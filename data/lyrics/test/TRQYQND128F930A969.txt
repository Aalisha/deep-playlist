Sunlight is drowning the halflight
As the feelings return
Strange and familiar a nocturnal fear
Appearing and disappearing

There is the river running deep
And it is floating through the veins
A nameless dread of the unknown
Temporary sight an apprehension
Vague yet saddening

Black angels guiding me
The sum of all my fears
Black angels owning me
Whispering through me

The ties are loosening
