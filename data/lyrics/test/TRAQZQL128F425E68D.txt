I'll buy you one more Frozen Orange Juice
On this fantastic day
We'll walk the sunny hills of Madrid
Laughing all the way

And if you feel you wanna, run down the beach
A place that no one else has ever seen before

Well, I'll pick a flower from the road and
And place it in your heart
We will hold our breath together
