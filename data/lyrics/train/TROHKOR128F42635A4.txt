Drunk, gettin' the hell out of my way
You know all good time
And I need your [Incomprehensible] today
Hey, please do good job for me
Yeah, let's see it, yeah

Well, I'm a damn straight shootin' man
Ride with a gun in my hand
Lookin' for a girl who'll understand
Don't wants responsibility

I don't care about holes in jeans
I gotta get out tonight and see
Hope I don't get in a fight
Just because I grabbed some nice ass that don't belong to me

I met a woman that said, I stunk
I got a speed stick, damn, you're drunk

She felt good 'round her ass and thigh
She grabbed me low, I grabbed her high
Said, "Take me backstage, pretty please
Just let me finish up this here drink"
Sat there about to change my mind
When she turned and said, "Honey child"

Take me drunk, I'm home
Take me drunk, I'm stoned
