Well you deserve only the best in me
Without you I've lost it all
I know I've taken for granted all these years
The things that seem so small

And I'd give anything for one more
Just one more try
To notice the things I'm holding on to
Right now in my mind

'Cause I'm missing you tonight
Till I finally close my eyes
I am caught up in this moment, so caught up
'Cause you're right here by my side

You always did bring out the best in me
That part of me has died
I know I couldn't even live my life
...
