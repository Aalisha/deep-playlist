Look around
Tell me what you see
Have you found what you wanna be?

And would you like to be a real go-getter?
Would that make you feel a whole lot better?
I really don't mean to sound unkind
But I've just gotta say you've been wasting my time

Do you know what you do to me?
Does it show? Baby, can't you see?
That all I need is some good, good lovin'
Instead of that, I get this push-and-shovin'

Sit down, we gotta draw the line
I've got to tell ya, you've been wastin' my time
You say that we're doin' just fine
I've got to tell ya, you've been wastin' my time
