Oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh (4x)

Love's, oh, so strong, love's, oh, so long
For such a long time
And I'd better be alone
Where would I be if you decided to leave me?
Don't you go, cause you mean everything to me

Wanna hold ya, wanna love ya
Ooh, oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh, all night long
Wanna hold ya, wanna love ya
Feeling strong
Oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh, all night long
Wanna hold ya, wanna love ya
Feeling strong, strong

What would I do if we were through?
I don't want no one else
Don't want nobody new, new
What you give don't go to waste
You got the type of love
That cannot be replaced

Don't you know? Don't you know?
Don't you know? Don't you know?
I still want you?
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
I still love you?
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
I still want you?
Don't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?
