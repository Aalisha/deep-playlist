Eat your beets, recycle... recycle...
Don't eat your beets, recycle... recycle

The message is; 'THERE IS NO MESSAGE'

Babe, you better not ever think,
Staring into the drink... get out of my mind...
Cause I may not be the one to say,
is there no other way we could do this another day?

I saw God.

She said...'If you don't believe me, guaranteed you'll never leave me'
On my way, and out of your time
But I didn't even know if it was true or just a result of chemicals

Shut up and think of something more important to say...
'Sometimes I think that in every straight there's a gay!'
Something or nothing a whole either way it's a way,
it's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way
EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY, EARTH DAY
...
