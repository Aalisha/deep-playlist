Can't Stand In The Way Of Love

It stops... never

Meant to be
You and me
Unconcious love
Love is a attraction
It's so hot
What we've got
Like a chemical reaction

So how can it be so suddenly
You treat me like a stranger
Remember, remember when
You told me I
I made you feel so alive

You can't stand in the way of love
You can't stand in the way of love
Like a river to the ocean
Can't stop this emotion
You can't stand in the way of love
