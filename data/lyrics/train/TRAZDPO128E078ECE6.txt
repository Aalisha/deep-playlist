Come 'ere, baby
You know you drive me up the wall
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got someone on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?
Say you're leavin' on the seven-thirty train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl, you been givin' me the line so many times
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good, yeah
That kinda lovin'
Turns a man to a slave
That kinda lovin'
Sends a man right to his grave
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
