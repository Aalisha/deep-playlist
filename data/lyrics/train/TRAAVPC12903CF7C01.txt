i'm an honest guy i've got no reason to lie
you're a superstitious girl you put a spell on the world

the conversations great yeah i can tell
things are moving fast like a bat out of hell
i can lose my step here for you front foot forward to find

your positions good
for making skeleton stew
sh sh she got the numbers in her neck
and now she's reaching for you
