We got a 747 coming down in the night
There's no power, there's no runway lights
Radio operator try to get a message through
Tell the flight deck New York has no lights
There's no power, what do we do
A 747 coming down in the night
Try to get a message through
We were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights
Stangers in the night
Going nowhere
We were strangers in the night
Both on separate flights
Stangers in the night
Going nowhere

This is Scandinavian 101
Flight from Hawaii coming out of the sun
Kennedy, you should be in sight
We can't see a thing here in the night
