Well, I don't know where I'm goin'
And I don't even care
But from tomorrow mornin'
You won't find me anywhere
I'll be gone, long gone

You'll be callin' me back girl
But I'll be makin' tracks
Baby, I'm gone

Baby, I'm leaving on the next thing smokin'
This time, I'm gone and I ain't jokin'
Western, Delta, Continental
Amtrak, Greyhound, Avis Rental
...
