YOUR PRETTY BROWN EYES, YOUR WAVY HAIR,
I WON'T GO HOME NO MORE, 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT THERE.
I'M TELLING YOU NOW LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU,
DON'T LEAVE ME NO MORE.

LIPSTICK TRACES ON A CIGARETTE,
EVERY MEMORY LINGERS WITH ME YET.
I GOT IT BAD LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU,
DON'T LEAVE ME NO MORE.

(Won't you come on home?)
WON'T YOU COME ON HOME?
