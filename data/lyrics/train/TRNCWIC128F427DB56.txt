He rides the night like a shadowy bat
He seeks his next victim a crazed maniac
His steed is a demon equine made of hate
When you hear his gallop it shall be too late!

Beware! Beware the headless man!
Take care! Protect your neck my friend!

Through the fog you now approach your doom
The headless rider as cold as the tomb
