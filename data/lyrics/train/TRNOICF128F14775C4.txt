Warm night, can't sleep, too hurt, too weak
Gotta call her up
Dial that, number, no one, answers
Till it's two o'clock

And if by chance, you let me come over
Out on the street, I want to see ya baby
And if by chance you let me just hold ya
I'm down on my knee, I wanna please ya baby, I
[I'll be your righteous lover]

She said â€œSugar, Honey, Darlin'
I really wanna see ya too
It's just that someone's, over, and baby
I really wanna be with chu'

But if by chance you let me just hold ya
I'm calling I'm free, I wanna see ya baby
When in need you said you would be here
And you hold the key
To my very being baby and I
[I... love you, baby]

If you are that special lover
