A Little country church on a two lane road
The bride and the groom comin' out the door
White lace dress and a red bouquet
Just married written on a blue Chevrolet

Don't that make you want to fall in love
Don't that look like a picture of us
A match made in heaven if there ever was
Don't that make you wanna fall
That just makes me wanna give you my heart
...
