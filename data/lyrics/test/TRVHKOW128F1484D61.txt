Forty winks in the lobby,
make mine a G&T
Then to our favorite hobby,
searching for an enemy
Here in our paper houses,
stretching for miles and miles
Old men in stripy trousers rule the world with plastic smiles

Good or bad, like it or not
It's the only one we've got

I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
...
