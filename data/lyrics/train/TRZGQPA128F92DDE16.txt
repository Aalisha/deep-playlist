Do you remember
Before the rain came down
You were so full of life
So bring that right back round

It's a rainy day
It's a rainy day
It's a rainy day
It's a rainy day

Billy was a youth on the way to school
Hum an him bredin
Deh ina everything togeda
Gyal dem catchin'
Go ina di club a night time
Bubblin' pan di rydim
After the school year
Done Billy did loose sight of him
Many many time pas by
An him hear
Him friend hustin'
Drop ina di trap fi di double
An him recieve bullit
Billy feel bad bredin dead an bury
It's a rainy da
Yeah the sun will shine
It's a rainy day
