So what happens in your room
when youre all alone
with me at home going crazy over you
behind these bedroom walls
every night I sing along
with all her favorite songs
I sing until my voice is gone
until my lungs are bleeding
tell me you don't miss these brown eyes
and that you're not in love.

Chorus:
Take this stupid heart
I know it's all you ever want me for
and I hope you keep it close
...
