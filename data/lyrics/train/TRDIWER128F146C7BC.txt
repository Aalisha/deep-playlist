When your hand brushed against mine, I thought I'd collapse
I'm no rolling stone, I gather too much moss
Maybe it's 'cos I'm gettin' a little bit older
But oh, how your neck flows to your shoulder
It draws me, it draws me to your flame

I wanna be near you and blink in your light
And toast marshmallows on a cold dark night
I wanna be near you and blink in your light
And toast marshmallows on a cold dark night
Your flesh it melts in my mouth like Holy Communion

But you don't really care for Jesus now do you?
A photograph of this love hangs on my wall
I would dare to speak its name, if I knew what it was called
I would dare to speak its name, if I knew what it was called
Rattle the one whose shadow you're standin' in
...
