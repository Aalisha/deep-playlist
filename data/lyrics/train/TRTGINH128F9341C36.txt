You see my mind gets to clickin' / and the light started blinkin' / pen steady leakin' / next thing "Oh we've got a song" / and time keeps on slippin' our survival seeming distant, but progression is a lesson / and thus we move along / and I remember Easter when my Mom gave me that boom box / boxing out the world every time I heard a tune knock / Knocking on my door got no response / I was lost in a small room in a small apartment in Boston / My own universe withs bouncing off the wall in reverb / pop quiz / do you remember these words? / " I'm the King of Rock!" / and til this day there is none / back when musicians flaunted styles that hadn't been done / and era to treasure / I pay homage when I put a pen to / the paper / drop a jewel to school you later / vapor catches word matches assemble thoughts (visions) / wisdom leaking through my pen / speaking volumes / tunes remind me blindly seeing life in 2 dimensions (inventions) / amplifying what I mention / word, syllable, sentence / Sent this to a million folks I never met / they regard it as an ancient epithet / and they haven't even read it yet / etiquette pertaining to predicate / my actions attracting interactions from factions seeking rations / Cash and jewels escape me as I walk the streets faintly / panicking lately / usually a calm Brother / I suffer / from the stress and duress of the windows that I see closing / never know which ones will be open / and I keep hoping for a little rest / but it doesn't seem to be in my cards / so I wake up and I work hard / hardly sleeping / fans needing more of the raw / they tell me never stop / well I can't promise I'll forever drop / However by request / from your favorite chef / another rhyme written near death / a data platter served best / on a sunny day drive with some weed in your chest / or in the dead of winter when you've got some time to invest / more or less horrorfest awaits those who hesitate / and miss their calling in life / this time it's too late / But for now / recognize that God bless the child / with style / support my records / keep me on file / and I'll bring forth / with sincerity of course / some descriptions of my missions as I'm plotting my course
