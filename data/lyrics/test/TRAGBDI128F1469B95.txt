From the canyons of the mind
whe wander on and stumble blindly
through the often tangled maze
of starless nights and sunless days
while asking for some kind of clue,
a road to lead us to the truth
but who will answer.
Side by side two people stand
together vowing hand in hand
that love's embedded in their hearts.
But soon an empty feeling starts
to overwhelm their hollow lives
and when they seek the "hows" and "whys"
who will answer.
On a strange and distant hill
a young man's lying very still,
his arms will never hold his child
because a bullet running wild
has struck him down! and now we cry
"Dear God! oh why, oh why"
but who will answer.
