You never ask me the right questions
And love's informers wouldn't give you a hand
We don't see eye-to-eye
Now you know the way to walk on by
Don't let the pirates steal the limelight from your heart on

Desert island discs
All the hits you missed and more on
Desert island discs
You're the miss that I shit out on
You're not number one, now it's me
Ooh, yeah

You are someone I am still proud of
But pride looks on to see me
Down on my knees
Far as the eye can see
There's night and day and me
...
