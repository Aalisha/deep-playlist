We've had it good for years now
Don't let that change
We've never needed answers
To find the way

Now all of a sudden
Like waves on a beach
Love has come crashing down
The truth has been lost and found

Don't say it's love, baby
'Cos you are to me what you want to be
Don't say it's love, no baby
If our friendship is to survive, don't say it's love

We've shared so many secrets
Now kiss and tell
...
