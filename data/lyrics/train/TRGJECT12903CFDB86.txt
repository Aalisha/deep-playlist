Some motherfucker gon' do today. Got shit to do. Got shit to do.

Now everybody used to tell me, "Go to school."
Down what I was doing and treat me like a fool
I've always been a cool cat even when I had no friends
You see I dreaded in the F and lived it up on the weekends
I wasn't freakin' them Thursday nights, right
Had to get up in the mornin'
No time for night life
Full schedule of classes and work after that
Used to jerk on my dick cause I had no time to mack
I knew I couldn't be a college MC
Man, I want this world and knowledge in me
And that starts today
Mark the way, I say my words in a text book
I can write an essay but if you gave me less than an A...
You weren't fuckin' with the way that I think
I'd rather travel the globe then study to be a shrink
Or a lawyer or a doctor, man that's proper but it's not me
I got to be
Chillin' in my spot free of stress
I see the best road and I'ma take it
Make it easy to succeed cause I got something you need
Time to get my shit straight
Write my poems
No bustle in my hustle, just muscle in my dome
Foamin' at the mouth in front of mics for bein' hype
I used to say I was a rapper and they try to take me light
Weight/wait, I drop heavy shit
Always ever ready with the verse to kick in any situation
