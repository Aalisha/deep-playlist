You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life

See that girl, watch that scene
Diggin' the dancing queen

Friday night and the lights are low

Looking out for a place to go

Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king

Anybody could be that guy

Night is young and the music's high
