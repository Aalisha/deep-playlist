Chorus:
Love and devotion, baby
I can't get enough of all that love and devotion in my life.
Love and devotion, baby love and devotion,
You are the sunshine of my life.

When a man loves a woman, a woman loves a man,
Love and devotion gotta keep it if you can.
A kiss, a smile, even when you cry,
Everybody knows that we need it once awhile.
So come on come on, you gotta keep it if you can.
Love and devotion is the master plan.
I'm talking about I'm talking about a wonderful emotion,
I'm talking about a game called love and devotion.
Tonight is the night, when love shines so bright, and we will be reunited.
