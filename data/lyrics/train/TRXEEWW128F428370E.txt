I get down to dry my hair
with a little touch of gel
I read all the newspapers
but my mother still reads my mail

I won? t wish my life away but
tell me if you can
Who decides when I? m grown up
and I? ve turned into a man

Drop the boy drop the boy
I? m a man, yes I am
but they still call me boy
Drop the boy drop the boy
I? m a man, yes I am
and I? ll be jumping for joy
...
