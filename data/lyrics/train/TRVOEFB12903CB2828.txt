Take the time to touch the morning
Whoa, you'll wish you had some day
Take the time to touch the morning
Before it slips away

Have you ever seen the sunshine
Peepin' through a window glass
Have you ever noticed Jack Frost
Etched so lightly on your grass

Have you ever tasted apples
With the dew still on the skin
Have you ever loved somebody
You'll never see again
