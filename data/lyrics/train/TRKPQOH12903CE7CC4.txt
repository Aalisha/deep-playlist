Driving on, it's been so long.
My letters never say,
I think of you, and all the times we've made.
Up and down this lonely road,
Horizon's getting old.
And all I ever wanted, is waiting at home.

I can't wait to see you,
Again.
I can't wait to see you,
Again.

Best I can is love you,
Do everything this way.
