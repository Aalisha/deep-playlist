Cold and silent
Soiled face
I will wash it all away
With my love
That's all she's ever needed
From me
It's my time
To mother
One of my own
In my life
I am so alone
Left with no one
In my life
I'm so alone

Life submissiveness
Hypnotizing the ignorant
A little boy's best friend's always his mother
At least that's what she said
Life
Of a simple man
Taught that everyone else is dirty
And their love is meaningless
I'm just a soiled dirty boy
I'm just a soiled dirty boy

Sheltered life
Innocence
Insulated memories
Spark reflections of my head
Duality in my consciousness
Caught in the war of hemispheres
Between the love lost in my head

Mommy do you still live inside of me?
I'm so lost in my life without any guiding
Protected me my whole life from everything
Nailed shut the doors to the shrine
To screen your dead eyes from me
For sickness, I'm masticating
Dancing and masturbating
...
