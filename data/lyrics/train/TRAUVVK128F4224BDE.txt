Late night walk,
you're not allowed to talk.
About shape and form,
about my surface rust.
I'll be sure not to sing your praise too loud,
and i'll be sure not to build you up too fast,
and i'll be sure not to say your name at all,
and i'll be sure not to build you up too fast.

You've got those sculptor's hands,
...
