I paid first and last month's rent
I wondered why I even carried in this old bed of mines
'Cause it's not like I ever sleep
All I do is think of her and wonder how I'm gonna make things work
'Cause I know as a dad I got a lot of responsibility

And even though God gave this gift to the both of us
Somehow every other weekend is how it ended up

'Cause when the telephone rings I drop everything
'Cause when all you got is at 8 o'clock
Night, night daddy, miss you a lot
