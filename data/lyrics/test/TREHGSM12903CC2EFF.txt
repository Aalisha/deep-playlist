You pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister, and your mama too
Cuz we're about to go down
And you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Gilde by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick mama
Come on baby tell me what's the word

Word up everybody says
When you hear the call you've got to get it underway
Word up it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJ's who think you're fly
...
