Outside, wild winds are calling
Broken leaves are falling

Outside, wild winds are calling
Broken leaves are falling
Like I fall before you
Outside, nightfall is returning
Our home fires are burning
Like I burn before you
Wind, and pray they blow
Will we watch them come and go

Don't go
And in my heart I held you just for awhile
Don't go
And in my eyes I see the love of your child
Don't go
You can deny you feel the call of the wild
Call of the wild
