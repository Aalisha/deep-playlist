I was lost in paradise
I was washed ashore
I was praying someone
Would walk right through that door
I was hung in effigy
I was flayed alive
I was lost and lonely
And struggling to survive.
Say that you need me
Say that you care
Say you believe in me
Say it, say it, say it
And I'll be there, oh yeah.
