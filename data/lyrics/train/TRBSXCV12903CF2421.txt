Forever we go into the glorious light
And there is no turning back for us, forever more
Together we rise, we will become strong again
And we'll be forever true, or die

When we fight it is for all mankind
For life, forever more

Help us to be the future, to reach the stars
And to be embraced by light
If we just stand together then we might break
The chains, help us fight (help us fight)
