Seems a little bit odd when you think about how the way he used to
Certain things that you did when you were with me but not with him or are you?
Looking for a purpose in the time we spend with me you argue
I don't want to be the man you used to have but in a brand new forum

So many times I let this go
But I won't let you do this

You tried to turn me into him
I will not stand for this again
I've held my thoughts inside my head
But now I'm leaving

I was hoping maybe things would change but I guess it's just the way you are
