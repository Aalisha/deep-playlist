Do you read me?
Do you read me loud?
Do you hear me coming to you now baby?
I'm a chopped off head
Cruising at the speed of sound
Spitfiring in the air
Transmitting to the ground
See I'm a projectile baby
Radio controlled
And when I call out your name
It releases me from pain
I'm a blood-hot comet
Going to see my rendez-vous
