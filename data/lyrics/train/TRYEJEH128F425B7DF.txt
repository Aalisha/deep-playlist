Early morning, without warning
Woke me with a scare
I had that dream again
That the Sun was dead

Make me warm or take me home
It's so cold in here
Can't we meet somewhere?
Is it winter there?
Is it winter there?
This winter

Meet me in the summertime
We can move the air
Sweet Virginia countryside
I will meet you there
Blood and lips and cherry wine
Moonshine in your hair
...
