Close your eyes
Maybe someone will apologize
Maybe someday you will hear what I'm
Whispering at the top of my lungs

Ego cursed
I feel bad about not feeling worse
Come on kiss me on the honeyburst
Whispering at the top of my lungs
Whispering at the top of my lungs

Someday I'd like to forgive you
Someday I'd like to regret
