Had so much to give you, had so many plans
For our future happiness, isn't that the role of a man
I knew that I could provide everything you need
All I wanted was a little time, then to you I could commit

So, you waited on me believing in all my dreams
I didn't think I'd have to learn in the worst way

Why wait till tomorrow, you got a good thing right now
Baby, 'cause tomorrow may not ever come around
