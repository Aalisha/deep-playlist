We met in the winter 
And we fell in love 

Right by a fire place 
We shared our first embrace 
And then inside my heart 
I felt a fire start 
It's gonna snow outside 
The weather will be cold 
But I'm gonna be warm (ho ho) this winter 

Each time your lips touch mine 
They taste like sparkling wine 
I feel so warm and loved 
Just cause I love you so 
...
