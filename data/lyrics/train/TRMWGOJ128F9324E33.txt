I am a Christian, do you know what that means?
It means I'm far from perfect but simply redeemed
I was bought with a purpose, purchased by love
It's not a form of religion, but a gift from above
I am not perfect, I have been redeemed

I am a believer, listen do you know what that means?
It means I've pledged my life, I gave Him everything
And just to know He loves someone like me
'Cause I am not perfect but I have been redeemed, redeemed

While I was yet in my transgressions
Somebody paid the price for me
I offered up my life to Him and now I say again
I am not perfect but simply redeemed
