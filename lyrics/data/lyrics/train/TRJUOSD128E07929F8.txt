You want to suffer and show me you're angry.
Fight with your fists up or call for you mommy.
You want to suffer and show me you're angry.
Spend time alone find a stick in the basement.
Drink water and gold dust and live on impatience.
Slaughtered for weakness electric like static.
Slaughtered you're weak there's no need to speak.
You chang your shoelaces.
I light firecrackers.
You step on the sparks.
You change your shoelaces,
I light firecrackers.
I shouldn't be any great inspiration,
I never got in your way.
I should never have to chase you.
