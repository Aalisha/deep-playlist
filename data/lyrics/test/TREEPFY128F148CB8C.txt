Yeah yo Def Squad, Full Cooperation on this one
Yo total concentration
Wassup wit these cats out there?
I don't think they figured son
I don't think they hear you son ha ha

Now first but not least you will respect Keith
Lay a nigga down like a doo rag in some grease
You must be crazy tryin' to play me
I been dedicated since king tut the third baby

Lyrical chemist rhyme minister, diminished you for the benefit
Then continue to kill shit for the fuck of it, I see y'all been writin'
Still bitin', still lookin' lame, half y'all niggaz still soundin' the same
I'm excitin' when live on stage
When recitin' in lighting, frightening lightning
Throwin' thunder in chain

When I first came, I gave birth to a million M C's in the game
Who should all carry my last name
And I'm gonna get you sucka like Damon Wayans
And fame like Jermaine bring pain and novacaine
Okay y'all lil monkeys wanna play?
My squadron brings the art of war the correct way

I need your full cooperation and total attention
