Standing in the Sun, gazing at a new day
Filling in the blanks, just another Monday
Waiting for a plane, take me down there under
Waiting for the past, waiting for the wonders

Take it to the skies, make it to the big cloud
Far below the sea, far away the runner
Think about the speed, dream about the distance
Far out to the East, leave behind all western
