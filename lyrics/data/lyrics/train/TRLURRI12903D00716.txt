Trapped Inside And Filled With Fear,
He's Sitting In His Chair.
So Lonely And So Cold, But He Knew.
'cause' All Those Years With All Those Tests
Had Finally Shown Result.
That They Are Not Alone,
Repentance For What He Had Done.

It Seems Like It Won't End, I Don't Know What To Do.
It Feels Like It Won't End, I Don't Know What To Do.
Doesn't Matter If I Try To Close My Eyes.

Even Every Second Is Too Much For Me To Take.
Losing My Mind In A Room This Dark.
Please Make Them Go Away.

So Many Years, Now You Are Here.
When You Replied, All Pleased Inside.
There Is Nothing Else That We Can Do.
