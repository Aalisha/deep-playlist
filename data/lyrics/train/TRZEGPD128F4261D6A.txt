Every mornin' I wake up, the first thing I remember,
is all the things I said the night before.
Then I look in the mirror, stop myself pretendin'.
All I have is worth a whole lot more.

It doesn´t matter what you do,
as long as I can be with you.
I know we're gonna see this through.
it´s all about love.

Every time that I'm with you, I capture every moment,
just in case this world should fall apart.
And I don´t wanna lose you, you can hear me callin'.
I can´t change what happened in the past.
