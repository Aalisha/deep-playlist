Pop pop pop that bottle top, let your body rock
? Cause the beat don? t stop stop stop
Pop pop pop that bottle top, let your body rock
? Cause the beat don? t stop stop stop

We? re chillin? again I wanna be more than a friend
? Cause you? re takin' me to places I never been before
Feelin? like I? m yearing for a little more

And I wanna begin to build with you, let it do what it do
? Cause we been talkin? and kissin? and touchin? like every night
If that? s wrong I don? t wanna be right

Pop pop pop that bottle top, let your body rock
? Cause the beat don? t stop stop stop
Pop pop pop that bottle top, let your body rock
? Cause the beat don? t stop stop stop
