You got me feeling bad
You always make me sad
You never treat me right
You always wanna fight

But I love you so,
I'll never let you go, oh no
It ain't no good, it's true,
But you knows what to do

Oh yeah, you alright
Oh yeah, you alright

Always telling lies and you're making me cry,
Do me wrong, you stay out way too long

I can't put you down
...
