I preach my dear friends you are about to receive on John Barley
Corn, nicotine and the temptations of Eve.

No parking by the sewer sign
Hotdog my razor broke
Water dripping up the spout
But I don't care
Let it all Hang Out

Hanging from a pine tree by my knees
Sunshine through the shade
Nobody knows what it's all about
It's too much man
Let it all Hang Out

Saw a man walking upside down
My TV's on the blink
Make Galileo look like a boy scout
Sorry about that
Let it all Hang Out

Sleep all day, drive all night
Brain my numb can't stop now
For sure ain't no doubt
...
