Regie Hamm, Steve Siler and Bob Farrell
We do a pretty good job of throwing sticks and stones
But everyone's got a closet full of skeleton bones
No need to tear each other down
'Cause we're all standing here on common ground
Chorus:
If we could love one another
We could bring Heaven down out of the sky
If we could love one another
We could bring hate to it's knees tonight
Wouldn't every future be bright
If we could love one another
...
