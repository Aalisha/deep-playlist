Mmm... Good to me...

I've never known a love like this
I just can hardly believe it
And I love giving you my everything
You give me more than I needed

And thinking of the good times
Precious times that were yours and mine
That's why I can't wait to see your face
Baby, when I tell you goodbye

'Cos it's a damn shame
