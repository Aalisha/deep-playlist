We walked away
Before we said goodbye
That ain't right baby, no

I always thought
We'd stand the test of time
I was wrong, baby

When the lights
In the house all go out
I get lonely, how 'bout you?

Every time
The phone rings
I hope it's you calling

We could work it out
Forget this all somehow
Start over again

It's our love on the line
We should try baby, try
I know we can make it

If we both take a chance
If we try baby, try
'Cause we've got
Too much to lose

Too many days
Without your smiling face
...
