If ya come inside I can't help outside
You can't cry but you won't need to
Baby has found a way to surround
Surround herself in sorrow
If ya come inside I can't help outside
You should learn And God you'll need to
Baby has found the way to survive yeah Baby has found the
Solace

Get down, down, down inside the Devil
Get down, down, down inside the sun
