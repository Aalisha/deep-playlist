Something about the way you taste
Makes me wanna clear my throat
There's a message to your movements
That really gets my goat

I looked for sniffy linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more

I got a gut feeling
I got a gut feeling
I got a gut feeling
I got a gut feeling, feeling

Centered 'round long time ago
On your ability to torment
Then you took your tongs of love
And stripped away my garment

I looked for sniffy linings
But you're rotten to the core
