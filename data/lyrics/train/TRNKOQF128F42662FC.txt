mama there's wolves in the house
mama they won't let me out
mama they're mating at night
mama they wont make nice

they're pacing and glowing bright
their faces all snowy and white
bury their paws in the stone
make for my heart as their home

they tumble and fight
and they're beautiful
on the hilltops at night
...
