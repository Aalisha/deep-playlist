Oh you can have it all
And wrap it in the world
You can have everything
You can have Love
And lots of other things
to make you think

But when it all comes down to you, girl
Yeah no matter what you do
Take a look at yourself and realize
I've been good to you
I've been good to you

Oh no
I didn't mean to say what I, did say
All about lovers and how they should lay
...
