I'm Not Stopin', Ya Heard What I'm Sayin'
Put The Money In My Hand, And Catch Me If You Can

I've Been Waitin' And Watchin', To Put The Bitch In A Coffin

(Verse one-Young Buck)
It's Gon' Cost, But We Gon' Get Him Gone, Take His Life Away
2 A.K's, We Gon' Send Him Home
This Is How We Livin' From The Projects To The Prisons
So Don't Be To Comfortible, Bitch 'Cuz You Can Be A Victim
Get 'Em Buck, Hit 'Em Up, Ambulance Pick 'Em Up
