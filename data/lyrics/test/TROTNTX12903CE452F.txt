Sand and stars
The secret life of planet mars
Somewhere I can feel the sun
There's something in the air between us

Let it rain
Nothing ever stays the same
Your tears are falling in my dreams
There's something in the air between us

I've been soaring like a cloud
I call your name out loud
In taxis and in towns
And I have walked upon the beach
A rainbow within reach
...
