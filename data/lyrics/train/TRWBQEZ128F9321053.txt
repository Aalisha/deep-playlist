What are you gonna do when I'm gone?
Whose shoulder are you gonna cry on?
What are you gonna do on the day
When I turn my head & just walk away?

What are you gonna say to your friends
When the talk around town begins?
Will you tell them how you treated me bad?
Will you tell them how you made me so sad?
You make some people think that you love me a lot
