This is, this is, this is
You're now tuned in to WUTP radio
We your host for tonight, Cool and Dre
You're now locked in to the Juvenile hour
I know all y'all hot girls is tuned in right now
So we gon' send this new one out to you clearly
It's called Rodeo, talk to 'em pimp!

Y'all need to open ya ears up and soak this game up
And if nobody don't know ya I'ma make y'all famous
This is 24 karats but it shine like stainless
Just look at how the diamonds complement my fingers

Yes indeed, shit chokin' me
Woah I need a breath to breathe
Chasin' with the Hennessy now that's how a G play it
Especially when them hoes shakin' that ass to the DJ

If I could do it big, give 'em some leeway
Security stop trippin' and you niggaz be easy
Yes sir, this the bubble right hurr
You're all beautiful women if you insecure

Let me see ya work that, twerk that, serve that
Come on and do the rodeo
Let me see ya bounce that, move that, do that
Let me see ya do the rodeo

Let me see ya work that, twerk that, serve that
Come on and do the rodeo
Let me see ya bounce that, move that, do that
Let me see ya do the rodeo
