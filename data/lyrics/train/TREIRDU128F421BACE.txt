The prayers have been spoken
May the gods be on my side
May they join my way to bring me victory
Seven at one stroke
My triumph and my pride
They will be history

But behind my enemy's eyes
A soul in disguise
Not only lies

We live to fight the hand of doom
We got the pride to strike a fool
Vain glory be my wicked guide
We live to fight the hand of doom
...
