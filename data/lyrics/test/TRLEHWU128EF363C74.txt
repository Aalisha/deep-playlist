Miss you
And you
With you
And
When I visit you, I miss you
I am a part of you, and you get me through
With a sudden refuse, you make me choose
When you show me again, how weak, how proud,
And how rarely you get loud
I doubt you wanna make me burn
I doubt you wanna make me burn
I doubt you wanna make me burn
...
