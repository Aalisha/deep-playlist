[Spoken:]
"This song is dedicated to all you 16 year-old girls out there.
You know, when all those boys come 'round asking you all for a
date, y'just gotta sit back and be cool and tell 'em one thing."

You keep a-knockin', but you can't come in
You keep a-knockin', but you can't come in
You keep a-knockin', but you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night, and try it again

You say you love me, but you can't come in
You say you love me, but you can't come in
You say you love me, but you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night, and try it again

You say you love me, but you can't come in
You say you love me, but you can't come in
