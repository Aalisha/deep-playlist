Burn, burn - out of fire you'll never walk!
Turn, turn on you liar, try again to stalk!
Bloodstained your wicked vision - a deceiver's heart,
Forward! Bend! A million needles pierce - a solemn art.

Absence, presence, intense defense,
Efforts to breathe only embitter your state.
Vengeance, welcome the cremation sequence...
Depart, discard! Your downfall's lying in wait.

Forlorn, forlorn, affliction your glance reflects.
Face the last of competitions!
I grant your fall, the fatal poison injects,
Fading out all insane visions.
