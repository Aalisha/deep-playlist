Wish upon a star

Take a step enter the land
Walk through the air
Take my hand
Wishmaster's will-
Join him the quest for dream
A make-believe
Is all we ever need
Wish upon a star

No matter who you are
The second star to the right
Harbinger's gate
Beyond the boundaries
Blossom ballet
In the great wide somewhere
Wish upon a star

Believe in will
The realm of the king of fantasy
The master of the tale-like lore
The way to kingdom I adore
...
