Full moon standing in the streets
I know the time is near
Incarnate power roaring
From the sky

Unrelenting forces
Blasting through the air
Roaring thunder
Lift your hands and pray

Running through the empty streets
They're looking for the fight
Swords gleam in the light of moon
The Gods prepare to strike

Metal invaders
Ready to strike
A warning from hell
Be careful tonight
(Owh)

Dark night overwhelming bright light
See the demons fly
Can't trust your senses
Fear you'll have to die
...
