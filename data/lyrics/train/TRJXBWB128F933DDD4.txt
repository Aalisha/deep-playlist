Judy in disguise, well that's what you are
Lemonade pies with a brand new car
Cantalope eyes come to me tonight
Judy in disguise, with glasses

Keep a-wearing your bracelets and your new rara
Cross your hear-yah-with your live in bra
Chimney sweep sparrow with guise
Judy in disguise, with glasses
...
