When everything is war
You're living in a battle zone
When everything is torn
And the world is cold as stone

Don't lock all the doors
Close your heart
Shut me out of your life
And throw all the keys

Will you reach out?
Will you reach out for me?
When life holds you down
Like you're drowning at sea
I'm the hand that you need
'Til you land at your own destiny
Reach out for me

When everything is wrong
Distant cries still reach my ears
When ever you're alone
Doesn't mean that love's not here
...
