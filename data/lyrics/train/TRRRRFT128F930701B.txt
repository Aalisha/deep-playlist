Girl, can't you see
Goodbye is not the answer
Sometimes you need to work things out
Girl, help me now
Cause I just can't remember
What we made so much fuss about

I said this and maybe
You said that oh baby
Never mean to hurt your feelings anyway

I don't care how it all got started
Don't wanna feel this broken hearted
Don't wanna leave a perfect world (baby)
I don't care how it all got started
Before this love is gone, departed
Don't wanna leave a perfect world
A Perfect World

Words, they can cut
...
