Leave me alone, and there'll be
No one to get hurt
Nobody move and there'll be
Nothin' to disturb
The sum of it all is that you
Don't know where to turn
Despite all your promises you
Don't keep what you learn

Beautiful beat get me out of this mess
Beautiful beat lift me up from distress

Sometimes all i want is another
Drink or another pill
If i could get anything done
Maybe I'd hold still
...
