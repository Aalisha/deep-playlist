Riddled by the trappings
Of words that makes the edges blur
Here on the outskirts
Of sincerity and pride
Stretched as far as words can reach
By the lure of higher meaning
There's something out there
Lost behind the power lines
It's all the same to me
It's all the same to me
Lost all faith in promises
And deadlines closing in
Tired of deciphering the wayward
Stands of truth

I don't care
'Cause I can't feel
I don't know
Anymore

Sure we've had a good run
With vowels, nouns and letters
But within its very nature
The ability to distort
There's nothing in the words I hear
That makes me want to take a stand
...
