Looking down the barrel of a gun, see the light flash before my eyes 
Facing fear, fear in discipline, another night time to pay the price 
Just two steps closer to the attack 
Unleashed is their rage in doubt fight back 

Life is pain 
Life - is fucking pain 

Twisted minds begin to behold what's wrong or right 
...
