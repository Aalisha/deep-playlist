STORMY You are the sunshine, baby, whenever you smile
But I call you Stormy today
All of a sudden that ol' rain is fallin' down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away
Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy
Old Stormy Stormy
Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze
...
