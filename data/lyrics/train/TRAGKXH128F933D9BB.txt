"Slow down baby... slow down, hey baby...

For a while, I've been missing you for a mile
Hey babe, for a while, I've been missing you for a mile

Won't you hold me close to the corner store
Rush to get ya, by the time I reach the door
They tell me you called to the dress shop baby
Can't seem to catch up to you, but I sure won't stop
Cause I need you my heart says
I just won't have it no other way
...
