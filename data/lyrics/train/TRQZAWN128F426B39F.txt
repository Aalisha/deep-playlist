You're a man who
Lives in solitude
Never knowing what life
Could bring you
Have to raise your fist
Just to break through
All the voices inside your
Head that make you

You're a man whos
Filled with attitude
Don't you know that
Everyone hates you (hates you)
It would be so simple
For me to kill you (kill you)
Mark my words my man
I will stop you

Killing the beast
Killing the beast
Kill

Killing the beast
Killing the beast
Kill

Killing the beast
Killing the beast
