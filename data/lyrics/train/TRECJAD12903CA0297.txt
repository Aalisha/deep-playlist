I've been through all them changes
A lot of stuff came down
I've dealt with all the issues
You might say I've been around
But back when I got started
There was a righteous sound

I'll still be diggin' on James Brown

Ya know the more things change
The more they stay the same
It may be a different age
But I'm on the same page

Cause one thing that I've found
I'll still be diggin' on James Brown

I had an attitude adjustment
I did some psycho therapy
