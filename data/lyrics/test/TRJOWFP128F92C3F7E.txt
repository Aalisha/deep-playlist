I don? t want excuses
I don? t want your smiles
I don? t want to feel like
We're apart a thousand miles

And I don? t want your attitude
I don? t want your things
And I don? t want a phone that never rings
I want your love and I want it now
I want your love and I want it now

I don? t want your history
I don? t want that stuff
