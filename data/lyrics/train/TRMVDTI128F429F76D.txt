(1, 2, 3, GO!)

Hey now everybody
Look who's on TV
Look who just got famous
Don't you know
It
Should have been
(Me)
I'm not really bitter
I'm not really mad
I love to see other people get
Everything I ever
Wanted to have
I don't really care
How big they get

I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
I hate you
Fuck you
Leave me alone
Why cant I be cool like them?
