"Don't worry bout a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be all right.
Singin': "Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right!"

Rise up this mornin'
Smiled with the risin' sun
Three little birds
Sit by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Sayin', ("This is my message to you-ou-ou:")
