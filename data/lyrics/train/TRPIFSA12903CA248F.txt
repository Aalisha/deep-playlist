Leavin' on the runway
To another world
Still stranded somewhere
In between the earth and sky
It's 3 AM
I'm in Japan
You're still on my mind
Your long-distance love is coming through alright
And I'm not lonely
Lost in the Orient
I'm dreamin' of
Turn around in Tokyo
Gotta send it back to you
Turn around in Tokyo
Well I feel like a stranger
