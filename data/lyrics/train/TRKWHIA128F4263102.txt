Light skin
Dark skin
My Asian persuasion
I got them all
That's why these girls out here hatin'

Cause I'm sexy
Do you like my style
Yeah that sexy sexy sexy
Like I rock it down
Yeah that sexy sexy sexy
You can work me out
Yeah that sexy sexy sexy
Let me show you how
Yeah that sexy sexy sexy

So here's my demonstration
A peep show
Tonight my body's an exhibition baby
Though it's on display, don't be scared to
Touch it, it said so
So come and get it babe

Strum me like a guitar blow out my amplifier
When you hear some feedback keep going take it higher
Crank it up give it to me come on
Crank it up give it to me come on
I'm gonna feedback feedback oh
Feedback feedback oh
Crank it up give it to me come on
Crank it up give it to me come on
