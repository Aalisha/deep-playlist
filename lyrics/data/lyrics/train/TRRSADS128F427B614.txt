She was washin' the dishes
When she burst into tears
It was the time of the month
She was up to her ears

I put my arms 'round her neck
I said sit down a while
Cry as much as you like, I'll do the dishes
Tell me what's on your mind

There's a boiling point that you're bound to reach
When it's all your fault and you're half asleep
She's lucky she doesn't have to shave
I'm so lucky, I'm not doubled up with pain

Her eyes were like pools
Filled with newly wed tears
She was sat doubled up
With her hands on her ears
...
