sweatshop

ahahaha

well look whose looking out the circus crowd
with a whole crowd of clowns to tear it all down
pound for pound i will tip the scales
spit til the frail(?) think I'm sick as hell
well im sorry for the minor confussion
meditive merchant of the sweatshop union
and if using my head mean losing respect
I chose what I like to prove i object

welcome seldom seen but heard
above the mainstream on a leaf observer
I can see the earth as an innocent bystander
and eat the worms that are giving our minds cancer
my answer is to stay out of the water
and climb faster to escape out of the monitors reach
think I'd let the beast ever defeat
a frog like me, not likely

Aw here it comes right the drums like waves
