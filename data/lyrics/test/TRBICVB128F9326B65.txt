The room filled up with water and the roar of the crowd died down
They didn't hold their breath, they just waited to drown
Now, I'm just the ghost in the corner that nobody knows
I'm just a chill in the air that comes and cuts you to the bone

I've never seen it shine so bright before
I stumble blind into the light of it all
