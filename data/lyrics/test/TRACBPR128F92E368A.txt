Open sky
Wide as the night that surrounds me like a mystery
Closing in tonight, taking hold
I wanna hide
I'm lost in a world that's so empty, and I can't breathe
Counting every day I stay alone

I'm falling backwards
Nothing matters when you're far away
I need to feel you on my skin
I'm falling backwards
All I have to hold is empty space
I'll be standing still until you're mine again
Falling backwards
...
