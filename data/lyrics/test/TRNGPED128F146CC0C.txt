Well I was sittin' on the porch with Mel and Web
Kickin' back pullin' tubes courtesy of Jeb
When Smootie rang up and he dropped a dime
We're at the Django house and the waves are fine

Dan came back with an ol' lap steel
When he puts it in his hands he's got to be real
If you come around the corner don't forget to turn
And bring a little fire we got somethin' to burn

I got around the corner, I was half way there
When I met Ted Moore and of course John Hare
They had just got a sack weighing 3.5
It was 4: 19, just about that time

So we took a detour to 6703
The house they occupy oceanside D.P.
