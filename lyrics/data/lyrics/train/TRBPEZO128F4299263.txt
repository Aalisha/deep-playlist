The paths have been crossed
The crumbs are gone and the way
And the way is lost
Melancholy phantoms eye our skins
Poisoned apples falling with the wind

Hear the sigh of the trees
Those who enter here never leave

And the rangers stream
Out of their cabins
They are the hunters,
We are the rabbits
But maybe we don't want to be found
Maybe we don't want to be found

Further in and on we go
Sightless creatures tugging at our clothes
