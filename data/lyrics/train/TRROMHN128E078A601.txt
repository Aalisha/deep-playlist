There's a voice in my head
And everywhere I go
It is telling me to come home.
And I know what it means
I'm a million miles away
From the smile that makes me live again.
There's a ringing in my ear
And it's telling me to listen
To the words my heart will always say.
I can fell all the pain
You are going through since I've been away.
It's the call of your heart I feel
It's the call of our love taking me night by night.
