I made my reservation,
I'm leaving town tomorrow,
I'll find somebody new and
there'll be no more sorrow

Thats what I do each time, but I cant follow through

I can't breakaway, though you make me cry
I can't breakaway, I can't say goodbye
No I'll never, never breakaway from you

No, No, no no no, No, No, no no no, No, No, no no no, No, No!

I make a vow to myself,
You and I are through,
Nothing can change my mind
and that just wont do
...
