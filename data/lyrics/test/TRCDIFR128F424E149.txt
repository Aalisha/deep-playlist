The whole click tote pistols
buck ya lucky charms
niggas got tats on they necks and they arms
so when you see us comin, duck cuz we bussin
flyin in the bucket, holarin fuck it cuz we thuggin
(times 2)

yeah
back in the lab, back on the block
back with them slabs, back with them glocks
run in ya drop, yeah nigga, we'll run in ya spot
take ya little chains and ya colorful watch(heh)
stackin my greens, money get locked
still on the corner i stand, trafficin on blocks
we'll pull a nigga card for real, yeah
my boys in da hood hard for real
and niggas say they ball, but what they talkin is lame
my whole clique strapped, and we off of the chain
plus alotta niggas fake, so ima say it out loud
cuz alot of niggas hate, but they dont say it out loud
i come from the a-town, we come from the playground
where niggas don't play 'round, stand and we spray rounds
still thinkin', we run from the k-9s,
got the trap bumpin like the beat in the bassline
