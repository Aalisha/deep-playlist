I don't know if I told you
But I'm seeking sanctuary
You'd never guess the things that I do
I've had the devil around for tea

Don't you know that I'm here beside you?
Can't you see that I can't relax?
When I saw you in my rear view
You could have stopped me in my tracks

I'll be there for you when you want me to
I'll stand by your side like I always do
In the dead of night it'll be alright
