There's only one way to say it
You're my Refuge in a complicated world

That's drying up and burning out
There's only one way to play it

So simple in a sophisticated world
That's speeding up not slowing down
You opened up my eyes to see You
You opened up my heart to the truth

Jesus I love You
Jesus one Way one Life one Truth
