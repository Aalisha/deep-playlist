My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine softer than a sigh
My love is deeper than the deepest ocean wider than the sky
My love is brighter than the brightest star that shines every night above
And there is nothing in this world that could ever change my love

Something happened to my heart the day that I met you
Something that I never felt before
You are always on my mind no matter what I do
