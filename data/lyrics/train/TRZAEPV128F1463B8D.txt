Mrs Robinson im happy to be this way
Hello special one you've been so hard to find
Rumour has it you're in love with me
I got to thinking just the other day
The kiss, the cuddle, oh its never felt this way
A little glance from you is all it took to steal my heart
And i noticed from the start
How i loved your smile
I just love your smile, makes me feel alive
