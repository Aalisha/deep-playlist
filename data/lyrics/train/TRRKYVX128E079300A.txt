I'll give you money
I'll give you lovin'
I'll give you everything
But heaven above

I'll give you all I have right now

I'll give you money
I'll give you lovin'
Everything

I'll give you kisses
Sweet as honey
I'll do you everything
'Cept make the sun shine

If I could change the world right now

Make you happy
