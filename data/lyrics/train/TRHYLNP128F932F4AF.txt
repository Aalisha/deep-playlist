Are You listenin' to anything that I say?
'Cause I been prayin'
How many prayers can I pray?
I'm still waitin', maybe, You'll show up today

I know You're here but I can't feel You
And if You're speakin', I can't hear You
How much longer will this last?

So okay, answer me with silence
It's okay if You don't say a word
You're testin' me to trust
You'll be faithful in this quiet
So okay, answer me with silence
