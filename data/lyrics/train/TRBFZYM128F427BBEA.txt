Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out

Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out

Too many legs under the table
Too many reasons for trouble
Have I got a girlfriend and does she get real mean?
Yes she does, yes she does

If the feeling's right, you can see it
It's the same, don't hurt
If you can't stop yourself when you feel it
Ooh

I can't control myself
When I see you there's no one else
When I get down all by myself
You're the one that I think about

I can't control myself
When I see you there's no one else
When I get down all by myself
You're the one that I think about

Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out
Let's make out, let's make out
...
