Hello there
How have you been
I've called a million times
But to me you're never in
I know I never had the style
or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you

I'm doing really well
I'm as happy as a lark
I got a new apartment
It's as safe as Central Park
And if they ever mug me
When I'm walking in the dark
Would you know

Don't hang up
Don't hang up

Rolled up in my camera
With the big cheese up above
I stumbled from my stag night
To a never ending limousine

The band went la di da di da
And I got loady do di dodied
...
