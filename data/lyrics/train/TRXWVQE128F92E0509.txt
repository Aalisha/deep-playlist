Is there anybody there?
Is there anybody there?
They forced their beliefs on you
They force you to pray
They force you to believe in God
Take part in the games that they play
Is there anybody there?
I've been good all my life
Kept to the straight and narrow
Married and provided for my wife
Is there anybody there?
Devoted to the church
I made it my life
Remained faithful through trouble or strife
Is there anybody there?
When the time comes
I will claim my reward
A place in heaven, next to my lord
Is there anybody there?
Is there anybody there?
I've worked hard
