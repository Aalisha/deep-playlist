Tell me how you want me to be
Then look again and you will see
That I'm still the same, love

Think me into any shape
Your twisted mind has no escape
But don't be ashamed, love, it's just a game, love
You can learn how to play

Born like you were in a terrible mess
Didn't know what it was to have a new dress
You just wanted to scream out my name
