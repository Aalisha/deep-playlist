A slight call afar is tempting me
Like a whisper sweet or an awful scream
I cannot ignore what I've always been
I am leaving again - one last time?

Laid on the pale scythe of the Moon
I play with stars around me
The elvendom is now calling out my name
My fairy and I are wandering through times
And stories forgotten, some old fairytales
Of wizards of Oz, of lost keys and gardens
Hiding secret doors that lead to a dream
...
