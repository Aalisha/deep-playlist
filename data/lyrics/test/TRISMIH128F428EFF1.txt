Leave your past at the front door
And run away like you did before
Blisters, blisters, blisters

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures

Oh, oh no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out, oh no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out

Such a harsh tongue used so easily
