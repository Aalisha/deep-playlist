Never felt like this until I kissed ya
How did I exist until I kissed ya?
Never had you on my mind
Now you're there all the time
Never knew what I missed until I kissed ya, uh huh
I kissed ya, oh yeah
Things have really changed since I kissed ya, uh huh
My life's not the same now that I kissed ya, oh yeah
Mmm, you got a way about ya
