You've gotta hold, hold open my eyelids
If you're gonna shake, shake, shake 'til the morning
I'm gonna put, put things in perspective
And it's gonna take, take, take my precious time
All we need is a reason
For us to dance, dance, dance 'til the break of dawn
All I need is a hook now
For us to shout, shout, shout these words out

Cuz we're all, all, all
We're all...
You know we're all a part of the world, of course
If you know it sing out
Yeah, sing it out

I'm gonna snap back into formation
And get to work, work, work 'til the job gets done
Everyone's getting ready
Cuz they've been wait, wait, waiting for Friday night
...
