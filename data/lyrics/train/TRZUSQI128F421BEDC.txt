When you came by this morning,
Boy, you caught me off guard,
Who would have thought it would be you
When I opened the door!
And it made me realize, yes, I still think of you
Yes, I still love you man, yes I'm still missing you!
Yeah, I almost forgot to say I love
Thinking about how it was before.
We got to talking, started remembering
All the times we had, trying to get them back.
Then you ask if I could take you back.

Oh, I can forgive,
But I can't forget all the fights that we had,

I can forgive,
But I won't forget the way that you hurt me like that!

I'll never forgive you for cheating, lying and leaving,
Treating me so bad!

I'll always love you, but I can't forget,
So I don't want you back!
