Maybe It's cos' of the way that I dress
They say I look out of place
And my taste is a mess
And there ain't
No point in trying
Cos' I know what they're dying to do
Some stupid opinions
on the way that I am
They can look at me
and I don't give a damn, damn, damn
They got no sense of humour
They only spread the rumour
They say I'm just misguided
I don't agree

I think I'm wonderful
...
