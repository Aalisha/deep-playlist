Girl, you know I want you
And I don't know what to do without you
(I know you need me too)
All I know is I love you, girl
And you need me just like I need you
 (I want you, you want me too)
And I want you, baby

Yeah, yeah, yeah
No matter what you do
I will hold on to you
You should stay down for me
Follow your heart and you will see
You will see

(Without you)
I can't walk, I can't talk
What can I do?

(Without you)
I can't eat I can't sleep
What can I do?

(Without you)
Nowhere to go, nowhere to turn
What can I do?
(Without you)
Without you, without you

Try to imagine me and you
Hand in hand as we watch the moon
It doesn't matter where we are
('Cause you are always in my heart)
'Cause you are always in my heart, yeah yeah

(Without you)
I can't walk, I can't talk
What can I do?
