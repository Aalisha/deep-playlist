Head lights approaching, they come to point me out,
helicopters circling, they'll turn me in,
run with the hungry, I get trapped between your teeth,
they shine like a razor, a blistering shield,

Hidden treasures never found, they where stolen long ago,
the dark something turns to dust, so eat your heart out, and be proud,
...
