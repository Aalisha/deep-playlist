Would you please take me away from this place?
I cannot bear to see the look upon your faces
And if there is some kind of God, do you think He's pleased?
When He looks down on us, I wonder what He sees
Do you think He'd think the things we do are a waste of time?
Maybe He'd think that we are getting on just fine
Do you think He's skint or financially secure?
And come election time, I wonder who He'd vote for

Ever since He can remember, people have died in His good name
Long before that September, long before hijacking planes
He's lost the will, He can't decide
He doesn't know who's right or wrong
