[Donell Talking]
Damn man... I had it all before I got up in here

[Jail Bars Slam Shut]

Girl I know that you been creepin
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
Don't get no letters or no money or no visits
Its like I don't exist
And if it wasn't for my daughters
Then I wouldn't have no reason to live
But I've come to realize that life goes on

Since the day that I got locked up
My lifes been different. oh yeah.
'cause she was my soul, my heart, my love, my best friend
I can't understand why,
She won't accept my phone calls.
Shoulda knew something was wrong
When mama said "baby its time for you to move on..."
Now that everything I had. is gone

Girl I know that you been creepin
Can't believe it, but I'm locked up in here
