These hoes don't love me, they love my Benz
Love my rims, love my style
These fiends don't love me, they love my coke
Love my dope, love my ink

These haters don't love me, it don't matter to me
I stay hater free 'cos I'mma down ass G
'Cos if I don't make dollars, then it don't make cents
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents

I'm in town dog, Mexican brown dog
I'm signed to interscope, I'm grims a C-note
500 cokily add to a kilo
ID rather be rich, than snitch nigga out cold

My crack in sinthostat, drummers with hunny hats
My bitch from D.R., switch 'em with bigger stash
Movin' my work, jus' for some boots 'n' a skirt
I was loose but she complainin' it hurt

Ice skatin' on ice, I got these crack heads, scrapin' the mic
Late at night, bitch be shakin' her dice
Runnin' from feds, like I had Jerry rice legs
'Cos the dope and the rice come from pac and them plant eggs

It's the top shotter that rocked prada
That rhymed proper
In high school I had ex in my gym locker
Locker, locker, locker

These hoes don't love me, they love my Benz
Love my rims, love my style
These fiends don't love me, they love my coke
