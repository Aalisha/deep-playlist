Many years have come and gone
Since I wandered from my home
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born
Many a page of life has turned
Many a lesson I have learned
And I feel that in those hills I still belong.

Ride my pony on the reservation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born
A way down yonder in the Indian nation
A cowboy's life is my occupation
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born.
