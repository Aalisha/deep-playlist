Can't we be sweethearts?
Why don't we fall in love?
Right from the start, you're the girl I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see you're the only girl for me

Please be my sweetheart, don't you know the way I feel
Please play the part and make my dreams all real
Oh don't you know, don't you know I really love you so
