When I'm in love
 I do it right
 One on one
 All thru the night
 Ooh I take my time
 And work it slow
 You've been whipped
 Before you know
 Cause these arms
 There's ectasy
 Once we've touched
 You're history
 Ooh imagine baby
 You'll lose control
 When we make love
 Away we go
 
 The whole world is ours tonight
