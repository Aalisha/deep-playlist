I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
And I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
But I'm in a daze from your love, you see
And I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, do for love
...
