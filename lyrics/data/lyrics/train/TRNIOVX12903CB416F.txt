He is a boy, he's very thin
Until tomorrow
Took heroin, don't like himself very much
'Cause he has set to set to self-destruct

He is
Set to self-destruct
He is
Set to self-destruct

He is
Set to self-destruct
He is
Too good to be true

Destroy it
Enjoy it
Destroy it
Enjoy it
Destroy it
Enjoy it

He is
Too good to be true
He is
Too good to be true
