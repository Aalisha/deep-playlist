Everybody
Sell your body
To the night

Human flesh

Working out in the weight room
You're trying to make it pay
Sweating for a future
But it's such a long night anyway

Out on the dancefloor
Working up a sweat
Your body's their amusement park
Now enter the night and see what you can get, so...

Everybody
Sell your body
Everybody
Sell your body
To the night

Hey boy, you wanna get ahead
You gotta give some head
Might end up dead instead
Hey boy, but you can make it right
...
