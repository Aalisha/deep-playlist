let it go!
let it go!

what's drowning you is slowly drowning me
you make me suffer to watch your disease
trapped in yourself come release your mind
relax we'll leave this world behind

you still suffer
still suffering
you still suffer
from this state you're in

you still suffer
still suffering
you still suffer
from this shit you're in

let it go!
