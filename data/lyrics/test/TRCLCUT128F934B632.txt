There's not a way around it
We're no longer one ahead
As we fall into a world
Of endless doubt and constant worry

Losing all our senses
As the sky is turning gray
How can all these things we know
Be deemed allowed and forced each everyday?

Cannot we ever find what we see as the truth,
When we leave all the dreams that we knew...

On and on, to the edge of the world
Lead on and see what our reason will do
On and on, not a sign far beyond
...
