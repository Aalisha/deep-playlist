JE:
Didn't care about the money. Never asked for a dime.
Said you only wanted my Love and my time. Yeah!
Looking back its so funny. I thought you would always be mine.
I guess that why I damn near lost my mind.
When you were out of touch no where to be found.
When I needed you most, you were not around.
In my own safe world thought that I was holdin it down.
Thinkin love was all I need to keep you around.
JE Chorus:
I wanted you so bad. I should have been careful.
So, naive. Looking for love with my heart on my sleeve.
You told me forever but now I know better. That your kind of love aint for me.
JE:
Didn't care about them groupies. No. Know how crazy this job can be.
No they didn't have nothing on you. So they could never have me.
I thought we were something special. I thought you could really understand me.
I thought alot of things but now I see.
That you had other plans for this love of ours.
