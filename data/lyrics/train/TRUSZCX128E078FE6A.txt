Love of my you are
sunlight, my shining star
all of the world to me
all i could ever need
lately i can feel you've grown away from me
and inside i pray it's not too late to find a remedy
Don't wanna live a lie
i don't wanna say goodbye
so how can i start again
and how will my heart mend
here i am alone with only memories
so i'm searching just to find a way to keep you here with me
So i close my eyes
