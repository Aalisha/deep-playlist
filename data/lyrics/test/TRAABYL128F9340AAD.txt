Please stay with me now
Don't you let me go
I'll make it somehow
I got to let you know
That I'll make it
Somehow, some way
Though I wait on the day
What I'm doing's got to pay
Someway, somehow

My baby, when he cries
It's 'cause something's on his mind
This world is full of lies
You and me are one of a kind
