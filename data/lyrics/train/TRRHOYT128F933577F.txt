Written in vulgar disgust of ignorance, prejudice and jealousy:
Deep in this blackened void, the space that used to be my soul
No ray of light, no hope has shown there in the darkened cold

In time memories and pain will fade and disappear they must
But not until this mortal being has turned to scattered dust

You cannot judge what you don't understand
Take the blade from the child's hand
All the petty lies and the jealous whores
Matter little and leave me bored
...
