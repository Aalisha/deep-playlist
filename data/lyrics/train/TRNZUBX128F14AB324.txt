Just as sure as the sky is blue and the ocean too
I've never lied to you
And I've never ever done anything that would render me untrue
But for you I can't say the same
You have only brought me pain
There's no use in pointing fingers when I'm the one to blame

And I know that it's over
And there's nothing left to say
And we all pay the prices
Of the games that we play
I don't know how to love you
But I can't walk away

What do I have to say
What do I have to do
I need to hear you say
"I just wanna be with you"
What to I have to change
What do I have to prove
You're never gonna change
You're never gonna change
