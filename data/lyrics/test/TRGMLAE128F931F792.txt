There's nothing civil about civilization
So fuck your righteous hype
I've had a long day I've gotta full time of questions
I'm not a product of your type
Wer'e all going nowhere-that's fine with me
I'm not afraid to stop this class race
That's set to be
No, I won't blindly follow no, war has not been won
Our destruction has just begun
You can fight the swindle
