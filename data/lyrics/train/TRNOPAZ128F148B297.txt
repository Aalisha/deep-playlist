We need a kick start
We need a quick solution
We need a next step
If we're really going
If we're really going

We sit on our couch while we watch our tv
and the phone doesn't ring and it's perfect
To be here playing house is no comfort to me
It's just more of the same again and again and again

We need a kick start
