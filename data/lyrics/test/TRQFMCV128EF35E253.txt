The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
No, don't disappear

Ever had that feeling
Almost broke in two
Said that you were leaving
Like you do, you do

All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more
In tears, in tears

Be near me, be near
...
