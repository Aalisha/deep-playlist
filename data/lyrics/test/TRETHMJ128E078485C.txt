Well you can give me all your love
And anything else you got too
But don't pay it any mind
If it seems like I'm acting cool

Well you can dress me in your mirror
Give me kisses forever and a day yeah
But there's just one thing

You don't have to say
You don't have to say you love me
And you don't have to say any prayers
No you don't have to say you love me
Baby it's alright

Cos honey I don't care
Oh baby I don't care
Oh honey I don't care
Oh honey I don't care

Well you can turns the lights down low
Somethings are better that way
And you can tell me all your stories
But please spare me the plays
