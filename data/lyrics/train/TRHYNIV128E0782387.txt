How many days have I felt like this?
How strong am I?

It feels so good to be free
I want you to know
How I feel

You take me from the madness, the awe-inspiring sadness
Take me to the places where the air is clean
Fill my heart with wonder, awake me from my slumber
Toss me to the ocean like a sinking stone

Could be a city thing
Could be a blues thing
Could be a country thing
Could be the real thing

Took a walk over the rocks on the beach
And I was thinking of all the things I have and can never be
And I was dreaming lazily on your head as I
Watched the sunset

You take me from the madness, the awe-inspiring sadness
Show me places that I need to know
Roll me to the ocean, like a stone I will just fall in (I've been drowning)
Heaven knows where this love will go

Could be a city thing
Could be a blues thing
