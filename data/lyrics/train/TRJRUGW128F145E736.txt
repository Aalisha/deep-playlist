***Verse1***
We had a love that was so good, Ooh should have been unlawful.
Yeah so good… or at least I thought so.
But now you got me running round in circles, and I’m so down on myself.
And you say that you won’t be coming back…Won’t be coming back to me baby.

***Chorus***
Well I’d rather see you dead.
Erase you memory from my head.
