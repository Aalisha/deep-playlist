Heavenly Father
You always amaze me
Let Your kingdom come
In my world, in my life
You give me the food I need
To live through the day
And forgive me as I forgive
The people that wrong me
Lead me far from temptation
And deliver me
From the evil one
I look out the window
The birds are composing
Not a note is out of tune
Or out of place
I walk through the meadow
And stare at the flowers
Better dressed than any girl
On her wedding day
Oh, so why do I worry?
Why do I freak out?
God knows what I need
He know what I need
Your love is
Your love is
Your love is strong
