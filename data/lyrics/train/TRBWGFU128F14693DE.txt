There is nothing wrong with me
There's nothing wrong with you
Maybe we're just blind to see
Each other's point of view

Nobody knows what we had

I could have walked right out on you
There was nothing stopping me

Nobody knows what we had
Oh, nobody knows what we had

We were running out of passion, we were running out of time
There's a face to fit the future, there's a face to fit the crime
