Full assistance to those who bear it all
Unable to fall, waiting patiently
Backs against the wall
Not allowing the weak to dictate, when it's our turn to recover


(Show me that)
If your experiences don't compare, just turn the tables
(Don't compare)
Stop acting like you really care, if you're not stable

Full resistance to those who care at all
Directing the call, it's consuming us
Backs against the wall
Convincing the meek to dictate all their actions on command
and eviction to those who swear it all
Fit to befall the false memory
...
