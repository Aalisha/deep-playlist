This place is a prison
These people aren't your friends
Inhaling thrills through twenty dollar bills
and the tumblers are drained and then flooded
again and again.

There's guards at the onramps
Armed to the teeth
And you may case the grounds
from the Cascades to Puget Sound
but you are not permitted to leave.
