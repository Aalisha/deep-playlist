Life's just a game that you have to play, 
Gotta have a hand just to stay sane,
Why's it always seem I lose my turn?
Well, the game's gotten old and my brain is sore,
I still role the dice, but I can't keep score,
Still just a pawn, I await my crown. 
My life lies on an old chess board,
I hide in the corners to avoid the storms,
Maybe some day I might just win.
I know some day when the tables turn,
I'll jump ahead and you'll be burnt.
All I ask is just a chance.
Gamble with life everyday,
...
