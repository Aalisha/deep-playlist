I've got a lover way over there
On the mountain side and I know that's where I should be
Don't you know I've got a lover way over there
Across the river wide and I can hear her calling to me

Oh, she's calling my name
So sweet and so plain
And I can hear her saying

Come to me baby
I'm on my way
Come to me baby
I'm gonna stay
Come to me baby

They tell me that the river's to deep
And it's much to wide for you can't get across to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
