The Marmalade - lovin' things

It's the lovin' things you do
That make me grow so close to you
Gonna want you my whole life through
For the lovin' things, baby, that you do

It's the lovin' things you say
That give me comfort every day
By your side I'm gonna stay
To hear the lovin' things, baby that you say

Since that day our love began
