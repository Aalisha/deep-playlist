Hey girls, you see these boys over there? Well, one of them is mine

He may not be the one who's handsome & tall, but
He's the one I love
Let me tell you now, his looks don't matter at all 'cause
He's the one I love
Now you may like the handsomest boy in the lot
& that's all right, but I'll keep the one I've got 'cause
He's the one I love
Let me tell ya, he's the one I love

He may not be the one with the fancy clothes, but
He's the one I love
...
