Up so early feel so bright
didn't get much sleep last night
freight train rattled through my head
whistle blowing love is dead
is dead

Heart attacked by fear and doubt
won't be long till the truth comes out
first impressions never last
lover's bonds they hold so fast

Restless future burning bright
...
