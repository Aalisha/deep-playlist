(Billy Sherrill, Jenny Strickland, Carmol Taylor)

(man speaks):
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together,
In the presence of God, and these witnesses,
To join this man and this woman in the bonds,
Of holy matrimony

Do you Tammy, take this man, George
To be your lawfully wedded husband,
To love and to cherish until death do you part?

(T.W.) sings:
I'll take this man and by him I'll stand
I promise that we'll never part
To him, I'll be true
There'll be no one new
...
