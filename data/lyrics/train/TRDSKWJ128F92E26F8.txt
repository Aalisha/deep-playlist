Well they say you're running all over town
Your Gonna put me down
Well I don't believe it
But that's what they say

They say you're playing me for a fool
The situation ain't cruel
And I should just leave it
But that's what they say

They say that we should be far apart
You're break my poor heart if I stay
And I keep trying hard to ignore
They tell me more everyday
And i don't believe them
But that's what they say
I don't believe them
But that's what they say

They say that you've been with other guys
