Yesterday's news is tomorrow's blues
But today I am alive
(I am alive)
Today I did much more than survive

I learned to live by the love I give
It's the only thing I own
Shadowed valleys that I've known
Helped me build my home

So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid?
(Why should you be afraid?)
We've seen better
We've seen darker days

So tell me why?
Why should I be afraid?
(Why should you be so afraid?)
Sittin' here watching just another parade
