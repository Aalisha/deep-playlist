I make a miserable D.J. getting drunk, playing records up late
Wearing out a hole in my heart on the couch from when you went away
Today wrote out a prescription leave all calls to the answering machine
I don't remember anything but I know that you know where I've been

Where would I go?
What would I do?
I would be nowhere with out you
Now I know heaven's above you I can grow
I just can't make it on my own

Watching terrible T.V it's ok all our secrets we keep
I used to dream of broken teeth now I lie awake watching you sleep
If I'm so independent why when you leave am I digging up holes
To hide and wait til you come back like a bad actor between roles
