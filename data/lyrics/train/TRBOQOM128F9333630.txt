We sent out the SOS call
It was a quarter past four
In the morning
When the storm broke our second anchor line
Four months at sea
Four months of calm seas
Only to be pounded in the shallows
Off of the tip of Montauk Point

They call them rogues
They travel fast and alone
One hundred foot faces
Of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk
To always get hit
Out of nowhere
By some wave and end up on your own

The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts
To bail us out
And flooded the engines and radio
And half buried bow

Your tongue is a rudder
It steers the whole ship
Sends your words past your lips
Or keeps them safe behind your teeth
But the wrong words will strand you
Come off course while you sleep
Sweep your boat out to sea
Or dashed to bits on the reef
