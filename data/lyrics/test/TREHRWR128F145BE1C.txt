Girls, girls, pretty little girls, oh what they do to me
With their ponytails & their short short skirts just above the knee
Big ones, small ones, short & tall, they all have somethin' new
There's so many girls & so little time
I don't know what I'm gonna do

Ooo I love the way they walk
Uh uh, I love to hear 'em talk
...
