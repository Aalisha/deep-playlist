Way too restless, in suspense
When the voices begin
All the whispers in silence
He just took it on a chin
Defense turned to violence
Laying face down on a sand

Face down on a shoreline, it was not like how it seemed

With all the passion drowning, leaving nothing but a doubt
Soon you buried six feet under, there's nothing to talk about
