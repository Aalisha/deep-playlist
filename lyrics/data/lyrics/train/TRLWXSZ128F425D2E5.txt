Well... I won't be caught living in a dead end job (job)
While praying to my government, guns, and God (God)
Now it's us against them
We're here to represent
And spit right in the face of the establishment
And now I don't believe (In having faith in nothing!)
Stand on my own (Got no sympathy!)
Wasting the youth (While being young and useless!)
Speak for yourself (And don't pray for me!)

Well because we're doing fine
And we don't need to be told
That we're doing fine
Cause we won't give you control
And we don't need anything from you.
Cause we'll be just fine
And we won't be bought and sold
Just like you
