The first time I saw the moon
I cursed the sun
as I watched it shine
I watched it burn a hole
I watched it burn a hole

Every time I cursed the moon
I cursed the sun
as I watched it burn
as i watched it turn away
I don't have to turn away

Everything, as it moves
as it moves I watch it turn right into gold
it turns right into gold
but you said everything, as it moves
as it moves me it turns right into gold
and yes it turns right into gold
...
