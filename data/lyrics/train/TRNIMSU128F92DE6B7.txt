So you're big and kinda hairy
Like a monkey at the zoo
I don't care if you're a monkey
With an ass that's red and blue

'Cause I'm gonna fuck you doggy-style
The way chihuahua's do
But I got one request
That I just have to ask of you

Turn out the lights
Before you suck my dick
Someone beat you with an ugly stick
I wanna fuck, but you make me sick, so
Turn out the lights, turn out the lights

So you think that I'm a loser
'Cause I used to be in jail
And I got my GED Diploma
Last week in the mail

But at least a man can exercise
If he gets too fat
