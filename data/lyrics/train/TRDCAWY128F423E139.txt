I never sleep
I been awake for what feels like a year
'cause when I dream
My mind puts a face
To each one of my fears
I'm exhausted by my imagination
I close my eyes
But I could still see the pain on your face
It's your disguise
You put your heart and soul on a plate
I'm exhausted by my imagination
The walls are bleeding cause I'm hallucinating
Beneath the wheel I cannot slow it's rotation down
