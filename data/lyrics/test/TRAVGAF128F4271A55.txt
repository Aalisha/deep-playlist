When light goes down,
I see no reason
For you to cry.
We've been through this before
In every time,
in every season
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more.
Can't you see it in my eyes
This might be our last goodbye
Carrie, Carrie,
things they change my friend
Carrie, Carrie,
maybe we'll meet again
...
