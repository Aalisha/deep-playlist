How do expect me to sleep at night
Knowin my people ain t eatin right
Gimme a mic
I ll strike with heat like a meteorite
Fuck the media hype
Scribes sniping at me and mine
Megatron clockin Autobots with the eagle eye
They got you covered
Eye colour to your sneaker size
Revolutionaries demonised
Mother Earth colonised
Stolen culture commoditised
Modified genes
Each regime modernised
Maximum terror
Fear and e|ciency
Military missionaries
New age crusades
Faith for your misery
Minds in the grind
No time to meditate on the mysteries of life
And can t motivate
Drive trapped in the tra|c jam
Bare-knuckle boxing
Brand new caravan
I m cat-a-walling like Margarita Prakatan
Til Sona Fam go platinum in Pakistan
And stack collateral
Watch the country bumpkin smash the capital
