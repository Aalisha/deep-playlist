"This recording, is a collection
of unintended indiscretions before microphone"

"Oh who locked the door?"
"A hard man is good to find."
"Open the door!"
"The principles. of friction"

[Nice] This feeling's a function, so step to this
[Serch] Ain't the average boys who do this
[Nice] Door is opened, to office summoned
[Serch] Yo Pete I think you're in there man! ("I'm coming!")
[Nice] Reception warm, not a handshake
My hands shook, barrier's about to break
[Serch] She was seated, legs long and slammin
[Nice] Oval office opened, so let's begin!
Push my point across, firmly
[Serch] Core proposal
[Nice] Prime Minister serve me, surely ("Surely! Nyuk nyuk nyuk")
I serve you with motion
and doors open wider, coast in
[Serch] Secretary said, "Put Serch on line two.
Yo, put him on hold!"

"That towel was related to my husband!" (repeat 4X)

* [MC Serch] - speaking in background *
Aiyyo Pete man, let me in man
I'm here to get retarded yo, so step off
Nah I'm not holdin the door to come in
Yo, yo move your, move your elbow!
Move your elbow, yo, you're not dickin on me
Your boy look like the Great Pumpkin
You're frontin like you play the Pumpkin
Move your elbow, because I'm IN THERE!

[Serch] The meeting rotates
[Nice] Mockneck or cactus?
"They got my head boss."
[BOTH] She attacked us!
[Nice] With a treaty for disarmament
