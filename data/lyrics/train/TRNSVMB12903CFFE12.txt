I could stay all of the night
Wondering where this thoughts may take me
I would think all that I want
Knowing how this might affect me

How can I
Just lie down and sleep
When there's so much to know and to say

How can I
Hide from it all
With a lifetime of war on its way

How can I
Remain without doubt
When all that they want is so near

I can try
To stay shy of my anger
And all that I'm holding so dear

Taking all this time to fight
Those who do not see
