I don't wanna leave you here all by yourself
I just wanna let you know I'm there for you, like no one else
I don't wanna drift off to another place
I just wanna lay here in your arms, with your hand on my face

So let's not ever tell the moon about the sun
I'll keep hearing love songs, hoping every wrong's undone
It's foolish, but we've only just begun
I don't wanna stop this, all my walls are cavin' in

I wanna give you something worth livin' for, oh yeah
I wanna tell you this and so much more
My everything, my universe
