Crying out loud for someone to save you
Numb to everything in life
I’ve been dead to you for way too long

You take me away (away)
Now you're bringing me back to life, back to life

Here we are buried under our lives
In a world, oh so cold
Frozen in a moment, just close your eyes
Life was all a dream so put me to sleep

I’ll follow the blood, to you my God
Bring this puzzle back, back to life
