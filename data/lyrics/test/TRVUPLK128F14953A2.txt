We have waited for so long
To occur this day
There are those who fly away to a distant place
But I think I'll stay
And I wouldn't have it any other way
In this solace I see
A light piercing the darkness
Coming on the winds
Of imagery
When all I know is crumbling
I am becoming something more than humanity could ever allow me to be
I remember a day when
My dreams of escape
Seemed so far away

Let's go back in time, you and I
To my
Initiation to your false empire
You greased, you aimed
And then you spit
While I
Once again pushed away my conscience

Yet always, it seems
I cannot fathom the plateau
Without first the pit
...
