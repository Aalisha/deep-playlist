was early in novmber, the leaves were on the ground,
i couldn't get up, i just gotten down,
i'm all alone, been waitin by the phone, waitin for your calls eventualy
you filled me with worry, you filled me with fear,
i'm not standing still, and i'm not staying here
outta my way, i can't take it no more,
so brown dog barkin at the back door, brown dog barkin at the back door (come on!)
so off on my adventure, where do i begin
america called, it's calling again
i jumped on a plane, i'm drinkin on the way, i wake up in the sunshine every day
