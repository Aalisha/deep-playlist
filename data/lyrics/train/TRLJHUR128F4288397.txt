Secrets
Secrets

Secrets, oh, what you kept from me
They made our world go around
But secrets, they only last a long
Enough to break you down

Stuck sitting, you left me there waiting for you
You didn't want to be my girl
And I saw you by candlelight waiting for two
Sure wasn't me who was doin' it with you

Oh, but there's too much in my mind, right now
To say, how I feel, to do what I need to do
And how can you leave like this
When a simple kiss, it is all you gave me
...
