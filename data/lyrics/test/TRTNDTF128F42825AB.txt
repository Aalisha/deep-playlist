This is Minister Metal Foot, treat a pedal like an earwig
And cook off by applyin' the same logic to the gearshift
Bird off prey circle, serf homes like I tweaked when the beak
Hit the bones, leave him alone

Leaky break fluid but ghost, the boy whip swift
Cruise for the unusually mutual shoes
In and out hot stepper lane eat fame
Spit the blinkin' lights back to the lions
Keep the name freak the frame

Like it lasts without compromising the mission
On guard to peak with the gain the second
The second frame twitches
Which is fine, I learned stay alert early
For the buzzards that burgle the worms
Know nothing of mercy

Wrote this one in Europe with Walz
While his Ravi sick at home, it's killin' him, if you can't identify
Peep, see when you kill the shows, then the bills unfold
And if the bills unfold, the children ain't gonna pick at bones

Only soldiers shoulders built to carry weight could troop us
Shake a room up scoop the venue phone
1800 Brooklyn zoo is Kenya home
I mean, it's love when the screams leave your face
But it's realer when your seed's fever breaks

Kid, I got your family, pull up a chair
I got a little somethin' that I want y'all to hear
There is much greater peace out there still
And if I gotta carry it home in my teeth for y'all, I will

There is a greater love
