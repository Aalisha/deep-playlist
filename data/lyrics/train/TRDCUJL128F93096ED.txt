Woo Rastafari rule and reign
Rastafari guide and protect I again
Hold fast

Lion wear the crown
Lion wear the crown
Lion wear the crown
Lion wear the crown
Lion wear the crown
Lion wear the crown
Lion wear the crown
Lion wear the crown

Pythagoras Anaxagoras Rasputin Erasmus
Napoleon Leopold of Belgium
Julius Octavian and Augustus
In the August and in the July try
Still you are not of the Lion Tribe
Still you are not of the Lion Tribe

Bring my daughters, bring my sons
I know that the day will come
I know that the day will come
I know that the day will come

Napoleon the Naples Lion obsessed
with being god and man
Alexander and Aristotle his tutor
Egyptian culture conquered the conqueror

Bring my daughters, bring my sons
I know that the day will come
I know that the day will come
I know that the day will come

Every time they hear the word campaign
They see Hannibal crossing the Alps again
In Washington DC New York and in
Germany and in London
Did you see the obelisk of Axum in
front of the Vatican Oh God

Giordano Bruno Joan of Arc
Da Vinci Leonardo and Michael Angelo
The black Medici of Italy knows
An influx of innovation from
the African coasts

Bring my daughters, bring my sons
I know that the day will come
