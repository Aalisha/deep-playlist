Yeah, uhh
Girl you lookin' so sexy, you know
Come ova here
Let me talk to for a min
Check this out

I got your message on my cell phone
You said that you were gonna be home alone
(Ohh)
You know, I can't miss a chance to have your body next to mine
 (Next to mine)
See I pull up into your drive way

And you rushed at the door 'cause you been missin' your man
(Missin' your man)
All your friends are gone so we actin' grown
(Grown)
Let's play house all nite

You take my clothes off
I take your clothes off
I turn the lights off
You turn a light on

'Cause you wanna see me
While we get freaky
N' to start it off I got one question
For you tell me do you mind?

Do you mind if I wanna put my lips right there?
(Ohh, do you mind if I wanna put my lips right there?)
Do you mind if I wanna pull on your hair?
(Do you mind if I wanna pull on your hair?)

Do you mind holdin' onto somethin' while I'm workin' in the rear?
(Whilin' I'm workin', workin' from the back baby)
Let's make love, let's make love
Make love all over tha place babe
