Come on, when you love me
You make me feel so strong
You just wanna love me all night long

Move just like the river
Fall like the morning rain
Mmm, can’t help but love you, ain't no way

Keep on rollin’
Keep on rollin’ me mama
Roll me mama, to take my cares away
Keep on rollin’
Keep on rollin’ me mama
Roll me mama, roll my cares away

Roll me mama
