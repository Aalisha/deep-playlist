Yeah, c'mon!

We're lovin' every beat of the music
We're lovin' every beat of the music
We're lovin' every beat of the music
The music, the music, the music

I still remember it was day number one
We hit the ground and then we started to run
Now we're connected and I won't turn around
Cause you set me free, put my soul at ease

I just can't stop the feeling (stop the feeling)
What you give is what I'm needing (what I'm needing)
I just won't stop believing
On and on it's only just begun (it's only just begun)

I feel so (so) alive (alive)
Make it last forever
Everyday (day) is fine (is fine)
Whenever we're together (together)
I'm so (so) alive (alive)
Loving every minute
Underneath the sky there's a heaven for you and I
I feel so alive
