I do declare I was surprised to see you stay
Only to be betrayed by the one you gave all your love and trust

And tell me how could I let go
Since I caught a glimpse of your immense soul
You were dancing to northern soul
Just one glance, ah well you know.

There she goes a little heartache
There she goes a little pain
Make no mistake she sheds her skin like a snake
On the dirty road to fame
...
