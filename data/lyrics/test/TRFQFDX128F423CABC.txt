Snow piled on tables, up on scales, into bags
Late night beer and smoke
Too sleepy and awake
Two sleepy and awake

Crazy eyes over eggs, crazy eyes like mine
Clothes from a street cart, too much beer for the time
At hand
Night time passed by me again

Phone calls that should never be made
Phone calls that speed last night into today

So, where will you be in ten years?
