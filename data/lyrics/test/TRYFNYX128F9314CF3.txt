. . . and then the river ends, ya leave the boat
& find you're walkin' . . the boat is floating
in your mind, although these words are talking
. . . this seems a very good place to sit & rest
a while before the chorus . . .

oh! & there's a feeling comin' to ya
oh! & then you're smilin' like a buddha

. . . the music draws you up a valley, & across
a mountain . . . ya gather round it like yer
gathering around a fountain . . . & when the
music is right, ya feel the spirit lockin' . . .

oh! & there's a feelin' runnin' through ya
...
