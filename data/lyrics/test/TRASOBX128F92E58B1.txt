Verse 1:

I've been walking in circles
Watching you everyday
I've been taking every care
Not to scare you away
I've made you my friend
You've put your trust in me
I'm a shoulder t cry on
Whenever you're in need

Verse 2:

I've been reading your ways
Looking for a sign
Is there any chance at all
That I can make you mine
Well I've come this far
but there's a longer way to go
My chances look slim
But soon I will know

Chorus:

It's tearing me up inside
Holding back for you
Feelings are hard to hide
...
