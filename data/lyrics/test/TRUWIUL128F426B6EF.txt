Now time has passed since we broke up
And I start to see the good things again
I'll never love another girl
Now time has passed and these facts remain the same

You're the best thing that ever happened to me
I'm sorry but at that moment I couldn't see
I wonder if you have some space for me
Or if I'm bound to sail this lonesome sea
