Hold on you dont have much time
find a nosebleed seat when the worlds collide
cause there's something coming from outer space
and i've got everything bet on the ace of spades

harmageddon its the end of time
say your last haiku and make shure it rhymes
cause while nuclear winter makes your volvo rust
you'll be spending forever as a handful of dust
