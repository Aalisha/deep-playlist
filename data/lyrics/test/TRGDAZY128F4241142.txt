Well you're boring me now
First you stay then you go
If I'm kicking you out
Then it's time you should know
Oh baby

I'm so sick and tired of sitting talking to you
Yeah that's right
You never tell me anything that I wanna know 'bout your life

But baby when you touch me on my body
I love every feeling that I used to know
And baby when you touch me on my body
I'm losing my mind every time here I go

But baby when you touch me on my body
I love every feeling that I used to know
And baby when you touch me on my body
I'm losing my mind every time here I go

Baby, yeah that's right
Baby, yeah that's right
