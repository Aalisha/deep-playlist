Upon this street where time has died
The golden treat you never tried
In times of old, in days gone by
If I could catch your dancing eye

It was on the way
On the road to dreams, yeah
Now my heart's drowned in no love streams, yeah

The street is cold, its trees are gone
The story's told the dark has won
Once we set sail to catch a star
We had to fail, it was too far
