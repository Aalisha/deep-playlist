She got eyes that cut you like a
knife and
Lips that taste like sweet red wine
And pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastatin' smile knock a grown man to his knees

She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
but I couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is
