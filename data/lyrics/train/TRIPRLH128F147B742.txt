Rollerskate skinny and the terrible two's
How can you have everything and nothing to lose?
You and nobody see eye to eye
You're gonna wake up with a ghost instead of a guy

Bulletin board on the wall of a church
Soaking up the city from a top-step perch
You're gonna break down on a midnight date
You're gonna curse this town, you're gonna run late

You're pretty as a penny
Rollerskate skinny
You're pretty as a penny
Rollerskate skinny

Do you want to meet up at the Pickwood Bowl?
We could knock nine down and leave one in the hole
