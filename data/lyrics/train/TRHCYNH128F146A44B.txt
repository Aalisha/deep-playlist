I sit and I watch the sun go down
Seems I've lost what I thought my heart had found
It took one crazy night to take the moon and turn out it's light
Will it shine again? Well it just might

* If you'd only love me (You're all that I need)
If you, if you would only love me (You're all that I need)
If you'd forgive me now
With your love I'd get back the moon somehow
If you, if you would only love me

I dream, you're on the other riverside (The other riverside)
You call you hold your arms out open wide (Open wide)
