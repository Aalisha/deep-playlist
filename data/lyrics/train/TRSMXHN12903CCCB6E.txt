Got a ragin' fever, losin' control
Got a wild desire burnin' in my soul
I'm hungry baby, hot on your trail
Gonna get to heaven, through the fires of hell
Through the fires of hell

Come and take me to the promise land
Won't you give me all your loveCome and take me to the promise land
Open your gates baby take me down
To the promise land

Headin' for your garden, yeah I'm glory bound
Wanna dig my fingers deep in your sacred ground
Your sacred ground
