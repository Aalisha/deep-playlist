It's a shame when you got me where you want me
But you want me somewhere else
And it's a shame the way you take my love
And baby on and off the shelf

Tell me how many times can I believe you
When you're out with your best friend
When you don't even care if the
Whole town sees you out with another man

[Chorus]
It's a shame, shame, shame
The way you run my life
...
