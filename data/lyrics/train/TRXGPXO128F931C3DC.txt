Could you stay long enough for me to say goodbye
You can be free as long as you're with me
If you could see the real me you'd bleed
If you could see the real me I'd breathe
Could you still breathe long enough for me
Could you still be long enough for me

When do you think I'll be okay
When do you think I'll be okay

If I should stay when do I pray
If I should stay where do I begin
Do you think I should watch you die
Should we close our eyes and say goodbye

When do you think I'll be okay
When do you think I'll be okay
When do you think I'll be okay
