Sail on down the line
Bout a half a mile or so
And don't really wanna know
Where you're going

Maybe once or twice you see
Time after time I tried to
To hold on to what we got
But now you're going

And I don't mind about the
Things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame
But I'm giving you back your name
Yeah, yeah
