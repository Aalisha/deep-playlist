So from this view
This canyon I call the future
This precipice from which I stare
Over nothingness and all so self-aware
Disappearing
Disappearing

Will you ever make the jump for me?

That makes me feel so good
And this makes me feel so positive
That makes me feel so good
And this makes me feel so positive

For all the little half-truths and total lies
I cursed myself over
Yeah I cursed myself tonight
Journeys with morals cast aside
Re-enacting the dissident code
Re-enacting the dissident code

That makes me feel so good
And this makes me feel so positive
That makes me feel so good
And this makes me feel so positive

I'll cover all your mistakes
I'll cancel all your negatives
I'll destroy all the traces
Of your misdemeanours
I'll cover all your mistakes
I'll cancel all your negatives
I'll destroy all the traces
