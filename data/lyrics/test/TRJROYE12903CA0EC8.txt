(feat. Method Man, Nas & Ja Rule)

[DMX - dialogue]
I ain't goin back to jail
Next time, the County or the State see me
it's gonna be in a bag

UHH! This is it baby!
End of the road, ha hah!
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life!
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon!

[Method Man]
Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe
from the Friday the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger achin, snatch yo' ass
out that S-Class for fakin, forty-fo' blast
is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
for the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me
Throwin rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young G we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
Cause we family for better or worse, you and I
from the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
to be here, and each year, I'm pourin out more beer
for deceased peers, holdin fort
Police line 'Do Not Cross', they found his corpse
in the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide the crime Method, add another
killer verse to the murder record, the Grand Finale
