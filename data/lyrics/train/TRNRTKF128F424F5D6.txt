All of your life, you never tried to see the plan
Holding inside, the things you’d never understand
Drifting in darkness now
You hear a sound that breaks the silence

Your mind’s working overtime,
you’re wondering what you’ll find
Drives you crazy!
You’re holding it deep inside
You might as well give it up,
It drives you crazy!, yeah yeah

Waking inside a dream,
When nothing is what it seems
Always alone, but you’re never lonely,
...
