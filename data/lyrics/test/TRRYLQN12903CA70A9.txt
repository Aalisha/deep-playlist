I've found a place where I can go
I've found a place that's holy
I've found a place where You are no long reaching for me
I've found a place that's close to you
I've found a place that's close to me
I've found a place where You are and that's where I want to be

*Chorus*
And You'll find me at Your feet
And You'll find me kneeling
And You'll find me near or far
You will find me where You are
