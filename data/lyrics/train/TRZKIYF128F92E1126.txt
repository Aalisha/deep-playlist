Had my golf clubs on my shoulder when you saw me first today
Wearin' my old army sweater that you thought you threw away
And when you saw me standin' there you shook your head and sighed
When you saw I'd bought a sixpack I thought you were gonna cry
Your man loves you honey and I don't know what else to say
Your man loves you honey but you can't change my ways
