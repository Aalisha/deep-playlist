'Member Mossy, 'member the sweet dreams
'Member the cocoa leaves, 'member Sega Gene-sis
Now we live in love like Genovese, stash twenty G's ease
Crib in Belize please, forever cheese
Crib all fresh high-tech nigga, art deco
In the villa room, sippin Demi Sec, ohh?
Seperate the classiest from the nastiest
bugs, on some ninety-six ill shit
Niggaz used to rock Swatches and style 'member?
Now they 'bezle on the Rolexes chips like December
in Havana, the Cabana, Copa
Now Fox is flippin more chips than Oprah
Lizard skin sofa, ice flooded Don
like Imelda Marcos, the Donness, I be the peron
pure precon foot action Tone
like the Brax-ton, Fox nigga get your smash on

*sung chorus*
No one's gonna love you, the way I do
Nobody, I can love you better
...
