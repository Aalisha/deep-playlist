Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
