Verse 1
There's a voice from up above that says
The only ting in life that you regret
Are the times your courage's down
And you just let those moments pass you by

So lift your head above the winds and rain
For all the others in the world afraid
You've got a life ahead of you
That's filled with promise and hope will get you through
And wishes come through and I hear him say

Aim your arrow high
And when you reach the sky
Somehow you'll know you've tried more than the others
And if you miss the mark
At least you've played the part
Of the dreams inside your heart that you've discovered
When you aim your arrow high
