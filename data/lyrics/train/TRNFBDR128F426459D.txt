Grand slam
Your moment's at hand
The day holds a costly bargain
Lost lamb
Asking the lion's share
Homespun
A prodigal son
Comes begging a humble pardon
But no one
Rises to hear his prayer...

Lone star
You've wandered so far
And long in the unfamiliar
That now you
Travel a map unknown
Starbright
A constant delight
To those in the dark
And still your
Birthright's
...
