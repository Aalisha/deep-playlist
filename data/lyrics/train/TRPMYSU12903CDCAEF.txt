Throw out the old rulebook, rulebook.
Throw it out.
Bring back the old playbook, black book.
Use it now.

Tonight is your night, so answer the call.
If you are going to bleed, we will take it all.
It's not about self pity, it's about recovery.
If there is any confusion, we will show you what we mean.
