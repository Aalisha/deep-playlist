Darkness descends on my world once again
Straining to see the truth in front of me
Clawing through broken glass, tears and cuts
Floor drenched in death screaming in agony

Faces surround me cold and dead
Gazing into nowhere, filling me with hellish dread
Spellbound by malice paranoid and cold
The living dead sit quiet filled with black blood
With ravenous vermin gnawing flesh
The hunger returns for the sustenance that I dread
Racing through my veins with a vengeance so cold
Feeling like god rising above this world
