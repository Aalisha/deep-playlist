Suddenly, it happened so fast
I couldn't believe the news that I received
My heart stopped as I hit the floor
I fell to my knees cryin' Lord help me

No matter what time brings
All the changes we go through
In life there's some things
We just can't prepare for

I don't care what they say
Don't care what they do
I don't care what they think
I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life
Don't they know
True love never dies
I promise to love you for the rest of my life

Life goes on that's what they say
Time will heal all your pain away
