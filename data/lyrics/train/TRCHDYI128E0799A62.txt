When a spirit is broken
Why go on
When there's nothing to say
And a love just a token
It was strong
Now it's fading away

Ah but I'm free as a bird
As I walk right out that door
You have my word
I won't bother you no more
Yes I'm doing alright
As I face the lonely night

And our love it was over
Long ago
But we just didn't say
And the years they have fallen
...
