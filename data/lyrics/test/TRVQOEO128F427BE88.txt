These things I say
Come spinning out of my mouth
Like they've lost their way
And there's no doubt about it
You heard me
I shouted
I think you preferred it
That whenever you come clean
I say nothing at all

So what
You left
Before I had a single chance
To second guess
These bittersweet diversions
And late night excursions
Secret perversions

Maybe I'm naive
Because I can't believe this
