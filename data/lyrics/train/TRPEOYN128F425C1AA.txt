I´m feeling safe and warm now 
But just as much betrayed 
Your attraction drowns me in now 
Although I´m feeling driven away
You take from me what I call my own 
And you pour out what you call love 
And this eternal up and down 
Just like your mighty waves 
Again and again 
The ocean takes the ocean gives 
And I´m entangled in my dreams 
The ocean takes the ocean gives 
...
