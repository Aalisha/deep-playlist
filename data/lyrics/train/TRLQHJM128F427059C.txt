Crying Holy unto the Lord
Crying Holy unto the Lord
Oh, in that day when the bells don't toll
Crying Holy unto the Lord

Crying Holy unto the Lord (Crying Holy unto the Lord Holy unto the Lord)
Crying Holy unto the Lord (Crying Holy unto the Lord Holy unto the Lord)
Oh, if I could, I surely would (If I could surely would)
Stand on the rock (Praise God) where Moses stood (where Moses stood)
