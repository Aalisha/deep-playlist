Yo, this fucker I was wit the other day, I was chillin'
with Scott and the minute that we got in front of our
crib with a shotgun. Cause jokers gonna be bustin' up
in there trying to get food, clothing, shelter, TV's, forks,
radios or whatever they can get there hands on. Shit
is getting mad ill out here man. Joker's running out here
like with MASKS on; I was with my man Pee, he think
he like Charlie Chan or Robert De Niro
or Bruce Lee or some shit, jumping from behind trees on
Muhfuckas, like Cowboys BANG BANG or whatever you
know. Trying to shoot a joker he had beef with, he wound
up shootin my man up in the street, tyring to be Cowboys
...
