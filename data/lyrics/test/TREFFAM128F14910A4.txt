In line, I long to be, inside your company.
Good things are coming our way, I know they always have.
In time, go far away, a place where we can go I know we will some day, our own
Until then, I will lay inside, the Sun'll rise in time
Don't be so selfless.
I wait on the same lines as you
You can't be so helpless, I'll say what I'm going to do

Good things are coming our way.
