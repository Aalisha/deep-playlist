Anxiety Album

(rough lyrics need revisement)

I need to give up all my hate
cuz all it seems to ever do
is put me deeper in the grave

i only bottle up my rage
but i need to let it out
cuz all it does is put me in a cage

and i dont know how this world can be so cruel
It hurts me, no one really cares that you're alone
