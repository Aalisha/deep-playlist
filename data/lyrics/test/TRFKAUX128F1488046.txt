Love is like an airplane
We jumped in then we pray
The lucky ones remain
In the clouds for days
Life is just a stage
Let's put on the best show
And let everyone know

As if I had to die tonight
I'd rather be with you
Cut the parachute before the time
Baby don't you cry
You had to bring me down
You've had some fun before we hit the ground
...
