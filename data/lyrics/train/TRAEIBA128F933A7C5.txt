Weapons of steel, horses of thunder
He rides the wind, fighting the sin
Demons and ghosts, he pulls them under
He makes the laws and he will win

Lord of the magic twilight, king of the eternal flame
We´re fighting right at your side against the creatures of hell

Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together ´till the end of time
Beware creatures of hell, we will prevail
