In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a barstool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her, her name

When the drinks finally hit her she said, "I'm no quitter"
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings

In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
