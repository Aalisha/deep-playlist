Should I go north? No
Should I go south? No
Should I go west? No
Should I go east? Yeah

I know where my love is
My love is east of Eden
Ohh, east of Eden

You make my dreams so believable
Before I meet you I believed in giving up
You tore down all my walls so I could see outside
Yeah, darlin', that's something I ain't never givin' up

Everyone needs to rely on somebody
Everyone needs to rely on someone
