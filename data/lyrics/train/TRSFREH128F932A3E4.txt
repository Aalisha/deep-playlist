Stonecutters made them from stones
Chosen specially for you and I
Who will live inside

The mountaineers gathered tinder piled high
In which to take along
Driving many miles, knowing they'd get here

When they got here, all exhausted
On the roof leaks they got started
And now when the rain comes, we can be thankful

Ooh, ah, ooh
When the mountaineers saw that everything fit
They were glad, and so they took off

Thought we were due
For a change or two
Around this place

When they get back, they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
