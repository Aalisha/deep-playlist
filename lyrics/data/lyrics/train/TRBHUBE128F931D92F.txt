We're running in circels
And we're running out of breath
A war of the roses
That's how bad it gets

See the heart of the matter is
That this house just ain't a home
Used to hold so much warmheartedness
That it's gone

-CHORUS-
How did we change?
How did it get this far?
How did we change?
Remind me just who we are
Cause I miss the both of us
Making love the way it was
