Oh thinkin' about all our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free

Now nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before

But that's over now

You keep me comin' back for more
And baby you're all that I want
When you're lyin' here in my arms
I'm findin' it hard to believe

We're in heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart

It isn't too hard to see
We're in heaven
