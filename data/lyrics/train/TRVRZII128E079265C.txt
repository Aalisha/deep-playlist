I found you wearing satin, the shade of ebony
In the silence of my dreams you kept me company
On this secluded island our bodies seem to melt
Intoxicating, overwhelming intensity

You're the one that I've been searching for
No less than everything and nothing more
Until the end of time I feel a dawn
You baby, you are all, you are all

I sketch you to observe you, a smeared reality
Now you're draped in chocolate, tasty opportunity
To place you, take time to rest you on some mantel piece
Ignite you, take time to, and everything in between
