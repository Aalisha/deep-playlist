God was really all alone
Everything was clean
Just a sound
Feeling young and feeling free
Feeling right at home
Began to look around
I know you can feel
Light years away
Sound that will get it right
The music of life
Playing around
Changing the lonely night
Little string are never mute
Any time you hear
You're alive
If you feel the harmony
Running every show
