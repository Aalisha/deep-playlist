Went up stairs to pack my leaving trunk
I ain't seen no blues whiskey made me sloppy drunk
I ain'ts had no whiskey, the blues made me sloppy drunk
Goin' back to memphis baby, I had much better luck

Look here mama you know you asked me to be your kin
Said you can man if you only keep it here
But don't let my husband, my main man catch you here
Don't let my main man, my husband catch you here
