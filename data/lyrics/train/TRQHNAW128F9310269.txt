A nature to nurture
An instinct to sin
What's under me
The skin you live in
You trade your unlimited
Your precious creation
You will submit
You will get it

Suddenly I have no strength at all
So suddenly hit with all I've lost
Suddenly my world, is falling apart
So suddenly so suddenly
Suddenly

You say you're a victim
