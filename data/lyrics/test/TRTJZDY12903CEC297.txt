I don't know where I'm going,
But I sure know where I've been.
Hanging promises in songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind.
I ain't wasting no more time,
But here I go again.

Here I go again on my own,
Going down the only road I've ever known.
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone.
And I've made up my mind,
I ain't wasting no more time.
