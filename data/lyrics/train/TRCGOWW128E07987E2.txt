Chours:
Unbreakable,
You can't break our bond It's far too strong
Unshakeable,
Ooooh... we love we cry we ride we die
Unmistakable,
There's so questioning It's the real thing
It's unbreakable,
You can't try but I'm telling you It's unbreakable

Never endured a love like this
It's just pure tenderness
From the morning to the midnight
The million ways he's loving me
Never have I known It's so true, ooooh
These heights he takes me to
I've lost control he caressed my soul oh
I aint never gonna leave

You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't have it, no, no, no, nooo...
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't get it, oooohh woo...
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't
You can't take it, no, no, noooo...
...
