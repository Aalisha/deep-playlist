Said woman, look lovely to me, but your body no ready
And if that you're thinking you're ready to give it a try
And maybe, you might want to wait before you give yourself away
Or maybe, the reasons you're willing are burning inside

And if you say that you want, and girl, you know you need it
And say that you don't want to be caught between someone else and your love
But till you're older now, you've got to get a little bit older now
A little older now, you've got to get a little bit older now
A little older now, you've got to get a little bit older now
A little older now, you've got to get a little bit older now
