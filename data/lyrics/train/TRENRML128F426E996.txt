She's got your eyes
She's got my nose
Oh, I get high just watching her grow
I always dreamed we'd live in a castle, oh but
We're in the same old shack
Sometimes we get into a hassle
But we always take each other back
Oh, you know
All our friends seem to be in a hurry
But we'll just keep on taking our time

We're living such a sweet life, oh what a neat life
Sharing my love with you
