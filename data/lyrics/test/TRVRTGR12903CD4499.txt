LARS:
Straight up - I'm an anarchist - politically extreme
You'll find me down at Kinkos printing anti-corporate Zines
My stencil graffiti is rebellious and defiant
Nothing says revolution like Andre the Giant
JESSE:
You know the science on the Mayans and twenty-twelve, with
Government thugs covering up, lizard people with many selves
Voting is collaborating, only thing I'm advocating
Is raising awareness of MY awareness and self-congratulating
LARS:
Starbucks is the devil, Adbusters told me so
I wear my Che Guevera shirt to subvert the status quo
The government is lying to you and me
Bush knocked down the towers, literally
JESSE:
Yeah he strapped himself with C4 and piloted two planes
Like Bill Pullman in ID4, bootlegged as Loose Change
Who's sane when you claim he didn't plan it with Hussein?
They're one crew signed to different labels, like Wu-Tang

Chorus
LARS:
I've got Naomi Kelin on my mind (No Logo)
Read her whole book because she's fine (No Logo)
You'll find me down at Wal Mart with an anarchy sign
Because dude, it's a fricking anarchy sign! (No Logo)
JESSE:
I'm not racist, you're sensitive, geez (no logo)
