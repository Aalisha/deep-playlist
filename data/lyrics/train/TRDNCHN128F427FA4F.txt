I can never win with you
I try but you don't let me through
Well, what's the point in fighting
When we're done?

I know I've been acting strange
But wait, don't leave, I know I'll change
We're wasting all our time
Together now

Well, I don't know what to say
Every word just makes you turn away
And I don't know what to do
Every day I wanna be with you

Well, I've lost the battle and I'm losing the war
And I keep on asking myself what for
If you believe in fate and destiny
Well, then open your eyes and believe in me

Believe in me
You believe in me
