Who wants to know about history?
Not me (Not me) and not me
Who wants to know about psychology?
Not me (Not me) and not me

Who wants to read books, when you've got the looks
To go out, go out and have some fun
Who wants to stay in, when that's all you've been
And you know that you only wanna have some fun

(You work and you work and you work, no, no)
(You work and you work and you work, no, no)
(You work and you work and you work, no, no, no)

A level pain, hits me again
Hits me again and again and again
Always the same, always the same
Always the same and the same and the same
...
