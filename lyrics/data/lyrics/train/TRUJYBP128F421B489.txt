You cannot see it coming
Always without a warning
You need to hold on tighter
Find a brand new start

High on the wire
They taunted you like Messiah
Time for a change
Before your life just falls apart

How could you find a way
From deep within your heart
Reach out and gaze the star
Let the vision fly

We always have to sail on
Out of shadows to the light beyond
Never shut your weary eyes
...
