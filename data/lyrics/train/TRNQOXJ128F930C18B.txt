I lose my shape, I tumble
And I drift across the sea
I lose my thoughts, I watch them
In graceful movements flow

I catch the raging darkness
And transform it into light
I try to catch a second
But it slips out of my hand

When I reach the
Glorious
My silence within
Enormous
A journey begins

All the words fall so silent
No need to react
I'll remain in my silence within

Illumated I wait, only used for thoughts
...
