Hellfire!

I have always been here
In all forms in all perversions
I will always be here
In all ways in all times

A question in hidding
A solution in disguise
I know no bounds
Like a locust storm I rise

Leprous hell-world
My world
Night world

Blood coated
World despoiler
The master of a devils march
...
