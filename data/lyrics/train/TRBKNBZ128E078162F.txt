It's time to tear this place down
I've got the last game on my mind
Not seen my friends in ages
Have I been left behind?

It's time to figure out why
I find myself in custody
With each and every question
Words come so easily

Fly to El Salvador
I don't know why and I don't know what for
I've seen the picture for myself
Where did that label go?
I tried it out but it didn't work so
I'll choose the picture for myself
...
