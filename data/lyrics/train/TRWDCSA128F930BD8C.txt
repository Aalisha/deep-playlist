You point that little finger out
You got four pointing back at you
It goes evrywhere you go
Does evrything you do
he got roughed up on the inside
Screaming that this ain't fair
And in a block? moment alone on the outside
Thought that no one cared
You want me, you need me, you have me, I'm yours
So he puts in a call to his only friend
He dials 1-800-FEAR
Then he hid his face inside his hands
You know he wasn't very clear
Said I'm roughed uo on the inside
You know that this ain't lair
