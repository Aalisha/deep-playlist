Ooh... ooh...
Oh... oh... oh...
Oh... oh... yeah, yeah

Giving my all to you (Yeah)
Nothing else will do (Yeah, whoa, yeah)
Giving my all to you today
I wanna know (I wanna know) if you love me that way (If you love me that way)

Sometimes I feel
I don't know
Which is up
Or which is down

You make me feel
Like you're not for real
You play with my emotions
But I can't let you go

I've got this love burnin' deep down inside of me
Tellin' me that I should believe everything that you say
It's so hard to live a life with somebody day in, day out
I've got to know the truth
I can't be, I can't be just wastin' my time, so I'll be
