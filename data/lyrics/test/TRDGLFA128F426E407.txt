I should take my time
I should think this through
You know that not a lot of people let you talk like this
With your alarming lack of grace or grasp of rhetoric
Well it's not so much the words you say, it's how you use your lips

I'm sure by now you've noticed that there's no need to move
We're coming to you, yeah we're coming to you
Oh no

It's your place or mine
Just don't make me choose
You know I know you think you're saying what I want to hear
