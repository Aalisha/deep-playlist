Music is a teacher that can teach you right from wrong
'Coz if you listen closely, well, there's a lesson in the song
Music is a doctor that can cure a troubled mind
Listen to the music, say it again, the rhythms and the rhymes

'Cause music's takin' over, music make you dance
Music's takin' over, just give music a chance, say it again

Music is a comfort, well, when you're all alone
Just turn up your music and you don't need nobody home
Music is a power, people depend on every day
