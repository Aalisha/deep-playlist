Everybody's wonderin' what and where they all came from
Everybody's worryin' 'bout where they're gonna go
When the whole thing's done
But no one knows for certain

And so it's all the same to me
I think I'll just let the mystery be
Some say once you're gone you're gone forever
And some say you're gonna come back

Some say you rest in the arms of the Saviour
If in sinful ways you lack
Some say that they're comin' back in a garden
