Cold seems crippling
Lame meander through corridors
Aroma's thick with age
Mark off the day
Reflections of my life are fading

Pull me out your body
Don't want it, don't want in
Feeble frail and rotting
Descending
I'm lost in
A structure that's collapsing
Don't want it
Cast into
Maker take the body
Don't want it
It wants me

Past has found it's place
Salvation is no more
Will God accept my peace
Bleached will pardon me
Reflections of my life are fading

Pull me out your body
Don't want it, don't want in,
Feeble frail and rotting descending
I'm lost in
A structure that's collapsing
Don't want it
Cast into,
Maker take the body
Don't want it
It wants me

I just want to run around
Fly kites
Wrestle
Jump and play
Swim through waves that crash
...
