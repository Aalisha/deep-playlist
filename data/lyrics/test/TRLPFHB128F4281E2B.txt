This is a pointless teenage anthem
About how great things used to be
The kind that tugs your heartstrings
Like rhythmic atrophy

A pointless teenage anthem
We're not allowed to grow
Past the pointless teenage tantrums
Like the kind I used to throw

Round, round, round
Just keep spinning around
Down, down, down
...
