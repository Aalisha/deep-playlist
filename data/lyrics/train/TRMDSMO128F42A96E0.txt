It's hard to let the miles pass me by
Yellow lines that blend together in my eyes
And when the seasons change again then I will too
I just want to be closer to you

I'm staring out at endless rows of green
There are miles of hay like I have never seen
Just when you think you've had enough
And your dreams come true
I just want to be closer to you
