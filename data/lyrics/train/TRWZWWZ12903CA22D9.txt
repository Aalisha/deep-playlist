Tell me where you've been to
Nowhere that you shouldn't do
Tell me what you're good for
I can tell you something too

Where have you been staying?
Tell me what you're playing
Hope it's not my conscious
But it keeps complaining

Didn't meet you in an alley
The cats they weren't complaining
I met you in the daylight
Our vision's misbehaving

I offer you my temper
With the hope that you would tame me
We built ourselves a shelter
You will always be my baby

Feeling, keep on feeling, keep on feeling
