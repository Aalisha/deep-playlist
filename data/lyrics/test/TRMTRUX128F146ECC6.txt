What the hell is wrong with you tonight
I can't seem to say or do the right thing
Wanted to be sure you're feeling right
Wanted to be sure we want the same thing

She said I can't believe it
You can't I simply mean it
Don't we all want the same thing
Don't we, well who said anything about love

No not love she said
Don't you know that it's different for girls
(Don't give me love)
No not love she said
Don't you know that it's different for girls
You're all the same
