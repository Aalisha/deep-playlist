I never knew myself enough
And let it get the best of me
22 years late but now on time
I won my war and now I'm fine

You're still here but barely whole
You never seem to take control
You're trucking through the years alone
Just to find me waiting here still by your side

Light me up like dynamite
Don't need a hit when I'm with you
Fall into my bed, don't fight
A little love to get you through
