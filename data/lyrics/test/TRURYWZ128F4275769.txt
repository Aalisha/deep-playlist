Searchin' and seekin'
never sleepin'
I've got to find me a man.
I want no disguises
just surprises someone who I'll understand.
I don't need a guy who spends only one night

then tell me he's got no more time.
I'm looking for someone to share my life
I better move on down the line.

Searchin' - looking for love all the time I can.
Searchin' - looking for love I've got to find a man.
Some guys excite me but don't invite me.
They don't even notice
