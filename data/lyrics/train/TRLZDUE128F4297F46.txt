It's a beautiful landscape
The sunset makes the coast look so clear
It's the kind that makes you heart break
But no one has those kind of problems here

And from the sagebrush comes a dove
It comes to take away the ones you love
In camouflage comes a dove, and it comes to take away the ones you love

Wake up you faithless, see your heartbreak gone

The wolf has found a way to lead this foolish flock of sheep astray
