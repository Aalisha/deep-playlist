there was a time
when our hearts were one
almost lost you 
somewhere in the storm
wings of passion
cold and hard to bare
I remember you were standing there
standing there

as we look to the sky
watching love pass us by
one more time 
we try to catch a ride
in our hopes there is a dream
sometimes lost so it seems
don't let love pass us by 
this time
...
