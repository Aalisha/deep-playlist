If I smiled at you, would you stay with me?
If I made a place for you, would you lay with me?
If I dance for you, would you groove with me?
Please be with me, be with me

How I could I explain without fear
How I look at you after last night
I cloud lay here for all my life
Never again see the days light

Just be here and touch my face
And don't ever leave my sight
I'm a drunken fiend for the smell of you
If you go away what would I do
