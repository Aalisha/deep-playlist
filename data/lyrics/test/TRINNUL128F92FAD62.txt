I Wish you didn't love me
I wish you'd make this easy
It was love that caught me
Now it's fear that keeps me with you

I want to be by your side
So I can close my eyes
To the growing emptiness inside that kills me
When I'm with you

You try to break me Try to hate me
So you can fall out of love
You want to make me believe that I'm crazy
That I'm nothing with out you

It's unbelievable but I believed you
Unforgivable but I forgave you
Insane what love can do
That keeps me coming back to you

You're irreplaceable but I'll replace you
