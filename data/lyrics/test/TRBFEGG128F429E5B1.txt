C-Rayz. Walz.
We did it y'all, Ravipops
I'm here, emphatically yes
Definitive Jux, Ravipops

Ladies and gentlemen
We got C-Rayz Walz and a million fans in the house tonight
He just came off tour
Reppin for his 25th single
See "Ravipops - The Substance"
He gon' show you how he get down

[C-Rayz Walz]
Yo, I put the pace down, recognize my fate now
I'm ILL, still freakin skills like H-Town
I disgrace clowns who make frowns
Smile in your face but hate and deliver fake pounds
I'm a animal, in a cannibal sector
With chicks that give you brains like Hannibal Lector
Peep logic - there's nothin you can do to stop this
You have a better chance catchin bullets with chopsticks (WAHH!)
