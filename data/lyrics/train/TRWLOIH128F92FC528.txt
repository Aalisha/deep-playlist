A cold routine to lie in
a growing apathy killing me
misunderstanding all the way
as the darkness grew day by day
to dicover the fragility
unconscious, unconstant gravity
an unmoving, dirty rain
our quiet and sterile air

You're slowly burning me
you're slowly killing me
dropping bombs from your throat
each bomb falls into my heart
burning everything between
destroying everything within
...
