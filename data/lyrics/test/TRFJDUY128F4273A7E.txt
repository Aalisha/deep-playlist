Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
You just might lose the best thing
That you ever found
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around

Oh, the nights are lonely
Twice as cold
Without my baby's hand to hold
My happiness is fading away
Just like a thief
I tried to steal a kiss
From another pretty miss
My baby was the price that I paid

Now listen, fellows
(Think twice)
Think twice if you have cheating on your mind
(Watch your step)
Remember
The punishment will fit your crime

Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Don't let your baby catch you
Fooling around
