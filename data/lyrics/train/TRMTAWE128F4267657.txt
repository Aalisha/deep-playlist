Children growing women producing
Men go work and some do stealing
Everyone's got to make a living
LOX yeah
JLo yeah
Yeah yo-yo
We off the blocks this year
Went from a low to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm goin' and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear
Yeah we're at the airport out
D Block from the block where everybody air forced out
With a new white tee you fresh nothin' phony with us
Make the money get the mansion bring the homies with us
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
From the Bronx!
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where came from
From the Bronx!
From In Livin' Color movie scripts
To On the 6 to JLo to this headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya
