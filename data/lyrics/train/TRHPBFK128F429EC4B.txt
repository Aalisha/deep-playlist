Oh, that I could bend my tongue outwards
Leave your lungs hurting
Tuckin' my shirt in
Pants I wear so well
Cross your t's shirt smells
Worse than your lyin'
Caught my dad cryin'
Loose like the wind
From the rough we get par
Sleet city woman
Waiting to spar

I'm Drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst
Drowning for your thirst

Getting off the candelabra
We call her Barbara
