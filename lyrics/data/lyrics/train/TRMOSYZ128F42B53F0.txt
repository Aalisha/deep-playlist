The barrio starts two streets over
Miguel, he's a friend of mine
With brick weed, built a reputation
Like dry ice in the summertime

Now all you need's an electric razor
A magic bullet in a grassy knoll
The whole world's just a little oyster
To Snow White and the poison apple leaves

I woke up in the age of wires
I fell asleep at the dusk of man
Now I'm cold as Popocatepetl
Fingers crossed in the promised land

But you won't be getting in
 (You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
 (You know by now)
No, you won't be getting in
 (You know by now)
All sold out in heaven

The barrio starts two streets over
...
