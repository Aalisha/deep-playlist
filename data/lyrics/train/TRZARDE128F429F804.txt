I was scatterbrained
When I found the time to find
That times are evil
Sick and disjointed
My skin is thick
Thick and calloused
I'm ready to shed the shell
Ready to shed the shell

So you think you have figured me out
A young man lost in his problems
Some problems aren't that easy to solve
You can't break our code of energy

I'm bent out of shape
There is no happy ending
I've come to a point
Where I just don't give a fuck
My skin is thick
Thick and calloused
I'm ready to shed the shell
Ready to shed the shell
