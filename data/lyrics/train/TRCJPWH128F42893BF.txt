there are reasons to talk about it. 
this patriarchy we live in (i see it everyday). 
who's in the front row finger pointing? 
is the gender ratio in bands disappointing?

inspires me to struggle with my own internal battle. 
i know the two don't compare. 
don't call me white. 
i don't know what it's like 
but i'll support you in any way i can.
