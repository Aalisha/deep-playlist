Even though I met you only recently
I find myself falling in love with you
I dont know quite how to put this decently
but what's the chance that you can love me too?

who who who who who
has made my dreams come true?
and turned my gray sky blue
why its you you you you you

who who who who who
like amorous lovebirds do
who made my world seem new
tasted you you you you you
you make me feel like i'm seventeen again
