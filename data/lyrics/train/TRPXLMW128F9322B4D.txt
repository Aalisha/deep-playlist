Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Look what they've done to my song
Well it's the only thing that I could do half right
And now it's turning out all wrong, Ma
Look what they've done to my song

Look what they've done to my brain, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain
Well they've picked it like a chicken bone
I think I'm half insane, Ma
Look what they've done to my song

I wish I could find a good book, to live in
I wish I could find a good book
'Cause I could find a real good book
