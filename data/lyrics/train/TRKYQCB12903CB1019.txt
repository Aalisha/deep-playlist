[verse]
strangely out of place
there's a light filling this room
where none would follow before
i can't deny it burns me up inside
i fan the flames to melt
away my pride
do i want shelter from the rain
or the rain to wash me way?
[chorus]
i need you, i need you, i need you
i need you, i need you, i need you
you're all i'm living for
[verse]
i might sound like a fool
but i think i felt you moving
closer to me
face to the ground
