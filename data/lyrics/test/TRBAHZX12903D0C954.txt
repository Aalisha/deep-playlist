Hey, baby, love is coming at you
So you better be prepared
Hey... yeah... hey... yeah... hey

Newfound love is like a brand new toy
It fills you up, you wanna burst with joy
When you're in love it's a wonderful thing
Your mind at rest, you wanna try your best

Prepare a place in your heart
That's where it all start
A place in your heart
Make love your resort

Open your heart and let these feelings in
To deny these emotions would be like sin
A used love and true love I give to you
We made the start, so let's never part

Prepare a place in your heart
That's where it all start
A place in your heart
Make love your resort
