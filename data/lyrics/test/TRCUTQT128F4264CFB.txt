Love, what have you done? Oh, wow.
I was sure up to now that she was a friend.
I stayed till the end. Don't be a fool again.
I once believed that love was fair.
But I don't anymore. She said I'm a bore.
My heart hit the floor.

Don't be a fool anymore.
Each time around.
I tell myself it's the game of love.
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love.
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again.
So I'll say to the end
I just don't want to be a fool. (Don't want to be a fool.)
Said I don't want to be a fool ever again.
