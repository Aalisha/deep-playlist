Back in Nagasaki
I got married to Cho Cho San
that was her name
Back in those days and I was her man.
I'm going back to visit her
she got a problem

She got a little Cho Cho
Cho Cho San was her name

And this is her tale of woe
take it away Cho Cho.

Today's the day I see clear
a tiny thread of smoke appears

Where blue skies border on the ocean and a ship is set in motion.
All the while I sing this song I see a dot on the horizon

Growing bigger every second gleaming white in my direction.

Who on Earth can it be coming up the path for me?
What on Earth will he say
shall I run to him or run away?
Freaking out he's come to get me
my feet are stuck and just won't let me.
Run to him do I dare
Madam Butterfly
don't blow it.

Calling Butterfly
Madam Butterfly
