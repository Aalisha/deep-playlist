Yo man, you gotta be, you know, you gotta be on to die, man

What's up with that? Yo bro-shot, yeah, word up bro-shot
Uh, we need some brothers to be, uh, like droppin' knowledge
Ay man, why don't you quit talkin' all the stuff
And do something about it? You know what I'm sayin?
Oh, you talking about, kick some, uh, knowledge
Yeah, well you do that like right now
And some wisdom for the people, what's up with that? Okay, I got it
(Brothers and sisters)
Ya mom is so fat (How fat is she?)
Ya mama is so big and fat that she can get busy
With twenty-two burritos, but times are rough
I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (What?)

Ya mama smokes crack (What?)

She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back

Her knuckles drag down to the ground where she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk
Naked on a mountain top, tootin on a flizoot
Ridin on a horse drinking whisky out a bizoot
She's got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone and on top of all that
Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it
(Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it)

Ya mama got a glass eye with the fish in it

(Ya mama, ya mama, ya mama)
Ya mama look like she's been in the dryer with some rocks
With the big bust nose sucking dirt out of socks
Held up the ice-cream truck with a slingshot
