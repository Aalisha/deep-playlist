The national nightmare has begun
Empire of fantasy with a dark gloved fist aloft
While the challenger explodes
Banks are failing coming down hard

The way things are going I'm moving to the sun belt
Stars and stripes, forever is a long time
Don't ask me what's to be done
Ask what you can do for your country?

The Big Dipper' coming down
Miss America's lost her crown
Guess I've spent too long in this old town
No time to run and hide
We've been taken for a ride
America leads the world in teenage suicide

I always thought it would have been great
To be a part of the United States
a land of unmissed opportunity
A friend seems so far ahead
A land safe on film
