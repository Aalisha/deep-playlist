While tearing off a game of golf, 
I may make a play for the caddy, 
But if I do, I don't follow through
Cause my heart belongs to daddy.

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie, 
I just adore his asking for more, cause
My heart belongs to daddy.

Yes, my heart belongs to daddy, 
And I simply couldn't be bad.
Yes my heart belongs to daddy.
