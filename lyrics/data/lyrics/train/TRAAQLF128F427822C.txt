Ole buttermilk sky
I'm keeping my eye peeled on you
What's the good word tonight
Are you gonna be mellow tonight?

Ole buttermilk sky
Can't you see my little donkey and me?
We're as happy as a Christmas tree
Headed for the one I love

I'm gonna pop her the question, that question
Do you, darling do you, do?
It'll be easy, so easy
