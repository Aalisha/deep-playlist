Well, if I can keep it on the ground
When I put that hammer down
Then I'll be Texas bound and flyin'

I've got my 10 in the wind
Let it all hang out again
'Cause how're you gonna win
If you ain't trying

Well, now we're all back together
And we're burnin' up the road
And that old Sheriff's doggin' us today

He thinks he's really got it cookin'
