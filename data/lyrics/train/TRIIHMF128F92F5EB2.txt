Heads high
Ready to rock
Do you want
What we got
Tag along
Crank it up
Sing the song you know it don't stop

Yo my man get behind the wheel it's time to cruise
You snooze you lose let me introduce you
To my friends in the other car right behind us
And my other friends in the car right behind them
Start a caravan
Crank it up and let it pump
Bring out the beat and make it criss cross yo
Yes were drivin it
And when its time to hit the road
Let the heat, crash, ready to explode

And when the beat rocks
Hands high like so
Repeat after me didio didio
And when the show starts
Hands high like so
Repeat after me sing it loud
Every body go

Didio didio didio(every body like this y'all)
Didio didio didia (every body like that y'all)
Didio didio didio
Every body come and follow me
Didio didio didio (every body like this y'all)
Didio didio didia (every body like that y'all)
Didio didio didio
