Lies are fed through structures quelling our mistrust
Ignorance is fodder for machines of want
Followers saturate the earth
Automate consumption and remove our minor worth

What are we a collection of failures
Fueling now what must be done?
Do we work for what we've created?
Just byproducts of manmade gods

I'm the end for you
Your impending doom
You must obey the limits
You're programmed to consume
