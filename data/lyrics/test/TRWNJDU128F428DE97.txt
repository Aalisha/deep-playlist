It was the night when the sky rained fire
It was the night when the stars begin to fall

Baby I feel guilty
There's no reason why
Oh baby, 'cause I promised you
Love will never lie

Oh, I send a wish to heaven
I can't stand the pain inside
This moment tells a story
And I'm stronger than my pride

It was the night when the sky rained fire
It was the night when the stars begin to fall
...
