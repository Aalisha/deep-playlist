Better call and collect
Treat me with respect
If you think our love is pedigree
Push a button... disconnect
Dial again... redirect
You're wrong... you know it isn't me
Totally misguided
Babe you're misadvised
Don't even try to fight it
You're promises are lies
Did you think our love was sacred
Well it's much too over-rated
Think again... you're wrong
And our love's a precious memory
Better look what heaven sent me
