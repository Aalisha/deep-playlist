Threw away the nights all away
Darker than secrets that rest in her
I've seen it all now
To have her gloat around this scene
Step thru the faces of these seats
She cheats the ones who stand around
I see it all now
I see it all now

Cause I'm sick and I'm getting tired
Of their bickering down my ears
They're downing me with their thoughts
Sometimes I feel like I'm getting old
When you spit in my face
You're wearing yourself out as well as me
All you want is more
All you want is more
All you want is more
...
