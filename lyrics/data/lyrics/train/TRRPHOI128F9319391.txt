Waiting for a beam
To break through here
A chain way vision
All bright and clear

And they talk
And they dance

I was expecting something pure
With a golden hair
Arms full of bracelets
And smoke in the air

And they talk
And they dance

Here comes darkness
Just afternoon
Waiting for a sign
If I survive Iâ€™ll worship the moon
Or something
Anything
