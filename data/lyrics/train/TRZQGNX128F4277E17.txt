california california
your such a wonder that i think ill stay in bed
big time rollers part time models
so much to plunder that i think ill sleep instead.
i dont know this sea of neon
thousand surfers
whiffs of freon
and big nights back east with rhoda
california please
theres a moment ive been saving
a kind of crucifix around this munchkin land
