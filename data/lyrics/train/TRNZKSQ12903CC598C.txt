(Diddy Wah)
(A-diddy Wah)

(Diddy Wah)
I gotta gal down in Diddy Wah Diddy
(Diddy Wah)
Ain't no town an it ain't no city
(Diddy Wah)
She loves her man, just is a pity
Crazy 'bout my gal in Diddy Wah Diddy

(Diddy Wah)
This little girl is sweet as she could be
(Diddy Wah)
I know she's in love with me
(Diddy Wah)
A lovely face, she's so pretty
