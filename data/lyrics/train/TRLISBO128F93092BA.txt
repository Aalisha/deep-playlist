Is it the accent, the hype or the way she walkin'?
Am I, am I dreamin' or am I sleepwalkin'?
Got my arms outstretched so I don't bump into her
Silly me, now I'm so into her

Fashion, to her style of dress
And I'm lookin' in the mirror like do I look fresh?
Do I? Do I look fresh enough to get her?
If I see her one time then I won't forget her

'Cause I, I took a picture mentally
When I pulled up in a black on black Bentley
And I, I really feel like she was meant for me
If she wasn't then I know she was sent for me

'Cause she, she's the only one that made me chase
Got me singin' love songs like Babyface
And I tried to one night her but she made me wait
She made me wait

And so I think she got somethin'
She got somethin', think she got somethin'
Somethin' that I like
(Somethin' I like, oh, she yeah)

So I think she got somethin'
She got somethin', yeah, she got somethin'
Somethin' that I like, ohh
(Now break it down like)

She's got that somethin'
She got that somethin', that I like
(Uh, say it again like)
She's got that somethin'
She got that somethin' that I like
