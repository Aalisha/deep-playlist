Going through old dresser drawers
Fumbling through these closets
It's got to be here somewhere
I know it's round here somewhere

Searching from room to room
We couldn't have just lost it
I know it's round here somewhere
It's got to be here somewhere

Maybe we packed it up
With college books and winter clothes
Things we thought were in the way
Out of style or just outgrown
...
