I know you've been here before
There's a pain that you hold like a heart that's gone cold
Living your life alone, no matter what your friends say
It don't have to be that way

Let me love the hurt away
I know just what to do, I can satisfy you
You can open up to me
I'll show you what love can do, baby
(Yeah oh)

Put your hand in mine
Trust me, girl, you'll never find
I'll be all the man that you need
I'll take you to the highest height

Play with you and hold you tight
I'll be all the man that you need
I'll kiss you here, there, everywhere
Run my fingers through your hair

Can't you feel the man in me?
I'm talking not just for one night, girl
I want to spend my life
Being all the man that you need
