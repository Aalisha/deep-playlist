featuring Jeni Fujita & 20 Grand Pikasoe 
 
 [Forte' Speaking] 
 
 Political science... 
 The study of politics mixed with science... 
 Speak on it baby... 
 
 [Jeni Fujita Singing Chorus] 
 
 As I look in your eyes 
 I see the sunrise 
 I see the moonshine! 
 
 [20 Grand Pikasoe 1st Verse] 
 
 I'm from the days of the Colt 45's and gang bangers 
 Cocaine slangers who sliced doors no time to cook up 
 Them niggas like raw 
 It's all about the dollar now, white powder now 
 He owed us money so I watched my niggas tie him down 
 The conflict is crucial, police is neutral in this battlefield 
 Where the battles grill, like cattles grill for a platter mil 
 I even watched little Darryl deal 
 I love the ghetto, hate the ghetto 
 Must've been a genius who helped make the ghetto 
 So I sit back and taste the 'retto 
 I got beef, how can you misplace my metal? 
 It's a sob story, it's bad the way they robbed Tory 
 Of course, must've been religious 
 'Cause they took a small tainin' across 
 Wrong game to play, boss 
 Every night's a bug out 
 They shot up every corner where I hung out 
 Some nights I cry to this 
 Even though it's posi-flip (?) 
 
 [Jeni Fujita - Singing chorus] 
 
 It's like the sunrise 
 Just like the moonshine! 
 
 The rain stops, and your girl smiles... just for you (Yeah) 
 For you don't know, the love I have for you! 
 
 [Forte' - 2nd Verse] 
 
 Mommy, I keep my name on your brain like Missy
