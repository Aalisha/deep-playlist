Yo yo yo
Shillong city
Its the Prodigy clique clique clique clique
Freestyle Situation

Yo Jmae
ayo waddup man
Get 'em get 'em
Mic 1 2 check let me get your attention

We gonna shake this place up
So yall better be listen
Be dropping so hard then get cha ass
Bouncing to the ceilin
With the sound of the music and the rhythm

You feel it?
Its been a while now
Been keepin our shine shinning on the low now
Fakers making faces saying shit like its the time now
Gettin hyped up keepin it fresh fresh with our style now

Light the reefer up
Puff pass and im gone now
See life is complicated when you care too much
