There's a guide to take me home
Led me through the night
Stood against the storm
And taught me pride

Did they weigh you down?
Did they boil the salt?
Did they mess you up
In your fancy loft, baby?

There's a smile that broke my heart
That sparkles in your eyes
You're falling apart
Now you're living lies

Did they change the rules
Without telling you?
What a surprise
Who needs who now baby

Take a break and come down
Take a chance and start
Take a look in the mirror
Take the pill to wake up

Take a break and come down
...
