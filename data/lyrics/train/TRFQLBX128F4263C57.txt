I'm reading your dear John, it says, you're moving on
You need your space, you need some time
And greener grass you seek to find
I saw it from afar, I knew it in my heart
The happiness had gone away, pretended we would be okay

And every time you've made me cry, I gotta sit and wonder why
I love you, I still do, I need you, I always will
I want you to hold me tight, I need you with me tonight, I still do

Why do I hold on? Why can't I be strong?
I know it's time to walk away but still inside I hope and pray
