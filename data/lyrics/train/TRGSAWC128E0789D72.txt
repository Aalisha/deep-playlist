This year for Christmas
There's something I'd really like
So if you're up there somewhere Santa
Please don't bring me another bike
I don't need any ugly sweaters
And I don't play much basketball
But there's something kinda special
That I want most of all

I want an Alien for Christmas
Bring me an alien this year
I want a little green guy
About three feet high
With seventeen eyes
