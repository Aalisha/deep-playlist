Car 5032 of the Union Pacific
Is passing by on the right to bring back all the hopelessness
Of a trailer park in the old mining town

If you're searching for silver or an easier fortune
Finding nothing in the way of love or a life of living any better than before
You'll know you've arrived in Goldfield
