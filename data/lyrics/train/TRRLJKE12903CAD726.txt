Take a walk
Take the last step
Towards the end
On the backbone of night
These Might be the last steps we set
As we climb to the stars
As we climb to the stars
Towards the end
A depressive earth with a depressive shape
They will tear holes into the ground
Then we will watch the world burn down
The world burn down x2
