I know a gal got 
A lot to lose
She's a pretty nice lady 
But sheâ€™s kinda confused
Got muscles in her head 
Ain't never been used
Thinks she owns half 
Of this town
Starts drinking heavy 
Gets a big red nose
And she beats her old 
Man with her pantyhose
And takes him out and 
Buys him new clothes
That's the way that 
The world goes 'round
