You've heard a multitude of prayers on my behalf
I pray one more is not too much to ask
I've tried to fight this battle by myself
But its a war that i cant win without your help

Tonight im as low
As any man can go
Im down and i cant fall much farther
And once upon a time you turned the water into wine
Now on my knees im turning to ya father
Can you help me turn the wine back into water

So many times i've hurt the ones i love
...
