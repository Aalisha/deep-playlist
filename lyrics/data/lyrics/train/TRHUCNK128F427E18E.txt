I wanna tell you a story
Every girl oughta know
If you want a little loving
You gotta start real slow
He's gonna love you tonight
If you just treat him right

Squeeze a real gentle
You gotta make him feel good
Tell him that you love him
Like you know you should
'Cause if you don't treat him right
He won't love you tonight
