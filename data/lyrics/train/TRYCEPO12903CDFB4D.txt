Daz Dillinger
Aww yeah (aww yeah), it's bout that time to get into some gangsta shit
A second no doubt nigga before we bang you quick
The gang and No Limit, we about to trip
Slangin these thangs as a youngster
Grew up with killers and drug niggas, big cowards and busters
Seen it all from a mile away, but it's all on straight
With automatic with static nigga cause we don't play
C-Murder rap up and pat up and rap up, out to get him nigga what up
With enough lead to make these niggas shut the fuck up
Boom boom as me and my niggas come through with attitude
Actin rude, slappin and jackin these fools
Rollin down the block as the system knock
