Something's going on, a change is taking place
Children smiling in the street have gone without a trace
This street used to be full, it used to make me smile
And now it seems that everyone is walking single file

And many bow their heads in shame
That used to hold them high
And those that used to say hello
Simply pass you by

Think for a minute, Stop for a minute
