1vrs-This Gift to you I bring, a simple offering (pronounce loffering)
Of praise to you I sing
My grateful heart today, with joy it gives you thanks
You? re the truth that lights my way
Intro to course-And with all my gratitude I lift my hands and worship you
All this love from my heart to your ears
I just wanna say you? re the best thing that happened to me
Course- I? m here with you, where I wanna be
It? s clear to see, you? re the best thing that happened to me
You gave your life, just to rescue me
It? s clear to see, you? re the best thing that happened to me
2nd verse- As loving as you are, you took my broken heart
And held it in your hand
