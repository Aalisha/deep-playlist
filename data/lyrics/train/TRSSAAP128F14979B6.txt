The paint's peeling off the streets again
And I'll drive and close my eyes in Michigan
And I feel nothing, not brave
It's a hard day for breathing again

The heat is chasing off all your friends
And their scattered bodies part to the shore again
And I feel nothing, not sane
It's a hard day for dreaming again
