There was a time
I thougt I knew it all in matters of the heart.
Now looking back in time
I realize I'd only made a start.
You gotta hold of me
you showed me what it's all about.

Now I feel warm wind rushin' in
making my emotions start to spin.
No
I can't explain this state I'm in
guess I must be lerning.
The facts of love
sweet loving
the facts of love

the facts of love
sweet loving.

Sometimes I wonder how I ever lived
before you came my way.
Now I'm addicted to your kiss
