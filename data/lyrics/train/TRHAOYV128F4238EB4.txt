Watching and listening and waiting;
Knowing you'll turn out the light.
The spirit they've crushed now is fading,
But I want to help make things right.

Because I can see, and I can feel.
And you can see, and you can feel.
So why don't we both either stand up and fight,
Or at least together, we'll call it a night.
Call it a night.

They'll tell you that you must be stronger.
