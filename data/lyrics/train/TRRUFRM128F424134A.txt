Here we are in this big old empty room, staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you, let's stop fooling around
Take me baby, kiss me all over, play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of
Do me baby, like you never done before
Give it to me till I just can't take no more
Do me baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait

Here we are looking for a reason for you to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season, so baby please stop teasing me
