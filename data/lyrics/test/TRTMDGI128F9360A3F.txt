Take me home, Take me home

Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Cause I'm not to sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end up hurt
Oh I don't know...

That's the way that I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I wonder if I take you home would you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if i take you home would you still make me love baby
Because i need you tonight

Your love is... take me home

Lately you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch
You say I'm teasing but ought to have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
Cause you will have me and sooner than you know it
If you could only wait
Oh I dont know...
