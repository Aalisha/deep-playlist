Well they said we'd tear ourselves apart
and it turns out they were right
'cause I've never seen you so weak and so far out of breath
and I never saw the tide rise so high so fast

watch this pawn capture the queen
white picket drive-by
gargle the stench the storm brings
you'll never get enough

watch this pawn capture the queen
now I can't shake you
but I can't take you

empty skin bag you're my cum rag
...
