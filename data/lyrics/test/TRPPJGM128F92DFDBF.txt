Everybody needs a little place they can hide
Somewhere to call their own don't let nobody inside
Every now and then we all need to let go
For some it's the doctor for me it's rock and roll
For some it's a bottle, for some it's a pill
Some people wave the Bible, 'cause it's giving them a thrill
Others point their finger if they don't like what they see
If you live in a glass house, don't be throwing rocks at me

We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper to get us by
We all need a little shelter
Just a little helper and it'll be alright

Check out Mr. Politician in his suit and tie
But when the doors are closed there ain't nothin' he won't try
Meanwhile Mr. Medicine's treating his best friend's wife
Tipper led the war against the record industry
She said she saw the devil on her MTV
To look into the cabinet, it takes more than a key
Just like Jimmy's skeletons and his ministry

We all need a little shelter
