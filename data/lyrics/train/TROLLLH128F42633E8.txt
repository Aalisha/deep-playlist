And you sold it to her,
now you feel fooled.
She's the one gone bad.

She'll do it anyway,
and take the lead and say.
She won't be kind, no
realise...

Coz she's too nice to you,
and you're too nice to her.
You don't let each other burn.
Gay prarie.
Coz you know comes a time,
when love will unwind.
Somebody suffers,
what's new?
...
