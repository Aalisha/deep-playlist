Check, check, check, yo, we here M-I-S-S-O-U-R-I
(The best out there dirty)
For sure, we gon' hold that down for St. Louis no doubt
My nigga Kyjuan gon' kick this shit out right here,
we the Lunatics, no doubt
We gon'..., they wildin, they don't know

(Kyjuan)
Ay yo
St. Louis is small but we still do it all
We hit the mall, we drink it all, we always gon' smoke it all
Get hit, we shake it off, at the club yellin "take it off"
My success is takin off, I'm always workin, never takin off
I done that, did that, who her? I dont hit that
Cats be trippin off them rats, I ain't really with that
Makes me wanna sit back, I relax and think back
To when I used to click-clack, makes me angry when I flash back
Mo, you should get back, I mean this, hang with the meanest
Remain the cleanest, always smoke the seedless greenest
You've seen this like reruns, pop-a-lock like reruns
St. Louis where we from, you ain't never heard a weak one

(Ali)
You got to stand up and get it together, roll with the punches, whatever
Get in our way, destroy ya, make you wish you had never, ever
Fucked with the real crazy, pyscho sick? lady
Sunnin so nut and shady, kid pass me the three-eighty
