Wussuh, wussuh?
What's crackin' nigga? Chillin'
Where ya punk ass nigga at?
He in the trap, ya know
Oh yeah? Yeah, come through

Dat's what it is then, I'm in and out
Dat's cool
I ain't even trippin', ya know I'm sayin'?
Dat's how you feel?
Yeah, just be ready when I get there nigga
I stay ready, nigga, let's go

I'm on dat Grey Goose, a lil' Red Bull
So ya know how I'm feelin' tonight
(I know how ya feelin' tonight)

I just called, I ain't want shit
Want to know we was chillin' tonight
(Yeah, we can kick it tonight )

Slide through, dat nigga in the streets
So you already know we're fine
 (You already know we're fine)

Just a quickie, you can slide the Vickie's
I'ma even leave my Nikes on
 (You can even leave ya Nikes on)

You know me, I ain't even gon' sweat her
Rick Flare, I stay jumpin' off the dresser
Betcha ass ain't never felt better
Ain't never met a nigga make ya azz more wetter

I like it when you do dat, drill ya ass harder
Pull ya hair when you throw it back
Say she love when I pull 'em to the side
I can feel it when she cum, I can tell by her thighs

Oh Lord, you should see her when I'm in it
