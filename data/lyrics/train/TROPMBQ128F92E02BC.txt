I came to tell you how it all began
Nothing seems to work out right
I'm broken down again
So hold me now
Say it's not forever
Cause maybe someday
In time

Things will go my way...
Things will go my way...

I've pushed to get through
The crowds of twisted souls
Just to find I'm right back here
Doing what I'm told
So take my hand
...
