Chorus:
Wait a minute
I've been calling out to you
There's nothing more you can say to make me stay
This time I swear I'll stand firm to my word
Wait a minute
I've cried my last cry
For the last time
See you've stayed away a day too late
I've hurt for too long, boy, now you've got to pay

I gotta' dozen things on my mind
Issues with you are the first in line
I never thought it would be true
I was labeled a fool for chasing after you
Shoulda' known what to do
Repercussions all because of you
Manipulating
Aggravating
All of these things come to mind
...
