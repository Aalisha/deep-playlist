Girl, when you call my phone
Just say what's on your mind okay
Don't call and hang up
I'm not into that
Yuh want me tell you somethin'
Let me tell you somethin'

Your man he told me
That he's tired of the shit you got
He took one hit
And said my good shit keeps him coming back

He likes it tight
And said your shit is just a little slack
Girl, don't get mad at me
I'm only telling you the fact

I've got your man
And you can't do anything about it
You may think he is coming back to you
But I doubt it

Don't make no sense you even call him
And try to work out it
'Cause I've got your man
And you can't do anything about it

He told me you don't give him room
Nor give him breathing space
And when he's out with friends
You call and get up on his case
...
