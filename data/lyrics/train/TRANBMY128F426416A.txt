Hey have you heard the news
People on the hill changin' all the rules
The battle's just begun, stand up and fight

Don't be afraid to say what's on your mind, it's OK
Be who you wanna be cause it's your life

We're not the chosen ones but we've got strength in numbers
Get up and make some noise, let 'em here your thunder

Chorus:
Out on the backstreets, I hear a heartbeat
