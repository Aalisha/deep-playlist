Got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe your hair's alright
Hey babe let's go (stay) out tonight
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You sexy thing, you put them on

Rebel rebel put on your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel how could they know
Hot tramp I love you so

You like me and I like it all
