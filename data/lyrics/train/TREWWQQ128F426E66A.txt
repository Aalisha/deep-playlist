You never fade the red across your wrist 
There's never been a mascara that could fix 
The saddest eyes a boy has ever seen 
When you want so desperately to bleed 

We were never meant for this 
So wear it all with pride 
So put your hand inside of mine 
And together we'll 

Run until the world goes dark 
And we're all alone 
(Run until the world goes dark) 
I swear I will 
Run into the darkest night 
And bring back the stars 
(Run into the darkest night) 
To light up your eyes 
...
