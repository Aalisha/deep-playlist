Let's start with just the basics then
I'm sure that we could fake it when
It's time to say how much it meant
And we walk out so innocent

You can be so persuasive
When you say it's
More than a day trip
And convince me
I'm condescending
When I ask, â€œWill this be ending?"
How quickly lust can pretend that it's love

We're just the boys and girls that think they always know
With answers for the world
The ambiguity shows
We're just the boys and girls that dance with all their clothes
(we are the boys and the girls)
Hiding under the sheets
Believing nobody knows

All the suspense
...
