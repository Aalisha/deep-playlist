Whoso fly up in th' sky
Faster than any boy could ever describe
Whos got that love so deep
And everything alive

(I said)
Jet Boys fly
Jet Boys gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

This's the kinda place where no one cares
What your livin for
And Jet Boys so preoccupied
He don't care 'bout before

(That's why)
Jet Boys fly
Jet Boys gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

Flyin around New York City so high
Like he was my baby

My baby...

Jet Boys fly
Jet Boys gone
Jet Boy stole my baby

...
