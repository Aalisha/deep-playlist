Here we are at last with nothing left to say now
'Cause everything that's gone will never be
And I lost it all that one and lonely blue night
Everything was fine

Yes, I know I should have waited for you, baby
Where were you when I was needing you?
And a hundred times I called but you were not
there
You were far from me

Another life, another lover
Where in the world do lonely dreams ever go?
Another night, another blue day
It is so long, long, long, long

Another life, another lover
Where in the world do lonely dreams ever go?
Another night, another blue day
It is so long, long, long, long
...
