It's a rain dirt town, job hurts, but it don't pay
All these calls they're making been driving you insane
Don't you see, don't you understand?

Waiting for the phone to ring, to make me all I am
You're in the suburbs waiting for somewhere to go
I'm down here working on some dumb show

In a raintown, raintown, rain down
On all those tired eyes and tears, and frowns
Raintown, raintown, rain down
On all those days you're not around

It takes a big hearted girl from the north country you can tell
...
