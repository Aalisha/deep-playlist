Your words forever embedded in
My head but never entrusted
Hey analyst, try to make some sense of this
I know it's hard, believe me

You swore to never be bitter when
The odds were favoring elsewhere
Perfectionist try to make the best of this
I know it's hard 'cause we barely made it through winter
We barely made it through winter

Pleading
Not guilty
So don't be
Waiting to throw the first stone
Not guilty,
Not guilty

Your words, burned in my memory
...
