You took and You take our sins away, oh God
You give, You gave Your life away for us
You came down, You saved us through the cross
Our hearts are changed because of Your great love

You lived, You died, You said in three days You would rise
You did, You're alive
You rule, You reign, You said You're coming back again
I know You will and all the earth will sing Your praises
All the earth will sing Your praises

You took and You take our sins away, oh God
