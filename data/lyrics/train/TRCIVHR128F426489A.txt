You can look but you can't touch
'Cos I'm with the man that I love so much
And i never wanna be free
'Cos sleeping around just ain't for me

I feel a million dollars
And not a penny less
Why take the risk of a strangers kiss when you can have the best

The joy you bring to me, is clear to see

'Cos from the first kiss I'll tell you this
I fell in love
And from the first touch I knew this much
Heaven Above
And from the first night you held me tight
In your arms it felt so right
You know you got the touch boy but don't you push your luck.

When you go away
I miss the touch that I need so much
Your coming home to me
