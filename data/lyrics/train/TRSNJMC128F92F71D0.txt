Don't keep me dreaming
If all the hope is gone
If it's all over
Don't keep me hanging on

I can't stay
And dream my life away
In some kind of wonderland
Better to hurt me honestly
Than make a fool of me
My heart will understand

Make it easy on me
Just walk away, set me free
Don't try to do it gently
Just to please me
Make it easy, easy on me

If it's the time to go
