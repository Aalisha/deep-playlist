My head is lead,
I don't ever want to go to bed,
Your hair is on fire.
You snuff the blaze,
Turn to vapour then you float away,
We got into a bad fight.

I laid here on my bed,
Laid here on my bed,
Laid here on my bed,
Laid here on my bed,
Laid here on my bed,
Laid here on my bed,
Laid here on my bed.

My eyes are lungs, I'm a prophet and I speak in tongues,
I know how you'll die.
