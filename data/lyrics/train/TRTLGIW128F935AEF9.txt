Stigmata - Stigmata - Stigmata - Stigmata

Save Me...

It's happening again
I started to bleed
From my hands and feet
In an odour so sweet
Painful holy wounds of four
The blood-loss increase
Terrified I see they open wide
Oh, don't give me number... Five...

The pain become extreme
The more I will bleed
Whipped by a force unseen
...
