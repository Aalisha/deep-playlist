Hey Willie

Willie can you cook? Can you cook? Hey Willie
Willie can you save a dollar bill?
Willie can you sew? Can you sew? Hey Willie
Willie can you give a girl a thrill?

Willie can you ride a black-eyed stallion?
Willie can you fight a bear?
Willie can you love? Can you love? Oh Willie
Willie will you braid my hair?

Willie can you do the things I ask you?
Willie can you do them true?
Willie can, Willie can, Willie can, fair lady
If Willie takes a shine to you
