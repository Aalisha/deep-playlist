Now everybody 
has a right to be living their lives
ooh but we were long long way 
a long way from paradise
If there is freedom
tell me why everybody wants to fight
ooh 'cause we were long long way
a long way from paradise
You might be strong enough
you might be rich enough
you might be blind enough
to push it all aside
No matter what you do
it keeps coming back to me and you
Give a little bit of love then you get it back
give a little bit of pain you're caught in a trap
for every little thing that you say or do
give a little bit of love it'll come back to you
