I climbed to the top of a hill
But I had just missed the sun
And although the descending arc was gone
Left behind were the traces that always follow along

The most beautiful colors chase the sun
They wrap her trail in a taunting gesture
That seems to sing out loud
This is what you're missing

I'll endure the night
For the promise of light
I'll endure the night
For the promise of light
