I can't keep this together
And I might lose this year
I can't get through December
And you know all my fears

Someplace somewhere behind me
I walked right through the truth
Truth is that you're the one thing
That always pulls me through
This troubled life I choose

You are the one that I need
You know that I can still bleed
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life

You brought me down from my cloud
You keep my feet on the ground
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
