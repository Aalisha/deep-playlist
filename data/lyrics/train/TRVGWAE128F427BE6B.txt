there's a place in the back of the stall
where the plaster's so thin
there's a crack in the wall
and if you bend to the ground
and squint really well
they say that you're bound
to catch a glimpse into hell

as the smoke clears away for the view
all the people are waiting
lined up in the pews
and the sermon begins
and he's gritting his teeth
cause the music's kicked in
with the pulsating beat
