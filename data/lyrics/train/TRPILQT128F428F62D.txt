Sunset, a clear blue lake
Fishing with the boys
A weekend hanging out with my best friends
Tall tales and ice cold beer
Well, I can't blame you guys
For saying this must be the living end

Chorus:
Hold on, it does get better than this
If you were me
You couldn't disagree
'Cause I've held her oh, so tight
She's kept me up all night
I've tasted her kisses sweet as wine
Sure, this is a real good time
But pardon me boys
It does get better than this
