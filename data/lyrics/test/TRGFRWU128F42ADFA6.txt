mm uh mm mm yeah

Baby I just don't get it, do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt

You don't believe his stories, you know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why
If I was ya man
(Baby you)
Never worry 'bout
(What I do)

I'd be coming home

(Back to you)
(Every night, doin' you right)
You're the type of woman
(Deserves good things)
Fistful of diamonds
(Hand full of rings)

Baby, you're a star
(I just want to show you, you are)

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
