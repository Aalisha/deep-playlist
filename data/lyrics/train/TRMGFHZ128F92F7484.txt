Key of A major

Rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you,
rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
hoo-ah-ooh-ooh.

I'm like a - rubber ball, baby that's all
that I am to you (bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy)
Just a rubber ball 'cuz you think you
can be true to two (bouncy, bouncy) (bouncy, bouncy).
You bounce my heart around (You don't even put her down)
And like a rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you
rubber ball, I come bouncin' back to you.

If you - stretch my love 'til it's thin enough to tear
I'll just stretch my arms to reach you anywhere
And like a -
Rubber ball, I'll come bouncin' back to you
