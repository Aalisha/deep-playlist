Single by choice
Never marry, never ever divorce
Listen to the solitary voice
Tell you I'm single by choice
Single by choice
Never marry, never divorce
Listen to the solitary voice
Tell you I'm single by choice
I know what you're thinking
She can't be complete
'Til the right kind of man
Come sweep her off her feet
Well, I've been there before
