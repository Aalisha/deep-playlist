RAPPER: Yo, yo watch out, here we come, I never trust no-one
Make my own laws up ever since day one
Make my own rules, I'm a choose my own life
And who are you to say how I spend my nights?
Whether bustin' off steel or I'm bustin' on mikes
Well I'm turning out lights or I'm ready to fight
Trust no-one (no-one), same man who brought me here
Was the same man who left me broke and disappeared

Shed a tear for the future, don't know what it holds
You can have no clothes, look up and strike gold
And the world's so cold I ask my own questions
Find my own answers, learn my own lessons
Count my own blessings, book my own sessions
Worst comes to worst, got my own Smith & Wessons
Don't bother me, I'm screaming, fuck authority
I hate those cats with a suit and a tie

GREEN: Starts to come apart
Our high regard for making marks (and being organised)
It's hard to just discard
Our being smart for losing heart (you've got the Gorgan's eyes)
Run for cover superstars and
Show me that it's over
