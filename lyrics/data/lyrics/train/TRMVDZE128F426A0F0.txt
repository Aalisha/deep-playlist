I never return to love somebody
Now all that I need is all I see in you
And only you
And if you get lost I'll always find you
You're all that I need your heart will keep you true
My only you

You make me fall and I can't sleep
You want it all but it's too deep
And I can't give it away
I just can't give it away

When you slowly close your eyes
We play the moment in your life
Just give it away
Just give it away
When you slowly close your eyes
We play the moment in your life
