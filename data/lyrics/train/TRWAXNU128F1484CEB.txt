(Still)
Though you broke my heart
(Still)
Though we're far apart
(I love you still)

(Still)
After all this time
(Still)
You're still on my mind
(I love you still)

I've lost count of the hours and I've lost track of the days
In fact, I've lost just about everything since you went away
 (I love you still)
Everything that is except the memories you left me
...
