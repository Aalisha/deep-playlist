there's a girl from the far side of town
I tell you man, she's all I've been missing
got some bucks and her feet on the ground
she's so fine, I can't get her off my mind

I've got the time, she's got a place
I want to see her in black lace
I'm not her kind, but I don't mind
I gotta get her

girl, I can't stop till you're mine
till you're mine, till you're mine
...
