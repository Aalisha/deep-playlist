Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new kiss
She blames him, he blames her
But neither one is ever quite sure which way it really is

And all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie 'bout where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that'll take a little ring
...
