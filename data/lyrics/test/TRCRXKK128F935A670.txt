There's a map of the world on the wall in your room
Green pins where you want to go
White pins where you've been, there isn't even ten
And your already feeling old

Pretty faces stare back from the magazine stack
That you read when you're feeling bored
Look through a telescope lens it doesn't make sense
You think you've been there before

Some far off feeling, some up close kind of ache
A wide screen reason to look the other way
