There's a man in a cutaway
Buying drinks for the room
All the cheer raining down on the day
Comes to nothing and leaves by the broom

On the streets named for presidents
Where the kingfishers blew
All the cornflowers sewn in the fence
Keep the memory from tearing in two

But if I should lose
I'd wake up feeling lucky
If I should take a fall
...
