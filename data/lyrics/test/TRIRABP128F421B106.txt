V1
I know that a time will come I won't have to worry
And I pray that the day will come I won't have to hurry.
When a little piece of mind won't be so hard to find.
But I don't believe it's comin' anytime soon.

V2
The kids can run and play round the neighborhood
Without a care in the world like children should.
