I'm trying hard to understand
I'm trying hard to do the things it takes to be a man

Life's slipping away from me
It's not the way I thought it'd be
Life's slipping away from me
It's not the way I thought it'd be

I'm trying hard to understand
And to know just who I am
I'm trying hard to get a break
Or just to give a damn
I'm trying hard to get away
But I always seem to stay
I'm trying hard to understand
A fucking word you say
