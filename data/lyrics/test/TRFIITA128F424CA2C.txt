This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get

Everyone's asking the same thing
But you only have one answer, by the way
They look at you, they look at you
You're so afraid, you're so afraid of what they think
Of what they think so you just turn away

You run into your room, shut the door and cry
But don't stay true to these feelings you hold inside
You have your vanity and you can't blame them
When you believe it's true and everything's a lie
