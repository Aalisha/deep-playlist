Solo: Doc

Why would you walk into the fire?
Under a shield of love
I give myself to you
Tugging at the strings of my heart
Oh how I wish you were here
Turned on me, and left me empty
You took my heart and changed me
Under a shield of love
With every glance, I give myself to you

You don't have to walk alone
With the world left behind us
We step into the unknown
You don't have to walk alone
With the world left behind us
We step into the unknown

The pain I feel without you eats away at me
The slow drawn breath released from my body
