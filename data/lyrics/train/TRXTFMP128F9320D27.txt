Baby I'm yours and I'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
Yours until the rivers all run dry in other words until I die
Baby I'm yours and I'll be yours until the sun no longer shines
Yours until the poets run out of rhymes in other words until the end of time
I'm gonna stay right here by your side do my best to keep you satisfied
