Jah, Jah, Jah
Jah, Jah, Jah

Oh, once I was blind to face reality
Light of this world is the Almighty for me
Oh, King of Kings and Lords of Lords, oh yeah
The one that can break every chain, every bars

I say, Almighty, guide me, Almighty, show me
(Guide me, show me)
The righteous road to be travelin' on
(The righteous road, travelin' on)

I say, Almighty, guide me, Almighty, show me
(Guide me, show me)
The right road that I should be travelin' on
(The right road, travelin' on)

Every step that I take, I know you're all the way
Please guide me, the light of this world is the Almighty to me
When I'm all alone and feelin' brokenhearted
You're the only one that can heal my needs

I say, Almighty, guide me, Almighty, hold me
(Guide me, hold me)
Almighty, guide me, oh Lord, for eternity
