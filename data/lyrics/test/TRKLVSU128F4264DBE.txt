One two, one two, one
One two, one two, T get off my stuff
I'm not playing man, alright
You gonna take this one, alright

I get joy, joy thinking about
What He's done for me
I get joy, joy thinking about
What He's done for me

It's in my hands, my feet, I'm talking about
What He's done for me
I get joy just thinking about
What He's done for me

Oh how I wonder when my soul looks black
How I ever made it through my sinful, wicked past
I did everything that I though I wanted till it brought me down
Then God reached out to me, so I'm here to tell you now

I get joy, joy thinking about
What He's done for me
I get joy, joy thinking about
What He's done for me

It's in my hands, my feet, I'm talking about
What He's done for me
I get joy just thinking about
What He's done for me

I've seen the bottom of the mountain, I've had my share of pain
I've been through so many struggles, thought I'd never breathe again
So I prayed that God would help me, I couldn't handle it no more
