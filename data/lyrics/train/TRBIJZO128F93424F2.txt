This is my winter song to you
The storm is coming soon, it rolls in from the sea
My voice, a beacon in the night
My words will be your light to carry you to me

Is love alive, is love alive, is love

They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow or so I have been told
They say we're buried far
Just like a distant star, I simply cannot hold

Is love alive, is love alive, is love alive
