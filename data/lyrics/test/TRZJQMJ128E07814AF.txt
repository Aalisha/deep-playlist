Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, turning me down
Making me smile, making me frown

In a world that was war
I once lived in a time
That was peace
With no trouble at all
But then you came my way
And a feeling i know
Shook my heart
And made me want you to stay
All of my nights
And all of my days

I wanna tell you now
Something's gotten hold of my hand
...
