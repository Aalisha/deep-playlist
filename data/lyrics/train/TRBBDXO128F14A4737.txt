Gettin' together is better than ever

I am so happy, baby
Now that you are my lady
We can hold hands together
Every day, come what may
I promise you I'll always
Give you my lovin' always
You can depend on me girl
All the time, rain or shine

You're gonna love it
I'm gonna love it
Day time, night time
