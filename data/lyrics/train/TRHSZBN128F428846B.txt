So here's how it started
It started with a beat
A beat in my head
And it wouldn't go away
So I added a bass
The bass was phat
I played it to my boys on a 24 track
They like that ah
The hand clap followed by the mic
Check
No time for dinner
Five's out on the night shift
Shady eyes in the middle of the night
Into the dawn till the lyrics lock tight
On the mix tell the DJ
Quick Five boom

He kept playing my song
On and on all night long

Rip it up everybody
Rip it up one time
Let me bring your rigidy rugged flow for your mind
Got what you need now
Let me break it down
Five on the low
