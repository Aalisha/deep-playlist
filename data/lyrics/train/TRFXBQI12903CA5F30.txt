Red light's gone, I know, red light
Sometimes we need to say "Red Light"

This time I'm not that innocent
This time I'm not so eloquent
I guess it's not so evident
This time is not that different
I'm not so God dawm innocent
I know I'm not that innocent
This time I'm not so sniveling
This time I'm not that patient
This time I'm not so furious
I'm not that curious
This time I'm not that innocent
