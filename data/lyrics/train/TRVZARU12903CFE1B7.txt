I was thumbin my way outta San Antone
Saddle on my back
My Raybans on
A dusty old cowboy hat
Scuffed up jeans
When a tourqoise elderado
With horns on the hood
Slowed down to help me out
Like I hoped someone would
She was peelin' an apple
Drivin' with one
She said hey cowboy,
Where's your horse
I said I lost everything but this saddle
In my second divorce
And if you don't mind,
I'll keep the rest to myself

She said she'd put herself through college
