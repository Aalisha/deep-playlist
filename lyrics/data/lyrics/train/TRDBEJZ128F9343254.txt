When I met you I didn't really like you
First impression was you were somebody who'd
Walk right by when I waved at you and say 'Hi'
But they say (Hey)

Bad beginnings make happy endings
Now that i know you
I begin to understand things
It's turn around a hundered and eighty degrees
I found my missing piece


There's something about you
That's like the sun
You warm up my heart
When I come undone

Your like my soulmate
And on those days
When I hurt
When I break
You are my band aid

(You are
You are
When I hurt
When I break
You are
You are
You are
When I hurt
When I break
You are)

When I get caught in the rain and it feels like
There is no one in the world who understands my
Complications that I'm facing on certain days
I talk it through with you
