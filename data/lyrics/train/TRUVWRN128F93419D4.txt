Picture perfect
That's what it seems
They've got this whole thing figured out
But not me
We'll leave this place behind
Doesn't that feel right?
Picture perfect, it's picture perfect

Through the fire
Through the smoke and the flames
In my reflection in the window
Match in hand, and I'm running

Everyone's screaming, "You're never gonna get there"
Waking up shaking feels much better
And everyone's saying, "Shape up and get a life"
If nothing goes wrong, then how will it feel right?
Picture perfect doesn't mean much to me

Is it true what they're saying
I gotta settle down in a place just like the rest?
