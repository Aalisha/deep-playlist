These have been quiet days
When was the last time I wanted to sing
Last few dying days hanging on - what will they bring?
Even you and me
We keep coming apart
And it's a wrong thing
We goota look right at each other and say it
Turn on the radio and play it
And fall in love again

Can you feel the light shine
You now this song's yours and mine
Ain't it good to know you've got a place to go
Where the melody's fine
Sometimes I'm not so strong
And even now I could be wrong
But if you love me like music
