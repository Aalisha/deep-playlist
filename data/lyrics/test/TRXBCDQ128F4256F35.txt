Tonight we'll be watching stars fall down
I can't wait to see you and see you're smile
And be with you all day and night
Believe me there's nothing I can do

We'll fftasly wait till the sun comes out
Remembering those times we felt alive
So hold me close so close to you
Don't let me fall hold me one more time
...
