Inevitable
Impenetrable
Ignorance reverses intelligence
Devolving as a whole
Evolving as spoils of war
Cureless disease we are
Endless battle for survival
Illogical decisions throughout time
Causing the death of mankind
We are all equal
Yet most ignore the very fact that they are
War is inevitable
Throughout all life forms
