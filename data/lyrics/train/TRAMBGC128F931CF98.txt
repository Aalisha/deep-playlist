Don't depend on me kiddo
Bread made of blood comes from a blood red dough
The inoffensive are the ones you can hear
Playing on the radio
Don't ask me how I'll make ends meet,
I don't know
All you own you owe to someone you don't know
All you own you owe to someone you don't know
Eeny meeny tiny miny catch a little tiger by the toe
All you own you owe to someone you don't know
If every object has its root in a lie
Always check the mirror to make sure you exist
