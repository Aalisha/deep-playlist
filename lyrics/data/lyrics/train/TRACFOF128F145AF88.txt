There's a danger you might regret
it should be taboo, to do what we do
Hey what goes on?
I know that I ain't wrong
for the darling you dance to this song
Bernadette... say you won't be long

Hey Bernadette, Say Bernadette
hear what I say, and don't forget
Let's leave this city and lady let's drive
so far from here and when we arrive
...
