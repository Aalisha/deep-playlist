Hmm Huh Hoo hoo hey baby
I'm looking for you
Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, loving you
Day will make a way for night
All we'll need is candlelight
And a song soft and long, well
Glad to be here alone
With a lover unlike no other
Safe to see a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

I wanna be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
