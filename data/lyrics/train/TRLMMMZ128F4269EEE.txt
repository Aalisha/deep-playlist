Sunshine go away today, I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone he's tried to run my life, he don't
Know what he's asking
When he tells me I better get in line, I can't hear
What he's saying
When I grow up, I'm gonna make it mine, these ain't
Dues I been payin'
How much does it cost?
I'll buy it!
The time is all we've lost
