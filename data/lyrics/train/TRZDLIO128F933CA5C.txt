Siamese, Portuguese, dirty knees-
Look at these
rookies around us;
Arent you glad you found us?
If you are who you say you are,
get up here to the bar,
Well plot out a plan
to take down the man
Well start with that new future
superstore and steal all their
decorative rocks,
and fight all their rent-a-cops
And for the freeway maintainers
...
