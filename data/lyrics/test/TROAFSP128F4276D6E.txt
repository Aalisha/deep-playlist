A murky presage roaming the land
To silence the skylark's chant
The somber kiss is at end
To impart the crimson robe

Heed the darksome maid
Dancing across this equinox
To relegate persistence
As the bleak darkness grows

A cryptal impellent, devoted to the sublime round

Beholden for the boons of light
Retreating into quietness
...
