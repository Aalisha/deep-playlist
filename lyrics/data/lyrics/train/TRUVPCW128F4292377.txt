I lift you off the earth mundane and glum
Out the solar system, way past the sun
Till all the fear in your heart is gone, and so on

Walking through the world with no pressure
Inner peace beyond measure
I was leaving wherever I came in
When a man said, stop
I wanna have what you have
And get what you got

I got it sleeping rough on the streets in the rain
