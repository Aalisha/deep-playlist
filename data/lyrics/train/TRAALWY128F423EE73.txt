I'm turning the lights down low
Ready to make my move
Get you tickets to what you need
I'm treading the borderlines
And ruining people's lives by giving them what they need
You're quite right to ask what's wrong with me
You want to take a look at my head
Even I've been thinking what's wrong with me
I watch the news instead
