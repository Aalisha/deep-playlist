Michelle Williams
Hello Heartbreak

Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak
Hello, hello, hello, hello, heartbreak

I got a strange connection to pain
I can't seem to walk away from hurt
I'm always running into danger zone
I need protection, a change
What is affection? It's I'm longing for
It cuts me deep, but I'm still wanting more

Hello, heartbreak
It's good to see you
Happiness came
But it just lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Lets me down
Hello, hello, hello, hello heartbreak
Hey there, sadness
I knew I'd meet you
'Cause when all else fails
You'll always be around
