Gently approaching you
But not knowing what to say
Praying, you don't have a man

Offering you a drink
Of whatever your taste is
Maybe you might have a shot
Shot of your cocoa brown with me

Cool with my cocoa brown
That's what I want
'Cause she got a certain style I like
So cool and brown
(Cool and brown)

Cool with the cocoa brown
No doubt about it
From the moment
That I looked in her eyes

Mentally so supreme
But not knowing who to trust
Softly I take your hand
