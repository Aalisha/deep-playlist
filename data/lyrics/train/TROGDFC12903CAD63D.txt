Lights in the city, they go down in the city
And there ain't nobody there to love me
Lights in the city, they go down in the city
And there ain't nobody there to call me

Looking for you, why won't you show?
Looking for you, it's a city of ghosts, city of ghosts
City of ghosts, city of ghosts, city of ghosts

Lights go down, they go down in the city
...
