Tied down against the tracks
Screaming in silent black and white
Why'd you trust us we are such villains
We would tell ourselves anything
We want to hear if we are willing
To listen is to learn
Then too much is what we deserve

And how come when we say that we do
We don't
Pray to anybody you want
We won't
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
