Don't Stop (Funkin' 4 Jamaica)
(Mariah Carey/DJ Clue/Duro/Thomas Brown/Toni Smith/M. Tyler)

Featuring Mystikal

Mystikal:
Do the thing!

DJ Clue:
Oh-ooooooooo oh-oooooo

Mystikal: Watch yourself
Get on the floor, move your feet

DJ Clue: Woooooooeeeeeeee

Mystikal:
There ain't nothing u can do with the man,
Except for shake yo ass and clap yo hands,
Bob yo head and move your feet,
I ain't the type of rapper just to ride the beat!
I set the track on fire,
I take the roof, the house and knock out your tyres,
Its the funk in here
Let mystikal move you and Mariah sing

Chorus-MC:
Don't Stop baby(Mystikal ad-libs: shake yo ass),
Its extasy(watch yoself),
Turn me up a little higher,
Baby light my fire,
Tell me every little thing you wanna do,
Baby i'm into you(get on the floor),
Don't Stop baby(shake yo ass),
Its extasy(shake the whole grill),
Turn me up a little higher
