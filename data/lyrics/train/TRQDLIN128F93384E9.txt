This avenue, this home takes everything but gives back solitude
A proud departure from the rigors of a mundane breath
Expelled from the depths of a blackened sea
Expelled from the lungs of a gasping child

Strangled with a noose
Benign of provocative engagement
Coursing through these veins is the will to persue the unthinkable,
The diligence of so many before us

To achieve this reverie
The only way because we chose this...
