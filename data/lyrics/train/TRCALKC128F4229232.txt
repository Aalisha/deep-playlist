You say you want a piece of me
You wanna be king of the hill
You're gonna have to pay your dues
Before you move in for the kill

Been on the streets since I was fifteen
I know every trick of the trade
I've crawled and scratched to get what I got
And you ain't gonna take it away

So come on I tell you
Just step across that line
I'll show you what I mean
Want a woman
I'll drag you through the dirt
Banging on your knees
Cause when you mess with me
You're messin' with a hurricane
