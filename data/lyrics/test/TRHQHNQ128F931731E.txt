When I close my eyes, and you're not there
I feel this emptiness inside, do you care?
If you have to go, I'll understand
But the pain's so hard to take when we're apart
You'll never see me cry, it's locked away
But there's this feeling deep within me, wants to stay
And if you were here, would things be right
I need to find my way alone to win this fight

Stay with me tonight
One more time could make it right
One more chance to hold you tight
Won't you stay with me tonight?
