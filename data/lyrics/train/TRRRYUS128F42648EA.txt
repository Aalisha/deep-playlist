[Repeat: x4]
Whoa precious, precious love

I was lost, and in the dark,
Searching for some-thing to refill my heart,
Though we're lost and so alone
Looking for a place to call my home
And I'm looking for

(Whoa precious, precious love,)
Precious love,
Found it, found it, found it,
(Whoa precious, precious love,)
It pulls inside of me all of the time,
(Whoa precious, precious love,)
I've found the most precious love,
(Whoa precious, precious love,)
Precious love,
Found this love, I've found this love, I've found the love,
Found it,
It's so spiritual

One day I found the One inside of me
Hmm, He was the only, one who understood my needs
Although my lonely days seemed like a memory,
Most precious love inside of me,
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah,
