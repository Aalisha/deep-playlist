I know what's waiting
Some man is waiting
For you
Yeah you

Do not explain him
I get the feelin'
We're through
So true

And I heard there's somebody else
I tend to believe that they're right
I get the feeling whenever you go
That something ain't right, my heart's on the line

Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
I heard it all before
Don't say you love me (Don't say you love me)
Cuz once I'm gone I ain't gonna beg for more
