She'll say something that she don't want to,
Will you make it alright?
And I'll take something that I don't want to,
If I stay here tonight.

I don't wanna be the last to leave,

I don't wanna be the last to leave,
(Wait for me)
I don't wanna be the last to leave,
(Wait for me)
I don't wanna be the last to leave
(Wait for)
