Such a long while now
Since my highs dropped to lows
You know the sad part is
It's starting to show
That I ain't been quite myself now
For quite a long time
What looked like a thousand bucks
Now turned out a dime

It's getting cold babe
I've been shivering for days
Not exactly lost
But I have still to find my way
As folks did before me
