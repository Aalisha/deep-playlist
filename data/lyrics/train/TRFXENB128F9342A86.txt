Swell and swallow
Licked by gray tongues of insatiable and greedy wolves
There is no famine, no drought, nor dearth
Many lifetimes away from sincerity,
from commitment, from honesty
And yet the wolves still feed and fatten us for abolishment
Covet the seeping fumes as all skull content ferments
...
