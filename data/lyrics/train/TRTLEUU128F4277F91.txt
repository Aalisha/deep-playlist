(Verse 1)
Nukka Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
You better get in there and get that DOUGH
All over the world, god, it's kids that KNOW
You remember in South click we did that SHOW
Only had one mic but ripped that THOUGH
Only had one fight and flipped that MUG
Lucky for him we didn't get that TOUGH
'cause word to my moms I woulda shit bagged BRO
SAAAMN
Let 'em KNOW
Nukka Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
You ill when you rhyme simple as tic tac TOE
You know why I'm rhymin' as simple as tic tac TOE?
'cause niggaz is dumb and that's the shit that BLOW
SAAAMN
Let'm KNOW
Nukka Saigon where'd you get that FLOW
