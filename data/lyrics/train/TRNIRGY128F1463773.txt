Jenny Artichoke

Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat down by the sea with her baby
And she didn't know much about anything, but she was, oh, so nice to me

Jenny Artichoke lived in a boat, dressed like a queen, you should have seen
And she didn't care much about anyone, but she was, oh, so nice to me

Jenny, climbing up a flagpole, Jenny, looking through a pothole
Jenny with her hair of fire, how could anyone ever pass by her?
