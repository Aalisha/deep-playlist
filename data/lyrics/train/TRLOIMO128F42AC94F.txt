I know a place that we can go to
A place where no one knows you
They won't know who we are
I know a place that we can run to
And do those things we want to
They won't know who we are
Let me take you there
I wanna take you there
I know a place that we forgot
A place where we won't get caught in
They won't know who we are (they won't know, won't
know who we are)
I know a place where we can hide out
