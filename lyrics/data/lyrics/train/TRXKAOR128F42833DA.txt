One thing I've never learned is how to give up
So it's my destiny to bear this fate
They say that I'm still young but I'd better hurry up
And they're talking 'bout change
And it's a little too late 

I'm really not just jumping to conclusions
It's all a matter of fact clear of illusions
You'll never love me the way I love you
So I'm paying the price
All my life

Just when I think I'm moving along
You come back singing a different song
A song of love, a song of sweet regret
...
