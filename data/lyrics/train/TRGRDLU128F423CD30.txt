Rain is falling
All the way to the bus stop
Hear them calling
You run away
Try not to leave any traces
All the places that you've never been
There must be somebody out there
Who can take you away from all this

CHORUS
You're unwanted (you're unwanted)
You're alone (you're alone)
You're all I desire (all I desire)
