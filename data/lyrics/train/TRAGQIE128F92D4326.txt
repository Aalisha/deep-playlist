Mmmmmmm...

I say "I love you", you say "That's kind"
You don't wanna get too close
You loved me crazy, I lost my mind

You're everything I've ever wanted
And all the things I didn't need
This ain't who I want to be

You don't have to stay forever
I'll take passion over pride
Full moon, high tide
Let's make it a long goodbye
Tomorrow we'll pick up the pieces
Try to mend our broken lives
Soft kiss, sweet lies
Let's make it a long goodbye

I cried in silence, I lived through you
...
