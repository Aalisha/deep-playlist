Crafted and molded, sculpted and folded
Designed to praise in every way
Gifted with music, anointed with lyric
You made me an instrument of praise

Crafted and molded, sculpted and folded
Designed to praise in every way
Gifted with music, anointed with lyric
You made me an instrument of praise

Who am I that You
Would trust me with Your love
I am so honored, oh, God I'm flattered
You made me an instrument of praise

Who am I that You
Would trust me with Your love
