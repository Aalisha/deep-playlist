"Pouring Water On A Drowning Man"

You push me when I'm falling
And then you put me down
I guess I missed my calling
I should have been a clown
How much more
How much more can I stand
You're pouring water
On a drowning man

You put me on the right track
And then you put me down
You stab me in the back
Everytime I turn around

Criticize my lovin'
When I'm doing the very best I can
You're pouring water
On a drowning man
