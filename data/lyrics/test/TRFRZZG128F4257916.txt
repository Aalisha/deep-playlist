Who was the one who put the leaves on the trees
Who was the one who put the corn in the field
Who was the one who made you alive
and gave you all the will to survive?
Who is the one who keeps the whole world turning
Who keeps the Sacred Fires burning
Who is the force behind the internet?
Well let me tell you lest you forget

Who was the one who gave you films and TV
And gives you the chance each day to be free
