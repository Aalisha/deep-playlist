Jah rastafari, in a the life book i look
i see lightning and thunder and the earth shook
this is one song i got to say
Our father allelujah
i will sing with all my heart
set the captive free to praise the almighty
and this will be the answer to my prayer
our father allelujah
i will sing with all my heart
set jah people free to praise his majesty
and this will be the answer to my prayer
And i pray, for one-day things to be better
and i say, help the people from the gutter
can't you see, they stole our birthright take away our treasure
the youths are kings and queens don't call dem suckers
Our father, allelujah
