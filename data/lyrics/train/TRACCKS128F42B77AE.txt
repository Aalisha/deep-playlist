1: Flesh N Bone

We in the last five days of these trials and tribulations
And I'm waiting for the Lord oh please don't leave me forsaken
Caught up in the doom prepare for Satan
We facing a situation while I'm drunk and scared
Heavily sedated wonder will I make it to the pearly gates
Or will I burn off in that lake now,
Could you feel the earthquake shaking the dead awake
How many wait it's too late it's over now
Niggas had a lack of faith so life ain't straight, if you incapable,
Having a little trouble a day wid ah fiend or somethin'
Betta plead to bloody Jesus
Watch how the majesty control it
Don't let it go slow down hold on
Now can I get a witness shout Hallelujah, Amen
I'm feeling the Holy Ghost makin' moves through ya
Smooth, I made it to free your mind to the rhythm
I got designed when the world drop dimes
This world you'll fine there's no other like my kind

Bizzy Bone

Code Murder One, Code Murder One,
Code Murder One, Code Murder One
Murder them mo
2: Bizzy Bone

If the world should end today!
Fully automatic gunning through it
Gunning thangs, red rummed when strumming pain
Mo murda, I heard 'em holla holla, clock dollas
Swallow me baby cause we balling hollow point tips to the CI
Enemies keep rolling, get 'em off that flaunted fluid
Making me nauseous cautious these niggas is flossing
My Nina Ross tossed out I'm slaucing
It's for the auction rapper bop the copper got gospel on 'em
Who wanna magnum?
Who wanna tag 'em?
Bag 'em up ain't no problem, baby(bitch)
Smoked out in high school
Sleeping the fifth grade selling chicken
