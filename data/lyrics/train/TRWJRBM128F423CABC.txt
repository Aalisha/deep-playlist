Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying.
Brother, brother, brother, there's far too many of you dying.
You know we've got to find a way to bring some lovin' here today, yeah!

Talk to me so you can see; oh, what's going on.
What's going on yeah, what's going on, oh, what's going on.
Ah ah, ah, ah.
I yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, ya, ya, ya.
I yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.
She de doot do do de doot ba do be do be do bu bu bu bu bu do.
