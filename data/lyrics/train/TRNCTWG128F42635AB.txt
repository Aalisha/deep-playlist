A broken man without a home
Desperate and so alone
A victim of society
No one really wants to see

Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just help each other
Isn't there enough to share

There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain

There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change

In another land they still believe
Color grants supremacy
I don't understand how there can be
Regulated bigotry
