Life is a colorful thing
Life is a colorful thing...
From rainbows to rain
And all of the hills in between

Indigo passion and chartreuse motels
Blue mornin's after, feelin' like hell
Big yellow taxi - rusty and gray
Comming to take me away

Blue celebrations with borderline friends
We go through the motions again and again
Sometimes it's just not the way that you dream
...
