I'm lost again and I'm on the run
Looking for love in a sad song.
With your avenger eyes and your catlike ways
I can hold you.
You are a fool for me to be cruel.
I'm leaning on this bar listening to you sing
And your sad song rings in my ears and I start to cry.
He's searching
she's showing

See him held in a deep
deep spell he knows she's glowing.
I can find within my mind a way to go

I can look deep into your light and shout
Hold me
...
