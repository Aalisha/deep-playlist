Oh there's no time
To choose for yourself
It's like the candle's lit at both ends now
Deteriorating health

Parents' breaking up
Wish they would decide
Whether to stay together
Can't make up their minds

They wonder why you need someone
You get no freedom at all
They want you to drop down and conform
They make your self-esteem fall
