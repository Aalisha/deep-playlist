I've seen
Angels
Open arms
And cast down nations until
Nothings left
The stubborn heart
Kills thoughtful minds
Still they
Hate when
Evidence
Stares them in the face
The threat is real
Even when heaven is silent

There is a calm before the storm
When every man
Will call
On the name of God
And he will judge this wicked world
