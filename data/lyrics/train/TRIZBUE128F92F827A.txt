The pain, the lies they multiplied
It got too much for me
I have locked myself inside
And swallowed up the key

I've closed the lights
I talk all night
I'm such good company
Don't call me at home
I cut the phone
I'm as I wanna be

Search me not, please
Search me not
The door bell
It hurts my ears
...
