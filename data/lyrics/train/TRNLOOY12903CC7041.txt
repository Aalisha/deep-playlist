Sad song on the radio
Echoes down this empty road, here tonight
With lost memory and a lonely rhyme
Of windshield wipers slapping time, you know the one
It woke up something that was sleeping below my skin
I wanted to tell you so much, but where do I start, where do I begin
Do I start with how I lost my kindness and how I found it once again
And I'm gonna play it as it lays
Play it as it lays
Ooh, ooh
Every perfect picture has a mess or two
Sometimes it's me, sometimes it's you, but that's alright
You surrender, you confess, you make a mess, you get undressed and call it a night
