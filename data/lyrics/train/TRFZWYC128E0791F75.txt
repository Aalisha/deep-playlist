You're sweet just like the sun
But what happens when the sun doesn't stay?
The night reminds me when you went away (I don't care, I don't care)
Now my mind was pacing, heart is racing contemplating things that I lack
Even though you left me by myself, do I want you back?
Will you stay or will you walk?
will you let go?
Leave me all alone
I'm giving you one more chance
To make things last
Ring around the roses then she'll stay
Leave me once
Leave me twice
Kiss good-bye that will suffice
When you go away
Don't look back
