Some men can't be happy without makin' somebody cry
And some men gotta be famous and take all the stars from the sky
And some men find the answer in a big old house by the sea
But all I wanna be is your man, that's all that matters to me

Some men gotta have money or they can't sleep at night
And some men can't be happy without every pretty girl in sight
And some boys still need mama or they just can't get along
But all I wanna be is your man and nothing's gonna go wrong
...
