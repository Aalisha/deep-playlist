All of the things i never did,
I was waiting for the right time,
All of the things i never said,
I was waiting for the right line,

When is the right time ever right,

So Im gonna show you now,
The only way i know how,

And i dont care who sees,
I dont care who tells who
I wish the whole world knew,
Baby i've been kissing you,
Though people walking by,
