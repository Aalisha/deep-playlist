Lookin' for love and I lost my way
Another long night has turned to day
Nobody likes to feel this way
So I draw close to You
It's what I'm supposed to do

Lookin' for love and I close my eyes
I run to you with no disguise
You hold me close and say "it's fine"
You take me in Your arms
And You soothe this heart of mine

And I throw my hands up in the air
Here's my heart 'cause I don't care
What they say about me, I gotta praise
I throw my hands up in the air
And I know that You will find me there
Find me when I praise

Lookin' for love and I hide my face
(Lookin' for love and I hide my face)
What about the scars and disgrace
(Should I hide my disgrace)
