There's so many of us, there's so many of us
There's so many
There's so many of us, there's so many of us
There's so many
There's so many of us, there's so many of us
There's so many
There's so many of us, there's so many of us
There's so many
There's so many of us, there's so many of us
There's so many
There's so many of us, there's so many of us
There's so many

Let's have a war
So you can go and die
Let's have a war
We could all use the money
Let's have a war
We need the space
Let's have a war
Clean out this place

It already started in the city
