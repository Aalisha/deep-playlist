Yeah, yeah

High, higher than the sun
You shoot me from a gun
I need you to elevate me here
At the corner of your lips
As the orbit of your hips
Eclipse, you elevate my soul

I've got no self-control
Been living like a mole now
Going down, excavation
I and I in the sky
You make me feel like I can fly so high
Elevation
