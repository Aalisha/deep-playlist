Hugged your friends
Kissed your mamma goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why from me

Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed

We honked the horn when we crossed the state line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must've known what we were going to find

CHORUS
This ain't nothin' but a Heartbreak Town
Square people in a world that's round
...
