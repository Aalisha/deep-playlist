Here you go

If you fear the angels above while you sleep
Then I'll be the blood, you paint on your door
Your dream is a worry that nothing will keep
But time is a story and there will be more

Your dream is a worry that nothing will keep
But time is a story and there will be more

And death in disgrace can seduce anyone
That needs to believe there? s judgment at hand
Or God may be kind and see you like a son
But time is a lion when you are a lamb
