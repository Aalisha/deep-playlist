Hey fair weather friend,
You know you're ripping me down again,
And I don't care what you say,
I can tell when we play,
That you don't believe in me,
So this is how it'll end,
Like it was all just a waste of time,
Now I got nowhere to go,
I think I'll call up my bro,
I do believe he can save my hide,
I've had enough of your alibis.

Hey Drummer boy,
Do you remember the beat,
That we played in the street,
In the faded summer time,
Hey keep me hanging one,
Now I got nowhere to go,
I think I'll call up my bro,
I do believe he can save my hide,
What you think fair weather friend?
