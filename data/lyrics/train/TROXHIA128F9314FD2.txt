Superstar
Where you from, how's it going?
I know you
Gotta clue, what you're doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you
Gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you
Got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call them like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, Woma-Womanizer
You're a Womanizer, oh Womanizer
Oh you're a Womanizer, baby
You you you are, You you you are
Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just what you a-a-are

(Ooh) You got me going
(You) You're oh so charming
(Ooh) But I can't do it
(You) You Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just what you a-a-are

(Ooh) You say I'm crazy
(You) I got you crazy
(Ooh) You're nothing but a
(You) Womanizer
