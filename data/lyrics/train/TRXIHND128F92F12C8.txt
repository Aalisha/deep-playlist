Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It? s a skippidity do da day
I? m the happiest girl, in the whole U.S.A.

Good morning morning
Hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why? d we move that bojangle clock so far away from the bed
Just one more minute
That? s why we moved it
One more hug will do
Do you love waking up next to me
As much as I love waking up next to you

You make the coffee
