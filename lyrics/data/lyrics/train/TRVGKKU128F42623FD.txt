Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride

Through the park, past the dog run
Smell of shit burning in the sun
Watch the cab, dent his door
Happy hour's here, let's pick up Jorge

Lock 'em up, lock 'em up, lock 'em up
Three cold beers in a cup

Ride, ride, ride, ride
