(Buck Moore - Pat Bunch)

You always leave me holding the bag
Don't you know it's gettin' purty heavy to drag
You think it's funny but it ain't no gag
How come you always leave me holding the bag.

Remember out in Austin that time that we got tight
You told that ole boy that I wanted to fight
Now Moe you know I really thought a that you could win
And I didn't see no sense in me a steppin' in
You almost got me killed when you started to brag
And that's when you ran off and left me holding the bag.

You always leave me holding the bag
Don't you know it's gettin' purty heavy to drag
