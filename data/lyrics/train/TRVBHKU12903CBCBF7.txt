Brace yourself for the awesome and rare
The real, the right dynamite is in the atmosphere
As there's a time and place for everything that's under the sun
This is the time and the place that we have some fun
Now take a see to check the pedigree
Of the band that's spelled S-T-E-T
The rhymerator, Dee-Lite, the R-O-D
And on the keys, my brother D-P-C
Wise, Frukwan and my DJ Paul
We puttin competition back, up against the back of the wall
Me and the band that I just mention
Present to you a new invention

We-we-we-we regulate a Stets-a-flucture
So def, a listen to the structure
Formulate ya own, but please don't touch a
Good lokkin out, we thank ya very much a
Heed this style on the cartwheel nightcha
Fight to the end, I bet we'll bust ya up
And ya welcome to a force that creeps
Slowly but surely, enough we'll defeat you, BREAK...

Break: (*scratchin*)

Straight to the letter witta hip-hop band
Of America, London and even Japan
...
