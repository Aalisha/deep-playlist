You say: "Make me into something
Give me a body"
And you say: "Let me out the bottle
Make me into someone
You can give me life
And I'll trade
The potion you embody with
Trips down the well and a swing from a necktie remedy, necktie remedy."

"You can give me life..."

"Let me in, it's cold in this abyss
Let me in cause it's cold
You'll raise your drinks up hight and swallow to forget
You'll raise your drinks up high
We'll swallow to forget."
