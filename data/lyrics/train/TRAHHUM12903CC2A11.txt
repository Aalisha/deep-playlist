I can't hold on but I can't let go
So I just gotta hope that I can keep on holdin
You are my best friend
I can't give up but I can't get down
Gotta fake it til I make it; things'll turn around
And you are my best friend

And every time I think I've finally found the truth
It transforms and shapeshifts
