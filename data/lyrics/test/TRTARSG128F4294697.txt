Wish I had I car
Top rolled down
Music up loud
Follow that girl all over the town
You'll see, Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me

Wish I had a dog
See her in the park, with a puppy on a string
Lookin so cute, baby sooner or later we'll meet
Norma Jean Riley's gonna talk to me

Everybody says fool nothing you can do
Never gonna see her with the likes of you
I'd say watch and see.
Norma Jean Riley's gonna notice me
