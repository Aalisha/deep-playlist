Don't sink deeper down
I could get in, I should let it out
I don't let anyone get close
I don't want anyone to know
That you're the face who haunts my dreams
And I'm aching for your body next to me
Is it wrong to miss the one who breaks your heart
Who breaks your heart
There's something in your lips that feels like home
I'm drifting off to music soft and slow
The taste is so familiar and fleeting
When we kiss, I feel home
