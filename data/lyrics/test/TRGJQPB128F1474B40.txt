I never thought it'd happen to me
I've been looking all my life just to be
Be next to someone I could call my own
You know it feels so good not to be alone

But you know I never
Thought I would find
A Girl Like You
I could call all mine
I said I never
Thought I would find
A Girl Like You
I could call all mine

My girl's just so sweet
I never thought I could ever meet
