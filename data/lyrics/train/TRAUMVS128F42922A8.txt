girls girls girls girls are so polite
they don't crush everything that they see

you can take 'em to a funky funky forest
with big glass spiderwebs hangin' from the ceilin'

they wouldn't feel the uncontrollable urge
to tip and push and kick and rip and tear and smash and squish and

poke and destroy
poke and destroy
poke and destroy
i'm a boy, i wanna poke and destroy
poke and destroy
poke and destroy
poke and destroy
i'm a boy, i wanna poke and destroy

boys boys boys boys are said to kill
they wanna crush everything that they see
...
