The T.V. is talking
The telephone's ringing
The lights are all on and the radio's screaming
A million distractions are stealing my heart from You

I'm tired and empty
This life is relentless
It weakens my knees and it breaks my defenses
It's wearing me down and I'm desperate to hear from You

Stop the world, I wanna get out
I need an escape away from this crowd
Just to hear You speak to me
