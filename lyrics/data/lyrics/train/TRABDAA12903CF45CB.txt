I won't bow down
To the god of this world
False prophets who sell
Their souls for silver and gold
I won't rest until
Your idols fall to the ground
Just try and stop me
Just try and stop me now
So take your best shot
Show me what you got
So take your best shot
Is that all you got
I'm not going to be afraid
...
