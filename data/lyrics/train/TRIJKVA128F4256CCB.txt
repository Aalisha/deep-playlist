I'm tumblin', my feet don't touch the ground
'cause I got no, got no place to go
maybe if I did I'd settle down my roots would grow

I'm a tumbleweed

I'm tumblin', tumblin' round
I'm tumblin' like a wind blowin' through your town
got a sharp thorn sticking in my side
on this dusty road I'm goin' for a ride
...
