Dust to dust
I lost my senses tonight
When I hear the screams
Still the rain was falling down me

Like a whisper of death I'm over you
Like the last breath of life I close your eyes
Your beauty fades to grey and your smile has gone

Tears won't fall and is crawling in my skin
This fear is growing in my eyes
Bleeds my heart, I'm surrender in the dark
It's growing
Tears won't fall and is crawling in my skin
This fear is growing in my eyes
Bleeds my heart, I'm surrender to the sweet
Blood theory
