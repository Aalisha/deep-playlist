I'm here to wear you out
I'm here to watch you hide
Nothing to figure out
I'm here to watch you die

Running away from the breast of
Your busy giant healing machine

Nobody left in line
No-one to make you shine

Running away from the backs of opinions
You've borrowed and betrayed

Lying awake
Don't ask why you should pay for this
You mother
