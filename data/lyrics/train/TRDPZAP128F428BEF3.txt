Heard a sermon from a creaky pulpit with no one in the nave
I paid a visit to the synagogue and I left there feeling blame
No one can tell me what to do
They have not the capacity to answer me

What the world needs now is some answers to our problems
We can't buy more time 'cause our tender isn't valid
If your soul needs love you can get consoled by pity
But it looks as though faith alone won't sustain us no more
