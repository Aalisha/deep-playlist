Don't want no palace paved with gold
Don't need more cash than banks can hold
When I get to feeling a feeling
For something there ain't too much of
My sweet li'l darling gives me her love

Won't catch me chasin' 'round at night
I'm not impressed with glamorous sights
Li'l darling may be as pretty
As some other girls you may see
...
