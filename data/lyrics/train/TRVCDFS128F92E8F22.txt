La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Oh, baby, baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom? Is she smoking up outside?
Oh, baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'mma buy her

Do you know just what she likes?
Oh
Oh, oh, tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain

I just wanna go to the party she gonna go

Can somebody take me home?
Ha, ha, he, he, ha, ha, ho
Love me, hate me, say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?

All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
