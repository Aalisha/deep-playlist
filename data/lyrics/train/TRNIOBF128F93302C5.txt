You? ve been with me for so long
But there? s something you? ve not seen
You know me as soft and calm
But that? s not all of me
You? ve held the candle, felt the flame
But this you can? t contain
Tonight you? ll feel the blaze

You have heard me call your name
But never in this way
Tonight everything will change
You? ll never be the same
For us to really be in love
