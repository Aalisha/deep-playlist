I flick it then I pass it
I feel a little fantastic
I'm in the club knee deep
I feel a little Freaky Deek-y
My pretty baby don't care
My baby don't care, no
Watch while I strut my hinnie
Flip my skirt to the breeze
Call me… freak of the… freak of the week… freak of the week
Yes, I'm a freak, I'll never be alone
I rock the floor until the morning comes
Escape thru the music, let my worries go free
Shake off the world, let ‘em think I'm just a freak
Tisket a tasked
I feel a little pre school-astic
I paint my hair green
I, I wear it down to my feet, yeah
My pretty baby don't care
My baby don't care, no
Let my inhibitions go free
...
