Hey yeah yeah yeah

I know of a man who lives on the other side
On the other side of this mountain
They say he's calling the weary home

I've been told of a man who walks on the other side
On the other side of this mountain
With a heart full of stories of hope

Hey yeah yeah yeah

So run like a vagabond, carry the flame
Run for the children and run for the slaves
Hold it up high with a message of faith
...
