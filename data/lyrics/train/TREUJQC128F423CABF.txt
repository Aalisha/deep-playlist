I listened to the megaphone man
He said we were facing the end
That's so much different than my mom and dad
Who said this is just the beginning

Cause they're in love with their shiny new world
They're in love with their airplanes and cars and hotels
It gets invented and produced en mass the very next day
It seems that they've tried everything but nothing has failed

No need to wait for tomorrow
Cause everything is blowing up today
