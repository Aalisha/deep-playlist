It's not about the boy
Found slain
It ain't about his lips
Blood drained

You should've seen his
Dreams dissolve
Into the dumpster behind
The mall

I'm goin' down to the
Wonderful life
I'm goin' down inside
A satellite
I'm goin' down on the
Bullet train
I'm goin' down on the perfect dream


It's not about the
Freeway drone
That score her tired
Journeys home
Softly licking her to sleep
Her eyes are closed to
...
