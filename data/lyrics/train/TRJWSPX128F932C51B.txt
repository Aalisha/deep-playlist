Ayo, I got no cash, no money, funds, no dividends
How come all these people got so much money to spend
While I'm cruisin inside of my broken down Honda Accord
Wishin I had a dollar bill to throw in the tank
But obviously? is a deadly thing
So I step to Willy Big, lookin for pocket change
He pulled out some champagne, so happy to celebrate
I was like, nah man, I need chips, let's get it straight
So right before I jetted he slapped me a couple bucks
I knew where I was headed, for gasoline that's unleaded
Would the derelect regret it or is that the way they thought though?
