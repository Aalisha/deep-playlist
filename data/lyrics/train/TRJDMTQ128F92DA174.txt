Well, you're brought up on the street
Did ya make it on your own
Are ya living in the shadow
Crawling in the night
Sleeping in the subway
Beggin' for a fight
Makes ya grow up hard, boy
Aren't you ready for a fight

I don't need no one
You can keep you sympathy
I live on my own
I would make that company
I don't need no one
You can keep you sympathy
I live on my own
I would make that company
I'm rough and ready tonight
Crawling in the night

Standing on the corner
Asked ya for smoke
I kick you in the deep, boy
Steel away you girl
Talked into a night fight
