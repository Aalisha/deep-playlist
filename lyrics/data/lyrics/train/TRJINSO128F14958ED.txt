And now I'm all alone again
Nowhere to go, no one to turn to
Without a home, without a friend,
Without a face to say hello to.
And now the night is near and now I can make-believe he's here

Sometimes I walk alone at night
When everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy
With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head

On my own
Pretending he's beside me
...
