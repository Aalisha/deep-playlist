There was a time we'd sit in the backyard
'Cause the house would get so-o hot
From the summer sun there was no way of sleepin'
And you'd play your old guitar
We'd fight mosquitos and enjoy
Your backyard concert for we had no television

We'd just begun our life as man and wife
And hardships then
Could scaresely scare us into quittin'
Things were far from bein' fine
We often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love

And that Christmas brought our saddest day
...
