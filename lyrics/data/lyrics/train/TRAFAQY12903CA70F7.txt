War for profit can nothing stop it
punish those unloyal war for oil
we dominate we obliterate
world economics and other countries
U.S. policy hands in everything
our intervention ends in destruction
collateral damage the pack is rabid
foaming at the mouth awaiting the feast

(Chorus:)
Your Silence (2x)
Equals your death

War for peace it doesn't fool me
