(Timbo King)
Yo, inside a hood, they are fiends
Young teens, wanna look like the magazines, O.G.'s with M-16's
Hear the story, later, upstairs, a baby's cryin'
Cuz her mom's upstairs fryin', I'm outside
With the lions, and the timberwolves, stalk the streets
Gorilla beast heaters on, fitted on
It's dark and gloomy, three pigs on a duty
It's not a fable, it's hood lullabye, where the brothers die

(Hell Razah)
Project playgrounds, death singin' nursery songs
Built a school on the cemetary, for your new born
From the cradle to the casket, or in a straight jacket
God will be forever, son, your flesh burn to ashes
The hood school a shorty how to re-up on his crack flips
