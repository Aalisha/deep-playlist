Mutilate me, hurt me now
You've cut your wings to justify my guiltiness
We're all slave of some sadistic obsession
You put this needle in my head, a needle called "pain"

Let me hate you, I'll never save you from yourself
Hold me, destroy me, tomorrow will never be the same

You reveal the worst
My inclination to forgive every sin
I'm enabled to avoiding stare at your halo of desperation
