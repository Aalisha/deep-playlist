Someday soon
You're gonna catch that dream you've been chasing, yeah
Someday soon
They're gonna write your name in the sky

Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon
Someday soon

Out there in the air tonight
It's electric, it's alive
Suddenly you can see right before your eyes
A thousand candles burning bright

Someday soon
You're gonna catch that dream you've been chasing
Someday soon
They're gonna write your name in the sky
All you need is just to believe it
