There I was all alone
Someone in just the right place
For something to go wrong

Just when I thought that I was safe and sound
He picked all the locks protecting me
And got to me somehow

Just look around, everything is gone
All that's left is just this heartache I've got on

He walked right in and robbed me blind
He took all the love I had
It was almost the perfect crime
And slipped away like a thief into the night
...
