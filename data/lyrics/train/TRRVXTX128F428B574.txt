Oooowwww

I walk the city streets
And I'm looking for some tushie
I want to feel, I want to touch
And not just some hoochie koochie
9 to 5, half alive
Devil in a sheepskin
Time to die, the beast is out
I'm going down in sin
I remember shadows
I'm leaving for my grave
Something's in the air tonight
You can smell it all the way

Night wolf, Night wolf
