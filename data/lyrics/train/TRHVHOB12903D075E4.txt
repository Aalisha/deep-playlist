You are so far away,
And it strains on me to hear your voice everyday.
You never know what you have until you're gone,
To hear your voice everyday!
You never know what you have until you're gone,
So when it's over and I'm on way my back home,
It feels like days and days before I'm next to you again.

This is how we love.

You're so far away,
And this is where I will always be,
on the road that doesn't end,
and the views that never cease,
with a feeling bittersweet.
Counting down the days(You're so far away), we're counting down the days(This is how we love).

Beat up and broken down,
From the wear of it all,
But I can barely notice because this means too much to me.
You're so far,
so far away.
