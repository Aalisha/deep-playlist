I was down in L.A. town, when our manager said, "Jump"
I threw my clothes and my saxophone in a two by four bit trunk
I pushed it to the airport and I ran to the ticket line
Man said, "Son, you could have saved the run, those airplanes just quit flyin'"

And that L.A. flyway is goin' to be my home
Uh-huh

I ran to the terminal building, to fly by my airline
The man said I could ride the wing and I said that was fine
