Hello, mellow
I haven't met you yet
Hazy, lazy
Don't you think that you'll forget your

Now you're in command
You got the best thing ever planned
And your secret's safe with us
Just like it always was

How can you blow the world apart?
And will you hold a place in your heart?
And will you leave that space for me?

Crazy, lady
You still believe you're strong
