Na na na

I know how you feel, girl, I've been there many times before
I got a pick up, I'm walkin' out the door
Sometimes hopin' is all that we can do
In mind and spirit, girl, I'm always there for you

Every time I think about us, the way it's got to be
You know someday we will work it out
When all that we wish for is just a memory

Anytime you need me, I'll be there
