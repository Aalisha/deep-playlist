He lifts me up to the sky
To watch me fall to the ground
He calls me when he needs me
He leaves me when I’m down
He plays with my love
Just like I ain’t got no heart
Then he reels me in easy
He says we never gonna part

My man is a mean man
My man is a mean man
He’s such a mean man
My man is a mean man
