I've been living
I've been locked inside a fantasy
I've been begging for a single moment
I need to tell you I've been thinking of you endlessly
And won't you listen to the words I'm speaking

Don't you know that I've been wishing one day
You'll be standing there looking my way
You know, you know
I don't want to be the only one falling

Now I'm driving away
With what I wanted to say
Now I'm left with the words never spoken
If I could go back in time
If I could only rewind
Take me back to the way that we were before
With one chance, and one try
I'm telling you that tonight I'm gunna get it right
I see things much clearer
Tired of living life through the rearview mirror

If there's a chance then I don't ever wanna let it end
You're like a river and I'm diving right in
...
