Healing of a nation, I cients
Whoa, whoa, whoa

A boom draw of herb deh by mi bed side
Open book of scriptures I man won't deny, keep it high
The grass is greener on the other side
A good meditation man can't hide

Say me have fi catch up all a fire
Fi go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong
Mi have fi send fi rizzla
Fi go burn di sinting, sinting weh strong

Forgot me have fi send fi a quarter
'Cause mi find out mi sittin it done
May have fi send fi a lighter
Fi go burn down Babylon

Ey, oh green grade, purple grade, brown grade for me
High grade, topper grade medicate for me
Give me meditation, give me vibes in a hurry
A boom draw of herb keeps me curry

Way back in days of old
Before Babylon entered where plants were grown
A lickle draw of herb was on Solomon's throne
You can't tell I and I leave it alone

It's like 1, 2, 3 draws for me
Come take a seat a lickle reasoning with me
Elevate yourself keep your mind ever ready, steady
