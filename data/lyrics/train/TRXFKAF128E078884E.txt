I’m calling out
Only echoes respond
But I scream ‘til my voice is gone
Crouching in corners and hiding your face
I’m sick and tired of playing your games

I’m not alone
I stand amongst the voiceless
Millions in the unforgiving sun

Here arm-in-arm
We parade these streets
And sing our songs (and sing our songs)

We’ve had enough
...
