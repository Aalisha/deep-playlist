Jeannie, Jeannie she's running on a thin line
While Danny's looking for an alibi
Little sinners living on the wild side
Face to face
Out of place
Out of time

Out in the streets
With a thousand faces
Where lovers meet
In pleasure and pain
Out of innocence
Two souls crying out
So desperately
In ecstasy

She is the animal
The way she looks at you
She's creeping in on you
He's just a criminal
Ready to strike
...
