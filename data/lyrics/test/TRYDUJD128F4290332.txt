Shooting stars in midnight pastures
And hanging out on clouds beneath the moon
Hitching rides on magic carpets
It's a fairy tale to me but you're in tune

You're shattered by the final frame
Of the movie scene that generates your every aim
You ain't no bird and so for what its worth
Gonna bring you straight back down, down

Straight back down
 (Come down)
Come back down
 (Come down)
Straight back down
Y'all straight back down to earth
 (Straight back down)

In times when you're in need of assistance
You're looking for a lead and in the distance
You hear them calling come back down again
But you don't know how, you don't know where
And don't know when

You're shattered by the final frame
Of the movie scene that generates your every aim
You ain't no bird and so for what its worth
Gonna bring you straight back down to earth

Straight back down
 (Come down)
Come back down down
 (Come down)
