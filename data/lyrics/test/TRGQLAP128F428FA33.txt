Confidence is a must
Cockiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges (I like 'em rough)

A man with a Midas touch
Intoxicated, I'm a rush
Stop you're making me blush
People are looking at us

I don't think you know, know
I'm checking you so hot, so hot
Wonder if he know, he's on my radar
On my radar, on my radar, on my radar

And if I notice you, I know it's you
Choosing, don't wanna losing you
You're on my radar, on my radar
On my radar, on my radar

And when you walk
(When you walk)
And when you talk
(When you talk)

I get the tingle
I wanna mingle
That's what I want
(That's what I want)

And listen baby, turn up the fader
Trying to make you understand
You're on my radar, on my radar
On my radar, on my radar, on my radar

Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my... radar

Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
