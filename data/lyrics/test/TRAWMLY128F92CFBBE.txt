Chi Chi Man Everywhere You Turn
You Say Burn Dirty Babylon Burn
Abomination - You Cry
Receiving Messages From The Sky

Yet still in the Lord I trust
All this hatred will turn to dust
Turn to dust

I will face this madness / and violence with love
I will stand tall and proud / Cause I know i'm good enough
I can hold my own next to anyone / I am cursed and blessed to be my father's son

Ruled by love, always fooled by love
In my heart and my soul / I am strong enough
