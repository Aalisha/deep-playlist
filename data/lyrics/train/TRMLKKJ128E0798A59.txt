Yeah, got a pretty young face
And a pretty old soul, got a pretty old soul
And yeah, you know you've got what it takes
But you're never too cold, you're never too cold

And I want to get lost tonight with you
Let me know if it's alright that I do
Cause I want to get lost tonight with you
What you've got is what i'm running to
