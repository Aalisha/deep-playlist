Faint white figures paint my sleep
please don't tell my secrets keep them hidden (you got it (x3))
if the words that matter reach your face from floor
will you be wondering if, or (do I need what is given or honest)
does it cost me scarring if the words stay true
even number your nephew (I don't want it don't want it don't want it anymore)

and when the answer that you want
is in the question that you state
Come what may (come what may)
