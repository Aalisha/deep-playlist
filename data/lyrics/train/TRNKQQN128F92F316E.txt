I don't want to spend my life trying to change you
This time I'm gonna take it as it comes
There are so many things that I want to ask you
I am unafraid of what the answers may be

Before you walk away
And start burning any bridges
This woman's not the one you've knew
There's been so many changes

Please don't turn my love away
(Don't turn my love away)
I'm gonna love you like no one's ever done before
Oh please don't turn my love away
(Turn my love away)
I'm gonna show you a love like you've never known

We travel so many roads in a lifetime
In search of a promise
(Promise of a dream come true)
And now that I've found you
(Like a dream star falling from the midnight sky)
...
