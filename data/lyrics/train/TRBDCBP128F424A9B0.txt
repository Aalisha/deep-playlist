Sugarfoot's got two hands
Just as long as he can see
One hand in the birdfeed
And a hand in the apple tree

Stands in line just a little behind
The yellow moon that hangs
He's all tangled and he broke his sticks on the links
Of his own chain gang.

You ought to see this home that he owns,
It's like a box of jewelry
He's got his own church bell
And his bed, it lays in a gallery.

And all the colors they shine like flames
Comin' in through the window pane,
(They) end up gettin' checked over twice
For the reds of someone's veins.

So cold and blown all apart,
So cold and needin' of a heart.
He stands alone on top of his home
...
