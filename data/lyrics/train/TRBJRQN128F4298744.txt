I was young but I wasn't naive
I watched helpless as you turned around to leave
And still I have the pain I have to carry
A past so deep that even you could not bury if you tried
Oh...

After all this time
I never thought we'd be here
never thought we'd be here
when my love for you was blind
But I couldn't make you see it
couldn't make you see it

That I loved you more than you'll ever know
...
