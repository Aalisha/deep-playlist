[Intro:]
Whoa la la, la la la la la la (Mr. True!)
Whoa la la, la la la la la la

[Chorus:]
Music pumpin people jumpin
And dem dancin on dem feet
Place is pumpin tell yuh somethin
Yo this dancehall vibe is sweet
No delayin music's playin
Now it's time to hit the streets
Let's go clubbin rub-a-dubbin
Where the party people meet

[Verse 1:]
Let's go party, move your body, girls get naughty
Hypnotic we a sip no extasy trip
Yo shorty, whinnin in da hallway
Hope yuh call me, da vibe is right tonight

[Chorus:]
Music pumpin people jumpin
And dem dancin on dem feet
Place is pumpin tell yuh somethin
Yo this dancehall vibe is sweet
No delayin music's playin
Now it's time to hit the streets
Let's go clubbin rub-a-dubbin
