Toy boy, toy boy, everybody's talkin'
When they see me walkin'
With this little boy of mine
He's my play thing and I love him
I dress him up lookin' fine

He ain't got money
People think it's funny
He gives me everything I need
He's my play boy, and my love toy
And I want everyone to know

He's my toy boy, toy boy
I'm out with my toy boy, toy boy
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday night

When I want a lover
I don't need any other
I know he'll come runnin' to me
...
