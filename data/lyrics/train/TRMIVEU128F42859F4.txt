Don't kiss it goodbye.
Don't even turn out the lights.
No need to make a big deal out of it.

I said no.
Don't tell me its fine.
Go ahead and leave me behind.
No need to make a big deal out of it.

I said,
Like a row of bones,
stitch me up and the flesh is sewn.
Now it feels like I can't sleep,
lying here on the busted sheet.
I just need a microfone,
turn it up cause the box is stone.
This is a place I call home,
all alone in my head.

I won't take it, if you break it, don't mistake it, I can't fake it, I depend on you.

Goodbye, cruel world.
