Sirens wail and a flashin' light.
Nothing better to do on a Tuesday night,
But give me hell.
Where you headed, what are you out for?
We don't see much of you 'round here anymore.
I guess it's just as well.
Well once upon a time you had it all,
You let everybody down.
You're always seventeen in your hometown.

Running from your folks, running from the law.
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all.
You keep on running boy,
You run yourself in the ground.
You're always seventeen in your hometown.
