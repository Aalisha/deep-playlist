There's a rainbow in the sky all the time
Don't be blind
There's a rainbow in the sky all the time
Don't be blind, don't be blind

Said you I'm living in my fantasy
But is you who is blinded by reality
The material world means so much to you
You just can't get what I'm telling you

There's a rainbow in the sky all the time
Don't be blind, don't be blind
...
