Like the flutter of your fingertips, like the flickering of lights
You've got your bright ideas but we've got bigger fish to fry
Found you out there on your doorstep, undressed to the nines
From your Sunday best, black and blue velvet dress, your head's a mess and so is mine

I know times have been tough on you, it's all downhill from here
Oh, Dorothy, inside that dreadful place deep in your heart
It's blackening, I'm racing to your doorway, Dorothy

Dorothy

Like the scratching sounds of insects beneath the blades and soil
