A cover version of "I Can't Make You Love Me" by Boyz II Men for their 2009 covers album "Love". The song originally was recorded by Bonnie Raitt on 1991

I can't make you love me

Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, and tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

Cause I can't make you love me if you don't, you dont
You cant make your heart feel so bad let it wont
Here in the dark, in these lonely hours
I will lay down my heart and till I feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
...
