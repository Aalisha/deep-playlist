Close the door and take the stairs
Up or down
Ups and downs
Well
Don't pretend you've never been there
You kiss me like an over dramatic actor who's starving for work
With one last shot to make it happen
You've won the role
You've played your part
You've been cordially invited
But I'm not impressed
And I'm definitely not excited
'Cause the film runs a shallow budget
And the writer's subject script isn't any deeper
So dive right in

Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Hey you, who are you kidding
I'm not like them
I won't buy in
Hollywood hills and suburban thrills
Hey you
Who are you kidding
Don't quit 'til 47
Then we'll turn it up
And we'll play a little faster

Take back everything you ever said
You never meant a word of it
You never did
