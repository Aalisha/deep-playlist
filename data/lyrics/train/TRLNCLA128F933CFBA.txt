Yo don't bother me kid
Let a nigga live plus eat
Bless the wiz and protect my seed

(Gatekeeper)
I filter distortion like a magnet
Attract rappin bandits
Stretch em and blast em over the canvas
Blatant replies to that blast my exercise won't be televised
Due to the rise of spirits or my transparent perseverance
Fuck a publishers clearance, Gatekeep's runnin interference
Yo, you can dissect it
The black prospecta
I'm cold as a pirate's luger
Choke on my hymic maneuver
I breathe life in the fire
When my designs are tight like pliers
Born in a pillow of barbed wire
Taught by Ebenezer Scrooge in my mom's church choir
The death stalker
New York trendtogrophy
The G-O-D, 120 degree geography
The bomb thick iron skin without a blemish
Black art of war chemist
Carry out the death sentence with deadly vengeance
What I'm seekin is your head on a skillet
Soakin in burgundy liquid
Self inflected wounds fill pounds in Grant's tomb
