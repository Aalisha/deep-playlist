VERSE 1
Here we go again, you're about to cry
I'm about to listen to another nigga's lie
Everytime you call you want good advice
And everytime you ask I tell you everything's alright
First you let it go, and gave him one more chance
This time makes number three, it's a different circumstance
Women on the side, baby's mamas too
This time I can't hold back, I think he's runnin' game on you

CHORUS
If you don't know where your man is
And he left you home with both of your kids
Girl your man's a hoe, a playa, certified hoe (hoe hoe hoe)
