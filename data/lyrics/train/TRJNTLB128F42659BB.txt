She's a rounder I can tell you that
She can sing 'em all night too
She'll raise hell about the sleep she lost
Even cowgirls get the blues

Especially cowgirls they're the gypsy kind
And need their reins laid on 'em loose
She's lived to see the world turned upside down
Hitchin' rides out of the blue
