I cried, when you left me I nearly died
You had just been along for the ride
But now the show is over

I'm glad 'cause you always made me so sad
I thought I was going to go mad
When you just ran for cover

Now I'm going away to be on my own
And I will forget all the things that you've done
'Cause you broke my heart in 17 places
Shepherds Bush was only one
