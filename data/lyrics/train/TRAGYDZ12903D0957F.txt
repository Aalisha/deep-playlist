D'you ever see yourself in my eyes?
Did you ever think that maybe I'd be lost without you?
D'you ever think that I was alright
You knew it all along

D'ya ever try to sing to my songs?
Did you ever take a walk is wasn't walking with you, yea?
Did you love me just to be loved?
I knew it all along, I didn't try.

Sometimes I like to be alone.
Sometimes I try to telephone...

Lover, come back to me,
Lover, come back to me,
...
