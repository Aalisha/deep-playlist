Can you tell what's on my mind
She's with him it's driving me wild
I'd like to hit him on the head until he's dead
The sight of blood is such a high
Ooooohhhh
He gives me hell

We made it on a Ballroom Blitz
I took his arms and kissed his lips
He looked at me with such a smile my face turned red
We booked a room into the Ritz
Ooooohhhh
He gives me hell

I'm gonna take you 'round the world
Jet boy I'm gonna make you penetrate
