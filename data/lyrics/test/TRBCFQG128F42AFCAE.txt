What's gangsta
In my humble opinion
What's gangsta is knowledge
Spilled out on the track

Tell me who are we really
When we don't know our history
What good is the church for
When you can't trust the priest

Guess the lies are easier to swallow
Than it is to face the truth
But the struggles of tomorrow
Are the same ones as the past

Wishing I could prophecy
Or perhaps just fade away
For brand new better day
So until my dying day

Living life like a catch 22, yeah yeah
For every step I try to take yet they wanna push me back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I ain't worried about it see
