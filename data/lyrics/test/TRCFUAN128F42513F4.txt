Together we stand, divided we fall,
come on now people, let's get on the ball and work together,
come on, come on let's work together, now now people,
'cause together we will stand ev'ry, ev'ry girl and a man ...
Before when things go wrong, as they sometimes will,
and the road that you travel, it stays all up hill,
let's work together, come on, come on, let's work together,
now now people, you know together we will stand,
ev'ry boy, girl, woman and a man ...
