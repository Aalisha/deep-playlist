Do we know more than
We knew then
Or do we know less
And we just pretend
Should I ignore my heart
And walk away
Your eyes tell me more
Than words will ever say

Should we take a chance
And dance the last dance
Should we spend the night
One more time
Caught-up in this romance
Or maybe wait and see
Let it be
The way that it will be
Should we take a chance
And dance the last dance

How can I be wrong
...
