Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
And I feel just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hangin' on, honey

You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
Oh, loving you is all I ask, honey

Winters come and then they go
And we watch the melting snow
Sure summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
(World around you)
