All that matters is what you do it all comes back on you
all the love you give, it should come back to you
Oh the lights on, it's shining on your side
Decided i'm wasting time on mind games with you

You can play the part, and run away
I will be the fool, who gets to play
Cause i have a heart, getting in the way
Gets to play the fool another day


Ah it's nice if you've got love, is all you need
I'd like to think that love is everything
