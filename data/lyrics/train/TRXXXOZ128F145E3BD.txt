I got a brand new set of wheels
and I got to know how it feels
to be cruisin' down the road at ninety five
it's a brand new speed machine
I'm gonna need to keep it clean
the print is red with leatherette inside.

Little sixty nine
sixty nineer
little sixty nine
nothing finer
cruisin' out in mine with my diner
in my little sixty nine
...
