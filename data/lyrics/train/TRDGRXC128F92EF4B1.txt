The only thing to say would be
Take that bitch away from me
I can't stand her anymore than she can stand me

She wanted to be just like you and me
She wanted to be anyone but Emily
She wanted to be loved by someone else
But she hates us like she hates herself

Girls like her grow old alone
Working at some bar some uncle used to own
She always takes the early shift
That's to make it home in time to fed her cats

She's a real bad mother
She's a devil, don't be fooled
Every word she ever spoke was cruel (2x)
