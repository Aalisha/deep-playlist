I love real things built to last
Hardwood floors and stone fireplaces
And looking back on the past

Ice cold beer, fish that fight
Wise, old bucks
And old timer's tellin' lies
Fireflies

Rainy days, I love them, I always have
Screened in porches, my old, straw hat
Smell of dogwoods, early signs of spring
Real things

I love real things like a hard days work
...
