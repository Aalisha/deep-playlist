I've got no sympathy
For all you've done to me
I'll bring you to your knees
And give you what you please

I'm gonna get to you
Just like you got to me
And then I'll do to you
Just what you did to me

I'm gonna shoot it,
I'm gonna shoot it,
Cause I'm locked and loaded

I'm gonna shoot it,
I'm gonna shoot it,
...
