I have my work cut out for me,
Because I feel so selfishly
It hurts now lookin' back

I try to think of what went wrong,
I've Never stayed like this so long
It hurts now lookin' back

In this grip of saddness,
I knew this was my last mistake,
And i'm the reason why

What I need to rewind
Take back the ones I've broken
Turn back time
Turn back time
What I need to rewind
Restore the ones I've broken
Turn back time
Turn back time
Why?
