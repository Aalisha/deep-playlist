I don't know why I love you like I do
All the changes you put me through
Take my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet

I wanna know, can you tell me?
I'd really like to stay

Take me to the river
Drop me in the water
Take me to the river
Dip me in the water

Wash me down, wash me down
Wash me down, wash me down

I don't know why you treat me so bad?
