I fear death
I just wanna groove
I just wanna live
I got so much to do
I fear death
I just wanna groove
I just wanna live
I got so much to do

I need time
I like the way I live
and not to lose it all
I have so much to give
I need time
I like the way I live
and not to lose it all
I have so much to give

I fear death
I just wanna groove
