Thank god I finally know
This ship is out of control
Thank god I have the balls to leave it to the sea
Got my lifeboat well prepared
I'm gonna breath virgin air
I'm gonna smell the scent
Of a new island

It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
I just can't stay here
It's already said already done
I know I owe you nothing
Everything is said and done
I don't belong here

I've got the wind at my back
The sun upon my face
The wings of my belief
...
