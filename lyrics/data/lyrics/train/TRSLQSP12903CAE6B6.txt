I'm drinking whiskey, whiskey and gin
I'm driving fast before the fever kicks in
My woman's left me because I'm rolling the dice
I better quit because I'm paying the price
Monday, Tuesday, and every other day
The stakes are high it's a pleasure to play
I got the devil's hands
I know all the cheats
I'm standing proud
