I've cried through many endless nights
Just holding my pillow tight
Then you came into my lonely days
With your tender love and your sweet ways

Now I don't know where you come from, baby
Don't know where you've been, my baby
Heaven must have sent you into my arms

Now in the morning when I awake
There's a smile upon my face
You've touched my heart with gladness
Wiped away all my sadness

So long I needed love right near me
A soft voice to cheer me
