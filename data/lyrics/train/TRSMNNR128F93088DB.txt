It's Saturday night, and my parents are out of town.
Told all of my friends at school that tonight we're gonna boogie down!
Everybody's been spreadin' the word all over the neighborhood, so come on over
and bring a friend this party has got to be good!


Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...
We're havin' a party (everybody)
gonna dance and play (what'd I say, now)
we're havin' a party (hey, yeah)
while the folks are away!


Hey, looks like everybody showed up, now, it seems like a hundred and one!
All the prettiest girls in the neighborhood, we showed 'em we got to have fun!


Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...
We're havin' a party (hey, yeah)
gonna dance and play (come on over)
we're havin' a party (alright)
while the folks are away!
