Young girls are my weakness
Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness
Young girls are my weakness

Hey girls let's mess around
I wanna party with you on the town
Some girls really make me swing
There ain't nothin' like a pretty young thing

Young girls are my weakness
I just like their sweetness

Young girls are really mellow
