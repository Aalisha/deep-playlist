Chorus
If you do wrong they complain
Even if you call the father's name it's the same
What they'want us to do
Don't they know it is nothing new
Why won't they do what they want
And let me do my thing they should be thankful
There's lights of hope still shining
Buju Banton:
Let Jah rise and the heathen scatter
Have to give thanks and praises no matter
Even if the flames is getting hotter & hotter
Every one should know I don't believe in rumor
Children arise from your sleep & slumber
Don't come to bow, come to conquer
...
