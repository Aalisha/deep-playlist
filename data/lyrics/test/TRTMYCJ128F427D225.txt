So here's a question,
I'll hypnotize you,
But will you follow me,
Follow all these footsteps I left behind,
My hands are shaking,
Don't criticize me,
I'm not being in demand,
I could pay for your tears,

It's in my job description,
To tell you how to feel,
This is my ammunition,
I'll fire at will,

Make make me make you want to sing along,
WOAH OH OH, WOAH OH OH,
You can't have my life
Break break me until I write your favorite song,
WOAH OH OH, WOAH OH OH,
...
