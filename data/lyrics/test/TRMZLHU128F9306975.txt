(Chorus)
I'm crazy, how I dress and keep it fresh,
so many steps, ahead of ya'll, cuz I'm before my time,
I'm crazy, how I do it, when I do it, I can do it dats why
da girls da girls they love me
I'm crazy, how I dress and keep it fresh,
so many steps, I hit to yall, cuz I'm before my time,
I'm crazy, how I do it, when I do it, I can do it dats why
da girls da girls dey love me

(Bow Wow)
Yall know what it is when I step in da house,
So stop sittin back tryna figure me out,
I know it dont sound right,
Cuz I'm only 14 and your like, 30 years old,
cuz you only wearin gold, So you mad at me,
and my first joint went triple P, and no matter what I do,
when I step in the tube, the girls they love me,
only reason that I'm winning this, cuz I'm a gimmic,
i know thats what your sayin, but I came to ur show,
and was'nt nobody, and you still think your the man,
what waz that, no promo, no radio, I kno you got
summtin to say,
its not your fault, cause you hot, but nobody else seem
to feel dat way,
see its like this, when you rap people just clap, when I rap
they shed tears, they no dat So So See your flow crazy
like Britney Spears, it is,
Ask yo momma, Ask ur brotha, Ask somebodys dad,
I'm colla poppin gansta I'm super bad
man I'm Crazy
(Chorus)
I'm crazy, how I dress and keep it fresh,
so many steps, aheadof ya'll, cuz I'm before my time,
I'm crazy, how I do it, when I do it, I can do it dats why
da girls da girls dey love me
I'm crazy, how I dress and keep it fresh,
so many steps, in front of ya'll, cuz I'm before my time,
