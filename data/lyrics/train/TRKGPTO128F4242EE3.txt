So, what’s it like? To be young, and alive
So, how are you? Did your dreams, get you through?
All I got is a beat up truck but it aint ever let me down
I’m not changing for anything ‘cause all I need is to get around
You spend your life trying to be someone but you’ll always be the same inside
Your getting old as your body shows but your only just a grown up child
