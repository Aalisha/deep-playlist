In my foolishness I had taken form of a mortal man
And entered time to live amongst humanity born of my tears
But now they have turned against me and my descendants

There enthroned gouge out my eye
Terrible is m pain, horrifying are my cries, dreadful is my towering rage
All my fierce passions cause my torn eye
