Umh... la la da...
la da da..."Catchin Feelin"

I'm catchin feelins' (yeah yeah yeah)
I'm catchin feelins' (yeah yeah yeah)
I don't think I can deal with hollering at you and you not holler back
Leaving messages on your phone and you don't hit me back
Catchin feelins' (yeah yeah yeah)
I'm catchin feelins' (yeah yeah yeah)
I don't think I can deal with knowing you're laying up with somebody
else
I don't want you for my friend if I can't have you for myself

A friend of a friend introduced us, had some drinks and laughs told me
about
your man I told you 'bout my girlfriend you said he made you happy
sometimes but
(sometimes) he spends way too much time at work. And his family
worked
yo' nerves, baby momma was a jerk and his kissing was the worse but you
still loved him.
So we agreed to meet next week for conversation and some drinks.
But baby girl I think I'm catchin feelins' (yeah yeah yeah)
I'm catchin feelins' (yeah yeah yeah)
