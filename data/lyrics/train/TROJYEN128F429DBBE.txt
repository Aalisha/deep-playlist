Do you take this man for your lawful husband? Yes! I do.
And do you take this lady for your lawful wife? Yes, I do.

I'm getting married in the morning.
Ding dong! You hear the church bell ring.
She have mi yellow baby and I'm gonna?.
So take me to the church on time.

But hear me man!

Say if you think I'm sexy, cho little girl reach out and touch me.
If you really need me, cho little girl reach out and tell me.
And, give me your loving, give me your loving.
