"Iesum, salvator mundi Tue famuli subveni Quos pretioso sanguine quos pretioso sanguine Redemisti"

Fairy lady, who stands on the walls
Life is short and wait is long
The stars, away, dim with the dawn
Fairy lady, who stands on the walls

Your tale has only begun
It comes from far, the Nowhereland
The wind is blowing a sound well known
Fairy lady, your love is long gone

Oh darling, hear my soul and heed my cry
Cause all my crying may flood
A river in my heart

Oh, life is good,
Oh, life is good,
...
