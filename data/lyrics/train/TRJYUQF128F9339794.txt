My jacket pockets are full of my hands
On nights like this I'd rather stay inside
Because the bitter wind is blowing
But I get to see my friends tonight

I'll be stuck in this place
For the rest of the year
I can feel the indifference, what's the difference?
I don't need this

I can feel the indifference, what's the difference?
I don't need this

Oh, and we danced in your headlights
Oh, I would kill for those nights
I can feel the indifference, what's the difference?
I don't need this

Friends all kiss their bottles
The minutes slowly cut the fears away
For nights like this
I trade my days
