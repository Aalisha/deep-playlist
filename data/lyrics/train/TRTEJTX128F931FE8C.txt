Takin' this crazy chance to be all alone
We both know that we should not be together
'Cause if we're found out, it could mess up
Both our happy homes
(HIM)
I hate to think about us all meetin' up together
'Cause as soon as I look at you it will show on my face, yeah
Then they'll know that we've been loving each other
We can't let 'em know, no, no, no
We can't leave a trace

(BOTH)
Secret lovers, yeah, that's what we are
We shouldn't be together
But we can't let go, no, no
'Cause we love each other so
