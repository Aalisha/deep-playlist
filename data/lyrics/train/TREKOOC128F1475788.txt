To the Marxists and the police
To the junkies in the streets
To the gangsters in our towns
And the others underground

To the prostitutes and whores
To the self-admiring bores
To the drinkers in a drought
And the writers steeped in doubt

To the bailiffs and their bills
To the child whose thoughts could kill
To the veteran who fights
All his demons late at night

To the bloody and unbowed
Fanatics and their vows
...
