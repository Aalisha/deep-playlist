A spell to free all matter
Folding time and gravity
A universe to shatter
Conjuring black holography

Unraveling the ether
Rending screeching molecules
Severing the elements
Ripping core from core

Sorcery's caustic breath
Fills the void between the spheres
The archetypes are gathering
At the other end of genesis

Ylem
Rise from oblivion
Initiate the grand corrosion
Ylem
Awaken, demand omega
The web constricts around quivering hearts
