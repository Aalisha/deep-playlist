Radio to Kansas City
We're departing Corpus Christi
Facing turbulence near San Antonio
I've got a mind to leave these cloudy skies behind
But I just thought that I should call and let you know

That I don't wanna be close
No, I don't wanna be in moderation
Slower conversations only lead me to believe I'm getting old
Just making small talk, staring at the sidewalk
We exchange about the weather getting cold

'Cause I don't wanna be close
No, I don't wanna be close
Too old for confrontation
Too young to let you know
You need to keep your fucking mouth shut
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Operator this is urgent
Seems I've used too much detergent
