In silence enshrined through ages
A dying beauty on a journey far
Fading roses enchants the garden
Sleeping, dreaming of my bride

In quiescence faces borders the path
On the shore of no hope I am stranded
Fading roses enchants my grave
Sleeping, dreaming of my bride

Lift my remains from water violent
