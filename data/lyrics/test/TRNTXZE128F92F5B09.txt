It was Saturday night and I'm feelin kinda sporty
Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a... kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, "Who the hell?"
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
"I know who you are, but who the hell is that?"
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, "Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I want to be your lover
Just one thing: I forgot to buy a rubber"
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, "Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock."
