Somebody's got a long way to go.
You're not sitting by the phone no more.
You're gonna throw it away, crash it on a rock.
Yeah, so you can live your life.

Mmm, are we going crazy?
It's not fair to say we wasted time,
In my view we just used it all up.
It's not fair to say we wasted time,
In my view we just used it all up.
