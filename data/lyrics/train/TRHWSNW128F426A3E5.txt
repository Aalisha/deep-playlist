Come over here
Right now, yeah

Just you and me
The image of the way it's gonna be
Close by my side
Livin' in the luxury of paradise

(Pre-Chorus 1)
Did you ever want something so bad, you'd risk it all
No matter what the the consequences are
You've lost control of something deep inside your soul
And now it's gone a little bit too far

(Chorus)
Temptation
Tappin' on the back of my neck
Up and down my spine
Workin' on my mind
I haven't got rid of it yet
Temptation
