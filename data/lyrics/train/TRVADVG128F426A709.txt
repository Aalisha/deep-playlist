I let you in, just a little too close
You shut the door, so nobody would know
I know I heard a shot, on the fourteenth floor
The music was raw, you really put on a show

This is where we are
This is where we've been
This is how I fall
In love with you again

I had to say goodbye, before I said hello
I saw you crash, and you took off your clothes

And this is the sound of a broken heart beating
Almost died when I found your heart cheating
I won't survive very much longer
You got to keep this broken heart stronger

This is where we are
This is where we've been
This is how I fall
In love with you again
...
