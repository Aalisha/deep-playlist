k e e p t o y o u r s e l f

i can't think why it's so hard for you to see
seasoned years of encouragement
rolling eyes that never made a dent
and now you've turned up to burden me
words can just stack up like a shelf

gotta learn to keep things to yourself

i can change the venue
but i'd still have to talk to you
theres no use in reasoning
when theres just no getting through
