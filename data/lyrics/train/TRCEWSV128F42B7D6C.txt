(Everything I wanna be)
(Disgrace to my identity)

No one can hear
All that's been said
You're feeding me useless
Lines of nothingness

Let me run away
Don't keep me here
I can't stay around
I can't take this fear

Everything I wanna be
Disgrace to my identity
I don't mind
I don't mind

Just give me my indifference
Stop questioning my reasons
I don't mind
No, I don't mind
...
