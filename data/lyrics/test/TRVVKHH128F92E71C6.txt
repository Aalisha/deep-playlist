Oh if only Brazil was not so far
Far away I Would swim or walk or ride
But never ever fly
But all the noise of the maniacs there
The sweat on my face it's worth to bear
But I don't wanna bounce and die

But then I see a lady in a tight blue dress
I close my eyes, I know what I would go for
Stewardess before the crash

Lavatory Love Machine
No fear can quell my steam
Lavatory Love Machine
No cabin fire burn my dream

I'm at your disposal
I gotta get up to see what you ain't gonna hide
Wheeling junk along the aisle
Keep your seat belt fastened
You're whipping with an iron voice
...
