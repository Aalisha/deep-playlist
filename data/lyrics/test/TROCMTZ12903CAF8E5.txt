It's got to be real
Girl, I could write a book on how you're makin' me feel
I know I'll never find
Another who could match the lovin' you've givin' to me

So
This is (for the lover in you)
This ring (means I'll always be true)
This is (how we'll start love a new)
This time (it's gonna last forever)

I trust you, yes, I do
And girl, you're not the kind a guy could easily charm
'Cause the meaning of love
Is always shown to me when you are wrapped in my arms
Oh baby

So this is (for the lover in you)
This ring (means I'll always be true)
This is (how we'll start love a new)
This time it's gonna last forever (I don't wanna, I don't wanna give you up)
