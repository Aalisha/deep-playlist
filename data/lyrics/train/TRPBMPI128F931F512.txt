Intro
Down with the DC Talk, Down with the DC Talk
Are you down with the DC Talk, Down with the DC Talk
Verse 1
Pullin' out my big black book
'Cause when I need a word defined
That's where I look
So I move to the "L's" quick, fast, in a hurry
Threw on my specs, thought my vision was blurry
I looked again but to my dismay
It was black and white with no room for gray
Ya see a big "V" stood beyond my word
And yo that's when it hit me That Luv is a verb
B Verse
Words come easy but they don't mean much
When the words they're sayin' we can't put trust in
