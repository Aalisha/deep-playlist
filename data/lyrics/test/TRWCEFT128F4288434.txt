Well I was sixteen
And sick of school
I didn't know what I wanted to do
I bought a guitar, I got the fever
That's rock 'n roll

I played at parties, played in bars
I spent my money buyin' new guitars
I screamed my heart out, but how I loved it
That's rock 'n roll

Well, come on everybody
Get down and get with it
Come on everybody
Get down and get with it
Come on everybody
Get down, that's rock 'n roll

It's when the smokin' and the heat
Have got your heart pounding
Right with the beat
Don't try to fight it, just get excited
...
