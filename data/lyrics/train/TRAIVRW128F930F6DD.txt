It seems lately when I walk down the street
There's something in my neighborhood
It's getting stronger every day
There's a rumor that lights up all of me
And it whispers from the rooftops up above
I must hold on or I'll fly away

Oh, no, not the autumn leaves
Lift you up like a flower in the cool night breeze
My heart's just flying when he walks by

Oh, but he's my inspiration
Yes indeed my pride and joy
Don't you say nothing bad about
...
