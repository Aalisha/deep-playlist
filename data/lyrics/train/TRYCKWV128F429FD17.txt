I went to work this mo'nin'
My foreman looked me in the eye
He said, "Fella I don't know what's wrong with ya,
But you look sick enough to die"

He sent me to the company doctor
And he examined from head to toe
"Whatever's wrong with ya, young man,
My x-rays just won't show"

I say, angel of mercy
Won't you please look down on me?
Angel of mercy
A little mercy is all I need

The finance company
They just don't receive my check
...
