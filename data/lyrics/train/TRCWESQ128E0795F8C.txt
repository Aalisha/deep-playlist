You feel me.
Feel with me.
You see me.
See with me.
Feel the waves and I'll be the wave.
Feel the waves and I'll be the wave.

You are like the ocean, and I'm like the moonlight,
it seems, 
I'm only reflecting on your surface,
But you know I reach your ground.
You're my ocean, you're my life. 
Let me be within you.
You're my ocean, you're my life.
