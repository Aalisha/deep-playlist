Set yourself free
Set yourself free, free
Set yourself free
Set yourself free, free

To love somebody
To love somebody
To love somebody

When you can't face another day
Don't you ever stop and wonder
Why it's all work and there's no play
Why do you let them drag you under

Do you wanna hear how it should be
Face the world don't hide behind it
You've only got yourself to please
Happiness is where you find it

Until you set yourself free
You'll never hold on to your dreams
