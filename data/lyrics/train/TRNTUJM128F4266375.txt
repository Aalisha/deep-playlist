Communication is where it breaks down
Humiliation is all that's left now
Apologetic, you say you're sorry
You're pathetic, you won't be bothering me

Just like I told you before
Don't wanna see you knockin' at my door
Don't wanna see you round here no more

Give me a little respect
Not long 'till someone breaks your neck
You're just a wreck
...
