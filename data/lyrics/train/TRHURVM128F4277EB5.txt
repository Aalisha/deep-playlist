I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face
All my friends tell me i'm a basket case
I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face

I got so drunk
I don't remember what happened
But everybody said
I had a real good time

I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face
All my friends tell me i'm a basket case
I drink, i get drunk and fall on my face
