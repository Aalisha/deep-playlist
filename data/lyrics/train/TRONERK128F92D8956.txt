So long hidden it for too long
But I think you should tell us
Don't you think we've noticed
Promise there will be no fuss

It's one thing, none of our business
But we saw who you were kissing
We just want you to be straight up
We know its hard to tell

Steppin' out is hard to do when
You are young it's already enough
