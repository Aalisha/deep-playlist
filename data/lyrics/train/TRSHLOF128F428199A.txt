I'm bored out my mind
Too sick to even care
I'll take a little walk
Nobody's going to know
I'm in senior year
It gives you a little free time
I'll just use it all at once!

Took the fence and the lane
The bus then the train
Bought an 'Independent' to make me look like I got brains
I made a story up in my head if anybody would ask
I'm going to a seminar!

I'm a genius
A prodigy
A demon at Maths and Science
