You've lost that feelin' in your kiss
I'm only holdin' up the show
My god your face i'm gonna miss
But I see it's time to let you go

You don't dig lovin' me no more
We used to make it long and slow
I've cried so long my eyes are sore
I see it's time to let you go

It aint no good if it don't feel good, real good
It still felt good to me-ee
