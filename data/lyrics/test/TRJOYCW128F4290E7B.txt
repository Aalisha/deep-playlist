Who'll ever win?
Gee, you're just so ephemeral
Go back for new
For new in vain, it failed

Singing on the famous street
I want to love me
Am I just in heaven or Las Vegas
It's so much more brighter than the sun is to me

He's a hustler
It's a role, he'll never make a suit
Hang on to this
So stay and spin and fail and fail
Who'll ever win?
