I'm livin' love in the fast lane
Seein' the world from a airplane
Uh uh
A strange little thing called love
Tastin' the air as we're racing
Smilin' faces as we're passing
Uh uh
Strange little thing called love

The air is clear
Get out of here
Baby, grab your coat; let's take a ride
Hold on to me
And steal the breeze
Late into the night
Oh, yeah let's

Glide, Ooo, higher than the wind goes
Glide, Ooo, out into the neon sky
Baby, wanna glide
I know that you want to
(Ooo, glide-ee)
