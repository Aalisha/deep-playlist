For once in my life
I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once unafraid
I can go where life leads me
Somehow I know I'll be strong
For once I can touch
What my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Ohhhhh someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true
Yeah, yeah yeah.
For once in my life
