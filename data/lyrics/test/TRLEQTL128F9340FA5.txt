Go, if you want go
Stay, if you don't know
Friends, stay together baby
Call me I'll be there

Feel, what you wanna feel
Mine, oh love's so real
Friends, we're forever baby
Here and everywhere

Don't, keep your distance
Don't, lose your resistance
Don't, you want my heart?

That's love, we'll win again
This love is like an ocean
That's love, it's not a game
How deep is your emotion?
