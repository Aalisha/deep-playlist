Roll the carpet and pour out the wine
Treat me like it's your first valentine
'Cause honey baby, you've been on my mind
Like all of us who have waited for a time

I'm calling can you hear me?
The angels will steer me
To your door, feel so sure
The nite is the brightest

Who knows what I really will hear?
What I really will say?
What I really will feel?
Who knows what you really will hear?
What you really will say?
What you really will feel?

Wall the papers and call your friends
No longer, do we have to pretend?
'Cause honey baby, you've been on my mind
Like all of us who have waited for a time, oh

I'm callin' can you hear me?
The angels will steer me
To your door, feel so sure
The nite is the brightest
