Don't Upset The Rhythm, no
Don't Upset The Rhythm
The time is right
The sun is sleeping in the sky
Free your mind
You never know what you might find
What's your vice
You know we won't compromise
So let me show you
Something simple beautiful

Let's rock the boat
The magic is unstoppable
For on floor
It's the rhythm you've been waiting for
Pure delight, kicks, snare, hat, ride

It's all up to you and whatever you do
Don't cut into my action
4-3-2-1
Go baby, go baby GO!
Don't Upset The Rhythm, no
Go baby, go baby GO!
