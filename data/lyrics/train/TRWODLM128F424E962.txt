You can make the sun turn purple
You can make the sea turn turtle
But you know you can never make me love you more

You can turn wine into water
And sadness into laughter
But you know you can never make me love you more

Let the sky fall down
Let the leaves turn brown
Still you know you can never make me love you more

Let the redwoods die
Let the wells turn dry
Still you know you can never make me love you more

You make dew into diamonds
...
