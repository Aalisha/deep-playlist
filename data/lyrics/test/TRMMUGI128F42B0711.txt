It's speeding up around me
But my heart is slowing down until it stops

This train is off the rails
The devil's in the details
No one notices

There's bonfires in my head
There's criminals in my chest
No one notices

And I'm desperate
And I'm lonely
The hospital is empty
No one notices

It's not enough to say I'm sorry
For all the pain and the worry
What are you waiting for?
