You and I
Since you've gone all the flowers have died
You and I
We've been drifting apart for some time

How could I survive
In this world full of cocaine and lies?
'Cause every day away feels like
I've gone a thousand miles and have to go a thousand more
It's like a slow death in my soul
I feel while falling into space now darker than before
What ever happened to those simple days?

You and I
