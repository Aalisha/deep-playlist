Monrose - Just Like That
Tell me what you know about a girl. 
Tell me about it, talk it over. 
Its like I've got a habit being hurt. 

I should have known better.
But you where so clever, so clever. 
I should've known. 
Put on a dress that can ease my pain. 

Girl you gotta get back in the game. 
Gonna feel real sad but act real hard. 
Gotta shape it up. 
Get a brand new start. 

Just like that. 
No more you and me. 
Just like that. 
I'm not your property. 

Just like that. 
A whole new energy. 
I did it quit it.
