See that foxy momma over there
The one with the knee up hotter than hell
Aww yeah at the bar as they all stop and stare
But what they have to say no she really doesn't care

She let's them know yeah she makes it clear
Drunk talk and bullshit isn't why she's here
Chewing bubblegum and drinking beer
Aww yeah she's the one
That's right now

Bubblegum and beer (bubblegum and beer)
Bubblegum and beer (bubblegum and beer)
