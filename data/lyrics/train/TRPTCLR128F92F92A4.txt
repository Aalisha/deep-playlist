See there's this lady that lives on the street
She has no job, no home, no family
And she barely has the chance to even eat
So she begs and steals and sells her body

Sometimes she may come off a little strong
But she's just on her own
But if it was you, what would you do?
If you didn't have a home

If you didn't have a pot to piss in, didn't have a kitchen
Imagine if you was homeless
Didn't have a job, no car, no friends
Imagine if you was homeless

Sometimes you should just look at your life
And imagine if it was you
Just imagine if it was you
...
