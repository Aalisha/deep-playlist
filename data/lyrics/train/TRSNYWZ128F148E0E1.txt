I ran outside, right into you, and instantly you said you knew
that you were the only one, I'd ever need to know
You said you knew the answers
and you said, that it's just another day

I came here with a voice, a chance to make a choice
an island of a mind, with bridges built with time
and now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day

It's just another day, it's just another day
and now that I can see, why don't you come with me
'cause it's just another day
...
