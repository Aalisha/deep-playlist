You were bad but
do you feel it?
And in the hindsight
you don't see it
And it's a shame
you were forsaken
with the traps
set so well hidden
And I know all whales can sing

With the shouting
you hold me up again
If you're the highway
I'm the pavement
Through back door
from the existing
And all the wind blows
neverending
And I know all whales can sing
...
