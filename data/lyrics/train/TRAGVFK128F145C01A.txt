That burning sunset in the sky
Is calling out to us tonight
I won't work for my old man
Anymore that you fit into your mamma's plans
There's a place for people like you and me
True love's still got room to breath

And we can drive all night
Into the morning light
Let's go west
It's our ticket out of here
Yeah we can disappear
Let's go west
And that painted sky was made for us
It's everything we ever dreamed of
Let's go west
