I was nurtured
I was sheltered,
I was curious and young.
I was searchin for that something,
Tryin to find it on the run.
Oh and just when I stopped lookin,
I saw just how far I'd come.
In this liiiiife...
In this liiiiife...

You give me love,
You give me light,
Show me everythings been happenin,
I've opened up my eyes,
I'm followin
3 steps fight an honest fight, (oooh)
2 hearts, they can start a fire, (yeah yeah)
1 love is all I need in this liiiife...(oh)

Yeahhh... Yeahhh... Yeah Yeah...
In this life
Ohhh... Whoahhh... Whoa Whoa

I have faltered
I have stumbled,
