Hey whiskey man, you're running as hard as you can,
You drink your whiskey too much more than you can stand.
You have your highs, you have your lows,
Nobody knows which way you go.

Chorus:
Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long.
Whiskey man, don't you play that hand too long.
It takes whiskey to make you tall,
You ain't so very damn tall at all.
