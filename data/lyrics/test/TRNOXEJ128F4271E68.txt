Story 'bout a girl
Story 'bout the world

Suddenly, something I'm not
I'm something that you bought

My friend

Are you tripping all over it?
You better come up for air

Holding, holding your breath
And are you looking for something
I promised you one thing
I promised I'll always, always
Be there

Baby girl, stand up and fight
