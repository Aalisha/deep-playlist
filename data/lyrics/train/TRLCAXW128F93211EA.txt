[Chorus: Phonte]
I got money, lots of jewels and fancy cars
(They say I'm wrong) But, baby don't blame me
I'm just a paper chaser
Paid my dues and now I cruise with movie stars
(They say I'm wrong) But, baby don't blame me
I'm just a paper chaser

[Tity Boi:]
They wanna know where my name from, where I came from
Where I Florian Champagne done
Arm & Hammer grammar, campaign on it
Propane slang, put the flame on it
I was so hungry, I could eat a house
Then shit it out, 'til I figured out a different route
I'm try'na get clout, cash and a black card
So now even my pool got a backyard
Now it's time to fast-forward, speed up the process
I'm so fresh, I could fuck her off my outfit
Ridin' in the cockpit, ridin' with the top back
Ridin' on some butt-nicks, ridin' they say, "What's that? "
... A fancy car
Or a big tit, I hang with the stars
[overlapping first line of chorus] I got money.
