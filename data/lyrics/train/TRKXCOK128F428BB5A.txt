Drink.
Drink.
Drink.
Drink.
Don't Think.
Drive.
Kill.
Get drunk a lot.
And work 40 hours a week. Spend half your time.
Hung over, sick and weak. Make sure to tell yourself that this is cool.
And make sure to tell yourself that you have no choice.
And make sure to tell your friends that they drive you to it.
And that you can quit anytime that you want, anytime.
You can quit anytime that you want.
You can quit anytime.
You can quit anytime, anytime.
Drink.
Drink.
Drink.
Drink.
