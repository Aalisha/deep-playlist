He taps at my window
Willing that I let him in
I don't think I will though
My heart's taken, I won't tell him again

Maybe I'll write him a story and
Maybe I'll fall asleep in his arms
Maybe I'll wake up lonely
And fall unawake again

And until you calm me down, race around this town
Trying to find, oh, an emotion you cannot deny
...
