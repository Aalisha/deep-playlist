Put a hole in your soul
Make your blood run could

Put a hole in your soul
Nine millimeter homie
Make your blood run could
You diiiee
Gon' rest your eyes
You diiiee
Gon' test the fire

You don' fucked with the wrong one today
And you don't want it homie
Fuck what you're tryin to say
Your whole existence phony
Talkin so much shit you need'a mutherfuckin breathe mint
And when I hit you with that glock
You'll wonder where your breathe went
Always quick to take the dick up out'cha mouth to jack your jaw
Guess you're pissed ya baby bitch would take the time to jack me off
But nuttin like what she would be with you, du'
She swallowed it
Now you wanna give me attitude
Bitch, eat a hollowtip
Take your own advice and put the barrel in your own mouth
Kill your handicap and blow your mutherfuckin brains out
Do the world a favor, hoe, and try to fix a big mistake
Pull the trigger, send your soul to Hell for fuckin Heaven's sake

Pull the heater on ya
Put a hole in your soul
Nine millimeter homie
Make your blood run could
You diiiee
