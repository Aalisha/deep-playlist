Kill for glory...
Twisted needs for exaltation
No one knows, but blood may flow
When the game is over it will show
Wrath of pain
Fury striking from behind
Now to show, that blood will flow
But the game ain't over 'cause there are more
Kill for glory and take control!

Shedding blood instead of tears
Praying to God for glory to appear
Fearless
Without regret
The hunt goes on

Kill for glory...
Sweeping breeze of satisfaction
...
