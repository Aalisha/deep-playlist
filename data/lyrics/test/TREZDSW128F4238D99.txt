I am only nothing, I am only this
I am just a man with his two fists
You have asked forgiveness
You have asked respect
Only something that you did forget

All you gave you had planned to take
Beat upon me but I won't break
Stripping everything from me? No!

Will to me your anger, will to me your rage
Will to me your lies, your sufferings
Not a man of virtue, not even a man
