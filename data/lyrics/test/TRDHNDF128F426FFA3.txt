let me tell you 'bout
a thing that happened, right
i wasn't myself last night
i called up my first love
it must have been ten years since we last spoke
i said: hi, how are you? 
what have you been up to 
since you cut my heart out? 
is it there somewhere? 
does it fit in there? 
in your nice apartment
i just want my heart back
