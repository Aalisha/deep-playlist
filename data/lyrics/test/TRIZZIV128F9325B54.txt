Welcome to the world, welcome to the world

You got your popstar, I'll be your rockstar
When it´s a suicide, you call it superstar
Check out the forecast,
Predictions wont stop
You get your fifteen, and
Then they take the spot

Let's go, let's go
And then you´re ready to go
Let's go, let's go
Cause it´s the end of the show
Let's go, let's go
So just get ready to go
Let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go

All the time that you were gone,
I thought about how things went wrong
Now you´re coming down to earth
Ok, hello, welcome to the world

She saw the bright lights
She caught the fever
