I'd like to say, that I was on your mind
So I phone you at ten past three, in the afternoon
It's evening for you, and another bare hotel room
So hard to believe, that you're dreaming of me too
But it's true

You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
You only go around, round, round
