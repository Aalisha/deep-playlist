I look in your eyes and I can see
We've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone

You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start

But I believe that we've only just begun

When it's this good, there's no saying no
I want you so, I'm ready to go

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
