Don't leave
I want you to stay home
Why can't you save her?
Why won't you show her the book?
Choose time for you, but never for her
You want her to live but she was gone
The day that she had her
Why won't you turn back the sky page?
Why won't you show her the book?
You choose time for you but never for her
You weren't even there when she was born
