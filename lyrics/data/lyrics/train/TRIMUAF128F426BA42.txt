Darling this is my desire set your little old heart on fire
Do the things that lovers always do
So put your little hand in mine I buy you diamond ring so fine
Then I'll build a bungalow for two
Closer a little closer well there ain't no use to stay so far away
So darling turn on all your charms while I hold you in my arms
