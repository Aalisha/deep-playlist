No Right Angles

ive been thinking 'bout the straight and narrow
slip sliding round the back of my hand
keep turning and its almost tomorrow
ill find a way to make you understand
there are no right angles in my life
no right angles in my life

right now im hearing nothing but silence
high beams are on - i can feel you
every piece contains a little bit of violence
and you've changed so much but its still you
no right angles in my life
no right angles in my life
