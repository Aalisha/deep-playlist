It's harder than you think
To get through the things clear
I wonder, you're my brother?
Thoughts easy disappear
This weight, this heavy stone
The voices on the phone
"I know that you'll make it
You have nothing to fear"

You can tell your soul, I will not let go
And you can bring it all back home
And shine your light through the hearts of stone

So please let me try
Get me through to your love
And please let me sigh
You know I've tried
But I never find my feelings for you
So please let me try
...
