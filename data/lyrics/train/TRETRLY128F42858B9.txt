We shared a bed but never touched
Next time we compensated in a rush.
We're showing no signs of fatigue
I've got a friend to act as a go-between.

There's a distant draw to your delivery

And when I'm dry you resuscitate me

This bed's too tight
I stepped upon your records in the night.
Put on your favorite skirt
I've got a plan that will never work.

This isn't the first time but it still feels innocent
