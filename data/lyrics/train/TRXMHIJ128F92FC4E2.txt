I am the doorway, access denied
I stand erect where the worlds collide
I am the doorway, the gate of gates
The passage where all lives meet their fate

In my shadow-kingdom
You may rise to stardom
Might seem all so random
Enter, it's your destiny
Possibilities arise
I offer you a paradise
Just a simple sacrifice
Human flesh will serve as key

I am all like the pestilence
So contagious, so immense
Vaporizing your last defence: I lure you in

A doorway, a path towards silent darkness
...
