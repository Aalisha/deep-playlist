Dancing in the living room, cutting up a rug
Dancing with the baby looks more like a hug
Living in a house made of sawmill wood
Rollover Beethoven never sounded so good

Chorus:
So come on baby, baby let's go
Where we get the money honey I don't know
But one more baby's alright by me
We'll just add another limb to the family tree

Well raising up babies is our new sport
You're one day late and I'm a dollar short
Now maybe it was planned and maybe it was a goof
...
