On the run from 
Suicide 
Love breeches 
Temptation 
On the edge boy 
What's inside 
You better look 
You better run and hide 
Storms coming 
A hurricane 
Tear the roof from the 
The foundation 
Crystal ball smashed again 
It's all there in the balance 
Hanging 

Wrong time to not regret your actions 
These are dangerous roads that we travel tonight 
I'm tuning into you your eyes are faintly glowing 
Can't you see the truth my mind is deeper than life 
...
