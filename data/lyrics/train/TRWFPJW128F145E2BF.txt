The old covent garden
I remeber only too well

The girl's a fool
She broke the rule
She hurt him hard
This time you will break down
She's lost his trust
And so she must
All is lost
The system has broke down

Romance has broke down
This boy is crack'in up
This boy has broke down

She plays it hard
She plays it tough
But thats enough
...
