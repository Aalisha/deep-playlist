Every morning when I rise, baby
I look into your sexy eyes, baby
Your love refreshing is good to me, baby
There's no other place I'd rather be, baby

What a way to start each day
Everything I think of
Just comes my way
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

(CHORUS)
Cause you're my joy
You're everything to me
And you've shown me
How groovy life can be
Lips to lips, heart to heart
