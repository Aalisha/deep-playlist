On the road in a thunderstorm with a load that's overdue
Drivin' on in the drivin' rain till I get back home to you
This west coast time is just a bit too fast for me
But I'll be fine when I'm back in Tennessee

CHORUS:
'Cause when we're together love's so strong
I feel I could take the whole world on
If it's gonna rain I don't care
I can take the pain if you're there
...
