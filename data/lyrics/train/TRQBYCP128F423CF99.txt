I've met my past
And my shadow just followed me home
He screamed at the sun
The piercing light would undo him

True wanderer
Only thrive when you're inside
Behold the transformation

I've struck a nerve here
I'm caught adrift on a lonely breeze
Unable to swim ashore
Boundless thoughts will carry you

Daylight glints through every seem
And paints upon my skin
Sunburn â€“ burn me

Between the lifeless and senseless
Between these gray mountain peaks
...
