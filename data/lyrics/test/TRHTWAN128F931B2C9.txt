It took a long time to find this place*
It took a long time to see HAPPY
It took a long time to recognize your face
It took a long time running around
It took a long time to find this place
It took a long time to see HAPPY
It took a long time to recognize your face
It took a long time running around
Nothing good COMES easy
Nothing makes it past
