I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
Said I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I'm gonna rip you off.

Well, I made my first kill
With the old town girl
She was the apple of her daddy's eye
Well, that woman looked up at me
And I said, "Honey we'll be
Together 'til the day I die"
But I lied.

I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
I'm a bad, bad boy
And I'm gonna steal your love
Come take me to your house
Then I'm gonna rip you off.

There seems to be no end
Of women who are lookin' for a man
