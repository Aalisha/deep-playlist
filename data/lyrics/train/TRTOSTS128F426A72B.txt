Baby, we've been through a lot and times sure I have changed
Everybody's leavin' town, lookin' for better things
But I found what I want and I got no problem workin'
I wish to God that my heart would stop hurtin'

But the shops closing down, factories outdated
People so frustrated and my whole life is changin'
Just tryin' to find some solid ground
A little house with a picket fence, how's that sound?

Love is all I need
Love is all I need

I've seen tears that are fallin' like leaves from the trees
Houses boarded up and they threw away the keys
But this town is where we're born and this town is where we're stayin'
...
