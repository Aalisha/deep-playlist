Kick start your heart
Just like an engine, battered and over-used
Are we really ready?
I don't think it's any use
If you think it feels close to you, angel
There's nothing left to lose

Please, believe in what I have to say
The symptoms that you have are, so lost
Your wires are crossed
Are you leaving?
