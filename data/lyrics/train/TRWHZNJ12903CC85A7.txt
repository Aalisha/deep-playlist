Well things are mounting up
It's counting down set to blow.
It's no use pretending
See the blue sparks the final mode. Oh.

Countdown to explode
System overload.

Countdown to explode
System overload.

Atomic schemes in the bloodstreams they bankroll
Apologies to the dreams that have all been undersold.
