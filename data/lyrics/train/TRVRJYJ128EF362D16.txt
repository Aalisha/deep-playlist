Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Oh, how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods
Woody woodpecker would if he could

But I didn't want to pass it up
To the next man had my walkman bumpin' on
The fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a kill thriller driller tiller out with the miller brew

Filler up, took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
([unverified])
Luke skywalker ain't a sweet talker so I got ill
With my light saber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst

The night felt good but the day got worse
I thought I was alone slim trade the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school sayin', "Ooh" and I'm busted for real

Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit

What to say the least
I'm so slick that they need to call me grease
'Cuz I slips and I slides when I rides on the beast
Imani and your mom sittin' in a tree, K I S S I N G
