Maybe deep down inside, you don't believe it
Your wailing wall, it isn't weeping at all
And you're not worthy of adoration
You're scared that somebody somewhere's gonna find
the burst pipe
And as fast as they bow down they'll leave you behind

But baby be brave cause what's the point of it all
What's the point of it all yeah
Baby don't blow it, tell me what's it all for
If you're not terrified to fail
Are you terrified to fail?

Way far down below you don't feel it
Yeah everyone knows but we don't believe it
...
