A written guaranty
No, don't need it. well, might need it yeah
A home in germany
No, don't need it. Well, might need it yeah
A perfect forgery
No, don't need it. well, might need it yeah
A colored history
No, don't need it. well, might need it

Well I threw my flag in the wishing well
Paid my own way to show and tell
Climbed up high and I wish I'd fell
And I ended up in hell

She was alone
And I'd never thought about it if I had her on the phone
She was alone
I could cry out every day but it won't bring her home

She was alone
She was alone
