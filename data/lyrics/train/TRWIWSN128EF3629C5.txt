I said a pilot, a pilot - i said a pilot the dune
I said a pilot, a pilot - i said a pilot the dune

You bet a lot i'll bet all see you
You always wanted to be

To see your life i'll bet you'll see so
You always wanted to see

To take your life i'll take mine say so
You look at me and bleed my baby
