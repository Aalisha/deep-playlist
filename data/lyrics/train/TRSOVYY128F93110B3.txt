I have always been the type to think before I speak
I have always been the type to look before I leap
And like a bolt out of the blue I was struck and there was you
For a moment I believed that I could let go

You lift me up into the sky
Felt like I could fly
Never gonna die
N' I almost made it but not quite
Now you're flying out of sight
And you know I can't come with you
I'll always be scared of heights
Always be scared of heights
