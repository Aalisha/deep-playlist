My love is full of pleasure
Falling rain
To cool my aching face
Lord, she cools me with here fine
And gentle ways

Her eyes so dark and gentle
As they wake
And greet the new day born
Lord, she leads me through her close
And natural dawn

Pleasure, my pleasure is there
Pleasure, my pleasure is there
...
