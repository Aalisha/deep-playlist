In a dark and smokey room
A shade of webs that leads you to
A tattered stage thats worn and gray
Another gorl sweats for another day's wage

Oh under a silver moon
She leaves her thoughts behind
Yesterday's long gone cold
The hourglass of time
Lays heavy on her mind

Child, blessed with a smile
Shivers like a snake, the way she moves
Wild, oh so wild
...
