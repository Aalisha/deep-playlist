It happens that someone knocks at my door
Then the whole house starts to shake
So that it gets really hard to stand up
And even worse to walk
I usually fall down
On the floor
And i stay there
Until that someone decides to leave
And the house calms down
And i look through the curtains
To see if he would regret
To see if he would try again

It happens that someone calls me on the phone
And my house gets so scared
That it jumps right up into my throat
I swallow like crazy
Hoping my heart will glide
Back down
So i can talk to that someone
Maybe talk to a friend
But it is too late
...
