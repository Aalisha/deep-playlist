(New Radicals cover)

Wake up kids
We've got the dreamers disease
Age fourteen
We got you down on your knees
So polite
You're busy still saying please

Frienemies
Who when you're down ain't your friend
Every night
We smash their mercedes-benz
First we run
And then we laugh till we cry

But when the night is falling
you can't find the light
If you feel your dreams are dying
Hold tight

You've got the music in you
Don't let go
You've got the music in you
One dance left
This world is gonna pull through
Don't give up
...
