If I lived and breathed before you loved me,
I don't recall.
If I walked around at all I was in bits and pieces,
Of a jagged heart.
You kissed me and every piece back into place,
Every pain got erased.
Held me up to the sunlight,
Now it feels like:


No one ever left me out in the rain,
Cold words that remained unspoken.
I never got lost, spent years in the dark,
Cuz you're here now my heart's unbroken.
When I see you smile, feel my soul again - I'm unbroken.
