[Intro:]
Say ohhh...
Say ohhh...

[Verse 1:]
Say ohhh,
Feel like I lost my Heart
Or misplaced my thoughts and, I don't Know
Where did it all go wrong
I just couldn't see it comin'
Say ohhh,
Baby it was all My fault
I forgot how to treat a Woman
I don't Know,
Why I was playing around
And all the while I was Losin'

[Pre-Chorus:]
The best girl in my Life, for sure (for sure)
Is about up and walk out that Door
Said, She won't play Number 2 anymore
Seems like the waters won't dry
And I don't know why...

[Chorus:]
So I'm telling her, I'm ready to work on Me
It's too late, She's gone, She's gone, She's gone
I'm telling her, I'm ready to meet her Needs
It's too late, She's gone, She's gone, She's gone
See, She decided to up and leave (up and leave)
Before I could give her my Apologies (give her my Apology)
Wish I could bring that Girl Back to Me
It's too late, She's gone, She's gone, She's gone
It's too late She's gone...

[Verse 2:]
