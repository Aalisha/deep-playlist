I thought those Days
Would help me face
The demons I had called
Tripping away
Only the pair of eyes
Would follow me

A loaded gun
I'm on the run
But I don't know where from
It feels irrationally right
But I am losing
Am I the one who could have done
Everything he was told
A thousand nights i've been awake
Now I am losing my ground and I fall

I am drowning again
See the fear in my eyes
Golden light and shades
...
