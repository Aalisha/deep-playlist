One more touch and then were leaving
When we move, the curtain falls
Yet our final destination is unknown
One more shelter then its over
One more day and love moves on
Yet a simple exaltation still shows, no

Dont want to face goodbye
Until tomorrow
Dont wanna look into the eyes of a day that fades

Dont want to face goodbye
...
