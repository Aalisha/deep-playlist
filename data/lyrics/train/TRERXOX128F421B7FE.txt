There was a shadow over heaven
On the day that I was born
They tried to bless me with holy water
But I was baptised in a storm... Oh yeahhh

I was raised with a crossbow aiming for something real
I sent out the arrow from behind my defense shield
Eternal dreamer so full of lite
A faithful believer soon I will arise

They tried to put me down
And it struck me hard
I used to turn the other cheek
Till they pushed me too far
Now I'm right on target
And my thoughts are clearer
Closer to balance as the end draws neare... Oh yeahh
