(Fernando Garibay, Shep Solomon)

I hear the words you speak it's clearer every time
The middle, the end, the sound of every line
But do they mean a thing when defenses are stoppin' you
From saying everything that I need you to?

Do you know what it's like when it kills, it's a crime
When the one that you want is only speaking in empty rhymes
'Cause I want you, want you, want you, I've fallen over you
So don't tell me, tell me, tell me the sun will see the moon
When I need ya, need ya, need ya you make me wait in line
Just be cool tonight, don't lie
