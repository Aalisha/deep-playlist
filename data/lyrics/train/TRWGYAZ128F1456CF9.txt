The prey of the beast
Screamed bloody murder
The line is so fine
Between hoping and hurting
Former believers they beg for release
As love looking down on them
Smiles and picks his teeth
Trapped in between heaven and hell
He knows all the secrets
And don't want to tell
There's nowhere to run
And there's nowhere to hide
Love knows you all too well
He will find you

Love is the ghost
Haunting your head
...
