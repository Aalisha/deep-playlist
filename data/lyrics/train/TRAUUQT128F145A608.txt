Well Prophet, it seems like you're in a bit of a jam
I hope you can unstick yourself
Oh, and what you did to my wife
It was nothing, I have others
The Saga Continues
It's been a while since I escaped the library
Fightin' ignorance every day, it's gettin' weary
When I think I got him, he pulls a slip on me
And there's so many soldiers in his fiendish ass army
One of the fiercest, is this nigga named Tricknology
The last time we met, he got the drop on me
Shit happens so fast he even got some of my family
Blasted my way up out the building when I catch him, I'ma kill him
Track him uptown, where I hear he's lyin' to children
1 2 5th's the stop, go outside I hear gunshots run up the block
Greedy Lou's dead in front of the materialistic crack spot
Trick's yellin' out, "This is my block"
I would've hit him, but I didn't have a clear shot
An innocent bystander might get popped
Damn, a small thang 'cause the Prophet still can't be stopped
What? That's right, this is my motherfuckin' life
Tricknology, you know what I'm sayin'?
