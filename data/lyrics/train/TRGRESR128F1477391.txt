Last train to Norwich, last train to Norwich
Last train to Norwich, last train to Norwich
Last train to Norwich, last train to Norwich
Last train to Norwich, last train to Norwich
Last train to Norwich, last train to Norwich
Last train to Norwich, last train to Norwich
Last train to Norwich, last train to Norwich
Last train to Norwich, last train to Norwich

Yea summer days that blind your face
Will soon be dead and gone
Better get it on
Tuned to a day the baby against the world, yea

You took the best seat will you risk it
When the chips were down
Better make it long
...
