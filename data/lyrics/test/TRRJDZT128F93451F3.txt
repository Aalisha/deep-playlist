It comes upon me slow and through my body flows
And so begins the twist within my soul
Like a shot in the dark you wrap around my heart
And I can't shake free from your hold on me

Here I go and all around me's twisting, twisting
I've no control, my head is spinning
Spinning round and round we go

Blame the stars above, my endless love
Only you excite, you ignite my soul
There's no relief this burning heat
Like the desert sands slipping through my hands
...
