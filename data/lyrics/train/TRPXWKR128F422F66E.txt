Born in filth, with no future in sight
Living of nothing
What chances for survival exists? Is this the way to live?
Death is a choice
Walk among zombies of everyday life
Each day is a war against starvation

Hail the god of transparent life
Hail the god that rules the weak
Hail the god, see through the waste
Hail the god, degradation is the way

Razor void crumbles inside
Curves flatter the spine
...
