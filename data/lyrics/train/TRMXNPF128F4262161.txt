I aint goin to work today yea why not? 'cause I'd rather work on breakin my own
Bones with some style ya know Go 45 M.P.H Go down hill on a skate there's a Code
That ya better know and there's one style & it's to skate We skate in packs our
Flag is Jaks there's always time to race only a fool has a pool and keeps it
