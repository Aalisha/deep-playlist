(Ice Cube)
Oh Yeah,
It ain't over motherfuckers...
Niggas don't understand...
Every few years,
Niggas got to get their motherfucking caps peeled back...
Nigga this is Westside nigga... dont think, nigga DONT THINK!
Now, next motherfuckers... go by the name of Cypress Hill
K all motherfucking day

(Ice Cube)
Every few years niggas think they can deal with the real
Now I gots to fuck Cypress Hill
I got a voice you should fear!
I drink a beer bust a rap and end your fucking career
You fuckin cowards
Never seen a hood high powered
Like the Westside Connect
Slide me my tech
I Got'em
Soon as I spot'em I'm dumpin
Gots to treat these bitch ass niggas like they stole something
I see a joint in your clutch
You're smokin that shit too much
Got your bitch ass touched
Sen Dogg you can't rap from the guts
And B-Real sounding like he got baby nuts
I don't know why y'all think y'all slick
I don't know what rapper down wit your click
I don't know one bitch on your dick
And I don't know one nigga pumping your shit
I hear you claiming South Central wait...
You ain't from my hood!
Y'all hoes from South Gate
Coming with a voice high pitched
The "B" in B-Real must stand for Bitch

(Mack 10)
We'll its the Hip-Hop junkie startin static
Now I'm rolling up Cypress Hill
letting niggas have it
Got these wannabe thugs up
Load my slugs up
Hey yo back up Cube Dogg we passed that bitch Muggs up
Pull over and let me out this show no sight
And let me show this White Boy
What that Westside Connect like
Boo Ya Boo Ya! from tha gauge as I spit them
Tha buck shots spray and made them lay as I hit'em (Uhhh)
