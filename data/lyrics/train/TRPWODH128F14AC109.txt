I've been really down trail up of brown
Well I feel just like Cathy's clown
I'm just a regular burn dog

I've been confused and contested
Misteated and rejected
Kicked around, shoved down, beat up
I said hang on baby, I've had enough

You got to wait a minute, wait a minute baby
Hold on, I can't take it no more

I like apple pie
I like Eskimo pie
