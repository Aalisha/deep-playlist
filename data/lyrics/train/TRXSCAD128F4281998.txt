Honey, lovin' you is the greatest thing
I get to be myself and I get to sing
I get to play at being irresponsible
I come home late and I love your soul
I never forget you in my prayers
I never have a bad thing to report

You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl and you don't even know it
I am livin' out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
And you're the funny little frog in my throat
