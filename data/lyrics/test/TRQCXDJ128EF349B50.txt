Found something crying, it was my soul
I fed it milk so it wouldn't grow old
We crossed the borderline at dawn
And woke up in a field of corn
The farmer told me I was late
I better start oiling the gate
Said that those who rush will fall
But I don't wanna wait for waves
I don't wanna wait at all

Oh, Annie, let's not wait
Let's cross the river now
We could sit for years
