See the boy on the corner,
He's only twelve years old.
Every night he's out there doin' his best,
To get his goodies sold.
Cause he's gotta feed his momma,
Gotta beat off a couple a dads.
They just come around,
When they feel like bangin' in the bag, yea...

Aww, that's life,
In Hollywood.
Where what's bad,
Just seemed to be good.
That's life,
In Hollywood.
I love the place,
Am I misunderstood?
