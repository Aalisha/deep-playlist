Runnin' around
I spend my whole life runnin' around
Settlin' down
I never dreamed I'd be settlin' down
But somethings comin' over me
Woman you got have a hold on me
And the reason just might be
You're so good to me... Aww

Somebody's doin' me right
Somebody's holdin' me tight
Sharin' my days and my nights
Somebody I really like
Just took a hold of my hand
You make me feel like a man
There's been a change in my life
Somebody's doin' me right
