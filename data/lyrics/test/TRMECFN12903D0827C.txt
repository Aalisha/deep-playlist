You are coming home, are you still alone?
Are you not the same as you used to be?
As the sun grows high and you serve your time
Does each day just feel like another lie?

Now you know, is it just for show?
Just a foolish game that you hide behind
Don't forget the nights when it all felt right
Are you not the same as you used to be?
Used to be
Used to be
