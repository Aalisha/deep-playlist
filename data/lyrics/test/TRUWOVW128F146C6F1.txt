Oh peace and seizing it,
Am i still breathing it?
Oh peace receiving it,
You thought of me when you were bleeding it,
The signs and the sums,
Have left me dumb,
And now I'm just hearing it.

No self respect,
But have a good time,
No self respect.
No self respect,
Yeah, but have a good time,
No self respect.
