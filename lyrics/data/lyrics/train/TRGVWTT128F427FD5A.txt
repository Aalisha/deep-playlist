I'm the result of an
Ageless redemption
A body with a
Heartless convention
A face with a smile that's
Been shut down for years
Facing the facts of
My generation... cause
I'm a sinner, a winner
My blood is getting thinner
I might as well get another life
Cause I've been there
I know what's been said
And I know what's been done
Don't you tell me
I'm the only one, cause I.

I will be there looking for something
Coming straight out of nothing
Just killing time
Facing those walls so black, so vile
I really am waiting for nothing
