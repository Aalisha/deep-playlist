I feel so good I'm going to break somebody's hear tonight
I feel so good I'm going to take someone apart tonight
They put me in jil for my deviant ways
Two years, seven months and sixteen days
Now I'm back on the street in a purple haze

And I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I'm going to break somebody's heart tonight
I feel so good
I'm goning to make somebody's day tonight
I feel so good
I'm going to make somebody pay tonight
