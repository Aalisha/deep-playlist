In a mirror of you,
reflections of you,
you're showing what you
Feel like inside,
Need the power of two,
just me and you
An image that you hold in your mind.

Sometimes you're wrong
and then sometimes you're right,
You don't expect me to put up a fight.
I'm sick and tired of all of your lies
I'm sick and tired and I'm saying goodbye.
