Why can't we speak another language, one we all agree on?
Why when men look outside do they see houses
Instead of the fields they grew from?
We are constantly uprooted from them, making us tiresome and fearful
Can you get up right now, endeavor to free-fall
'Cause you can fall if you want to

It's just a matter of how far
You treasured our home town
But you've forgotten where you are
And it will stay with you until your mind's been found

And it has been found wandering around
With that skipping rope, the trampoline

The crafty smoke that made us choke
But we didn't give up hope
It's the simple ways of getting paid
The carelessness of running away
And I wish I stayed
...
