That foreign (That foreign)
That Foreign (That Foreign)
That Foreign!

Colombiano yeah! I love that
I love her if she speak another language
She be doing things I never seen
I think I might have hit it in my dreams
She drop it, then she throw it, yeah she work it
I seen your Instagram but you look better up in person
I think her booty fake, she say it's real though
She back it up and let me get my feel on

She only been here for two weeks (been here for two weeks)
Came with the girls and they tryna leave with me (tryna leave with me)
She workin' hard like she tryna get a visa (get a visa)
The way she twerk it I just might pull out my Visa (pull out my visa)

After we leave girl, you know where you going
Straight to the 'tel, you ain't leaving 'till the morning
Same old thing, yeah you know that shit's boring (that shit's boring)
American you know I had to cop that foreign (cop that foreign)
American you know I had to cop that foreign
