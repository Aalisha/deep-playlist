You make many promises, and they sound so sweet
Talk like yours will knock most any girl right off her feet
When will you deliver, words can't warm my night
Conversation's nice, but I need a man to hold me tight

Some days you just don't have to say it, say it, say it, say it, say it
'Cause sometimes words get in the way
So don't give me your lines

I want action
Oh, so tough
Action
If you really want my love

Like the way you think, the way you speak your mind
You want to get together, well, that suits me just fine
You call me up to tell me the things you'd like to do
You and I got time for love, but never follow through

You set me up, oh, so tough, so tough, so tough, so tough
Now I'm cravin' your love
It's time to show your head

I want to see action
Show me the real deal face to face, oh
Action
Got to know if you can keep up the pace
