Sit down
Give me your hand
I'm gonna tell you the future
I see you
Living happily
With somebody who really suits you
Someone like me

Stand still
Breathe in
Are you listening?

You don't know
Somebody's aching
Keeping it all in
Somebody won't let go
Of his heart
But the truth is
It's painless
Letting your love show

Break down
Give me some time
