The traffic has gone quiet
Just the finger-tip drumming
Of the last train on the hill
Now only I can hear it coming

And the moon is way up high
Like a giant map-maker
She paints the windows of our house
With a yellow highlighter

And a voice says This Is London
And I wait and count the beats
And the night fills up the valley
And the cleaners clean the streets

And the words bounce off the satellites
And they fall back down to earth
Across miles and miles of ocean
To the city of my birth
