[Opio]
My nigga P. Cubano, hail from Santiago
He said pass me that bottle of rum, we make mojitos
And puff some Monte Cristos while we listen to James Brown
"King Heroin" pumpin out the JVC now
As I sip my drink, begin to think about where I'm at
Tip the ashes off my cigar, and start to trip on trap
doors that await me, but lately, my Spidey Sense
been tinglin, fingerin out the snakes
See I move with experience, choose and select
Smoke with no filter, hickeys on my neck
Scratches on my back from rough sex but what's next
Goin through my cycles of 7 I retrospect
Remember when it first hit me, me Phest' and Kenny
Pushin down Ocean Boulevard in a renty
Ha ha, it's a brand new year, hear me?
And I'm about to get mine the harder way
