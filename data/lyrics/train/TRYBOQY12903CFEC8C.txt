Petrified
In sleep paralysis
Swallowed by
Nigtmare cataclysms

Cohorror builds its temple in me
Erecting hydric elevation
Under my cafaleptic skin

Even in this gruesome revelation
The bottom drops from abyssal unreallity

Wrenching revulsion
Cracks my skull, kills me again
I know this epiphany
Wearing my own face
