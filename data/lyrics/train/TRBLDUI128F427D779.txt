Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby
Dance with me
Come on dance with me, baby

I want you-and you want me
So why don't we-
Get together after the dance
What a Freak!

When I first saw Miss. Fine
Lookin' good on the Soul Train
So good
I cannot get you sharp and right
You was dancin' good-spinnin' everywhere
