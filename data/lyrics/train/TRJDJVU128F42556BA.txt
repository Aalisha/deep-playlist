When I woke you were gone
The room was empty
But the light was left on

YouÂ've got to let me know
The places that you go
Darling, if itÂ's going to be
This thing, yeah baby you and me.

YouÂ've gotta tell me
Where do you go
Where do you go
You got to tell me
Where do you go
You gotta tell me
Where do you go
