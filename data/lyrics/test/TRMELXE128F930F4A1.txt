The Hollies
I'm Talking About You
(Chuck Berry)
Track 1 on album 'Stay With The Hollies' January 1964

Let me tell you about a girl I know
I met her walking down Lowtown Street.
Well, she's so fine
Well, I wish she were mine.
I get shook up everytime we meet.

I'm talking about you.
Nobody but you.
