The drugs they say
To make us feel so hollow
We love in vain
Narcissistic and so shallow
The cops and queers

To swim you have to swallow
Hate today

There's no love for tomorrow
We're all stars now in the dope show
We're all stars now in the dope show
There's lots of pretty, pretty ones

That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones

Will leave you low
And blow your mind
...
