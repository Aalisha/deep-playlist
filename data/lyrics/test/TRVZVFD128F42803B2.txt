There's no-one to call from a country town
It's not a bad thing
I don't have anyone lovely to call
And it's not a bad thing 

I'm not doing the dirty, breaking a vow
I'm not a tomcat doing the rounds
And if I were there'd be no-one to complain 

There's no-one worrying at home
Ringing to see if I'll answer the phone
Happy if after the show I'm alone 

...
