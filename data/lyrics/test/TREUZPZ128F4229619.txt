I remember when we were young
Things were easy, we had such fun
And I know what we talked about
But let's hope that they don't find out

Cos everybody wants me
Everybody wants me
Everybody wants me now

Everybody wants me now

But I just want you
I just want you
I just want you
I just want you

Take your mind back to rainy days
We stayed inside and played those games
