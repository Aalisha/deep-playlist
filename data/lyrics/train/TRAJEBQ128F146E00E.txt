Go glam the Conqueror Worm
Defender of the American way
A friend to the weak, the smug, the huddled thugs...

A waste of money, it's sad but true
but in the morning it'll feel all right
chart a course with magnetic strips for our broken hearts

Weare screaming towing the line
and disposible by desgign.

So get lovely lovely lovely my girl
I don't wanna be the one to tell you 
the luckiest luckiest luckiest world
is the on between your eyes
imagine-magine if we we were thin
...
