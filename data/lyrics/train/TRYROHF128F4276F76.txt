There's a little black dark scar tired divide
This is it, can you hear me?
Have you ever felt a sad heart buried alive?
You can do almost anything
There's a little red bridge with the view of the sun
With a lake, recommend such a setting site
And the thousands of stars, come out thousands of times
We can go, only if you believe
Only if you believe

Do you feel like you've lost everything you can lose?
This is it, can you hear me?
When you cry do your tears ever chill up the room?
Calling out in a moment of need
Do you ever lay awake with the look in the eye?
Asking God if a wish is too big to deny?
I will offer a line, and it's ready for use
Let me know, are you ready for me?

I'd like to say
That you're my only fear
And when I dream
It slowly disappears
And when I wake
I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart
...
