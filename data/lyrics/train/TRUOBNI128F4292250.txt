It's just another old Sunday
A few more hours 'til it's Monday
The weekend's almost over
I feel myself gettin' older

It's becomin' more and more apparent
I'm turnin' out like my parents
I hate goin' to bed early

But I gotta go work for a man
Who doesn't know my name
Makes me wear a uniform
So everybody looks the same
But I can't be late
I've got those credit card bills I gotta pay

Hey, hey, hey
I'm gonna be happy someday
I said, hey, hey, hey
I'm gonna be happy someday

Then finally it's Friday
...
