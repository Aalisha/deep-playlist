Make no promises to me
you're slowly melting
wake up then fall back asleep
you're quickly fading
hey man you'll have to wait your turn
i can see that you're jonesing
taste no flavors on my tongue
they've evaporated
Why you gotta bring me down
why you gotta bring me
bring me down
Charma comes around two times
so you better be good
watch out for unfamiliar signs
when you're going the wrong way
