Eggsy
I seen that film, American Pie
Where a bloke fucked a fruit, so I gave it a try
My technique was slightly off-key
It involved tinned meat and a pop celebrity
I wouldn't? her if I saw her on the street
But I wanna make a statue just of Kelly for me
You know, it all started way back when
Using spam to cap? Boys II Men
I used bacon to make Rusty Lee
Kelly Osbourne, you're my meat fantasy
You're always there when I need to talk
And I love the way your fingers and your toes are made (from pork)
All
I made a corned beef Kelly Osbourne,
And I fucked it when I was watching porn
I made a corned beef Kelly Osbourne,
And I fucked it when I was watching porn
Maggot
Minimum content, 3% meat
I trimmed the fat off, it looked really neat
Made the torso and shaped the thighs
But I'm stuck, I've got nothing for the eyes
Billy
Fluid dripping like a running tap
When I warm my meat up and rub it on the lap
Xain
Making bacon with reformed ham
People pay money for this in Amsterdam
Mysty
Meat fantasies often give me the horn,
But nothing like a corned beef Kelly Osbourne
You're divine, so sexy, so tasty
Like meat in a pie when I penetrate the pastry
