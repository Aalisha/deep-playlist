[ *this song is styled after Ice-T's '6 'N The Morning'* ]

To all my hustler niggas
To all the muthafuckas out there that's rollin
You know what I'm talkin bout?
Fuckin with the birds...

Check this out
Bring me back a soda and I don't mean a Sprite
I need the armor hammer so my shit'll bounce right
I was cookin dope, bringin back full moons
Fuck till November, I be gone till June
Summer ain't shit if you ain't got the coke
Flipped a drop-top with the all-gold spokes
Oakland gettin money, nigga, fuck what you heard
Out of town niggas livin half a bird

What you fuckin with?
Tell em what you fuckin with
I'm pushin birds...

Seen my nigga in a Benz and he spin in a ditch
He be movin things for like 13.6
Try to tell his nigga how he hatin the game
Let's get them driver numbers, 18 a thing
Wanna-be niggas can't tell him shit
Two weeks pass, heard that nigga got hit
Found him in the hills with a dick in his mouth
Stupid muthafucka, game turned him out
