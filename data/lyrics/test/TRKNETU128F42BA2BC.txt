Lady, where do you feel this life is taking you?
Lady, what have your hopes and dreams transformed into?
Lady, you came away from home to an unown world 
Don't look back - don't look down

Lady, can you come against your destiny
Lady, you're reasoning with things you cannot see
Lady, you wanted to laugh at the days to come 
Don't look back - don't look down
