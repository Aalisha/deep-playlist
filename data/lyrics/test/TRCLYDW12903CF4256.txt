I think I just forgot
To pick up the shells
From my recent discharge
And you took the blame
Explanations falter
To ears fallen deaf
Wherever I go I get lost

A reference to something
That both of us knew
Nothing that favors the few
In the darkness electric we see
That silence has spoken tonight

I think I have lost my language
Whatever I've said I deny
I think I have lost my way
Whatever was missing is gone
