Young Moolah, baby

How did I let him come back?
How did I let him come back?

She wants ya, I need ya, please tell me to stay
She says that she loves ya like I love ya
But you know that it ain't the same
We had a fling, this I know
But now we got a thing, she gotta let you go

'Cause now I'm actin' crazy
I'm out here callin' you, baby
I shouldn't have let you hit that
'Cause now I can't forget that

I thought I wouldn't really give a fuck
But now a bitch all in love
Don't mean to be a hater but ooh, shit, damn

You're so good, so good, so good, so good
You're so good, so good, so ooh, shit, damn
So good, so good, so good, so good
