Stay with me
Here with me
Right in this instant
Not in the distance
When your headis
Off in future time
That’s the place when things get out of line
Taking in this moment,
Your time is so well spent

It’s alright
Wherever you are right now,
I tell you it’s alright
That’s where you’re supposed to be now
