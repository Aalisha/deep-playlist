It's been so long
since I touched a lady
and I'm still waiting
for you to come back to me
now will you forgive me
for the wrong I've done
and let's try again
to make it last so long
chorus:

I'm still waiting
for you to come back to love
to fulfill this life
we're dreaming of
so don't wait
another day might be too long
don't rush
go slow so nothing goes wrong

listen baby
I can't wait
...
