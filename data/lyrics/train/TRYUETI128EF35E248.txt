Was it rage or regret
Or the love I was feeling
In this age - who's perfect... are you?
Wasn't made to forget
This moment worth stealing
Was it rage or regret or the two
Every morning when I wake up
Wake up dreaming then... wake up dreaming
Build a temple from you fragrance
Build a chapel in your heart
Do you really understand
Do you feel the need to try
Do you even care for me
Do you ever wonder why
