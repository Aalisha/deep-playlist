The eastern world, it is explodin?
Violence flarin? and bullets loadin?
You? re old enough to kill, but not for votin?
And that Jordan River has bodies floatin?

But you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don? t believe
We? re on the eve of destruction

Don? t you understand what I? m tryin? to say
Can? t you feel the fears that I? m feelin? today?
If the button is pushed there? s no runnin? away
There? ll be no one to save with the world in a grave
Take a look around ya boy, it's bound to scare ya boy

But you tell me
Over and over and over again, my friend
You don? t believe
We? re on the eve of destruction
