Where's the love we had?
When did it go bad or am I just insecure?
I give all I can, baby, I'm your man
Tell me what we're in this for, remind me

I can't go on, I know not what to do
My heart is worn, I feel as if I'm through
Please believe in me 'cause what I need
Is for you to believe in me

Countless sleepless nights, never ending fights
...
