There's this guy in this place and he looks me in the face
And he tells me 'bout this girl that took him home
And there's this girl and she says that she's never been with him
And she tells me things that I don't wanna know

There's a warning inside going off in my mind
You won't get me this time to forget about it

I know there's better things to talk about
And I believe that you're looking for so mis-romance
And I say that you don't know what you're talkin' 'bout
Well I can see so just pass is on to someone else
And say "It's just the talk of the town"

Week goes by and I ran into the guy
And he says that he heard I was with his girl
