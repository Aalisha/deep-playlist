Your house of cards is tumbling all around you
With its feet of clay
And you pretend that it doesn't matter
And that you're not scared

Oh, here comes that day
Oh, here comes the rain on your parade
There's a price to pay
For a life of insincerity

Always smiling, never with a frown on
A mask of hidden tears
Have the courage to say what you mean now
And mean what you say
...
