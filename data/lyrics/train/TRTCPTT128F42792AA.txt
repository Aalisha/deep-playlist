I've met so many people who look the same
Most were forgotten but you still remain
Most of the time, I don't care
But London's so far away when you are there.
And so it saddens me to say
I'm only happy when I move away

I am young and I am lost
Every sentence has its cost
I am young and I am lost
You react to my riposte

And we look out upon the sea

We look out upon the sea
The coast is always changing
I'll bring my camera out to sea
The coast is always changing

Age makes no difference 'til you open your mouth
...
