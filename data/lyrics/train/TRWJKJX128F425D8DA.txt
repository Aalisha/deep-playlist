I saw that warning sign
But I paid no mind
I just kept on
Rolling on

I saw that warning sign
But I had no time
I was
Headin' for your arms

I saw that warning sign
But I just went blind
Never read a word
That it said

Woe is me
Drivin' down this dead-end street
I must be out of my head

Danger, heartbreak ahead
...
