He had her down in the cellar with a knife pointing at her throat
He wouldn't let her go oh no, he wouldn't let her go
She kicked and screamed
Someone heard through the walls from next door
'What's the crack? what's the score?'
Next door neighbour gave a call
No one answered, so the boys are coming
The boys are coming for you

They'll take you on a holiday
Maybe to the seaside, maybe they'll just give you away
