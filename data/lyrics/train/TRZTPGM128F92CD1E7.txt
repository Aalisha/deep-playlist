5 SECONDS OF SUMMER
WATCH NOW
5 Seconds Of Summer - Wherever You Areâ€¦
For a while we pretended
That we never had to end it
But we knew we'd have to say goodbye
You were crying at the airport
When they finally closed the plane door
I could barely hold it all inside

Torn in two
And I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of you
Wherever you are
You
Wherever you are
Everynight I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
...
