Well, I was up all night well wonderin' what to do,
Thinkin' that I oughta just forget about you,
But it's a little too late;
Well, it's a little too late.
When you walked in I shoulda walked out.
Well, it's a little too late to do the right thing now.

Well, the whole town told me you're a heart break king;
Guess I oughta pay attention when they say those things.
Well, it's a little too late.
Well, it's a little too late.
