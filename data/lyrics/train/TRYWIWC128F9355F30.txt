You see the flashy lights, it's like a movie scene
Them stunna shades got you lookin' like a beauty queen
Without a throne, American but international

She got her hair done, styled in designer jeans
Heels on and her skin type Maybelline, I can't control
The way you walkin' girl, you got me gone

When I see her my mind goes to places
I just can't focus when she's on the stage
It's the way she switches her hips with her body
Just proves she's truly the life of the party now

Look at her she got it, shawty knows she's the shit
You can tell by the look in her eyes, she's like the devil in disguise
