I saw you and fell in love
You saw me and fell in love too
You and me
We fell in love with each other Last night
I told you that I was concerned
You told me of your concerns too
Yet and still we both decided to make love last night
Baby please, tell me
Where do we go from here, my love
What are we doin baby
Boy you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just got to let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we chose
