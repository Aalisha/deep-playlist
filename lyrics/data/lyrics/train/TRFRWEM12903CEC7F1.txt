Awaken on through deserts wasted
As emplaged eternity has passed
Blowing winds of scorching twilight
Spiritual scourge on me is divine

Worm soul blasphemous dissent
Extensions of primitive maledictions
Treachery of holy scriptures
I became spawned again

Serpents redeemed, mundane rebirth
Embraced by thorns, decayed angels fall
Decayed angels fall
...
