Some people got no style
I guess you've fooled them for a while
But now you're running out of luck, my friend

You need to know what you're doing
And exactly who you're fooling
Or it hits you right back in the head

All that tough talk
You'll have to eat those words in the end
Watch your step, kid
You might just need those legs again

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars

There you go again, a phony to the end
But you're not gonna get that far
Climbing those monkey bars
