Please don't turn me away, please don't leave me alone
Oh I'm not asking for paradise, I just got to find me a home

I said land-ho, will I be sailing forever
Oh-oh I gotta find some shelter from the cold
Land-ho, will I be searching forever
Oh-oh I gotta find an anchor for my soul

Well you may think I'm a fool, and think I'm running away
But I've had enough of the city lights, oh I've got no reason to stay
...
