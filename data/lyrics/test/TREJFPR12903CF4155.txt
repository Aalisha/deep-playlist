A weak boy beneath a blood-red devilmask
Crossing the line inflicting his mess
He's not a friend but I won't say it to his face
I will turn my back and find my own place
- No apologies in vain

Don't blame me - can't you see
- You're a clown in a circus of fools
You hate me and I hate you too until I'm six feet down
...
