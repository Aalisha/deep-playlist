Apathy
She just dosent know it yet

Chorus
I got a baby mama
I got a baby mama
I got a baby mama
She just dosent know it yet

I got a future wifey
I got a future wifey
I got a future wifey
She just dosent know it yet

I got a fuck buddy
I got a fuck buddy
I got a fuck buddy
She just dosent know it yet

I got an ex girl
I got an ex girl
I got an ex girl
She just don't know

Apathy
We could play some video games
Just for the fuck of it
Tattoo my name
You could always cover it
Remember when you snuck out
Regardless of the punishment
I know how mean ya mother get
I know how mean ya mother get
Play my shit for your friends
Now they all in love with it
I'm really down to Earth like I fell out of the mothership
Better turn that bass down before she say some other shit
I know how mean ya mother get
I know how mean ya mother get
Look
I don't mean to come off as crazy
But bitch Ima make you my lady
Listening to Jodeci lately
You're so fucking dope Ima fold you a note like "Hey will you date me?"

Chorus
I got a baby mama
I got a baby mama
