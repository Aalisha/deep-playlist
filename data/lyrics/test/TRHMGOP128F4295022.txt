Back about eighteen hundred and some
A Louisiana couple had a red-headed son
No name suited him, Jim, Jack or Joe
So they just called him Billy Bayou

Billy, Billy Bayou, watch where you go
If you're walkin' on quicksand, walk slow
Billy, Billy Bayou, watch what you say
A pretty girl'll get you one of these days

Billy was a boy, kinda big for his size
Red hair, freckles and big blue eyes
Thirteen years from the day he was born
