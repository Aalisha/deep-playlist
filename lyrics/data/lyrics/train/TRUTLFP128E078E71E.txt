Hey,
you know what I mean?

Sell a man (?) your religion
Say I walking down a hit song
A booming business
Buying, selling belief
Standing in the pews
Talking bullshit, bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit
I want to know, I want to know,
Can you feel the spirit of the lord?

[Ryder]
There's nothing more sinister
as ministers in dresses
Gather round some nice black people
While I deliver this message
Kill the message


you do nothing but socialise
and become a menace
put on your reeboks man
and go play funky tennis

can I get a witness
I said can, I get a witness

Oh come oh ye faithful
Oh joyful and triumphant
Gather around,
While I blow my own trumpet
...
