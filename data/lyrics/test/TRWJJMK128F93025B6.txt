Got a gig I'd like you to know, we're leaving here tonight
We're going just to sing our song and everything's all right
And we'll be missing you but that's for me to care
Gotta go, better tell you now, 'cause something's in the air
Don't care if I do it or die, that don't mean a thing
Yes indeed that's all we need â€“ so everybody, sing!
