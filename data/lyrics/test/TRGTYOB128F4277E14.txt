I'm a pilgrim like you
I was only passing through
You'll never know my name
You'll never walk in my shoes
I've been no use to my friends
I've been no use to myself
Now I'm looking for proof that I ain't someone else

I was too afraid to read the newspaper
Working in the basement of a skyscraper
That's why I roll and you'll never know my name
Oh no

I'm not here to feel the bones of some forgotten saint
I know who I am, and I know who you ain't
Spent fifteen days in solitary confinement
Digging a hole in the wall
There's no escape, they said you need realignment
...
