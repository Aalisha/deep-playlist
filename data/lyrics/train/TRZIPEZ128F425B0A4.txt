Oh, yes sir

I don't care if it comes in a bottle
I don't care if it comes in a can
I don't care if it's stirred or shaken
Man, could you give me one for both hands?

If it goes down easy
It makes you feel good
If it goes down easy
It makes you feel good

Sign on the wall said, 'No Dancin' On The Tables'
She never lets the rules get in her way, no she don't
She got the whole joint jumpin' and goin' crazy
She grabbed my hand and danced me right outta the place
Out of the place

If it goes down easy
It makes you feel good
If it goes down easy
It makes you feel good

Might be one of those fine French wines
