Love has truly been good to me
Not even one sad day
Or minute have I had
Since you've come my way

I hope you know, I'd gladly go
Anywhere you'd take me

It's so amazing to be loved
I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'd go

Got to tell you how you thrill me
I'm happy as I can be
You have come
And it's changed my whole world

Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
What a wonderful day

It's so amazing to be loved
