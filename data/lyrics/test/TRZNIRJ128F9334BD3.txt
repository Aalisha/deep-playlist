How can I find you, are you hiding or am I
Should I go or should I wait for a sign
Following your voice, walking through a desert night
And I see your silent storm in the sky

And I stand in my emotion
And I let it be my own
And I know I'm not forsaken
And I'll never be alone

When I fall, when I fall
I know where I'll be landing
When I fall, when I fall
You will still be standing
