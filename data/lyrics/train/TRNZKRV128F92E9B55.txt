I let my head touch my hands and it's right on me yeah
I touched the night now it's gone, felt it right on me yeah

I'm running hard and the dust, now it's right on me yeah
I'm writing blind and these words they're all over me yeah

Oh Oh Oh Oh lost them in the forest
Oh Oh Oh Oh dawn is almost on us
Oh Oh Oh Oh spell is gettin stronger
Oh Oh Oh Oh

Coz my mama said my daddy was wishin at the wishin tree
Down the well is nothing but wet
And it's all in my head
Hear what I heard
If I'm in a dream I don't care

Hot on you
I'm thinkin of your style
I know that spell you been weaving (You)
You give me what I want
That kind of thing you make me feelin
So right (So right)
Feels good (Feels good)
