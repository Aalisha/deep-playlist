This rush inside me
Do you feel it too
shivers up my spine
makes me feel like new

so come with me
and i'll take you to
that secret place to hide
i'll show you just what to do
and i know
i see it in your eyes
we can take the night
and make it last forever (make it last forever)

Open up your arms
let you fall in
give me what you need
got the feeling
lurking on the love
just let it begin
make it last forever

Open up your arms
let you fall in
give me what you need
got the feeling
lurking on the love
just let it begin
spend the night together
