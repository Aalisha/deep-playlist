Follow me, I'll show you what I see
Some say we're waste of space, I think we've found our place
They're so concerned about the way we live
Struggle to make a buck, they point the finger at us

A lot has changed, today there is no shame
Who's gonna speak the truth as television lies to you?
And those of us who know what's going on
Hear you generalize, we try to rationalize, don't fucking criticize us

'Cause when the lights are low in your head
That's when we'll shine on you
And when you can't believe things can get worse
That's when we'll see you through
