Nine of diamonds, nine of diamonds
Lord, that's a lucky card.
We'll celebrate it, when we've made it,
I'll jump all over your yard,
I'll jump all over your yard, I'll jump all over...
I don't know what hit me but I'm seeing stars.
This comic book life is like being on mars.
Thousands of warm hands are touching me.
All over, all over, I hope this will never be all over.
