If I could block the moon and rob the sun from the sky
My love for you would still shine through me somehow
And If the rain won't fade away
My love would still soar

I love you... girl and I know it shows
I can't deny the joy I've found
And when I'm at my wits end
You say a word that gives me peace within

Queen of Sanity from sanity of sanity
My soul is what you've touched
I love... you
And I know it shows
How do you run this race and never lose your pace?
