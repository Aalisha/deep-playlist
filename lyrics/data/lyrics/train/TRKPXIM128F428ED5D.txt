I can't cry, I can't understand
Can't we give in or give up my plan?
And we were swimming in the water with no hands

And I will never quit the fight
I'll push the limits of our love
And every passing day and night
I'll push the limits of our love
And everything will be all right
I'll push the limits of our love
To see how far it goes, goes where nobody knows
