i'm not gonna lie down in that bed tonight
no, i'm not gonna lie down in that bed tonight
no, i'm not gonna lie down in that bed
let them covers clutch me and pull these thoughts out of my head

i'm not gonna feel so all alone tonight
no, i'm not gonna feel so all alone tonight
no, i'm not gonna feel so all alone
with that empty space beside me and the city just a drone out the window

i'm not gonna roll over tonight
