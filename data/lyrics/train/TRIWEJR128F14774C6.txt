Real cool

Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house
Brooklyn's in the house

Real cool, 'cause Brooklyn's cool
Friday doin' the last day of school
Girls steppin' to the mall to swing
Settin' up dollars for their summer fling

Cars on the avenue create gridlock
And there's girls like mad at the bus stop
Not waitin' on the bus but waitin' on the cash flow
Fellas are laughin', gassin' the past hoe

Girl steps to me and pushes issue
That knot you got, is that money or tissue?
Feelin' on the bulge, thinkin' it's her own
I tell her that it's money and she should move on

She says she's pure from legs to her thighs
And we should talk over some Chinese and fries
I tell her to step but hey, that's the scene
'Cause she ain't nothin' but the Brooklyn-Queen

We are looking for the Brooklyn
We are looking for the Brooklyn-Queens
We are looking for the Brooklyn
We are looking for the Brooklyn-Queens

State the rhyme, borough of Brooklyn
Otherwise known as Crooklyn
Freaks fortify flesh with gold
Ears hang trunk in a slave hold

Walk past, don't get the time of day
Played like a suede on a summer sway
Conversated till I made her laugh
Said, "I'm Pete Nice, you want my autograph?"

Oval Office closed as she heard this
She said, "From 3rd Bass? I could do this"
Listen closely, slowly took a swig of intoxicants
