Fromm the tallest mountain he watches
The serpent, the saviour, the eater of men
He who thrives on dead flesh

The phantom king hungrily awaits
The march of fallen souls
Rise from the ruins of your gods

Who will be guided by his song?
Who can prove where they belong?

I fear, certain death
From the ruins of pride, I am reborn
