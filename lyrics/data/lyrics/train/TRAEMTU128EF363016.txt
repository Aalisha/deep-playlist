It's so damp in here and I've lost all my reasons
It's so cold in here and now I'm shivering, shivering
It's so dark in here and I've lost all my direction
And I don't know quite where I stand anymore

But I will win through, though I think I need you now
I will overcome the pain that you put me through
Yes, I will survive, I will overcome the heartache
That you put me through
That you put me through
I will overcome it

I've lost all my senses, I can't see or feel the right way
And my vision is blurred and I have no balance left at all
And it's still so dark in here, I've got to find my lost direction
...
