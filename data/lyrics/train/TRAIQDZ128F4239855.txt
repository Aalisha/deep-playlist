Nice time of year, for a holiday
Such a pity you've no words to say
And your flying in on this thin imagination
Flying out with a brand new prescription

And I cant believe it looks just like the brochure
The other side of the world seems somehow closer
Yet he'll be bouncing off the hotel walls
And you'll be having no fun at all.
