Well Iâ€˜ve never seen this place 
but I've been here waiting for you
I've held onto your love forever
Tell me you wanted me to
Before I believe it's true
Before I believe it's true

Wait just a minute baby
Don't make a single move
Prop me up just a little longer
But if I fall, you fall too
Before I believe it's true
