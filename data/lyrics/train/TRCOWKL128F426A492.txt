I've got stars in my great big sky,
I shall gaze upon without leaving small ones behind
Because they're harder to find.
Some were satellites, others planes
Some were twinkling while others were fading away,
But they're all one of a kind.

It's not that interesting but I'd like to keep it a secret,
So I'll have something left to give.

It's not that difficult when you've got a luck of this kind.
We've got to take advantage, we've got such limited time.
I wonder, oh I wonder
