Don't you want my foolish heart?
Don't you wanna tear apart?
Or is it just a dream, or is it true, baby?

Baby, baby, come on, take my time
Wake up, darling, love is hard to find
Don't hurt me
You said, "Love is just for free"

Baby, I don't wanna cry no more
Oh, you're knocking on forbidden doors
Come hold me
You said, "Love is ecstasy"

Oh, baby, baby, can't you hear my lonely heartbeat
Oh, baby, baby, please be mine
