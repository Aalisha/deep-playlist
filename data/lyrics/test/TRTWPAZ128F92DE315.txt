(L. A. Martinee)
I've never know someone before
Who feels the way you do
All my dreams somehow became true with you
And i've never wanted someone more

Awaking in the night
And not having you by my side

And make a love that's everlasting
We'll be as one
I can see it in your eyes
When i looked at him
