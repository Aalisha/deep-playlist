VERSE: I
The devil, told me, that I,
, could not stand. All the sins and the darkness that
spreads throughout the land.
Just look at the dark and the sins,
who will be able to escape?
But the word of God showed swiftly to me saying God will make a way
VERSE: II
The Lord Said I Am The Way,
The Truth And The Life, You Must Not Doubt,
For There Is Nothing To Hard For Me,
I Will Work Things Out, Yes I Will,
But Now Is The Time To Show You That I,
I Am Still In Control. Then The Lord Said To Me Get
Your Eyes On What You Think You Might See And Put All Your Trust In Me
(DUET)
Grab A Hold, And Don't Let Go,
Hold On For One Life, Hallelujah!
Place Your Feet, On A Solid Foundation,
Hallelujah Set Your Eyes On Christ.
.For He's The One Who Deliver Jesus Is The One,
He Is The Giver And He Gives To Everyone His Peace.
He'll Give You Salvation, Yes He Will,
He'll Give You Salvation, Hope,
Joy And Peace And He Will Give You Hope And Peace
VERSE: I/CHORUS:
All You Have To Do Is Reach Out On Faith,
And Grab A Hold (Grab A Hold) And Don't Let Go
(Don't Let Go) You Got To Hold On (Hold On) Hold On For
