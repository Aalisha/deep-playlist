Cast into desolation
Uniform destruction of the pure
On wasted soil never to vegetate
On this lifeless planet of ash
Manipulation of their world
These helpless victims

Sirens of war soon fade
Silence of death now heard
By mutant survivors of this holocaust
A strange leprotic race
Dreaming of a different place
Manipulation Strain
Manipulation Strain!

To build once more from volcanic dust
A populace of deformities
A multitude of horrific defects
...
