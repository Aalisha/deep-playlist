Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff.
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff.
Goodbye Harry Braff, it's so good to see him win the race.
And the crowd, feeling proud to spend all day out there.
And getting a good view of Harry Braff, Harry Braff

Realise Harry Braff and the Mayor of Gordon cheers him on.
Ev'ry mile, see him smile with the dust in his eyes.
