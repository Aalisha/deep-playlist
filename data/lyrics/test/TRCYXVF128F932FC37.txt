You live in spite, you live in spite
You live in spite, you live in spite calloused heart
I am the bullet shot from your pistol
Pointed in the face of the ones i love
So i blame you tonight
For all the times that you broke me
And now it starts to bring me down
I can feel i'm losing ground
How long till i face you on my own calloused heart
Calloused heart
Calloused heart
You are my pistol, calloused heart
