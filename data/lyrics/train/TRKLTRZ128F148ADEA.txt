Worked all week, got it all done
Lets make a Tennessee River Run

Hey everybody I think the time is right
Lets get together down where the catfish bite
Cooped up all winter
Waiting on a day like this
It's the way I feel when I'm rockin on the water
Baby that I can't resist
Bar-B-Q grill, summer time jam
Just about a mile above the Pickwick Dam
Party on the water whole lotta fun
Time to make a Tennessee River Run

I'll get my bass boat, crank up your party barge
We'll drop these anchors out where the big boats are
Break out a cooler, pass out ice-cold beer
Look at all the people out here on the water
Man I can't believe we're here
