The gypsies know my future
The angels know my past
I roll around this big wide world
To find a love to last

I'm weary from my wandering
Lord I'm wounded in a war
I'll lay me low where the willows grow
Listen to that river song

River runs by my window
River runs by my door
River runs so sweet
Might never roam no more
...
