Hang all
The mistletoe
I'm gonna get
Yo know
You better, yeah
This Christmas
And as
We trim the tree
How much fun
It's gonna be
Together
Yeah, ha
This Christmas

Fireside
Is blazing bright
We're caroling
Through the night
And this Christmas
Will be, yeah
A very
Special Christmas
For me, yeah
Ooh, hey, ooh

Presents
And cards are here
My world is filled
With cheer and you
Oh, yeah
This Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine
The town, they do
This Christmas
Fireside
