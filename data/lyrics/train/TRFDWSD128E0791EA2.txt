Proud, proud is to hear it all yeah yeah
Proud ah proud, proud is to watch us fall yeah yeah
Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time
Make wishes, don't break mine

Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time
don't break mine, don't break mine

Cold fire used to inspire all not now
These are tired, maybe they'll find their niche
Or resort to wish

Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
Throw kisses all the time
Make wishes, don't break mine

Make a wish, make a succotash wish
You live the pompous life
