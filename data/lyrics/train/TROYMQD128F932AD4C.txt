Feel the fire

Oh yeah!

Feels too hot, too hot to trot
She said feel the fire

Hands are cold and a Devil's soul
She said feel the fire

I know it's a sin and I know it's the law
But she said feel the fire

Love is precious and love is blind
She said feel the fire

Watch the flames get higher
She's got me burning with desire

Feel the fire
