The first circle comes around
You don? t want to leave her side
You? re staying in and don? t go out
You? re having such a perfect time
You make your bed and you lie in it
And time is precious every minute

The next circle comes around
And so domestic you become
You're matching dressing gowns
You think your lifetime? s just begun
You cut the cake, but just the one slice
You? re crawling back all through the night

Love circles up above
It waits until your love breaks down and weeps
Then it? s out of your reach
Love circles up above
It waits for your love down on the floor
Then you? re there in its claws
