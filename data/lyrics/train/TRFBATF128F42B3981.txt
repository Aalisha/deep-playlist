I'm doing Damage (uh), Damage (uh), Damage (uh), Damage (uh)
Damage (uh), Damege (uh), Destruction (terror), Motherfucker say WHAT?
(ONE) something's got to give
(TWO) something's got to give
(THREE) something's got to give
Arrrrrggghhhhhhh.

Sage Francis is out of it. He done switched his tone
Closet Alcoholics Anonymous, bitch, I drink alone
Nobody knows so I press on.
I go to Fugazi shows requesting Minor Threat songs

Drunk driving for Exxon. Don't slalom the icebergs
It's smooth sailing til the boat bottom bites curbs
No problem, but my sight's blurred. Don't serve me drinks
Because I'll write the words that make this whole world sink

I'm bitter, sweet and sour, shit, I need to shower, shit and shave
Stuck to the TV and completely out of it these days
I've got a CD. Fuck the counterfeit DJs
Who first fronted on our vinyl then bought Bounce off EBAY

I'm sick of headwraps... they meditate on rhymes
Swing lead bats... to elevate their minds
Get back... Emcees ain't fucking righteous
Craig Mack ain't never got his meat lumped like this

I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath stalkin'
Natalie Portman with a blank tape in my walkman
talkin to myself over instrumental cassettes
the essential steps of having graphic, telepathic mental sex

Mind fuck me or get the hell off of my head case
Suck it up or spit it out. How's that medicated bed taste?
I replaced the sheets. I love ripping off pillow cases
