You found a home inside a heart
And lost it all with broken feelings
I watch you churn inside your mind
And put it out with double meanings

(chorus)
Well, we're coming home
We've been searching for a place to call our own
Yeah, we're coming home
All you lonely vagabonds
Looking for a place to call your own

Now, oh, no, no yeah...
