Row of mirrors and I can't see my reflection, my reflection
My life is so far, far from my expectations, my expectations

It's getting lonely in this parking lot of life
I guess my punishment is my salvation

I wish I could find a way to roam, driving home
Always gives me the blues, gives me the blues
I wish I could find a way to roam, driving home
Always gives me the blues, gives me the blues
