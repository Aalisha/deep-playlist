Fall
Seize
I am merely debris
Scattered along the ground

False
Rage
A man in a cage
An explosion without a sound

Drawn
In
By the deafening din
Crumbling into dust

Look
Down
Watching me drown
Choking on my disgust

And when I surface again
I will not breathe the same air as you
And once my enemies are slain
My lungs will drink the liquid sky
...
