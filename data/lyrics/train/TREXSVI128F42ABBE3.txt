Blue the color suits you cool blue
How will you stay this way for ever?
Blue again it's a lasting chill
To keep you cold as winter

How can I forget you?
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said
How can I forget you baby?
I'm never gonna give you up, up I said

Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
Here it comes again
