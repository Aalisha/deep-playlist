If it sounds country, man, that's what it is? this is a country song

Busted flat in Baton Rouge and headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clapping hands
We finally sang off every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for
Nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free
...
