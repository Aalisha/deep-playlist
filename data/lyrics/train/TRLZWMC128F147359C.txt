Did you see your angel?
Did you see
the one pouring dust over you shoulder
When you cried, the city cried
The lights went off the day before
all papers called,
that your tears went missing
and therefore
from now on the city was freed from the miracle
did you asked questions?
About how many more days forward
How many evil intentions
All the unusual people
On ordinary missions

Everyone seems to know but us
I trust my eyes
And this is not happening
I make a list everyday, but it fades
Must be the see through int in my veins

Say it now change your mind call my day a sunny night
