Turning into something
Drifting off to old ways
Got to pull myself back in

Holding back the questions
We're bruised with all rejection
Gotta pull myself back in.

Suffer the breaks
You know I still remember it
It keeps burning away
I know that you may take a while
To come back around

Come back around
I miss you around

Reaching out for someone
Burning out for so long
