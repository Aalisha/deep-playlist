Hook:
Let me in (x2)

Verse 1:
It's kinda funny how you listen but you never show,
The kinda opening I'm hoping intertwines our soul.
It's kinda silly that you really wanna let me know.
The kinda feelings that you're dealing with you're tryna cope.
I'm not perfect,
You're not perfect,
This aint worth it,
You gotta know by now,
I got have intentions,
But I got a temper,
Baby still remember,
Just what we're here to do.
I wanna help you 'cause,
I think that we can beat whatever.
I wanna prove to you,
Aint nothing gonna stop us never.
I wanna innerstand,
The type a moves you're gonna choose.
I wanna show you baby.
This way we'll never loose.
I'm in need of,
Your love darling,
If we keep on,
Starting over and,
Over baby,
Miscommunicating.
Then we'll still be waiting.
