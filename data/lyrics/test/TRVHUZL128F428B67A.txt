(Feat. Stu Stone)

Breathe
Just Breathe
Breathe
It's alright
Breathe
You're doing fine
Just breathe
And one more time
Breathe
You're doing fine
Doing fine...
Breathe...

You are not alone (4x)

You are not alone
I'm right here to catch you when you fall (3x)

I'm right here to catch you when you fall... in love

I pop, I roll
I'm in control
Real like a superstar
I feel it in my soul
Can't feel my legs
...
