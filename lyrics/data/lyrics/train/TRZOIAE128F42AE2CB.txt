Only daughter,
you got your ticket too soon.
Holy Water,
'cause everybody's getting ruined.
They are waiting to see what you do.
Too long, waiting.
Everybody's cleared the room.

And they'll dress you up;
Stand you in all the right places.
Words like honey,
smile as they change your faces;
With no regard for you at all.
and you find,
that they treat you like a paper doll.
...
