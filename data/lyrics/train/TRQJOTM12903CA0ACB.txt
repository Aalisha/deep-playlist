I AM HELL!
Sworn to black to the legion of darkness.
A crown of thorns
replaced with human bone
Underneath the moonlight I speak the sacred
oath.
The sun begins to wane as my words grace the air
and the blood begins to let upon the altar.
The slaugher of the lamb the day turns to night.
As
the darkness starts to flow into my body
As the rain begins to fall and the
winds begin to blow.
The reign of darkness has begun and we will never let it
end.
