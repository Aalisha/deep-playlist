Oh, it's cryin' time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me, darlin'
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well, my love for you couldn't grow no stronger
