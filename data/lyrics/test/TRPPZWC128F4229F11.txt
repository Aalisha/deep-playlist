Pretty soon now
You know I'm gonna make a comeback
And like the birds and the bees in the trees
It's a sure-fire smash

I'll speak to the masses through the media
And if you got anything to say to me
You can say it with cash

'Cause I got the trash and you got the cash
So baby we should get along fine
So give me all your money
'Cause I know you think I'm funny
Can't you hear me laughing, can't you see me smile

I'm the man
(I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man)
I'm the man that gave you the hula-hoop
 (I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man)
I'm the man
(I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man)
I'm the man that gave you the yo-yo

Kung Fu, that was one of my good ones
And what's a few broken bones
When we all know it's good clean fun
...
