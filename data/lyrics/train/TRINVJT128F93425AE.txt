Come my dears, come on...
My sweet little things
Don't you fall down I'm right here
Keep standing strong, yeah...
Bringing the stars back in your sleep
Fly away flying your wing away
I don't need you dear come back here
I've got strong enough, yeahh...
My life full of dreams without you
So yes dear tells the stars
You're not alone
Miss you around me
Than we are rocking together
Yes my dear we're sitting on top of the world
Miss you beside me and let's sing

Move your ass right here man
Hold your friend so tight
