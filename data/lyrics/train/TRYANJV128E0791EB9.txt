Mr. Messed up I should Have known ya
Yes you guessed it oh la its over.

The time was right.
THe vibe was right.
Ready to get into you all night
I wasnt really into puttin up a fight
I let you do your thing and your thing was tight.
Funny as it seems I had a ball with you
Wanted to eventually step all with you
I'm caught up in the middle of the desert sea
But still I let you get the best of me, best of me

I never really wanted to be with you
said, I'm just tryna be honest
I didnt even care for the things that you do
said, I'm just tryna be honest.
I never really wanted to give my love away.
I'm just tryna live honestly, think You and I can never be
So I'mma have to love and leave
Don't you take it personal, baby.
Mr Messed up I should have known ya
