Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

I'm in the basement
You're in the sky
I'm in the basement baby
Drop on by

I'm in the basement
You're in the sky
I'm in the basement baby
Drop on by

Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

I'm in the basement
You're in the sky
I'm in the basement baby
Drop on by
