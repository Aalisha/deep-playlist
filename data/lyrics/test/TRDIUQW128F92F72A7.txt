I'm searching for loyalty, glory and truth
You know it's not gonna be easy
Maybe I'm dreaming, but life is so cruel
The power is leading my heart.

Draw in your mind a utopian world
I want to break free and escape here
Don't wanna hide in the shadows no more
Follow me, it's not too late.

Now try to believe me
From now on you've all got to listen to me
We never will fall
Forever we'll be free
