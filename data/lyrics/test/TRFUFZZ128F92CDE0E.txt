You whisper in my ear
All the things I wanna hear
You say you're sorry and you can change
If I give you one more chance

But I've heard it all before
You can't hurt me anymore
All the lying and all the pain
Now there's nothing left to break

I know what you're feeling
Don't it hurt now
I hope it hurts so bad

Cry
I wanna see the tears in your eyes
For me
You've thrown it all away
There's nothing you can say
Just cry
...
