sometimes... so strange... cut up the pain
some thing... arrange... always the same
come into the scene... closer... and please smile again
come for a walk... together... in this wasteland

these comforting words i'd want to hear...
i'm only dreaming

this is the moment i was waiting for
i was burning to welcome you into my world
so tired of crossing you path once more
i thought we'd walk the same way after all
...
