She burns friends like a piece of wood
And she's jealous of me because she never could
Hold herself up without a spine
And she'll look me up when she's doing fine
Because the rage it burns like Chinese torture
She's just someone's favourite daughter
Spoilt and ugly as she willingly slaughters
Friends and enemies they're all the same
All the same
Crush her fame
Burn her name

She'll break a promise as a matter of course
Because she thinks it's fun to have no remorse
