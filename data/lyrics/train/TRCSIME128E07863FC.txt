Wasted and complacent
And you about the same
But still I want to get it
On with you tonight
When I was a little boy
I laid down in the grass
I'm sure you'd feel the same if I
Could fuck you here tonight

But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No, I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No, it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what you do

If we made it happen
