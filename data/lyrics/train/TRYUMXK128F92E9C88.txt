Your letter said that you were leaving
But you didn't know how long
And I have never stopped believing
That one day you would return

And though the waiting is the hardest
Part of everything I do
I do confess it's getting better
Knowing I will be with you

And it's alright, it's okay
And I won't worry about tomorrow
For it brings me one more day
Closer than I was to you
Closer than I was to you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
