I met you on the Palisades
The sun was spilling kerosene
And I was feeling wide awake
Girl, you can be so obscene
And when you sang a lullaby
A missionary called your name
You disappeared and hopped a flight
For the Serengeti plain

Tell everyone you know
Open up the door
Tell everyone you know
Open up the door

When your love has gone
You carry on
...
