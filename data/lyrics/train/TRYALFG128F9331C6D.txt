yeeee yeeee yeeee
I'm not getting crazy over you baby
no eventhough i'm under your Spell
couse ass I pass it down the street eee
my little heart just gives a beat o yes it skips a beat woo yes
it skips a beat

don't you know you got your influence on me
you wanna drive my out of my mind
couse ass I pass it by
I fell in love with you
when you look at me I'm hypnotized
