If it's ok, I'll leave the bedlight on
And place your water glass where it belongs
And if it's alright, I'll lie awake at night
Pretending I am curled up at your side

See I'm circling in these patterns
Living out of memories
I'm still a long way from accepting it
That there's just no you and me

But if I still believe you love me
Maybe I'll survive
So I tell myself you're coming home like you've done a million times
And if it's alright I'll still be loving you
'Cause I can't break it to my heart
