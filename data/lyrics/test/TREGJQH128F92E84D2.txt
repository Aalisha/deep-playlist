They say if you leave a horse alone it dies
Nestles into the hay and shuts it's eyes
Well I've dreamt of being that horse a hundred times
And I end up a pile of bones and a cloud of flies
And when you're nine years old you don't care
If your on your own or one of a pair
And when you get salt in your eyes, sand in your hair
Call for mum or daddy they'll be there
