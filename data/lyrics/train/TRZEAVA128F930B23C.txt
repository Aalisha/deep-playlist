I am back at the beginning, I have a crust upon my eyes
I'm alone in this my blindness, I'm alone but there is still life
Not under a tombstone, no worms are lickin' my bones
I'm just in a state here day turn to night and it's late

I am back at the beginning, I am black down to my heart
I am tied down to this rhythm, In a trance 'til death do us part
Like one of those people that are nothing but evil
A life of regrets is saved in the flower of death

All the things that are sad are saved inside my madness
all I touch will die before the summer is gone
All the blackest days will always flood my soul
Inviting me to rest upon the leaves of autumn
Searching for some kindness, lost inside my blindness
I turn around, I turn around
