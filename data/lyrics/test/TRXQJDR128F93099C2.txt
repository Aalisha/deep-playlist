(Tommy Collins)

If you got a Cadillac boy
And a forty room shack boy
A bucket full of money
And a tree full of honey.

But if you got no huggin'
No smoochin' or muggin'
Well, if you ain't lovin'
Then you ain't livin'.

If you're ridin' on the gravy train
Instead of walkin' down lovers lane
You can't make hay boy
...
