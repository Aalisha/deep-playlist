Bring it! What?
We right here
We're not goin' anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share
We right here
Bring your crew 'cuz we don't care
We right here

One mo' time
I gots to hit the streets off, make the streets talk
Let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk
This gon' be
The only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003
And y'all gon' see
That the hottest n out there, was, is, and will be me
Just like that
I can go away for a minute, do some other s, but bounce right back

And when it's on
I'm comin' strapped, with some s that'll spit from dusk 'til dawn
And when you gone
Ain't no comin' back in the morning, like that s was a dream
N you gone
That's for real
Creep ns like a seal, totin' steel, stick a n make him squeal
Oh, my God
Those can't be the last words of ya man, damn ya man was so hard

Come on
Bring it! What?
We right here
We're not goin' anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share
