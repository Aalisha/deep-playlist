Them want I, them want I
Become a them funeral
Them claim say, them claim say
Them are the general

Them want I, them want I
Com'a them funeral
Them claim say, them claim say
Them are the general

What a big disgrace
Way you rob up the place
Rob everything you can find
Yes, you did and you'll even rob the blind

You must see want I if com'a, com'a funeral
And I no go, no one burial
...
