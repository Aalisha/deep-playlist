They call me the Nashville Rebel
They say leave that boy alone
Don't you give him advice or he'll turn to ice
And you might as well talk to stone.

But I've got things to do
And things to say in my own way
I don't have time for your parties
My love's little guessin' games.

I've got songs to write in the still of night
...
