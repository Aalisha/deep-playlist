Save your breath
I see the storm coming
I feel the clouds closing in
Hush your mouth
I'll find the words for you
Oh your poor heart don't feel the same
We'll still be friends
But I'm alone again
So you don't have to say
What you're thinking now
Baby don't be afraid
I'll try and make it easy for you
I'll cry the tears a little later on
You don't need to worry
I know I have been replaced
It's written all over your face
