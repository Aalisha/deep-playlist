baby when I'm wrapped up in your arms
it never rains
and I'm praying for more more and more
each and everyday
aww baby

we're flying high
and no one can deny
they can tell by the look in your eye

that we got love
you got me
and if i got you baby
we got more than money
you are everything a man's been dreaming of
oh we got love
baby we got love

and you know i love to see you smile
and what you done for me 
what you done for me makes it all worth while
