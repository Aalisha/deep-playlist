Hold me down lift me up
There's someone on the bedside waiting there for me
I hear my name, turn around
There's gotta be a downside, something I don't see
Around me

Hide me
Dying in the light of the room
Blind side please
I don't really want to be seen
In my own eyes

Something's wrong
Awake all night
'Cause I can feel the dark side
...
