And this tune is for all the single ladies
We just wanna know
Are you gonna take us home tonight
Can you take us home please
We'll be out in the morning
I swear

It's Friday night, time to get dressed
Raving time, just to impress
Make sure your hair don't look like a mess
Got a little spray, gotta stay fresh
Bad to the bone
If you ain't got a haircut, draw for your afro comb
Got you car keys and your mobile phone
That's how you get girls to take you home

Just because the lady looks cute
She took more phone numbers than the loot
So before you knock boots
Make sure you put on your hat with your birthday suit
She wants you to come around and stay
She said a one night stand's okay
I'd say what Clint Eastwood would say
"Go ahead, make my day"

If you're single, then mingle
If he's buff, put his number inside your mobile phone
If you wanna take him home
Go one then, go one then

If you're single, then mingle
...
