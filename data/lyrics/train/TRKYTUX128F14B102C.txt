(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

I've got that lefty curse
Where everything I do is flipped
And awkwardly reversed
You're seldom known and barely missed
I always put myself
In destructive situations
I need oxygen, to be exposed
Where no one goes, where no one's been
When it all comes crashing...

(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight
Sing it (yeah)
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
Now we've got a big, big
Mess on our hands tonight

Somebody get my phone
So I can throw it in a public pool
And watch it float
And as it's slowly sinking down
Become a social ghost
...
