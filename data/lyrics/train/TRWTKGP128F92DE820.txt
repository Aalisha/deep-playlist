Baby, I wish I could hold you
Promise I'll never let go of you
Baby, you got me gone
Baby, I wish I could hold you
Promise I'll never let go of you
Baby, you got me gone

I don't know why I'm still so sad and blue
And I don't know why I just can't get over you, ooh
'Cause you didn't go far, you didn't do me harm
You make sure I get all that I want
So I don't know why I'm so sad and blue
When you give me all of you

You got me on bed rest, I'm hurtin' for love
You got me on bed rest, it's like I'm givin' life up
Pillows and thoughts, not takin' no calls
And never get up, baby

You got me on bed rest, I'm hurtin' for love
I didn't get the respect that I deserve
It'll take time before I can find the will to get up
The will to get up

I want the dark
