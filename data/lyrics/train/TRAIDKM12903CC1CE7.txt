Organ Grinder comes to town
All the children jump around
All the old folk shake their head
And make big noise to wake the dead
The Organ Grinder comes to town
All the children jump around
So bounce little mouse till you break the bed
And make big noise to wake the dead

Hold mic, permanent;
Man cut crip fuck shit up;
Them architects brought darker tech
Middle cloak spread laser
Stare raise a feather-man
Black wings mechanical;
Organ metatron set strong compositions
Shape shift; whip switch; channel shadow walk; stalk
Don't look
Invisible Beam high energy, beam death, straight kill
Kick rigorous, flow terrorist and bloody bang bang
Bare knuckle slang sling boom band bring
Spray on crayon war brought all on the mic
Diabolic, psychological, war on the mic
Hyper hazardous; one with the slanderous
Uncivilized crew; cause stuff to; romp stomp on pom-pom
Fluffy toys bakaboom
Crackadoom
Metraton spit gigatrons
