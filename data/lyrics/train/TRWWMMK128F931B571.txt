Don't need time,
Don't need your money
All I need is your sweet, sweet honey.

You're so hot
And you go so slow
The way you do it
I loose control.

Push, Push, feels so tight
You're in my mind
And you move just right.
Push, Push, take your time
You'll get yours after I get mine

I've got the need,
Give me your pleasure.
I've got the hot spot,
Come bury your treasure.
You do it best,
...
