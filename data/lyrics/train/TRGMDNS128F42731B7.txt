Back into your own submission
Back inside your lonely cell
Diseased by your own admission
Holding secrets you can't tell

And who cares if you live or die
And no one asks you
Why you cannot speak
A split decision, intermission

Back into your own submission
Who knows why it's been so long
Consumer gods and fashion victims
Ribbons round the walking bombs
...
