Get out of my life, woman
You don't love me no more
Get out of my life, woman
You don't love me no more
Get out of my life, woman
You don't love me no more, yeah

Get out of my eyes teardrops
I gotta see my way around
Get out of my eyes teardrops
I gotta see my way around
Get out of my life heartache
I got heartaches by the pound

Get off my ladder, woman
I gotta climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman
I gotta climb up to the top
Get off my ladder, woman
