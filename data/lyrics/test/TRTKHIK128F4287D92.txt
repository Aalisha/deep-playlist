Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury's in retrograde
Merc-Merc-Mercury's in retrograde
Mercury's in retrograde

Mercury Mercu-Mercury's in
Mercury Merc-Merc-Mercury's in
Mercury Mercu-Mercury's in
Mercury's in retrograde

This is not the time, the time to start a new love
This is not the time, the time to sign a lease
Try not to worry about what's forgotten
Try not to worry about what's being missed

Scars on my shins, scars on my knuckles
Today I woke up in the basketball court
John Joe's in Sydney and he ain't returning
I'm sitting in Soho trying to stay drunk

In any part of the world
From Silver Lake to Williamsburg
You can pick another stranger
And fall in love
