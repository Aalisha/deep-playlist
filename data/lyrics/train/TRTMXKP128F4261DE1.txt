A vision,
A flash of light
A gift we were given
Within each others dreams
We lived in the gardens of Avalon

Together
Believed that we could live there forever
Then it faded away
Forgetting we wondered to far from the land we'd known

Chorus:
Of all the lonely people
You're among the lucky few
If it comes even once in a life
Love is a lesson hard to learn
It's never as easy to return
But if you're willing to go on
you'll find the way back to Avalon... (Avalon)

They had it
