Word up, Erick Sermon an' Keith Murray
Kickin' it to the beat

Respect my views on this day an' era
Keep your eyes upon me an' not the sparrow of Barettas
I'm fly than any bird of this earth
For what it be, my style is butter like Worth

I freak the beat like I'm lost in the twilight
A zone with no phone, lookin' over parasites
I pack the house like Woodstock when I rock
A three day event of me droppin' the illest shit

From here to New Jerz, back to Brooklyn an' Queens
The Uptown to Bronx River, I still deliver
The off the wall for y'all
Rearranged, Cameo-type strange, pumpin' through your veins

What your mommy do if you're not ready to die like Biggie?
I'ma keep jammin' like Ziggy
I got the arrows wiped down like Funkmaster Flex
Sway an' Tech an' Premier an' we in here

It's on like that an' everybody's welcome
You are welcome
It's on like that an' everybody's welcome
You are welcome

It's on like that an' everybody's welcome
You are welcome
It's on like that an' everybody's welcome
You are
