Alright
Toy green

Yeah, (Yeah, Yeah)
I was right all along,
Yeah, (Yeah, Yeah)
You come tagging along,
Exhibit A: On a tray, what you say,
Ends up thrown in your face
Exhibit B: What you see? Well that's me,
I'll put you back in your place

Yeah I've done it before,
And I can do it some more,
So what you waiting for?
Yeah! (Yeah, Yeah)
I was right all along!

'Cause I have done it before,
And I can do it some more,
I've got my eye on the score,
I'm gonna cut though the door,
It's too late, it's too soon, or is it...

Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Tick Boom!

Ha

Oh Yeah, (Yeah, Yeah)
