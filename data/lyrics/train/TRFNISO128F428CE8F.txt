All tyrants are created equal, defined by paranoia
Power through, ruthless action, no one dares defy

Diametric opposition, rules of engagement
Central fallacy of global conflict
Force to annihilate, reserved for cold war
Trapped within race, arms inertia

Resurrect a paradox, balance of terror
Time already wasted

Foolish tyrant pride, belligerent hard line
Militant delusion, struggle for domination
Repugnant provocation, threats of mass destruction

Narcissistic rage, terrorist ambition
Imminent delivery, rampant devastation
Holy murder lies, hatred passed through generation
