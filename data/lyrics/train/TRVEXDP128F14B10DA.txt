When morning comes to morgantown
the merchants roll their awnings down
the milktrucks make their morning rounds
in morning, morgantown
We'll rise up early, with the sun
to ride the bus while everyone is yawning
and the day is young
in morning, morgantown
Morning morgantown
buy your dreams a dollar down
morning any town you name
...
