This world is a burning fire
Everybody pay his price
You can't stop me my desire
I'm the pirate of Paradise

I know Heaven is forever
I can't stop, baby, loving you
Here I dance on heavy weather
I always will be true

Just another dream, I will share with you
Just another night, gone and feeling blue
Just another day, I can't say goodbye
Hit me, hit me, baby, I don't lie

48 hours, come baby, hit me all night long
48 hours, oh baby, make me, ooh, so strong
48 hours, come, hear the rhythm of my heart
I'm burning, burning, turning for a start
