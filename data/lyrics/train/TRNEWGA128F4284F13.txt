You try to scream into the megaphone
You try to call me on the telephone
While I'm sinking at the bottom
And you don't even know my name

First you tell me it was copacetic
Then you tell me that was hypothetic
While I'm choking at the bottom
And you don't even know my name

But I'm happier this way
I found God, He dropped me yesterday
But I'm happier this way
I try harder now to disarray
...
