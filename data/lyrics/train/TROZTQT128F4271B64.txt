I've seen it come and I've watched it go
The ins and outs and the highs and lows
Well I gave my heart and I paid the cost
For the loves I made there were friends I lost

At the point I'd almost had enough
Like the morning sun you woke me up
You held me close and you help me see
Oh you made a believer out of me

Now I'm alright, I've got you in my life
And I never felt love, ever feel so right
