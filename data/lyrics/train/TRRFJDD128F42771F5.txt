Here she comes now sister in shadow
Lights up my day 'til there's no tomorrow
Almond eyes set in olive skin,
Betray the anger burnin' white within
There she goes dumbin' down for them all
And speakin' in code when sufferin' is calling
When the city's steppin' out to play
She cuts a dash in tenement grey
Her memory lingers then fades and turns to black
Slippin' through my fingers, shiftin' shape and doublin' back
...
