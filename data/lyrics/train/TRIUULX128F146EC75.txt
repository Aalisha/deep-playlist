Staring up into the solar system
All the stars are fixed up into the sky
I just want to sparkle for a moment
Before i just fizzle up and die

I'm happy because I'm stupid
Scared of spiders, scared of flying
If i wasn't so happy
I wouldnt be so scared of dying

So just be gentle with me
I'm not as young as I was
And I'll be gentle with you
I'm not as brave as I thought
Cos my heart gets broken so easily
...
