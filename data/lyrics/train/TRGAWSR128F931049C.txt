Lemme see ya lighter! - Put it in the sky for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Throw ya hands high for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Put it in the sky for me
Lemme see ya lighter! - Throw ya hands hiiiiiiiigh

Bang-ba-da-ba-da-bang!
Somebody mussa told ya that we play around
My name is Kardinal my job is to kill any sound!
Murder everything walking put the evil underground
Guess who's back came with a crew
No lames in my Circle and we aiming at you!
God bless cause this stress got me sippin that brew
All this success got me in a city near you
And the way that we flex will make your face screw
With my glamma campaign no making it rain
But the thunder making the world wonder HMMM?!
How come the kid ain't going under HMMM?!
