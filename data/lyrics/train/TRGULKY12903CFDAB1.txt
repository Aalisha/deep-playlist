Oh, it's crying time again, you're gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin', ooh
That it won't be long before it's crying time

Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
(Fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger
(Stronger)
