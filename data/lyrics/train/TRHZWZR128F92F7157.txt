Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lasses
They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes
Fair Betsy Belle I loved so well and thought I ne'er could alter
But Mary Gray's two cheeky eyes caused all my fancy falter

Oh Betsy Belle and Mary Gray, they were two bonnie lasses
They biggit a bower on yon Burnside and theeked it o'er with rashes

Betsy's hair's like flaxen gold, she smiles like a May morning
When Phoebus starts from Thoetus lap the hills with rays adorning
White is her hair, soft is her hand, her waist and feet flow gently
