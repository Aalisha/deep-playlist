Hey, Hey, Hey!
Hey, Hey, Hey!
Hey, Hey, Hey!

oh!

(verse)
I'm scared to try cause I'm scared to fail
I'm scared to die cause I'm scared of hell
I'm scared to kiss I'm scared to hug
I'm scared of sex cause i'm scared to touch

I'm scared to look cause I'm scared to see
I'm scared of you cause I'm scared of me
I'm scared to fly cause I'm scared to crash
I'm scared to move on so I live in the past

I'm scared to fight cause I'm scared to bleed
I'm scared to love cause I'm scared he'll leave
I'm scared of drugs I'm scared to drink
I'm scared to swim cause I'm scared to sink
