I know what you've been hearing
I've seen you hide your fear
Embarrased by your weaknesses
Afraid to let Me near

I wish you knew how much I long
For you to understand
No matter what may happen, child
I'll never let go of your hand

I know you've been forsaken
By all you've known before
When you've failed their expectations
They frown and close the door

But even though your heart itself
Should lose the will to stand
