I saw the light, I've been baptized
By the fire in your touch and the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

Well, the whole town's talking
'Bout the line I'm walking
That leads right to your door
Oh how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone

I used to have a wild side
They say a country mile wide
I'd burn those beer joints down
That's all changed now
You turned my life around
