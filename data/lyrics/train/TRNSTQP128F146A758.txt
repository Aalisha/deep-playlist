If that don't make you happy
Then I don't know
If that don't make you happy
I don't know
I don't know

If that don't make you happy
I don't know
I don't know

If that don't make you happy
I don't know
I don't know

And if this world were mine
And if this world were mine
I'd give it to you
If that don't make you happy
Then I don't know
I don't know

You are the one
That makes my dreams come true

Baby Baby
I don't know

If that don't make you happy
I don't know
I don't know

If that don't make you happy
I don't know
I don't know

And if this world were mine
Mine to give
