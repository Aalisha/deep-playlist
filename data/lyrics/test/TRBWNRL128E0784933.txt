Keep me hangin' on
Set me free why don't you baby?
Get out my life why don't you baby?
'Cause you don't really love me

You just keep me hangin' on
Set me free why don't you baby?
Get out my life why don't you baby?
'Cause you don't really need me

But you keep me hangin' on
Why do you keep a comin' around playing with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a brand-new start?
Let me get over you the way you've gotten over me, yeah
Set me free why don't you baby?

Get out my life why don't you baby?
