I tried to escape, fallout
All around me, yeah

The blast of light, burning day and night
It would last through time,
with an unseen spark of life

Man and his infamy, man will no longer be
Fallout is his breath of air
The stars above glance fateful stares

Looking back I'd wonder why
No one helped, they'd just stand by
They need to look the other way
To breed the fallout, the final day
