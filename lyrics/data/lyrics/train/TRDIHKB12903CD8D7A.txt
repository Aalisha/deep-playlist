You said it yourself
To convalesce from empty sorrow
Someone had to squeal
To drive to the bottom
You said I know
I know it's not your fault
Like wire around your bones
And you were never numb
I take it I'm a mad man
But I would never squeal
I never said it was no good
The innocent will rest in the peace they've been given
Paintings will sleep on the floor
