I knew it from the start
You would break my heart
But still I had to play this painful part
You wrapped me 'round your little-bitty finger
With your magic smile
You kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while
You put your spell on me
Took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do to make you stay
I'm gonna miss you
All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change my point of view
Oh girl
I'm gonna miss you baby

Giving all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
