She's cruising the streets,
making damn sure she don't run into that old man.
Well, around him she hardly even speaks,
she slips into an old retreat.
I saw her strutin' in a dress,
looking lucky last week,
keeping an eye out for shadys,
holding something sweet.

Sweet relief,
find it in a bathtub,
or a backrub,
or the clothes they wear,
or just in the air,
it's in the food you eat,
yeah it's something so sweet,
...
