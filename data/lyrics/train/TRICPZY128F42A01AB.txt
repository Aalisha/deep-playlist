You don't say much of anything
When questioned of your whereabouts, your whereabouts
And I just can't see through the evidence
It's evident, it's right in front of me in black and white and red

And I don't believe in much of anything
I'm glad I have people I call friends
If it was up to me, I'd never have to miss you
It's for the better in the bitter end I guess you'd know the best
