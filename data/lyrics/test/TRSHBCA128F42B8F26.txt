You're kind of pretty you can cover in make-up
Cover in perfume too
Moonlight, mud fight, any kinda sunlight
Still comes shining through

Stuff it with cakes, see if it breaks
Put it in the oven, see how she bakes
Your kind of pretty you can gas mark 11
But you can't ever overdo

Your kinda pretty, don't need advertising
Your kinda pretty comes with own billboard
Newly-weds nearly-deads
Anyone with bed-stead
