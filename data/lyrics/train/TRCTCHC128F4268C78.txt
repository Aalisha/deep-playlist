Lost in these times
Its hard to make up our minds
This is the reason
We're convicted for our crimes

So we wait
Scars on our face
They show the importance
Of finding a way to leave this place

But then we're left with
Nothing substantial to hold
And I'm afraid that
Our stories will never be told

Some people carry on
Some just stay right where they are
(Our worlds divide the sight)
I'd rather move along
Knowledge is not very far
(Our worlds divide the sight)

When innocence dies
It tends to shake up your life
