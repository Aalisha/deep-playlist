Can I take your picture, put it in my billfold
You'll never believe where I will take you
Can I have your headband, put it in my suitcase
I'm always gone before I think to thank you

I'm a soul that wanders in the field
Between the Hyatt and the Leela
Empty as a tiffin in the afternoon

You know a perfect love
(Maybe I'll stay here)
Is a world without hunger
(Maybe I'll take you home)
You know a perfect love
(Where do we go from here?)
Is a world without hunger

Freckles on your forehead, twinkle in your eyes
...
