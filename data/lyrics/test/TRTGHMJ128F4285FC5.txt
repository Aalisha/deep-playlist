Roger, roger. Calling, calling, roger, roger, can you read me?
78-78-9, 78-78-9, do you read me? Roger, major!
This is Modern Talking spaceship 1998,
We need authorization to land.
Major, major? Landing co-ordinations.
We are now ten seconds from touchdown.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Engage go for landing.
Keepin' the chance of rain calling cloudy skies,
but we're gonna see if we can make the sun shine anyway.
Right here on a station that pays,
if you want the hits, the whole hits,
and nothing but the hits... on your FM dial, keep it right here,
baby.
Modern Talking! 'Cheri Cheri Lady'!
And it goes down... like that. Come on!
Oh, I can't explain
Every time it's the same
Oh I feel that it's real
Take my heart
I've been lonely to long
Oh, I can't be so strong
Take the chance for romance, take my heart
I need you so
There's no time I'll ever go
Cheri, cheri lady
Going through a motion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
Living in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part
Cheri, cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart - don't lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby I'll be always yours
The lady of my life is out o' really feeling.
The real deal, giving you nothing but sex-appeal.
You steal my mind, I love the way you do me,
break it down to the sound of 'Brother Louie'.
...Brother Louie!.
Dear, love is a burning fire
Stay, cause then the flames grow higher
Babe, don't let him steel your heart
It's easy, it's easy
Girl, this game can't last forever
Why ? We can not live together
Try, don't let him take your love from me
You're not good, can't you see brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She's undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
Cause I'm a lover
Check it out, check it out, here we go, let me say it.
Tax on wax make the brothers wanna play it.
To the front, to the front, to the back, to the back,
To the hip, to the hop, to the rhyme, to the rap.
Every single line out o'da time you admire,
Stays in your brain like earth, within a fire.
I take you higher, fairly you desire,
I'm not a liar, I roll like a tyre!
You packed your things in a carpetbag
Left and never looking back
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
Music wherever you go
You don't fit in a smalltown world
But I feel you're the girl for me
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes
You're leaving town where nobody knows
You can win if you want
If you want it, you will win
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy
Take my hand, follow me
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life
You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right hold me tight
98.7 on your FM dial! You're listening to Modern Talking,
and this is "Doctor for my heart"!
Babe, how can you mend a broken heart ?
Oh, you're tearing me apart
