there was smoke on the water
a little fire in the sky
if i hear that song one more time
i'll stick a fork right in my eye
another round and a pickled egg
a truck pulled up with a 100 kegs
just another friday night
fuck no fuck no
its chug-a-lug night
here we go
here we go
chug-a-lug night
kissin' girls you don't know
here we go (2x)
...
