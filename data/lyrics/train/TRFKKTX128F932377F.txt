You need a shot to your arm
You need a shot to your face
You need a shot won't do no harm
Just keepin' pace
Tranquilizer

Oh Charlie your hand is shakin'
Shakin' like a leaf on a tree
Oh Charlie your head is buzzin'
Buzzin' like a bumblebee
Tranquilizer

I'll be your tranquilizer
I'll be your hypnotizer
I'll be your cold Budweiser
Painkiller
Painkiller
Painkiller
Painkiller
