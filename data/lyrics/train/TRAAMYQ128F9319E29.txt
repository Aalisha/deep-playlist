Bands come and go
they lack life
in a year they are gone
they lack grace
they're one hit wonder
they lack passion
it's a dead, worthless thing
hey hey hey grace face labor
Wa ooh ooh music born of hardship
hey hey hey born of our soul
don't try to understand it, you never will
it's in our hearts, the music we feel

HEART BLEEDS BLACK, we're poor at income
HEART BLEEDS BLACK, but rich with pride
