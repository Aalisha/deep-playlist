My friends tell me
That he's been cheating on you
And that he treats you unkindly
He's using you
My friends tell me
That he keeps messing around
And that your love is so blinded
You think that it's it cool

Well, he never sends you roses
He never kisses you goodnight
He never thinks about your anniversary
He says he don't have time
