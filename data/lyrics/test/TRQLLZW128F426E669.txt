Rain fell that day when the sky went black on everyone
These things we're told not to talk about, not to anyone
When You fell you took the fall for everything that I had ever done
So help me never forget just how beautiful the sky could be
You have lifted me just like the taste of falling rain
and my world has never felt, it has never felt the same
Yesterday I was six feet under ground and now I'm on my knees
and I can't explain, I can't explain any of this
It's coming down I close my eyes to feel the rain like it could wash away a thousand years of heartbreak
