Are you lonely for me baby
Are you lonely for me baby
Are you lonely for me baby
Are you lonely for me baby

Oh, it's the last train, to Jacksonville,
and I'm gonna get on it baby, you know I will
Will you try, come on and try,
to forget all the pain I brought you
Come on and cry, go ahead and cry,
I know I'm the one who thought you

To be lonely baby,
I'm lonely and blue
I'm lonely baby,
and I'm lonely for you

Are you lonely for me baby
Yes I am
Are you lonely for me baby
