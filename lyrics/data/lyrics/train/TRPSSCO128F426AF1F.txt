Even though it's been so long
My love for you keeps going strong
I remember the things that we used to do
A kiss in the rain till the sun shine through

I tried to deny it but I'm still in love with you
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
Ever since you went away, every hour of every day
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy
No matter what I say or do
There's just no getting over you
I can see the love shining in your eyes
And it comes as such a sweet surprise

If seeing's believing it's worth the wait
So hold me and tell me it's not too late
