Let's not forget, lets not forget what happened in the past,
You were right, you were wrong, yeah but everything was fast,
So when we build this ship remember to make it last,
Increase the time it takes to paint and build the mast,

Lets save this game for never,
Or you know this could be chess forever,
I'll take your piece,
Then you'll take mine,
Stalemate and we've just wasted time,
...
