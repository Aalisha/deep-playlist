Cutting life short I will end you
take all that you have
all you wanted your goals and your dreams.
Destroying hope I will crush you take your spirit.
Leaving you empty and hollow inside.
Crush you slowly. Steal your hopes dreams.
Cut your life short I will end you take
all that you have all you wanted
your goals and your dreams.
Destroy your hope I will crush you take your spirit.
