Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready
(Whenever you are ready)
Whenever you're ready
Whenever you're ready just call me

Don't take too long to read between the lines
Got a feeling that you're no longer mine
I think about you boy, each and every day
I'm not about to let your love just slip away

We both know something has gone wrong
Ah, but let me tell you we're gonna be alright
It won't be easy but I'll be strong
I'll wait for you, I'll be there
You can count on me, I'll be there, sugar

Whenever you're ready, I'll be around
Whenever you're ready, ha
Whenever you're ready, love is still waiting
Whenever you're ready, just call me, call me

Now, the word is out, it's all over town
