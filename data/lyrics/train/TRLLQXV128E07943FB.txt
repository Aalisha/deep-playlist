Don't you know
So many things, they come and go
Like your words that once rang true
Just like the love I thought I found in you

And I remember the thunder
Talking 'bout the fire in your eyes
But you walked away when I needed you most
Now maybe baby, maybe baby

I found someone
To take away the heartache
To take away the loneliness
I've been feelin' since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
