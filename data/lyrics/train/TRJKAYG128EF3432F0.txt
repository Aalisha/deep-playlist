Minnie you're a friend of mine
You'll come good in your sweet time

Leave all the worries that fuck you up
Sting much worse than a paper cut
Leave 'em all hangin' here by the door when you
Leave 'em behind you're gonna wipe the floor

And I don't know which way home
I don't know which way I should go
Chasing the shadows of a promise that'll never come
Oh no, and I don't know which way home
...
