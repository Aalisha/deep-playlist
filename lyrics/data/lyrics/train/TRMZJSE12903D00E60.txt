To the deep end, to the heart line
Hold it straight together, man, 
hold it straight together if you can
Little fevers wrapped in dedication
All strung out on novelty, 
collapse yourself and try to comprehend

An angry island, a bitter bee sting
Severing and shattering free the self and fix the between
It's isolation, mark the earth around you
Guess who's on the waiting list, 
I'll let you in on something secret

I can disappear anytime I want to, time I feel you
Shovel through my skin, I am with you till the end
...
