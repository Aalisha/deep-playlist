give me some kind of hope
give me one honest lie to promote
and try to think better days when you choke
when blood for profit gain wins your vote

and you can fake smiles to make you feel
when its time to break the deal
And i'm easy now, its easy now
and buy a new disease
when it pays to sell the cure
And i'm easy now, its easy now

cos i can climb mountains
i can spit further than you can hurl
...
