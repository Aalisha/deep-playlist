Get excited when we touch
Hey little baby i love you too much
I get excited when we kiss
I don't believe luck can be like this
I get excited when we ride
Oh come on baby sit by my side
I get excited when you say
Oh baby baby please please stay

My motivator come motivate my heart
Oh motivator oh we should never part
My motivator motivate me home
You know I hate to go
