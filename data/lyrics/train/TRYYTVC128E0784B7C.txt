Extreme ways are back again
Extreme places i didn't know
I bought everything new again
Everything that i'd owned
I threw it out the windows, came along
Extreme ways i know move apart
The colors of my sea
Perfect color me

Extreme ways that that help me
Help me out at night
Extreme places i had gone
But never seen any light
Dirty basements, dirty noise
Dirty places coming through
Extreme worlds alone
Did you ever like it planned

I would stand in line for this
There's always room in life for this
