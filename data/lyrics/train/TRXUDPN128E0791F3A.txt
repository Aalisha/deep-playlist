Wake up, can you hear me?
You're so clever, did you find me?
In the backroom, in your closet
In your suitcase, there's no running

I will find you, like the glacier
Can't you see me, leaving Canyons
In your cheekbones, passing through you
In the shadows, scenes undo you

Cut your ribbon, as it follows you
Everything, everything
How can you sleep at night?
And it falls apart
Anything, anything
How can you sleep at night?
