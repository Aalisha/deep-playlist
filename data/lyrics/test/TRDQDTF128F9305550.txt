Beyond the sweat and the groaning
The stained sheets and the moaning
She is rising as a phoenix
On a psychedelic helix
She has come a queen of harlots
She has come the whore of Heaven
She has come an evil genius
She has come to destroy us

Yeah, yeah she's the one
The whore of Heaven

With lips of red and eyes of anger
With grinding hips she shall conquer
With her lust and with her fire
She shall drown you in desire
She shall take and break your heart
...
