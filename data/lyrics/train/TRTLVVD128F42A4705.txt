Now that we've crossed those bridges
Where can we run?
We look behind us
And we are torn down
Once, I thought you were sincere
But now I know you
Better than ever
Scars forever
Scars forever
Scars forever

Now that you've shown your hand
Your desperate round
Your colors ran
And I can't help you now
And I thought the sights were there
But you were sleeping
Don't scream at the sky
The sun sets on you now
...
