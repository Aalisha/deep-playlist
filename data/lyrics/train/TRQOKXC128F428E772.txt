Yea, Amerikaz motherfuckin' nightmare bitch

They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Live in the flesh, with the Tec's and never scared
Them guns we holdin, claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air
Dump dump, reloaded Amerikaz nightmare

They wanna know, where the hood at, nigga we right here
Live in the flesh with the Tec's and never scared
Them guns we holdin', claustrophobic, we'll let 'em air
Dump dump, reloaded the Amerikaz nightmare

Dogs, I think smarter, reach harder
Slugs travel much farther
Nigga stompin' a Timberland wearing, face carver
With the box cutter, top gutter

I'll hover over you lames, run for cover, into your brain yea
You did your thang but, not very good
And by the, looks of things, you can't come back to the hood
This is not a good look for you my nigga

What's really poppin', inquirin' minds wanna know
How you rockin' them, new guns, we cope those
In bulk, like we bought 'em in Cosco's
Don't get yaself murked, wet shirt

Said it first, hurry this that red alert
You ain't gotta get bucked to know that this led'll hurt
The sight of my hammer, gotcha heart pumping
Nerves twitching, eyes jumping, heads will roll

When the pound starts kicking
You be missing
