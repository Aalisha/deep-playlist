We pulled through
Despite expectations, desperate situations
Tooting bec to the west end
It's a long way to go when you play rock'n'roll

Yeah, yeah, yeah, was i dreamin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the crowd was screamin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

This one's for rock'n'roll
For everyone who's made it roll along
This one's for rock'n'roll
From chuck berry to the rolling stones
