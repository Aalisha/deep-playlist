I'll be the one
When the morning comes
Calling out for you
To my rendezvous

CHORUS
I will be the one
The light of the world
Yeah I'll be the one
The bright and morning star
Said I'll be the one
Fairest of ten thousand
Yeah I'll be the

I'll be the one
When your heart is aching
When the day is done
...
