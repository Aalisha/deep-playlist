Where's the muses cave the isle of the dead
The sign of Eph is gone so is the sun
Tired and confused I sail into the night
With the Devil at my shoulder I'll be fine

No light will lead my way from my pain
Drowned in tideless pools no haven for my mind
In grief I meet the storm eye to eye

On the ebony throne
Lies the diagonstone
