Snatch it back and hold it
Baby one more time
I ain't doing too bad, baby
I got you on my mind
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
You having a durn good time

Somebody help me
I can't help myself
Somebody got to help me
'Cause I can't help myself
I'm not doing too bad, baby
You know
I ain't got no brand new bag
