Conception full of illusions - But eyes filled with pain
What yesterday was still today - Is tomorrow against away
The suffering from other life - in the new built within
From mistakes will be learn - But reached stolen mind

As is to be death in life - And lifed for the death
Or is to be insanity from sorrow - Or from trouble insane
The life is a child play - But no game for children
