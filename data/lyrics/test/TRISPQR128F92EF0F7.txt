I have a constant need for motion
I need to leave the past behind
To see all the good things I left dying
Come to life

So long I let them lies deceive me
And I let them take their toll
I'm growing tired of the illusion
I am in control

'Cause you are there in all my histories
My victories and pains
You are there in all my shadows
With forgiveness you are waiting

When I need a place to hide
When I need a place to hide

I need hope to start again
