I'm alone, wandering in your space
Waiting for a sign of life
Looking so out of place

And then you whisper to me
It doesn't matter what you say
I feel the weight against the wind
The demolition of me cavin' in

And I'm always swingin' on this wrecking ball
While you're building up and breaking down my wall
You push and pull and give and take
