As I recall when my stomach turned
And I was hiding away from myself
Away from you
Like nothing though something was terribly wrong
And I admit that I was only waiting for the right time, night time
The right moment for you to look away
Though you never did I pretended for a while
So I could walk where I don't belong

I remember every word you said
Come back in time come back
And I remember I would soon be dead
Pitiful so pitiful

But I know, as they hammered those nails, into your beautiful hands
Your eyes they tried to search for mine
