(Chorus)
Can we find forgiveness
In the throws of our misunderstanding
or do we fall apart
Can we find forgiveness
Or do we go on like this
Trying to cover up a broken heart

(Verse1)
Mmh'I made a mistake and I wanna know
Can you ever forgive me or do we go
Down in the flames of a broken love
If I ever really meant much to you
Then it wouldn't make much sense for you to
Turn your back and walk away from us

(Hook 1)
What about me
What about you
What about love
