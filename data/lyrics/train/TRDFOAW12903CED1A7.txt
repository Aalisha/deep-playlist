Six on the second hand
Two New Year's resolutions
And there's just no question
What this man should do

Take all the time lost
All the days that I cost
Take what I took and
Give it back to you

All this time
We were waiting for each other
All this time
I was waiting for you
We got all these words
Can't waste them on another

So I'm straight in a straight line
