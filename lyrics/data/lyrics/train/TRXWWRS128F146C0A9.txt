oeh yeah yeah
oeh

been a long time since the first time I tried to let you know
life is too short better cheer up baby or let me go
every night I'm on pins and needles wondering what to say
I'm working to hard just to keep our love from fading away

tell me what it takes
tell me what it takes
to get a happy look
and a smile on your face
tell me what it takes
tell me what it takes
to make the sadness end
and start you living again

oeh-oeh-oeh tell me what it takes
oeh-oeh-oeh tell me what it takes
oeh-oeh-oeh tell me what it takes
oeh-oeh-oeh tell me what it takes

there's a blue moon or a bright sun shining in every sky
better think twice before this life baby just passes you by
