We took a walk that night but it wasn't the same
We had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
She said she loved me but she had somewhere to go
She couldn't scream while I held I close
I swore I'd never let her go

Tell me what you wanna know
Oh come on, oh come on, oh come on
There ain't no motive for this crime
