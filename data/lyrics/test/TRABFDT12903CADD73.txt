VERSE 1:
now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say what up in the morning
brush my teeth,
find that clip I've been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up
in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
turn around
see myself in the mirror I guess I'm cool
and those happy thoughts
in my head
I'm feelin like I'm Peter Pan
minus the tights and the fairies
happy to see how far I've come
to the same place
it began
my dreams imagination
perfectly at peace
so I move along a bit higher

HOOK:
ill be up up and away
up up and away
cause
they gon' judge
me anyway
so whatever
ill be up up and away
up up and away
cause in the end they'll judge me anyway
so whatever

VERSE 2:
higher
learning
I seen the dreams I've made
so I'm cooler now
i can take care
of my mom and my little niece Zuri
so sing along little mama
