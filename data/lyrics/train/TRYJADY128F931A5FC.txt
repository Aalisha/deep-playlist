i can't cut my heart in sections and i'll show you no objection
cause it's better than being alone, it's better than being alone
And there's a...

...everyone keeps falling down
i don't think that you could ever understand
...everyone keeps falling down
i don't think that you could ever understand
...everyone keeps falling down

I could stay here in the middle
and speak to you in riddles
