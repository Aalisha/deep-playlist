You must have thought hey whats going on?
Im going to stop what im doin and clear up.

The mess you made,
Things like that just cant be saved,
Youou put your faith in time and moved on,
What a thing to have done.

Whats that you say little girl?
Whats that you said about your world falling through,
What could i do?
