Let me see you bounce
let me see you bounce

If you really know what's good for you
ease the load, let it blow
come on baby tell me what you're waiting for
bring it on, here we go

Break free of all your senses baby close your eyes
just breathe to the rhythm of my body and mind

Let me see you bounce
we're goin' higher, feel the fire
let me see you bounce
it's on tonight, we're on the rise (oh)
let me see you bounce
you don't have to hide it, if you like it

Let me see you bounce
(let me see you bounce)
let me see you bounce

You gotta (gotta gotta gotta) let it go if you wanna
really wanna lose it (lose it)
come on (come on come on come on) put your hands up
do it all the way, move it (move it)
