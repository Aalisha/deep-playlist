Alright
Alright
Alright

When peace like a river attended my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll, yeah
Whatever my Lord, Thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul, yeah

My sin, oh the joy of this glorious thought
My sin not in part but the whole, yeah
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh my soul

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well
