Venomous power prevail under the eye of Death's star
Haunt in the rage beyond the walls of the wraths of time
Shadows sweep, chase upon the far fields in flames
Whence we rise through the fall of celestial lifecodes

Take the sword
Kiss the wind
Unite with magic
Ride free from time
On fields of dream
Through the silver sky
Bath in fire
Walk with shadows
