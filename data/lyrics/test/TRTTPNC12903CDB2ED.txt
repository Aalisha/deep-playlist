"I close your eyes
and send you into vainly dreams
I reign your soul
the night engulf your painful screams

I watch you cry and
twist your soul in agony
No prayers can save you now
from Hell in eternity

I devastate your soul
and lacerate your mind
In sin I sanctify my
sword to crush your spine

I'm the Reaper
