I'll Sail My Ship Alone (1950)
We've been sweethearts for so long but now you say, "We're through!"
The love we shared is now a memory
I had built a ship of dreams and planned them all for you
And now I guess what is to be will be

I'll sail my ship alone with all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
