They say I'm different 'cause I'm a piece of sugar cane
Sweet to the core that's why I got rhythm
My Great Grandma didn't like to foxtrot,
no instead she spitted snuff and boogied to Elmore James

Spit On!

They say I'm different 'cause I eat chitlins
I can't help it I was born and raised on 'em
That's right, oh, every mornin' I had to slop the hogs
and they be gettin off humpin to John Lee Hooker

Gettin off!

They say I'm different 'cause I'm a piece of sugar cane
and when I kick my legs I got rhythm
My Great Grandpa was a blues lover
He be rockin his moonshine to B.B. King and Jimmy Reed

Rock on pappy!
