It's after midnight
The sucker's faded
Turn out the porch light
And feel the front side

The cold sweat, the presentation
The fighting and this head of mine
Tone deaf and out of place in another state
And I'm back on the front line

We never see you when you're
Fallen breath left hypnotized
Can't quite deliver it
So stay with this and you'll feel the front side

It's after midnight
The sucker's faded
Turn out the porch light
And feel the front side

It's after midnight
The sucker's faded
...
