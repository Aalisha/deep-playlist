To the mighty star, to all it's people, to the mankind
And to all true believers
You have known your brother and your leader
You know he never bowed to the despots

The dark cloud wavering in the sky
Pushed forward with ill-willed wind
Underneath walks a man having a dream
Wants to teach us his own way to live
Forgiveness is the word that he spreads
Through the barrels of the guns he have made
Entire world he wants to obey
And more power for himself to take

What does he want from us? What is the reason?
To occupy and to conquer, in the name of freedom?
We don't need his principle in revolt we shall rise
Soon he will notice that no-one converts us
