Oh it feels so good being here with you yes
Being close to you is what I wanna do yes
Just can't seem to get enough of your love, baby
The way you do the thing you do, what a rush

Every bit of you is what I need
So don't hold back, not on me

In the morning and all through the night
I move my stars by candlelight
Do me (do me again) oh yeah
Give me all your fantasies
Have mercy, no don't mercy me
Do me (do me again)
