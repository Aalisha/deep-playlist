I saw a face, grey as the cold December
A face I know, not the one that I remember
I wanted to hide but I cant run out on you forever
(Milky eyes like opal stones
Staring through a stained glass window
It's never too late to change your mind
Looking through a stained glass window)
It's never too late

I know a man, couldn't change the peace that stands between us
