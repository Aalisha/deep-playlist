I didn't like you much
Can't remember how we ending up gettin back in touch
You made me change my hair
Just to make me change it back again, when fashion's in the air

But don't get me wrong
You weren't the first girl that I ever kissed with tongues
But you were the best
You let me touch your chest
Cause I saved you two's on my last cigarette

I saw you on the underground
You smiled at me and then turned around, now love
This must be love
We got it on behind the station
Let's avoid this situation, love
This must be love

I couldn't work you out
You threw my cd's away
Got out our photos cut me out
