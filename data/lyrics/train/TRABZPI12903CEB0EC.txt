Remember the time when you ate a hot chip?
Remember the way it burnt your lip?
When you eat chips you just watch it
Hot Chip Hot Chip

Remember the time when you heard the Hot Chip?
Remember believing you could not believe it?
Remember the Chip can smell bullshit
Hot Chip Hot Chip

Remember the time you saw Hot Chip?
?
Turn round, bend down and look ripped
