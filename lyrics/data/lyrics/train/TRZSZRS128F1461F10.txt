We've always been the best of friends
No secrets and no demands
But suddenly from somewhere out of the blue
I see a different light around you

One thing I haven't told you, I just wanna hold you
Never let go, I need to know

How do I get there from here?
How do I make you see?
How do I tell you what my heart's been tellin' me?

Lost in your lovin' arms, it's where I wanna be
You know I love you
How do I get there?

You probably think I lost my mind
Takin' this chance, crossin' that line
But I promise to be truer than true
...
