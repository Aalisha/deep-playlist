Thirty-one days my fingers feel like rain
This jail was built on cracklins and cocaine
Policemen knocked me down and then charged me
With smokin' and inciting vagrancy
Yes he did yes he did

Chicken sneezed eatin' my cracklins
Butterercup bloomin' in the badlands
Kaboom kaboom piss on the curses
Hospital kiss all the nurses
I got to find some weed and some wine
I have just got to find some trouble sometime

Them Navasota troopers ran me down
Escorted me right out of town
...
