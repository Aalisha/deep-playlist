Like an echo

I can't believe what I saw in you (in you)
For me to think that it was just us two (us two)
But you talking to her while she talking to him
Then it gets to his girl (girl), then it gets to my friend (friend)
She said, "Girl you just gotta let him go" (him go)
"I'm your best friend so I had to let you know" (you know)
I don't know where to start, it's like he breaks my heart
And through it all, I still can't deal with us being apart

Been in life eighteen years but cried a million tears
My mama told me, "Auburn, you're too young to deal with this"
She said, "You're just a kid," I tell her, "Yes, I know"
I think it's 'bout time that I let him go

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Like an echo
Baby, I love you, I love you
Like an echo
Baby, I'll change, I'll change
Like an echo
But you're still the same, the same
I gotta let go

Baby, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Like an echo
Baby, I love you, I love you
Like an echo
Baby, I'll change, I'll change
Like an echo
