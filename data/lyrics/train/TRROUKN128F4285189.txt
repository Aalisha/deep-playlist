Oh them big wheels a-turnin', goin' somewhere
And they're carryin' her away from my side
Yes I cried, thought I died

Love was just a game to me, I thought I'd never cry
I thought she'd be the loser, but standing here am I
And that long train is rolling, goin' somewhere
And it's carryin' her away from my side
Yes I cried, thought I'd die
...
