Winding your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away and forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong when you thought it held everything
You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
