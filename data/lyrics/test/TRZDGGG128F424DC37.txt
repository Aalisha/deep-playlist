Atmospheres are tense today
Mother and father are rowing again
Silently seated around the table
You're the one that's getting the blame
Father looks at you like a snake
You play with the food upon your plate
No one seems to be on your side
Things that threaten to hurt your pride

Mother loves to be concerned
Using lessons that she learnt
Fathers never understand
When children have the upper hand
