Go away, leave me alone
I feel your presence in my mind
The time seems to stop
I set you free
You calm my mind
You calm my mind
Make my dreams come true, baby
Every time it seems to me
That fiction and reality
Melt together for eternity

Liquid words dropping down the stairs
Filling the emptiness with sense
You and me on the floor
Floating on our sensibility

You need a timekiller and you don't understand
I am like quicksand, lick it from my hand
I am your timekiller, I'll let your mind expand
...
