There's nothing I can do to heal you
If you let it all begin
There's nothing I can do to please you
If I could run along beside you
Never stop to look around
I would probably see the world through your eyes
And you say you have to be there
Cause you feel so ordinary
But you know how much you need me
when the sadness comes for you
And I know you feel
the weight that's on your back
can get you through
When lost is all you have
when lost is all you have
...
