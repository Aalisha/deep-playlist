(Louiche/Mike Muir)

Let's skate!

Seemed like such an innocent toy
He was the All-American boy
Got a skate at eight years old
Now the story can be told

Beware he's possessed to skate!

Skating takes him up in height
He's a pilot on a modern flight
See him flying through the air
If he don't land then he don't care
