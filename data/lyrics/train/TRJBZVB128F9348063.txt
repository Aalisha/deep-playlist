I've tried to be strong, I've tried to be tough
But I think that this time I've had more than enough
I've seen too much of your games and your immature stuff
You're a waste of time

All the people I've known thoughout all the years
Too many vodkas and too many beers
And I've learnt a few lessons from all of the tears
You're way out of line

I feel so lucky sometimes
I sit down and look at all my friends
They mean more than the stupid fools that pass my way

I used to prefer those who weren't good for me
Somehow the attraction beat reality
...
