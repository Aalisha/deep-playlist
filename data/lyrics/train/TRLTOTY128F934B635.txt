On the dark and blue horizon
Beyond the realms of land
About the edge of time
There showed a shape of wonder
With sheering course of might
And true revealing light

Feeling it's force drive me closer
I drew upon it's guide
Rising up and through the ruins of man
A vision so appeared before my eyes
With blinding light.

I never thought I'd find
True meaning to me inside
With all hopes I'd dreamt to see the end of life and time
Forever close your eyes
