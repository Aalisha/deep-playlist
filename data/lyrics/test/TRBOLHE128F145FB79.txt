Walk around my life
Keep your money in your hand
Look out where you're heading mama
Don't go running blind

Shine lights and strut it out
Keep your ear right to the ground
Watch out for the strange cats
When the strange cats come around

Mmm, pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl shakin' down

Keep your eyes wide open
Hold your head up high
You are not a stranger here
So much changes inside

Hold your hand to hold you
She would lend a helping hand
Do not turn your back on the lady
When the lady comes around
