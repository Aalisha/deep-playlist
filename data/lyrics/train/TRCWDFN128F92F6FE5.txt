(Spoken)
Disclaimer: We should all have hope and look towards the day where a man realizes the sounds exiting his mouth are mostly complaints that a change occurs!

Say it, say it
Say it, say it

Alone, you support, and embrace
Another reason to see
Sucess, we unfold, clutching firm
Letting me panic for sure

Say it, say it, that it's done
I want it, want it, need it done
Say it, say it, that it's done
I want, it want it, need it done
