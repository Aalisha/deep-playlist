When you said that you were leaving
I thought I was gonna die
But I'm sick and tired of grieving
I've got to find a reason why

If love is not the answer
Then tell me what it's gonna be
If love is not the answer
Why the hell did you give it to me

Because it ain't enough
Just to call it love
It ain't enough
...
