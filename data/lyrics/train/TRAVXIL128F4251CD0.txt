LRC by lzh, from jiangxi pingxiang
do you know what I know
where the light hits the dark
we can brighten the world
with the smallest of sparks
do you see what I see
past the lies and mistakes
we can make or we can break
we've got all that we need
where gonna learn sometimes
where gonna fall sometimes
where gonna get burnt sometimes
but we can always start again
