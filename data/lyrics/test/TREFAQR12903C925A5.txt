Well I'm looking for my baby
And when I found my baby
I'm going to kick back the rugs
I'm gonna pull down the shades

Well, I know everything gonna work out fine
Just me and my baby and a glass of wine
On a Saturday night, oh yeah
On a Saturday night

Listen, if we're gonna have a good time
And it might as well be a good time
