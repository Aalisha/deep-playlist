The moon sits above the streets
Echo the beats of the lonely city feet
As my heart sits inside it's cage
Talks across the page
Where songs for you are made

Oh it's only been pain loving you
You're my dues to pay
I hunt down the night that brought you here
And made you this way
'Cause I just can't wait

As I wake up turn to put on my makeup
Trying to shake up the shape I'm in
As I stumble in and out of bars
...
