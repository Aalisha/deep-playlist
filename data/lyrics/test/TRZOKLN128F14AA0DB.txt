Hey, Mister Bartender
Please don't be so slow
I got time for one more round
And a six pack to go

Tomorrow mornin's Sunday
I'm gonna be feelin' low
So please, please, bartender
I wanna six pack to go

I've been drinkin' all day long
Takin' in the town
I've done spent my whole paycheck
Justa honky tonkin' 'round
...
