(Ronnie Dunn)

Well I'm flyin' high and feelin' low
Drinkin' hard and dancin' slow
I'm gonna shine my buckle to George Jones
Heartaches are hot on my heels, bartender the race is on

She's gone for good and I'm goin' to town
I'm gonna live it up, ya livin' her down
Jos√© pick me up and get me on my feet
So I can scoot a boot to that two-four jukebox beat
