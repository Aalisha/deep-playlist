This is it, this is it
You show me who your loyalty is sleeping with, didn't you?
Let it die, this time I'm gonna let it die
I'm left here with the pieces of another try, nothing new
And I have never felt as humiliated as I do right now
And I don't know how I'm gonna get out of this with my head held high
But I'm gonna try
So turn the lights on and leave
Remember how I loved you when you ached and you need
Remember how I offered to be there when you turned
Remember when you burned what you had, what you had
And all that ever starts gotta stop, and all I know for certain is my hearts had enough
