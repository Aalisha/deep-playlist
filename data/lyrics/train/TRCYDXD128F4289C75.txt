People think I'm crazy to keep on lovin' you
After all the changes you put me through
But they don't understand the nature of my love
You can turn your back on me but I will never give you up

It's an unconditional love I have for you
And it just gets stronger no matter what you do
Undeniable feelin', forever true, oh, unconditional love

I don't care how long it takes to get to you
Some day I know I'll see my dream come true
Until I have you I've got nothing but time
