I say, watch me now deep into my eyes
to see how life is slipping away from my hands
So sick I feel inside this head
This suffering cannot be shared

I became the living icon of weakness
It burned emotions, made me reveal your lies
I'm the incarnation of suffering
I'm the harvester of your lies

Your lies make a man like me
close my eyes
