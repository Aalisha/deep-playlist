Well I woke up this mornin'
Looked outdoors
I can tell my milk cow
I can tell by the way she loathes
If you see my milk cow
Please drive her on home
'Cause I ain't had no milk and butter
Since that cow's been gone

Well you gotta treat me right honey
Day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down upon your knees and pray
'Cause you're going to need me
You're gonna need my help someday
