Carry on, carry on
The chanting has begun
A hymn of fame and glory forever

And ride on, ride on
In union we are strong
A symphony for freedom and glory

We are strangers in a strange land
We are born as renegades
And show the world what they should see

We are standing at the crossroads
Revolution is our way
We're breaking down the walls of hate

Carry on, carry on
...
