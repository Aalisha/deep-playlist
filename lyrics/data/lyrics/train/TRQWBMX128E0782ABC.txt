It's a dark and empty room
The sun beating hard on your door
Feel emotion roar within you
You're flesh and blood like anyone

Make some sense of your life
Move your hand and make the mark
I don't know why you're so confused
You're flesh and blood, there's no excuse

And the hunger inside
Won't go away, it's starting to rise
And the longer you hide
...
