Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how you set me free, oh lonesome me
A bad mistake that I'm made just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and face the town
A lovesick fool, I'm blind and just can't see, oh lonesome me
I'll know she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
