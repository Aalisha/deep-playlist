The clock strikes ten
Out on the streets again
I been looking for something to please me since I don't know when
Out on the dark side of town
Another rumbles gone down
And life on the high side isn't what this boys about

She's got something I want man, it's something I need
It takes more than the night to satisfy me...
I stand accused
That I can always run to you
Any road that you choose
I can always run to you
I stand accused
I can always run to you
I run to you
...
