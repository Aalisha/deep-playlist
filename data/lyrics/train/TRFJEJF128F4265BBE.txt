I think about the good times
We shared together
Whenever I think of you

Something goes through my mind
Through my mind

My heart starts churning
I wanna see you again

I think about the good times
Nothing but the good times
I think about the good times
We shared together

Oh, like holding hands
Remember how we made our plans
We used to dream on a star
How did we get like we are

I think about the good times
Nothing but the good times
I think about the good times
