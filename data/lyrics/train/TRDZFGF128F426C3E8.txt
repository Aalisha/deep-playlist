What a perfect day to climb the stairs into the clouds
What a perfect day to be uncovered from beneath a shroud
A voice from every corner screams "so nice!" into my ears

"Enough" I say
"Shut up" I say "Enough's enough"
I wouldn't give you any waste
I wouldn't give you any taste of anything at all

Did I really scrape the sky?
