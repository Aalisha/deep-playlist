Can't play pretty tunes
My head is always messy and
I can't walk in a straight line,
My path is always, always gritty and
I like to play piano but it's often out of tune and
There are lots of broken fingers
In the dark parts of my room

Please don't touch
Please don't stop and stare
Yes, I thank you for your kindness
But there's sadness in the air
Please don't touch
'Cause it makes me jitter, and

Although I lost my mind, sir
I think you lost yours quicker
Please don't Touch

Love me tender,
Love me true,
...
