He says she said that the counters in the room was a paranoia
It's hard to believe the walls can breathe
But I see it in my eyes
I see it in my eyes

Pretty girls with painted faces
Dancing for the boys
Crazy dreams just how it seems
As you know she slowly passed me by

Coming home, oh-oh-oh
I'm coming home, oh-oh-oh
Coming home, oh-oh-oh

Flying high to paper skies
