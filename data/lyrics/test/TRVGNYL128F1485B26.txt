Run they said to a promised land
Run and find us a helping hand
Don't come back till the sun is gone
Don't come back till the war is won

A cold wind covered up a line in the sand
All so young

And oh do you know what I'm saying
Strike a light to guide us
Somewhere
Tempest swells our worlds collide
Arrows from above and the salt in our eyes
Then as the sky began to bruise
