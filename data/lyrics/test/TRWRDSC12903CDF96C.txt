Shot to the head
As he falls to the ground
Humanity runs in fear
Body stood still
Fluids drained from the brain
The sound of death has appeared
Rushed to the room needing critical help
His pulse begins to fade
Drawers of death where his body last laid
His skin will meet the blade

Sentence has arrived
I will rip his skin to shreds
Bloody hands galore
And that's what everybody dreads
Taking one step back
As I dive in for more
Incisions to his heart
That's what necropsy is for

Skin the dead
