I went to a cobbler to fix a hole in my shoe
He took one look at my face and said, "I can fix that hole in you"
"I beg your pardon, I'm not lookin' for a cure,
I've seen enough of my friends in the depths of the godsick blues"

You know I am a liar
You know I am a liar
Nobody helps a liar

'Cause I've been down to Dixie and dropped acid on my tongue
Tripped upon the land 'til enough was enough
...
