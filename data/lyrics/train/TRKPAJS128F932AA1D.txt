Across fallen lands and seems
For the infinity of time
With the reflex with god
You have to fight
Fight this is your time
In the free world.
Come on!
Fight this is your life
You gotta make this wibe. x2
TOMSON
Don't be a afraid
In the situation
When they stand to face your fade
WOZZ
It does not perform attacking mind but a fight to fade you wis
TOMSON
You gotta come now speed the fire of your heart eyy
WOZZ
