He said I did something really stupid today
He said I did something really stupid today
Well can I bounce, bounce a rock off your head?
Can I pronounce, pronounce you dead?
Can I bounce, bounce that rock off your head?

So you're kickin' back into a once kicked habit
Outta boredom
'Cuz you were sharing
Kickin' back in and kickin' back
Just sharin'

When you start lying to youself
Then don't come running back to me
I still remember the pathetic mess you used to be
