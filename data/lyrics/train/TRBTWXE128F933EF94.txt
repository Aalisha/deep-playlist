Say you to me
You're a bird with an eye for anything shiny
Searching the land
For a hero of a man
You say I need
More than my fair share of attention
But I think you know
That just isn't so

Underneath
I felt the fire of a burning question
Tearing me apart
Right from the very start
And now I see
That it don't take a trick of the light to excite me
So strong, so long
You'll see

Hold on
To what you
Been given lately
Hold on
To what you
Know you got
Hold on
