Hold it up
My diamond in the rough
I always thought that it would be so easy
Let it out
It's never like you were so empty
And tired
And I can hardly take it here

I won't give up again
As tired as I am
With everything I can
I won't give up again

Wake me up
My inspiration seems
My mind is like a prison bound to hold me
Force it out
The damage has been done
We're broken, departed
...
