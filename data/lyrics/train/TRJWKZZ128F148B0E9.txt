I've been waiting up for you to rescue me,
To come around and cover everything.
Relying on my best memories,
To breathe for me, breathe for me'

So much better than all of this, all of this.

I'm tired of singing all the sad songs in my head,
But I can't find enough of anything to drown out what you said.
And sometimes i find i catch myself letting you back in
And im so tired of singing all the sad songs in my head.
