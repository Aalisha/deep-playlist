move on up you're such a sexy groover
when you get on down you're better than another
move on up it's such a hot sensation
when you get along get along get along
oh I could rule this nation
get on down you tie me up now baby
you just tie me up
there's no time for maybe

coz I'm a lady lady lady easy lady
lady playin' passion through the night
coz I'm a lady lady lady easy lady
