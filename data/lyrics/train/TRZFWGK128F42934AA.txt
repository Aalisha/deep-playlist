Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

I'm in love with Los Angeles
I'm in love with her soul
I'm in love with the nightlife baby
I love rock'n'roll

Calm down everybody has gone fearless
No one goes count it out
There's gonna be a lot of people getting high tonight.
One named Sheila, one named Stephanie
Goddamn then girls go get to me
I spent all my time chasing women around

I'm in love with Los Angeles
I'm in love with her soul
I'm in love with the nightlife baby
I love rock'n'roll
