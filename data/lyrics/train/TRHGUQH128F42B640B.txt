another night on the town
steppin' out, jivin' around
don't know where you're going,
all dressed up for no one
singles bars, they get you down

but you're going somewhere just cause it's loud
puttin' on your cool for the crowd
you tell them you ain't lonely,
but you're dying to meet
Mr. One And Only to sweep you off your feet,

and there'll be no love in the morning
it's gonna be so cold in the morning
he's all gone in the morning
he won't give you no love in the morning
