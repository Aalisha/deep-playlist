They say you're a fool they feel you resisting
They tell you you'll never go very far
But they'll be the same ones that stand in the distance
And fall in the shadow of your shining star.

Just keep on the same road and keep on your toes
Just keep your heart steady as she goes
And let them call you what they will
It don't matter a rose by any name is still a rose.

The kindess of strangers it seems like a fable
But they get to seek what I see
