You're on my mind, I'm in the dark
You're takin' your time, I'm fallin' apart

Girl, you hold my mind in your hands and you know it
I'll get it right if you'll give me the chance to come closer
I'll give you my heart if that's what you're after
I'll give you my love and that's all that matters, think it over
