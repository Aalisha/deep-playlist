Jackass Yolo
The smell of fall.
Changing season.
The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path
the chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.
Imprisoned souls.
Trapped for eternity.
Black crows break the silence.
The garden of the dead's alive tonight and you can't stop it.
Just enjoy it.
Open up your mind and you will feel it too.
The sound, the touch, the thoughts, that you've been so blind to.
You can feel the thoughts of the dead.
