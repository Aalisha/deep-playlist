Scattered thoughts, scattered brains
What you know about it baby? What you know about it baby?
Scattered thoughts, scattered brains
What you know about it baby? What you know about it baby?
I've been running round in circles
And I keep coming back to no one to find
And I've been dealing with these women
So confused on these feelings, so I leave them behind
I've been tryna find different
But really what's the difference when they seem to collide?
Then she end up in my bed, something that I said
Then she thought she was mine

Are you still down baby? Still down baby?
Are you really 'bout that life? Are you really 'bout that life?
Are you still down baby? Still down baby?
Is you down for the ride? Is you down for the ride?
Here we go again, here we go again
Why can't you let it go? Cause I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
