Poor guy that man John Thomas
His woman truly was a devil
And she wasn't all that honest
She tore him down on every level

You're a no good lazy motherfucker
Got a, a shit job you worthless motherfucker
You're a, a dead beat feel sorry for your mother
If I had time I'd trade you for another

He don't like that
He wants his life back
He wants to go back home
