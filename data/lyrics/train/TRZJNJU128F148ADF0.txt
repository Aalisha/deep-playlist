Two in the mornin', telephone rings
Somehow I knew it who was
Cause baby it's always the same old thing
When you need my love

You say it's over again and again
This time you've had enough
Girl, I know you've been fightin' with him
When you need my love

Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
