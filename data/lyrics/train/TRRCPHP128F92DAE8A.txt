Here you go jacket down
Timbs off
Remote control
And there you go
Off into outer space
Distant from me
Where do you go
Your eyes are closed
I'd like to know

I stop

Sit next to you because you seem so blue and pray nothings wrong

Baby I don't want to see us burn down and go up in smoke
No, no, no, no, no
Talk to me, break it down, spell it out, spell it out for me

Talk to me, break it down, spell it out, spell it out for me
But when I push

Begins the riff
You take off and there I sit
