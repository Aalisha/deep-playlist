super soul sista
super soul sista

tell u bout a lady, i said she taste like sweet potato pie
she can drive u crazy yeah, u know the girl don't even have to try
with that sexy kinda feel yeah, when she's clingin' close to me
hot and heavy breathin' well, you know that's how luv is suppose to be

she's a super soul sista, no man can resist her
(?) she knows a million ways of messin' up my life
