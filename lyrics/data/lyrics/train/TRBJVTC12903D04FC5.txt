You won't find me in your handbook of heroes
You won't see me in your hall of fame
All the girls they come around
And remove the mystery, oh

Do you get the picture?
I can get embarrassed too, you know
I would be your perfect host
I would vaseline my teeth for you

I'd be counting on a brave exhibition
