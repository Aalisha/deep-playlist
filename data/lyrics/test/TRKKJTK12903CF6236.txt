The light is fading from my room
As night time comes around too soon
I'm so afraid.
Swollen eyes portray my pain
As tears fall like the summer rain
I'm so alone

Son of a bitch you broke my heart
I need a little loving
To take away the pain
How could you let me down
When I'm in your care.

I pull the covers to myself
Drink and smoke upon his breath
I close my eyes.
Again i pray to God above
