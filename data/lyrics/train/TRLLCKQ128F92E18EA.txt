My mama done tol' me,
when i was in pig tails
my mama done tol' me,
hon! a man's gonna sweet talk
and give ya the big eye;
but when the sweet talkin's done,
a man is a two face
a worrisome thing
who'll leave ya t'sing
the blues in the night
Now the rain's a fallin',
hear the train a callin'
whoo-ee (my mama done tol' me)
...
