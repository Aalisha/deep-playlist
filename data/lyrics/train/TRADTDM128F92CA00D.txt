***, we tryin' to get it all together
And spend a lil' cheddar and fly in any weather ***
And homie you can get the money and the power
Then them *** come and holla and fly in any weather pimpin'

***, we tryin' to get it all together
And spend a lil' cheddar and fly in any weather ***
And homie you can get the money and the power
Then them *** come and holla and fly in any weather pimpin'

I see you haters, hatin' on the way a n**** think
But I'm laughing, laughing all the way to the bank
And I, I kinda act like my s*** don't stink
On a toilet with the burner taped under the sink

Like a Russian I'll rullet the bullet
Yeah, straight to ya head give a n**** a mullet
I'm a Cash Money brother a lover of money
Yeah, the tummy is showin' but the hunger is growin'

What part cha' don't understand, what you ain't know I'm like Kobe
You *** can't check me go head Bowens
And I never left the team 'cause I'm catchin' every pass
Stunna McNabb yeah, he like go head Owens yeah

Bet I'd put a n**** on his ***
Squlou and Big Whop make show he don't last
And young Wayne do song about the story
With Birdman singin' on the chorus, ***

***, we tryin' to get it all together
And spend a lil' cheddar and fly in any weather ***
And homie you can get the money and the power
