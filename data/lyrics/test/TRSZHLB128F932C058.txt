So if it's cool, I want you
I love you until you're
Black and black and black and blue
Till the police comes through
What... can't hear you
What... you ashamed of me
Come on... got a little secret


It's on the hush, only you and I will know
It's on the hush, it's on the hush
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
Only you and I will know
It's on the hush, only you and I will know
...
