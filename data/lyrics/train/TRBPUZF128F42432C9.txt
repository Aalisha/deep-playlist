Tried to find both my life and my love
Took the time to write down all my thoughts
Found that I need to let go of you (Let go of you)
All of my worst insecurities

'Cause I've got the tendencies
Of dancing away at anything alarming
And so...

Can you, will you
At least attempt to stay now
Just turn around
I'll make you break through
Never betray you
And now I know that I
Can't go back on all those promises I shredded but
Can you, will you
At least attempt to stay now
