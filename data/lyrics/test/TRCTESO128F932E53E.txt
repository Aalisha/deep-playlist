Something sweet in your nose
Tells you where to go
Seems as if you're never on your own
So you sneak just to see what it is
it's the heat, or maybe its just a kiss.

i may not be concerned
but i care, if she is there
to die for you
would she die for you
be there in your gloom
when you're calling her name
untill the end
'till the end of the noon
...
