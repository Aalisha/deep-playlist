My love is bigger than your love
We take more drugs than a touring funk band
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it

My band is better than your band
We've got more songs than a song convention
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it

And we're all going straight to hell
