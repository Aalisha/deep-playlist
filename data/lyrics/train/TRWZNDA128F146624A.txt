After the dance is over and I m alone
I sit by myself and wonder who s taking you home
It could have been oh so different, I guess I m just a fool
To live by a single promise, I couldn t play by the rules

And I keep pretending we re still in love
Over and over, still thinking of you
Dreams come true

So after the dance is over and I melt away
