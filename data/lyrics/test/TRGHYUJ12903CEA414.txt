I had a girl and her name was Eve
Every time I'd hit her she would holler "Police"
Cook them biscuits, cook 'em brown
Done talkin' I'll tear it around
If you catch another mule kickin' in your stall
Then you gotta tear it down

Chorus:
Oh, tear it down (bed, slats and all)
Oh, tear it down (bed, slats and all)
Oh, tear it down (bed, slats and all)
