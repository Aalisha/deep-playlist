I pulled into Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead

Take a load for free

And and and

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide

When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on let's go downtown"
She said, "I gotta go my but friend can stick around"
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And and and

I pulled down, Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just ol' Luke and Luke's waiting on the Judgment Day
"Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"
