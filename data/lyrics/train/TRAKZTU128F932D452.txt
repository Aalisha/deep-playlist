(Paul Gurvitz/Nick Trevisick)

You keep me waiting, and I don't understand
But I'm trying hard to keep my cool
No use in hiding, I know where you are
'Cause you leave too many clues
Why do you say that you want me
When someone else is holding you
(Someone's holding you)
Oh, I'm always ready to see you
So find the time

(Find the time)
(When will you find the time)
(When will you find the time)
(When will you find the time)

I'm telling everyone that you're still my man
I can hear them laugh behind my back
Oh come on and prove it to me, show me I'm right
'Cause it's time to face the facts
So many lovers all over the place
But they never mean that much to you
(Mean that much to you) no, no
