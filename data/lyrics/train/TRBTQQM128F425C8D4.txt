Rollin' herbals for the verbals
Extractions and distractions

If I had another sack, I would roll it up
I would light it up, then I would pass it around
If I had another sack I would roll it up
I would light it up, then I would pass it around

If I had another sack I would roll it up
I would light it up, then I would pass it around
If I had another sack I would roll it up
I would light it up, then I would pass it around

Joints, blunts and a bong
Any which way, I can never go wrong
I smoke bud all night, all day, all night
Whatever time, it's the right time for me

You know what time it is
I'm down with tha P H A R Cyde
