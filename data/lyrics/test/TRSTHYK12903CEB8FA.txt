It's the latest, it's the greatest,
Mashed Potato, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
A Mashed Potato started long time ago
With a guy named Sloppy Joe,
You'll find this dance is so cool to do,
Come on baby, gonna teach it to you.
Mashed Potato, peel it to me now,
Mashed Potato, come on and twist your feet now baby,
It's the latest, come on honey,
It's the greatest, come on baby,
Mashed Potato, yeah, yeah, yeah
And then this dance just through and through,
They look for records they can do it to,
