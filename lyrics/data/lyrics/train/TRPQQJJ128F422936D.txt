We've drained full confession booths
Polluted drinking wells with our repentances
And then stood grinning with our arm
Around our shoulders of a rotting child

Hold that pose, provisional arrogant little pigs
Who devour their siblings

Shoot that dog if we can't afford to feed

Famine fathered a moth
Famine fathered a moth that begot our fathers

Keep your voices down, I'm sneaking out
Hey, what's the big idea?
Keep your fucking hands off the insight
