Everyday
Everyday
Everyday
Oooh
Everything I ever hear you say I know
I feel, Oh Yeah
Ooh Yeah

No more time left to think about it
Been so long now I've been without it
Always moving, Gotta reach the other side
Now I know how hard it could become
Don't let it show,
No never assume that I don't realise

Gotta say what's on my mind
Gotta leave it all behind
Gotta say this straight to you
Cos no longer can I hide

Everyday that I'm without you
All I see
Everywhere another reason to believe
Everything you never hear me say you know
I feel, Ooh yeah
Everytime I close my eyes
You're on my mind
Everyday and night
I don't wanna be alone
But everyday I let you go
Another time

Yeah

On my own
My thoughts are playing
With all the things that you've been saying
You say you're sorry for the things
That you've done
To my life
Yeah, yeah
I never know where it is that you came from
Don't wanna miss a thing
But maybe it's already gone
