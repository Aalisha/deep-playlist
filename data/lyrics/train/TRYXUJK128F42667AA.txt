Well I'm-a going back down maybe one more time
Deep down home, October Road
And I might like to see that little friend of mine
That I left behind once upon a time

Oh, promised land and me still standing
It's a test of time
It's a real good sign

Let the sun run down right behind the hill
I know how to stand there still till the moon rise up
Right behind the pine, oh lord
...
