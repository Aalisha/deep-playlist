It's not that I don't love you anymore
No it's not that I don't want you anymore

No it's not that I don't need this to be true
And I'm calling on all stations just to get through

We have done nothing wrong
But now you're all I know

I will never bow to you again
I have found a place to lie
And you should know
I vow to save this country
From all the lies
