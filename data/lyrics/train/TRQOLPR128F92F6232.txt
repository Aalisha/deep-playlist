when you find it in your heart look this way and lu never stop
when you can't find what words to say l'll know what you mean anyways
and ydu kndw what you're doing
you gel right on up to it
1 said lord now i1's alright come on just take ydur time
if you feel the night and the modo is tight but you know it and you can seethe l1ght butthere's no end in sight butyou know
1 tell you somebody knows what you're talking about 1 tell you somebody knows
1 tell you somebody knows what you're talking about 1 tell you somebody knows
