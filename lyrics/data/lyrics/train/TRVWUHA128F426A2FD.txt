Lost inside this angeltown
Lost like I could not be found
No connections of the heart
Love was glass that broke apart

Gimme faith in dreams and someone to hold
Gimme love 'cause I'm out here in the cold
There are no secrets, no angels at my door

And oh, when you touch my hand, I fall from grace
And oh, when you reach for me, I fall from grace
