When I was young, I was so full of fear
I hid behind anger, and held back the tears
It was me against the world; I was sure I would win
But the world fought back; punished me for my sins
Well, I felt so alone; so insecure
But I blamed you instead; made sure I was heard
They tried to warn me of my evil ways
But I couldn't hear what they had to say

I was wrong.
Self-distruction's got me again
I was wrong...
I realize now that I was wrong
...
