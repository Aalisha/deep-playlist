Only come here once a day at hurtin' time
Payday, Charley knows I'm good for every dime
And I ease up on the barstool where I ease my pain
I'm just strong enough to face that lonely night again

Oh the power, the powers of drinkin'
And it's foolin' all of my native thinkin'
And it hurts so good I never notice the sinkin'
...
