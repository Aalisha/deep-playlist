We could be away from here
By ten o'clock tonight
Pennies won't get us to heaven, I know
But a borrowed car just might
Look through my wallet
There's enough for a hotel room
But no, no, no, you say
"I wanna stay in and get wet with you".

Why do you take the opposite view?

We could be different people tonight
Who do you want to choose?
I'll book a table in a suit and tie
