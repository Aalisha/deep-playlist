Like a spotlight that breaks into the darkness
Like an arrow that's racing to it's target
I got you in my sight
I am fixed on you
And I can feel you calling looking for me too

Nothing's gonna stop me 'cause I'm on a mission
I'm getting ready for a demolition

Collide, crash into me
Collide, I want to be broken by you
And made brand new
...
