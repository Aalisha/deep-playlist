Life is what u make it, ya flows are makeshift, i draw this of inspiration, you trace shit. patience been my life story, they say the trials almost over and i can taste the glory. its hard to ignore me with this big ass chain or this bright ass watch, all this big ass bling, one thing about it see its more than a name, stay the hell wit the verses, still the re-up gang, 2 zero comma five a key, the peace symbol front of the v, fuck gold digger bitches my set be freaks uh, momma i means no harm ya lack classic charm but i aint got it eather, accustomed to a certain way of livin, only know 2 ways of getin, either rap or un-wrap, if u aint get it you aint livid, so if u aint get it ya money tall as midget, P.

you mad huh, i know u like my style, you got to feel us, its the real one unfamiliar, not to ever let you know ma, the ultimate flow you know dope baby.
you mad huh, i know u like my style, you got to feel us, its the real one unfamiliar, not to ever let you know ma, the ultimate flow you know dope baby
