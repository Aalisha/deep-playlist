When I'm needin' a friend, I can talk to the wind
God, I sure am glad that I found him
Sometimes he seems to be the only one beside me
Who can feel the Lord's breath all around him

Winter's cold frozen ice or a bright autumn day
On a warm summer night you can hear him say

Cry for me, sigh for me, sad my breezes flow
Stay for me, play for me, the song my friends will know
My lonely wind must blow
