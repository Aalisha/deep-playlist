The waves are pounding on the sand tonight
I want to take your hand and make it feel so right
I know I'm ready and I'll never be like this again

The sky is trembling and the moon is pale
We're on the edge of forever and we're never gonna fail
I know you're ready and we're running on the back of the wind

And my body is burning like a naked wire
I want to turn on the juice, I want to fall in the fire
I'm going to drown in the ocean and the bottomless sea
I want to give you what I'm hoping you'll be giving to me

And when the waves are pounding on the sand tonight
I want to take your hand and make it good and make it right
...
