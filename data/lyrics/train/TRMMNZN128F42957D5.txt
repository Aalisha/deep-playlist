It was all his fault,
introduced me to knowitall and the (cannibal)

By the time they started showing up,
I ran the risk of blowing up
These times, these times get tough
So if i stay we're going to see who's had enough

By the time i needed backing up,
ya he was watching, cracking up
This time, this time it's tough
Well, here I am and now and I think I've had enough

(Ahh...) Stand back!
Take that and that and that

You're always up to no good
Ya you're always up to no good
