As I look back now it's exactly how you said
But it made no difference to the life that I led
The route that I took may mean that I learnt hard
But you only get one chance to make things play the way you're dreamin' of
I didn't know then
but then what the fuck is life for
I still regret it,
but now I strong than before
And this strength will open up new doors
See things I never saw before
...
