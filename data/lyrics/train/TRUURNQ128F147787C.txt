It's a sad affair
When there's no one there
He calls out in the night

And it's so unfair
At least it seems that way
When you gave him his life

And all this time he's been getting you down
You ought to pick him up when there's no one around
And convince him, oh just talk to him
'Cause he knows in his heart you won't be home soon
'Cause he's an only child in an only room
