Why do you run why do you hide oh don't you know I
just, just want to be with you, to be with you

Looking down from above as you watch TV
Wondering why, oh you're ignoring me
Do you remember, remember when i came to you
And you loved me
And i'm waiting for you
And i'm waiting for you

Why do you run, why do you hide oh, don't you know I
just, just wanna be with you, to be with you
Hey, why do you run, why do you hide oh, don't you know
