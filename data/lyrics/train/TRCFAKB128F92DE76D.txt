Special, yeah, on de verse, step on it, one more time
Yeah, aye!

I was just, a little too late
When she stepped, out of my gate
What am i gonna do, now that im feelin blue
Now i know, the way that she loves me

Cause shes ah heartbreaker, yeah
Tell ya she need you
Love an then leave you
Shes ah heartbreaker yeah,
I thought she was mine
Guess i was blind
Shes ah heartbreaker, yeah
Tell ya she need you
Love an then leave you
Shes ah heartbreaker, yeah
I was too late, she wouldnt wait
