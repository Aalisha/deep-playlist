Your eyelids are made of lead
You can't keep them up 'cause its sleepytime
And that's no crime in the western world
Cause when the sun goes down you’re bound to follow through
Sleepin' through the afternoon
I just can't seem to leave my room waiting for the moon and a love so true
It's gonna see me through
You know it's gonna see me through

'Cause when the sun goes down it’s gonna make that dream come true
Sleeping through the afternoon
I just can’t seem to leave my room waiting for the moon and a love so true
...
