(Written by: L. Rutledge & W. Dane)

These day it's a cold reality, living life on the street
No time left to bite the hand that feeds
The lure of money corrupts the weak, and soon they fall

Little boy turns to man with a weapon when
he's poisoned with crack
This time it was his turn to dies
Fate call his number in a bloody goodbye

Play war games, crack cocaine, all for material gain
Stray gunfire an innocent dies
...
