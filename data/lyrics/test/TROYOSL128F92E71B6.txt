No rules, no pain, no fear and no reason
Full moon, we're insane
Two time and one big treason

There is fire in the air tonight
A wicked sensation
Stick waving, dick waving
Trial-run of procreation

Lady don't you leave us in a mess
Take the bow and shove it up your ass

Go die or rock tonight
No tradeoff - there's just dead or rock
...
