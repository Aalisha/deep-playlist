I Love my Faygo, my Nyquil pills, Shaggy, I love my buddies, my Hatchetman, but I love my axe

My axe is my buddy, I bring him when I walk
Me and my axe will leave your head outlined in chalk
My axe is my buddy, he always makes me laugh
Me and my axe cut bigot spinal cords in half
My axe is my buddy, and when I wind him back
Me and my axe will give your forehead a buttcrack
My axe is my buddy, I never leave without him
Me and my axe will leave your neck a bloody fountain

(Chorus 2x)
Everybody everybody everybody run
Murdering murdering murdering fun
Swing swing swing
Chop chop chop
Swing swing swing
Chop chop chop

My axe is my buddy, we right the planet's wrongs
Me and my axe leave bigots dead on richie lawns
