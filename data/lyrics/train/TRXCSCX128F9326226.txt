Now it's time I packed up, gotta leave.
The day's nearly here and I've yet to sleep.
I'm combing the dirt with my hands again,
Desperate to find my elsewhere.

The pain's just arrived, suitcase in the hall.
Made up her bed, ready to give it all.
Stirring a spell in my head.

I'm not ready if that train's comin'.
Let me belong, here in the wind,
with the sun that greets my skin.
