It was six in the morning when I made the county line;
There's someone I've got to talk to, can't get it off my mind.
He is just a kid, and he's in a pretty rough spot;
Two dimes to make a phone call, that's about all I got.

How's my boy today? I know it's been three weeks;
But you know how far I've got to go these days to make ends meet.
How's your mama now, with her new live-in friend?
Oh, how I hate the wounds that never seem to mend.

You said, "I don't call him daddy, but he takes care of things.
When you pick me up on Friday, are you gonna bring me anything?
Oh, don't worry Dad, you know, it don't matter what we do;
Cause I don't call him daddy, he can never be like you."
