Some people think they're always right.
Others are quiet and uptight.
Others they seem so very nice (nice nice nice oh-ho).
Inside they might feel sad and wrong (oh no).
Twenty-nine different attributes.
Only seven that you like (oh-ho).
Twenty ways to see the world (oh-ho).
Twenty ways to start a fight (oh-ho).

(Oh don't don't) Don't get up.
I can't see the sunshine.
I'll be waiting for you baby,
'Cause I'm through.

Sit me down.
