Round, round baby round, round
Spinin' 'round on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
An' I'll ride still fired on the beat down low
I don't need nobody got my honeys
When I go round, baby round round
Spinnin' 'round on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
(Free free free free)

When your still in my face
You're messing with my brain
If you're trying to resist me
Then you better think again
If you move to my music
The music's got to give
If I'm too complicated
That's the way I want to live

If you hate me
I will show you
How to break me
Into something new
If you want me
Run away now
If you stop me
Then I'll hit the ground
(And we go, And we go)

Round, round baby round, round
Spinnin' 'round on me
I don't need no man
Got my kicks for free
An' I'll ride still fired on the beat down low
