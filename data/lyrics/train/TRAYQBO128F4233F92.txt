Written by Tommy Shaw, Jack Blades, Ted Nugent

I don't want to talk
That much about anything
And I don't want to know
About who you been seeing
My will is on
And I can't say no
The feeling's strong
But I can't let go
Baby
You got me living this side of hell
Living this side oh well
You got me salivating
Was it Pavlov's intention
Living this side of hell
I don't know much
About wide-eyed innocence
Or hanging around
