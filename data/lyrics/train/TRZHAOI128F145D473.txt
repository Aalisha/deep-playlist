While I was standing I saw
Two men before my eyes, Isaw
One man all dressed in truth
The other man was dressed in lies
One man held green and gold

And they smiled as they held guns to our heads
While I was standing I saw
Two men before my eyes
Watch as the rain begins to fall
Like tears from heaven on us all
To clean the sins we've made
