When you feel safe when you feel warm
That's when I rise that's when I crawl
Gliding on mist hardly a sound
Bringing the kiss evils abound
In the dead of the night love bites
Into your room where in deep sleep
There you lie still to you I creep
Then I descend close to your lips
Across you I bend you smile as I sip
