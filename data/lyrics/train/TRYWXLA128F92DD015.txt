(J. Davies, D. Farres)
(Original: "Quizás" written by Osvaldo Farrés, Cuba, 1947)

You won't admit you love me
And so how am I ever to know
You always tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

A million times I'd ask you
And then I'd ask you over, again
You'd only answer
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
