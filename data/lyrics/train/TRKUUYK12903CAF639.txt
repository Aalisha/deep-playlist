I saw just what it does
When it's too hard for you to face it
They're still pushing you to make it
It's been nothing new to me
Cause it's all been down before
Four years and we're still counting down
Until all your precious time is wasted
It's been no new news to me

We still haven't grown accustomed to the sound
As they all begin to drown you out
It's all been done before

When your deadlines become my days and nights
I'll take all your favorite lines
When you needed it the most
