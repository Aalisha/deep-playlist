One fat brat and this is how the big boys sound

Some people may be saying that I'm overweight
But I think that my big body is looking great
I used to diet and diet, it don't change a thing
Everyone must accept that I won't be thin

Well it's the way I wanna be
'Cause I'm someone that everybody can see
Well I always stand out in a crowd
I'm the heaviest boy you've seen around

'Cause I'm fat, I'm fat and proud
I'm fat and proud and this is how the big boys sound
Because I'm fat, I'm fat and proud
I'm fat and proud and I'm sure you've seen my butt around

Because I'm fat, I'm fat and proud
I'm fat and proud and the heaviest boy you've found
Because I'm fat, I'm fat and proud
I'm fat and proud and this is how the big boys sound

Would hate to be one of those skinny runts
You can't eat off your stomach or finish your lunch
Well you got no rhythm, well you got no groove
Well you got no blubber that you can move
