I am your dark desire
The one who comes with fire
The one thats gunna make you scream
Too late you will discover
I'm much more than a lover
On pain of fear, your evil dream

Now it's time for
Fire! Battle! In Metal!
I live for the Metal
Metal! Screaming! In lightning!
I fight for the metal and die for the metal

I am the evil soldier
The mighty metal warrior
The one you wish you'd never seen
...
