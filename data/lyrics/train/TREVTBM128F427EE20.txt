How many nights, how many days do I wait here for you?
Have you long forgotten all the things we'd said?
And how many times must I let the phone ring just to get to you?
Could it be that now this love has long gone dead?

No no, the wait hasn't been so long
No oh, I'm sure you're feelin's gone and then
Love, Love feels like a ball and chain
What a fool I've been to fall in love again, I know
Love, Love when will it ever end?
And I don't think that I can ever love again
