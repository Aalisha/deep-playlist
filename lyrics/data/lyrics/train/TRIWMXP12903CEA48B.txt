Man, I sure dig girls

I dig girls who wear a ponytail
Short fat fanny or as thin as a rail
Whoa, whoa, baby, I don't care
She can be a dream lover
Or a nightmare

The big or the small ones
The short or the tall ones
I dig girls, but oh, oh, oh
Yeah, I dig you

I dig girls from Tennessee
New York, Chicago
Or the mighty big beat

Whoa, whoa, baby
I'm telling you
A Tallahassee lassie
Or my Sioux City Sue
...
