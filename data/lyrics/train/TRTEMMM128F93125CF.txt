Angels fall to the floor
Like they would if I was captain
"Silver children," She roared
"I'm not the son of God"
Somebody help me sing
Can anybody hear me?
Liars and lovers combine tonight
We're gonna make a scene

Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Somebody help me sing
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Help me be captain of
Our crippled disguises
I won't show what's underneath
It's time for surprises
...
