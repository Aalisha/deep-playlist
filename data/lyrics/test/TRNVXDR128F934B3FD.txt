Bent across the wall, held she cannot budge
With the broken bottle in my hand I cut her arse like fudge
Blood pours on my shirt, the wench begins to whine
As violent pain and agony tickles up her spine

He laughs and licks his lips as her bowels drop on the floor
Watching as she floods the ground with putrid grime and gore
The pain inside it gets too much, his victim passes out
He stamps and hits and batters hard nad kicks her while she's down
