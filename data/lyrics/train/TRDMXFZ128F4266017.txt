I'm drivin' down the road doin' 95 miles per hour... oh-yeah
My radio's blastin' and I'm passin' cars faster and faster... uh-ha
I'm feelin' kinda down 'cause I left her with a frown, my baby... oh-yeah
We always seem to fight when things are goin' right and maybe... uh-ha

Maybe I should turn around, maybe I should stop
Maybe I should turn around

Chorus:
Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe
Speedin' back to my baby
And I don't mean maybe

You know, maybe I should turn around, maybe I should stop
Maybe I should turn around

I'm lookin' for a station 'cause there's no acceleration to get back
(Speedin' back) oh yeah (speedin' back)
