Walks in like he owns the place
With a smile and a wink on his face
He puts his makeup on for the night
He thinks its time to start with the smiles and antics
He grabs your hand tight, tight enough
But he lets go as soon as he walks in
Naive and soft, you're under a black cloud
It aint gonna shake unless you make this earth quake

Now raise your head, now raise your head
To the crowd
Make him cell bound, make him cell bound
...
