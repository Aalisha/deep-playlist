Oh yeah!

Monday, Tuesday
We were cool.
Wednesday,
I found out 'bout you.

Caught my heart by tellin' lies.
You weren't what you advertised.
But silly me to believe.
Oh! Oh! Oh!

I was unique.
When I'm there you put on a show.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
You gotta go!
'Cause what's true about you?
Who are you when I'm gone?
Wanted to be with you,
Don't know what I was on!

'Cause you got me to forget me.

Oh! Oh Oh!
You know that's true!
