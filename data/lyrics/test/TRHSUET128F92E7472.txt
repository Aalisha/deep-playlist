I really miss drinking chocosho
you'd pick me up discreetly at the end of my road
We would go somewhere quiet and drink them slow

And I really miss taking drives with you
Fires fills and villages we'd pass through
There is not one single thing I'd rather do

Forget about our history if you must
You can find a new guy if you'd like to
But I'm still hooked up on us

Oh, I really miss the spring in my step
The one that I contracted from that bed in which we slept
