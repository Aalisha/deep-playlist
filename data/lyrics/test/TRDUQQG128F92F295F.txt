You make me nervous when you walk
You make me nervous when you talk
You make me nervous, can't you see?
Baby what ya doin' to me (ah hee, ah hee)
You make me nervous with your smile
You make me nervous with your style
You make me nervous, what can I do?
Honey I want some love from you
Well, my heart starts to pound when I see you go by
