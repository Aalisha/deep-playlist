Your mama don't dance and
Your daddy don't rock and roll
Your mama don't dance and
Your daddy don't rock and roll
When evening rolls around
And it's time to go to town
Where do you go to rock and roll

The old folks say that you
Gotta end your date by ten
If you're out on a date
And you bring it home late, it's a sin

There just ain't no excuse
And you know you're gonna lose
You never win, I'll say it again
