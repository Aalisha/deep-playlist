gonna head on out of town 
on a greyhound bus tonight 
you can say that it's a retreat but i'm not 
fighting 
broken tatooed heart 
like words and promises 
and i've seen just too many wrongs for righting 
bitterfree -- the road that lies ahead 
two blue eyes, focused rage 
dear god i'm seeing red 
i'm free 
free of you 
...
