My shadow left my mind and went a walkin' 'round and found a nickel on the ground 
And the buffalo upon one side he got up and walked away 
And the indian upon the other side gave out a sigh and said thats better now 
Without the buffalo 
Without the buffalo x 2
Without the buffalo im just and indian 
I'm free and clear 
...
