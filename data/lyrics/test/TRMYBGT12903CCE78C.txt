God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Saved rock and roll for everyone

Love your friend and love your neighbour
Love your life and love your labour
No, it's never too late to change your mind
Don't step on snails, don't climb in trees
Love Cliff Richard but please don't tease
It's never too late to change your mind

God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Put it in the soul of everyone
God gave rock and roll to you
Gave rock and roll to you
Saved rock and roll for everyone
