Climb upon my faithful steed, 
Then we gonna ride, 
Gonna smoke some weed. 
Climb upon my big-ass steed, 
And ride, ride, ride. 

Weeee-eee-eee-eeeee-eeeee-eee-eee-eeeee-eeeee-eeeee-eeeee, 
What's the name of the song, 
Explosivo! 
Don't know what it's about, 
But it's good to go. 
What's the name of my girlfriend 
I don't know, 
But she's built like the shit 
And she's good to go, go, 
...
