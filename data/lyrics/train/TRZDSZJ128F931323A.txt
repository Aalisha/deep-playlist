Lost infidelity
We've never said a word
So black, and white you see
It's all the lies we've heard

In my mind nothing makes sense
I'm nothing you can't have
Cracked up to disagree
It's all we've ever had

You, only you, only you
Only you can't be the one
Only you, only you
Only you can't be the one

Your secret smile so quaint
...
