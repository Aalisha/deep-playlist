Charlie Daniels, Carolina
The Devil went down to Georgia
Nothin' could be finer
Midnight Rider, Allman Brothers Band

I got your country right here
Little bit of rockin'
I got your country right here
Deep fried Southern

I got your country
Grab a beer, pull up a chair
'Cause I got your country right here

Gimme some Waylon
Little bit of that Ramblin' Man
Our country boys can't survive
Can I get a little hand for Hank?
