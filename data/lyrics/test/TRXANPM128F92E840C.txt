I just want it, I could need it
And Iâ€™m just on it, I ain't in it

And I shuffle around
And I hear those familiar sounds
The sounds that I heard before
But I don't wanna hear any more
Just to go where I want 'em to go
As if to say "I told you so"

And if I decide, I could live or die
If I decide, 'cause I could live a lie
If I decide, than maybe, just maybe
I could be saving the right life
The right life
The right life
