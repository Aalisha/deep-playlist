I was certain that I knew you at the tender age of twelve
You'd so often been described by those who said they knew you well
Dark and rugged in your thirties with a smile as bright as your robe

Every teacher, every preacher with the very best intent
Found new ways to hide the mystery replaced by common sense
And to know you was to keep you in my pocket so easy to hold
