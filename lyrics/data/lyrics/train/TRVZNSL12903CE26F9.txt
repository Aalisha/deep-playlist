Try and remember now just what has been done
Enslavement, displacement of every nation
And now to one nation everyone hold their grudge
Kinda make me wonder well which side I'm on
Don't defend the white and I don't defend the black
I defend truth and rights and all of that
Work on situations where I'm at
Hold my position never fall off track

Nah give up my faith!
Through Babylon rage
Ini strive til the end of my days
Rasta courage
Go against society, rasta courage
Babylon rage
Ini strive til the end of my days
Rasta courage
Go against society, rasta courage

I never give up no good vibes
And I never give up no truth
Never trade my sanity for livin in Babylon crew
Vanity will never drive this man insane
This man will walk alongside Jah again
We see all the pressure to conform today
