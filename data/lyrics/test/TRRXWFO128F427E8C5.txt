The night is falling
Exposing the way to your soul
I will be pretending to know
When I hear you calling
You put my mind in a spell

You left me waiting
To let me become what I am
I am so utterly bound to your
Empty promise - I follow the way to your heart

Your stealing time
When you say, "We'll leave behind who we are".
Who we are? Yeah, 

You know I'm just a fool for your heart
