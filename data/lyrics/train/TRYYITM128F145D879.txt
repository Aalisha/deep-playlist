Your brothers they all think I'm crazy
I think it's nothing at all
Today I'm feeling kinda lazy
So I'll be sleeping it off

Once again, it's kinda like a love song
Crazy old fashioned love song

Then she decides that the dogs they belong inside
It's a never ending ride you're taking
I can decide for you, hey
It's kinda like a love song

Some party's happening somewhere else, baby
Here there is nothing at all
Someday I'll be somebody's love slave
