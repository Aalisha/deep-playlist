Beg you listen me, don't be kissin' me til I'm done
unsung champion, a reason like seasoning ah
pepper your thoughts with spice,
and entice you to a space
where I dwell with bass players and layers are loops
think what I think with my prayers its nice
my world is everything I've become
contained in the hum between voice and drum
I'm coming from the same place I'm a still running from
but even sitting in the garden one can still get stung

I'm on Lonely Street age nearly three
Recently Mama's cryin' all the time is it because of me?
Or my younger sister? Even Dad was weeping when he kissed her
Face all Puffy like a blister, cryin' like he missed her
Since we moved away from the house where we use to play
They say I'll understand one day,
but I doubt it, Mama never say nothin' about it
How'd it get to be so crowded I found it a strain,
everywhere I look I see pain
And I can't escape the feelin' maybe I'm to blame
...
