"A thunderbolt in the northern sky...
...and the roaring of a lion"

Swept up by the downy wings of angels
Made from a heaven-laden voice
I float with all the weight of ether
It pilots an aerie merchant ship

Across the phantasmagoric main

Courses waged by hermit to lonesome starry shoes
Bequeath their secret entryways
Lighthouses watch fervently the horizons of the soul
...
