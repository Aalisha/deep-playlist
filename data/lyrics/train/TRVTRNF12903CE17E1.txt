Faustus begin thine incantations,
Take good care to draw thy circle true,
By god must you prevail -
For if you fail these
Demons make a meal of you.

Your soul shall be their meat -
A kingly feast for them to eat,
Beware your future at hand,
Alas for thou art dammed.

[good angel:]
"faustus seek repentance,
Abjure this evil art,
Cease this wretched wickedness
And cleans thy foolish heart,
For the evil that once served you
Has made of you a slave,
And transformed your bed of roses'
To a premature grave."

Then in a mighty flash of light
Before thee mephistopheles appears.
