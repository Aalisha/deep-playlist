Now I'll tell you in Chicago boys, I was broken man
Dirty movies, credit cards and bills past due again
And that son of mine spit in my face and then I tanned his eye
He got a taste of Appalachian pride

That sassy son of mine, he was more than I could take
I loaded wife and kids and dogs and then I pulled up stakes
Back home here in the old home 'stead I've kept him by my side
And filled him with my Appalachian pride
