The weekend's almost done
The moon is low in the sky
I feel like goin' out
Before the night passes by
I won't just sit around
When life becomes a drag
I dance

I like the bass (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like the boom (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I need guitar (turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like that drum when it goes boom boom boom

Let's dance
What the weekend
What the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends
Grab your boyfriends
Sweat it out
Let's dance
(Move your whole body)
(Let's start the party)

Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need someone to dance with me baby
