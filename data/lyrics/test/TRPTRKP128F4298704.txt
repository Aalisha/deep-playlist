Back in school you ever get busted for trying to walk 
and have some administrator tell you 
Son, You construct your obligations,
and try to be different from your peers,
but the responsibility of the future
is gonna find you
gonna find you
gonna find you!

Well I saw this kid get beaten down, because he was out of luck
In the lottery of acceptance in the school of growing up.
Saw a bunch of convicts doing time inside a cage,
Got locked in factories within the school of paid wage
is gonna find you
gonna find you
...
