All the notebooks in the world can never hold the lives I hold
But I've gotta make them real
It's like covering a bird in solid steel
All of these thoughts that I conceal
Through silence

All the hearts in this red world can never hold the love I hold
But I'm throwing it away
It's like swimming in oceans made of clay
Swimming in circles 'round the bay
So blindly

Well feed me out to the lions
My hearts a lion
...
