Memory wise, memory flies
Memory barely satisfies
The past steals
It's a passing feeling

Memory wise, memory flies
Memory rarely satisfies
The past tense
Tense and bleeding

You can choke
Or you can focus
I wanna forget
I don't wanna forget
I don't wanna forget

Memory knows, memory goes
Memory dulling, but I'm learning slow
The passing heals
The past is healing
