Well, Grandaddy was a hillbilly scholar, blue collar

He came from the school where you didn't need nothin',

If you couldn't make it with your own two hands.
He was backwoods, backwards, used words like:
"No Sir," "Yes, Ma'am," "By God," "Be darned,"
"Hell yeah, I'm American."
And all the years he walked this earth,
I swear all he did was work.
He said: "The devil dreams on an idle horse,
"So you listen to me squirt.

"Don't get too high on a bottle,
"And get right with the Man.
"Fight your fights, find a grace,
"And all the things that you can change,
"And help somebody if you can."
