I have escaped into the middle of nowhere.
Where no can hear you or would ever want to journey.
I have found you the perfect place to spend the rest of your life.
And you're lucky I let you live this long to see it.
I don't care who you are, you're no one tonight.
I don't care you you were, you're nothing tonight.
Hair like sand.
Skin like salt.
She smelled of the sea.
