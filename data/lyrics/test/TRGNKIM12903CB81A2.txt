Well I've seen broken hearts before
And I can tell by lookin' at you
Some sweet little mama took you for a ride and left you standing on the avenue
You suddenly discovered that first time lovers
Are not all sugar and spice
Now you're sittin' here, cryin' the blues askin' me my advice

Chorus:
Well I traveled down that road before
Brother I can sure testify
Your heart starts to achin'
And your hands go to shakin'
You just wanna lay down and die
...
