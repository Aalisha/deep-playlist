(Written by: L. Rutledge, W. Dane, S. Blosl & D. Budbill)

I will not worship your deity
There is no place in your religion for me
Slaves to the vision of a dying world
I malign
One with the universe, one star will shine

Who will be chosen, not one will know
The path to the perfect way, it is slow
All needs and all human traces of thoughtlessness
I resign
I pray to the alien, and we align

Greater understanding really isn't hard to find
...
