Whoa, whoa
Last call now I'm out of time
And I don't got no valentine
Singled out, now I stand alone
The underdog at a modern world
Suburbia's hot tonight
But nothing seems to feel alright

I don't want your sympathy
I just need a little therapy
At least that's what they say to me

Hey, ho, let's go!
I'm gonna start a riot
You don't wanna fight it

One, two, fuck you!
Don't tell me what to do!
I don't wanna be like you

Can't you see, it's killing me?
I'm my own worst enemy
Knock me down, I'll keep on moving
It's the art of losing

Whoa, whoa
