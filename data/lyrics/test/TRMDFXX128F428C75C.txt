Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train
I've run just as far as I can run
If I never see the good old days shinin' in the sun
I'll be doin' fine and then some

How long, how long
Woman will you weep
How long, how long
Rock yourself to sleep

Well I been doin' time in lonesome prison, where the sun don't shine
Just outside, the freedom river runs
...
