W Ballz D.J.)
Oh y'all just wanna do with out the beat
Uh well fuck it we gon' do it like this
On radio station mother fucking 187.4 bitch
W Ballz part two huh?
Peep game broadcasting
Provided by mother fucking emina huh?

(Daz Dillinger) (in background)
Enema!

(W Ballz D.J.)
Emena... not enema... Enema!
I'm saying it baby, I just said it low

(Daz) (in background)
In your ass

(W Ballz D.J.)
In your motherfucking asshole
Ok like this, we gon' clean it up like this, huh punk bitch

(Kurupt)
Man what a bitch, gangster shit
Paws scrap up the cement then bend
I never love me a ho
Just to remind y'all bitches in case you didn't know
I breaks fool all niggas, way cool all niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, sawed off y'all niggas
And I'm quick to pull out
Gangster shit, tell a bitch to stick a dick in her mouth

(Daz Dillinger)
As I skip to my loo C walking, G talking
I'm a gangster cold hearted, sick dumb and retarted
Came up this far without a bullet proof vest (yeah)
Ran with the best, sport khaki's again
Always stay fresh won't settle for less
Looped out, said now

(Soopafly)
Man these nigga on deck
Now it's the pimp of the crew, Soopafly coming through
I got a dick and a couple balls just to name a few
The D P locced out, niggas get choked out
Smoked out niggas and I'll fuck you with no doubt

(Tray Deee)
Gangster gangster tell me how you do it
It seems so simple like there was nothing to it
Ripping, sipping, dipping on the fluid
West Coast nigga, yeah we be the truest
