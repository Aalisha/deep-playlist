Dice are rolling, Knives are out
With thee present danger all around
I don't say they mean harm, but they'd each give an arm
To see us six feet underground
See us 6 feet under ground
It doesn't matter what those morons say

It's Murda I N C Uh, the Lord is calling me
My demons haunt me this really tortures me
'Cause they don't understand me
And while I'm holdin up I know you smilin' down
At all my enemies who wanna see me (six feet underground)

Look at me now hittin' em up holdin it down
'Cause I'm destined to be I know you love to see me
(6 Feet underground) why see do the Devil's Eyes
You vision my demise so may your soul lie
(6 Feet Underground) and before that I believe
That I can fly most people gettin lye my niggas is gettin' by
If you can't see we bitches ya jags, we foward ya last
We Diamonds ya glass, we get pussy yall ass. Give me love
We be wearing gloves tied up in gloves with special 38 slugs
So we don't end up (6 Feet Underground) the butch is hittin em'
The rule is to get rid of em' for those who feel they getting away
Ja we sendin em' (6 Feet Underground) I've feel I've cursed
My body and soul I been outta control ever since I fell in the zone
I want nothin more than to see my niggas eat with me
But my enemies want nothin more than to see me (6 Feet Underground)
