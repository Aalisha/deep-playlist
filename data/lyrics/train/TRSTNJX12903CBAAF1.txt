City of New Orleans Lyrics

Ridin' on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday mornin' rail
There's 15 cars, and 15 restless riders
3 conductors and 25 sacks of mail

All along a southbound oddeusy
And the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past the houses, farms and feilds
Passin' trains that have no names
And freightyards full of old black men
The grave yards of the rusted automobiles

Singin' good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me I'm your native son?
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
...
