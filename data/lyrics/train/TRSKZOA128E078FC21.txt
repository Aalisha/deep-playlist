Catch a fire
on your fingertips
lonely is a place but i don't go there anymore
my desire
i hear from your lips
won't you say again the words my heart is waiting for

Bridge

When i feel
the sumer in your smile
i can take the world on anytime

Chorus

Everyday you make me glow
in the way you let me know
all the feelings you can hide
sunshine on the inside
everyday you make me see
there's no other lover for me
i could never let you go
you make me
you make me glow
...
