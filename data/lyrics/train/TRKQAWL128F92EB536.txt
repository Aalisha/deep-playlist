I should've seen all the signs around me
But I was confortable inside these walls
So go ahead and take another piece of me now
While we all bow down to you

You tear me down
And then you pick me up
You take it all
Untill there is not enough

You try to tell me you can heal me
But I'm still bleeding
And you'll be the death of me
How can you love my friction

If you're the sickness and i'm the cure
Too long I'll fake this addiction
Another sacrifice to make us pure
You tear me down

And then you pick me up
You take it all
Untill there is not enough
You try to tell me you can heal me
...
