I wish you well
I hope you survive
I hope you live, oh baby, so I can watch you cry.
‘Cause I know in time you’ll see what you did to me
And you’ll come running back.

I’m gonna rain on your parade
No, I won’t take it again
And I’ll keep raining, raining, raining over you.

I’m gonna rain on your parade.
No, I won’t take it again.
And I’ll keep raining, raining, raining over you.
