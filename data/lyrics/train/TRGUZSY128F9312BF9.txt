Going down in the same old town down the same street to the same bar
And the same old people saying hi and I don't care
Going down in the same old bar and I don't even order anymore
I am so sick of consequences and the look on your face
I am tired of playing defense
I don't even have hockey skates

You can meet me at ten thirty
I won't be there I'll be gone
We can talk like we are friends
Going over it all again
