I take a stone and put it away
I take the soil and put it aside
Then mixed them as one

I've seen the stars been born
I've tasted the cosmic universe
When the others sold their world
I did create another dimension
I had created another dimension

Forgotten worlds have been terminated
The whole meaning of mankind is gone

Let planets impale the space
Fly through the nortern sky
...
