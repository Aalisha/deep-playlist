I heard from a friend today and
She said you were in town
Suddenly the memories came back
To me in my mind(CHORUS)How can i be strong i've asked
Myself
Time and time i've said
That i'll never fall in love with you
Again
A wounded heart you gave, My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many, I know you did
I come from a place that hurts, God knows how i've cried
