I remember Tommy, I don't remember lies
I remember thinking this time I'm gonna die
But who remembers answers when it's all behind
But I remember Tommy Boy's eyes

That's when he came upon me and asked me for the time
And I believe that he read my mind

He said his name was Tommy, been watching for awhile
Felt as if he knew me and understood my style
