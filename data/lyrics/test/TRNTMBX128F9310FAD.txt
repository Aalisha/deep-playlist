Say, that man of mine, he's as sturdy as a rock
Made out of real good stuff, he's made out of real good stock
With the big strong arms and hands that he has
He knows how to handle me like I was made out of glass

Pretty good lovin'
(Pretty good lovin')
Pretty good kissin'
(Pretty good kissin')

It seems so unreal that this man of steel
Could possess such a tender feel
Let this girl tell the world

Oh, what a good man he is
(Oh, what a good man he is)
Wo, wo, what a good man he is
(Oh, what a good he is)

He makes the fact that he loves me clearly understood
He makes me feel so happy, girl, that he makes me feel so good
He knows that I need lovin' and I don't need neglect
So he comes around me constantly to make sure that I get

Pretty good lovin'
(Pretty good lovin')
