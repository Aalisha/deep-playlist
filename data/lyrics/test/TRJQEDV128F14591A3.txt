Midnight, feels like it's shining on me
Moonlight, taxis rollin' from the sea
Shots in the dark, slaves to the big city beat
Heroes, toasted and sent to the wall
Zeros, bleed you and laugh in your face
My kind of town, anywhere else but this place
But who can walk on the water

I can help this fear of falling
I can help this fear of letting go
I can help this fear of falling
I can help this fear of letting go

Hold on, check out and check out the fools
