I sit alone and hear the raindrops fall
Thinking about the meaning about it all
Trying to make sense of the words you said
While strange questions are running through my head
Now I know that nothing ever changes
You are gone and we are back to being strangers
It hurts me so and I've started to believe
That love meant to turn out wrong for me

And every time I'm staring into space
What I see, is that smile on your face
And even though, you are not here anymore
I can still feel how it was before

And at three, in the middle of the night
When I'm waiting for the morning light
And I'm trying hard to find a way
To play the way I want to play
