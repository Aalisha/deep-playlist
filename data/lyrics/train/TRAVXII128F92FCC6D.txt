Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now tell you what

It's mind control, mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Mind control, it's mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul

Don't let them mould your mind, they want to control mankind
Seems like their only intention is to exploit the earth (hey)
And you trust in their deceit, your mind causes your defeat
And so you become an invention to distort this earth

Propaganda and lies, is a plague in our lives
How much more victimised, before we realise (hey)

It's mind control, mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
