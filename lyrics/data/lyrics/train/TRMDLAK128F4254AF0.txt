I should have known that this would happen from the start
This kind of function's going to have to fall apart
I guess before I would have sworn that we were friends
And in this problem must award some logic trend

Well I still don't understand, what this whole thing's about
And all the words that you said, are somehow stuck in my mouth
This was going so well, but I don't know what I did
All I really can tell is
I've been hit!
I've been hit!
I've been hit!

Well there's only so much drama I can stand
This is just about as far as I will bend
