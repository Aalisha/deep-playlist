Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling,
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee
Ask the angels while they're falling
Who that person could possibly be

And I know you got the feeling,
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor
And I know it got you reelin'
And honey honey the call is for war
And it's wild wild wild wild.

Everybody got the feelin'
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day
Everybody wants to be reelin'
...
