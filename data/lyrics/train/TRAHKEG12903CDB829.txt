Mumbling goodmorning & raising my head
A bad breath kiss to my pillow pet
I take a look at the day turns & stay in bed
Open my eyes when the day have died
I turned the world and I slept allright
Now my daymare is over I zip my jeans tight
Oh lord won't you bless this night...

From the pale lips of a youth who lay
I'm sleeping my day away
And when the night comes to the city I say:
I'm sleeping my day away
Yeah! With my pale lips in the pillow I say:
I'm sleeping my day away
After dark is the game I play
...
