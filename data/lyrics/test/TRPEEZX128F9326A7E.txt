I see you walk around
pushing people out of shame
I see you walk around
you're hung over
I see you walk around
missing every pace you take
I see you walk around
its not over

I see you walk around
wishing you were someone else
I see you walk around searching for attention

Who's that they are sinking in me?
it's burning all over and over again
