First off let me start by saying
I ain't trying to get in your jeans
First I'd rather learn your ups and downs
And everything in between

I wanna know you, your insecurities
Secrets and your needs
I want your mental and your physical too
And once I've got it I won't stop
Until you know you're beautiful

I just wanna make ya feel beautiful
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful

I just wanna make ya feel beautiful
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful
...
