Oh, I won a hero's name with McAlpine and Costain
With Fitz Patrick, Murphy Ash and the Wimpy's gang
I've been often on the road on me way to draw the dole
When there's nothing left to do for Johnny Laing
And I used to think that God made the mixer, pick and hod
So a Paddy might no hell above the ground
I've had ganger's big and tough
Tell me tear that hole out rough
When you're building up and tearing England down

In a tunnel under ground a young Limerick man was found
He was build in to the new Victoria line
When the bonus gang had passed sticking from a concrete cast
Was the face of little Charlie Joe divine
And the ganger man McGurk said big Paddy ate's the work
When the gasmain blew and he flew off the ground
Oh they swore heed send down slack
