[Vinnie P]
Yeah Yeah
Kamachi, Planetary, King Syze

[Chief Kamachi]
Yo, they love the way I pin a champ,
Under a tinted lamp hear my voice blast from a vintage amp.
I kill the reciters of lies,
Get burned by the fire from the light in my eyes.
It's Kamachi, possessed by the pharaoh ways,
Underground like where the dead bone marrow stays.
The spot where you breath is where the arrow lays,
A sideways death for a narrow grave.
My shit hit hard like an Arab raid.
We blow up, ain't no need for a barricade.
They looking for good luck, like a barrel of jade,
They looking, so stuffed when the barrel is sprayed.
Since the five perfect exertions, they waited afraid.
The devil caught from the tower on the table is slayed, pussy.

[Chorus x2]
Fall back, fold up, rappers is so tough,
Until the army roll up banging that cold crush.
We send shots through ya vest and leave your soul touched,
Lock and load up, post up, toast up.
