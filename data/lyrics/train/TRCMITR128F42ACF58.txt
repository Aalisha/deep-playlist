You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it
I know you got soul
If you didn't, you wouldn't be in here
I know you got soul
If you didn't, you wouldn't be in here
I know you got soul
If you didn't, you wouldn't shake that thing
Shake it with the beat
Cause it make me sing
I know you got soul
If you didn't, you wouldn't be in here
I know you got the feeling
The way you move over there
Don't let them clean rep fool ya
I know you don't like a faker
Lighten up, it's okay
And shake your moneymaker
Say yeah, say yeah
Say yeah, say yeah
I know you got soul
