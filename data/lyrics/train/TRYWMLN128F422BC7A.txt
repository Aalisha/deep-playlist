Na na na na naâ€¦ (in the other room)

In the other room, I'm the other girl
I'm another one of your children
it's this other face, this other name
I'm the other girl (want to be in the other room)
when you're calling me, when you're calling me

Your gift
receiving through this
body of mine
is alive, so alive
Your gift
receiving through this
body of mine
is alive, so alive
