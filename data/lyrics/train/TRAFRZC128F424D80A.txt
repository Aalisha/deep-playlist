Here we go
Ground zero bowdown to the countdown
Bringing ruckus around the compass
From the depth of outer space
To the center of the earth
We're getting down for what it's worth
We're getting down for now

We got 3 minutes and we're out of here
The clock is tickin' and we're in the clear
We got 3 minutes and we're out of here
We got 3 minutes and we're out, we're out
We got 3 minutes and we're out of here
The clock is tickin' and we're in the clear
We got 3 minutes and we're out of here
We got 3 minutes and we're out

Is this thing on? (Yeah!)
Are you hearin' this?
We'll turn it up so you can get the whole wide world feeling this
A penny for my thoughts, a million for my album
Mine my mind for rhymes then sell them
Apocalypse now and then, but in the mean time between
I'm touring down the coast playing host
To a gang of folks in a gang of cities in a gang of states
We blow minds like Tet vets with metal plates
And the dream is to step up to be leanest
With less then 20 feet and a microphone between us
