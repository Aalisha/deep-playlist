I'm waitin' on the sun to set ‘cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smokin' cigarettes there's nothing else to do I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walkin', spinnin' tires ain't made for stoppin'
I'm givin' up on love ‘cause love's given up on me

I gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard but it's too long livin' like some country song
