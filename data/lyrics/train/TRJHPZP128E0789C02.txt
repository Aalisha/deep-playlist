These old boots still got a lot of ground
they ain't covered yet
There's at least another million miles
under these old bus treads
So if you think I'm gonnna settle down
Iâ€˜ve got news for you
I still got a lot of leavin' left to do

And as long as there's a song
Left in this old guitar
This life I'm bound to lead
Ain't for the faint of heart
...
