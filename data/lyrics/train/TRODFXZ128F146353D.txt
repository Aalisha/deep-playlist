Baby, I wish you had recognized the love I had for you
When it was in my heart and when it was there for you
Because now, you're coming back to me
And you recognize the love that was once there
But I found somebody else, it's too late, I'm sorry

You should have known that I loved you
You should have seen it in my eyes
Should have allowed yourself to
Believe in love and recognize

That my love, it wasn't going nowhere
No one but you was in my heart
And I can't believe that you would
Push your love aside

Baby it's too bad
You missed out on me
And it's so sad
Sad that you're gone away

And I'm sorry
You missed out on me
But it's too late
You let love slip away

And you should have known that I was open
You should have seen it in my smile
Should have allowed yourself to
