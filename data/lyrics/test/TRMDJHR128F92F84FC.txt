Dinner's ready
And the wine is chilled
My baby's coming over
Well, I know just how I feel

Because I don't
Wanna lose your love
Think how it feels, baby
It's gettin' harder to conceal, yeah

Do I fit in the life
You've been livin', boy?
(Baby, say I do)
Do you feel all the love
I've been givin' you?

Oh, when you come home
Do you care to see me?
Things ain't the way
They used to be, baby

But I can't believe
That's your only reason
You've got to say
Just what's the reason

Don't take my love
For granted, boy
And then turn around
And [Incomprehensible], whoa

I don't wanna lose your love
(I don't wanna)
I don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
(Don't wanna lose you)
I don't wanna lose your love
(Oh, come on)

Come on and say that you will
(Say you will)
I'll do the best to fulfill
...
