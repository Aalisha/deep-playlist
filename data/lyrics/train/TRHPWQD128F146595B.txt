Can't imagine my life without you but I'll try
Each day that comes along is one me day I cry
So much ahead of me that keeps me moving on
I have faith with you where I belong
Cause' something that's missing and I'll come plain
You're my only champion you hear my pain
I will always love you
Your world around
Real love is coming back I found

()
Real love makes sense to me
Real love from yesterday
It's your love that comes my way
Girl I'll be with you I know someday
