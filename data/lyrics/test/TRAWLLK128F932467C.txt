How you came from the wall
Feeding me handfuls of anonymity
A perfect mask can hide a shallow smile
A muted voice comprised of chicanery
A prophet to the disassembled
A bleeding heart for a dying cause
Prays in tongues and kneels in dirt
Hollowed without your face shows sickened ways
A filter of reality shows you in a league with a god
