I woke up this mornin' and I asked my baby to fix me some scrambled eggs
I woke up this mornin' and I asked my baby to fix me some scrambled eggs
Well she looked at me kinda surprised
And she said baby, you got your own two pair a legs

I went to bed last night, I tried to give my baby some love
I went to bed last night, I tried to give my baby some love
Well she looked at me kinda surprised and she said
Baby you got your own two pair a hands
but you ain't got no glove
