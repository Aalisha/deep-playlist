Thank you very much
Ladies and gentlemen
You know, we're mighty
Glad to be here today

And although we're
The stars of the show
We know that that
Ain't all there is to it

There is a woman

And I want to tell you out there
That if you are a man
You've got a woman

And I think you should take
A little time out to salute that woman
And give that woman a
Great big round of applause

There's a lot of plastic faces of every kind
And as you walk around the stage of life
