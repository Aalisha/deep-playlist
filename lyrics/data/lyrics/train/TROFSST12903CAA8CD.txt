Rod Price / Dave Peverett - Knee Trembler Music - ASCAP




I'm back on the road and I ain't gonna stop,
Goin' to roll 'til I'm old, gonna rock 'til I drop.
Out of the smog, headin' into the sun,
I'm goin' to New Orleans, Bourbon Street here I come!

Road fever, wheels turnin' in the rain,
Road fever, fire burnin' in my brain,
Give her the gun, drive like a hurricane.
