I don't want to lose you
This good thing, that I got
'Cause if I do, I will surely
Surely lose a lot

'Cause your love, is better
than any love I know
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock, knock,
on wood, baby, oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh, baby

I'm not superstitious, about ya
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnin', baby
