Over the airwaves tonight,
Sailing by a love lonely light,
Isn't it blue, but isn't it brighter
Than the pilot of a domestic flight

Well under this low, lonely light
I might be still in sight,
You were a girl, now you're a wife
Do not these memories stir you
From your long and peaceful night's

Sleep in perfection
...
