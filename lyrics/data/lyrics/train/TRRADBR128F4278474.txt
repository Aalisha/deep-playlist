I'm back here in the states
(thoughts turning over)
I've seen the marks go by
(beside you)
I've dreamt about this place
(with thoughts turning over)
Of how this morning will arise

IT'S THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE
AND I WON'T LET IT GO
IT'S THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE
AND I WON'T LET IT GO
I JUST WANNA BE RIGHT HERE FOREVER

See tielines scatter wide
(luck turning over)
...
