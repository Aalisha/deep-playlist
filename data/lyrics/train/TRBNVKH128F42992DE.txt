I, have always tried to find
A little place that I could get away for a while
And now I'm noticing that there's no clear frequencies, no empty space left on the dial

You just gotta take a little time for yourself
Here's to the life, that we always never wanted
And somehow we've forgotten the road we've traveled on
Here's to the life
