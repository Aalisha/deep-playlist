A line of clouds forms in the sky
A hazy heat builds slowly

The sun appears beyond the point
A barren stretch awakens
Cracked but seamless to the horizon
Idle landscape, no distractions

Dust and 'weeds drift in the distance
An image flickers by

I see the colors unfolding before me
There's a presence in this unrelenting force
Wind and water work in tandem
