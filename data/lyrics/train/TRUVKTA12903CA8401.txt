Look outside the autumn leaves are falling
Deep inside you hear the road is calling
And I know you want to walk away
Leave it all behind, running from nothing

Chasing lies can find you tired and jaded
In your world the colors have all faded
If you think that you can find a place
To get away from the pain, you're looking for nothing

I hate to see you leave without a fight

Time will open doors for you
Wishes spent make dreams come true
I promise I'll be there, don't say goodbye

Time will open doors for you
...
