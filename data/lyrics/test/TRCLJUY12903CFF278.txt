Welcome! Step inside the waiting room
Just relax they'll be here quite soon
Now if you could just let yourself go
You'll soon be starring in your own freak show

Thet know you're here, your own dark fears
You know you can't stop the show
You're at the mercy of the bringer of dreams

A dream or a nightmare tell me what will you choose
No way of knowing if you'll win or lose
