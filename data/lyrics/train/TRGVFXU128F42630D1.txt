I used to shine the perfect borrowed light
It wasn't mine and it was taking over night
Shame traces the edges of your face
Fully lit, independent of this place

Old enough to see
How diamond wedding rings
Has counterfeited things

I've been borrowed
Shame on me

My muse is gone, forsaken of the theme
No motto now--no cradle, no dream
...
