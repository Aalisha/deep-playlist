Everton Blender
LIFT UP YER HEAD AND HOLD IT UP HIGGGGGHHHH
WEEE KNOW THAT WEE'LL WIN THE PRIIIIIIIZE
TIME GETTIN HARDER, STILL WE STRIVIN FOR BETTER
AND WERE NOT GONNA STOP TILL THE BATTLE IS WON
AN WE GET JUSTICE
CAUSE IF YOU LOSE YER STAAAAANND
ANYONE WILL TRY TO PUSH YOU OOVER
OOOVER AND OOOOVER
LIFT UP YER HEAD AND HOLD IT UP HIGGGGGHHHH
WEEE KNOW THAT WEE'LL WIN THE PRIIIIIIIZE
LIFT UP YER HEAD AND HOLD IT UP HIGGGGGHHHH
WEEE KNOW THAT WEE'LL WIN THE PRIIIIIIIZE
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED, BY THE PITFALLS AND THEIR WORRIES
Pain endure FOR THE NIGHT BUT JOY COMETH IN THE MORNING
