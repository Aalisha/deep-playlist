I'm the queen of catastrophe the faded spade card in your deck of hearts
Squint my eyes at the dealer he hesitates
I can't let my secrets out keep a straight face and calm the noise
Of this debt-ridden hand, I'm trying not to fold
Trying not to fold

I consciously rewind the second hand
Try to find the hours I'm alive
I realize, I'm alive

Always try to comprehend as the odds of fate, start to wage
