We've been alright up until now
But the air that we breathe is about to run out
We've rehearsed our lines clear and loud
But the cue never came and the lights
They never went down
So we're passing the time
While time passes us
The fast lanes a term never applied to us
Without a dime to my name
Or a prayer in the world
I walk out the door

Destination anywhere but here
Away from you

Now I'm on my way to the other side
(On my way)
I'll forget everything I left behind
(On my way)
These empty rooms
(On my way)
Are still filled with you
(On my way)
...
