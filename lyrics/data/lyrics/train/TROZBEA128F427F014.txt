Tea time at Damascus computer cafe,
I'm looking busy and staring off the other way.
Leverkusen, Juventus; Leeds vs. Valencia:
I'm over-hearing all their nonsense in extensia.
They're talking too tough for me to inspect
so I have a smell who seems the best to connect.
I pick my clique and set to go to work
but the only thing they care about is to whom to play the Turk.
So I walked up the length of the Street they call Straight
cursing myself cause I got there too late.
I traded an expired credit card for two cupfulls of water;
they had a dirty beany baby so for good luck I bought her.
I rented a Hyundai with two flats and no windshield
no speedometer and a handbrake that squealed;
when the sun came up I couldn't put down the visor
so I put on my hat and a question to my local advisor:
Whose trucks are those that parked up by the town?
