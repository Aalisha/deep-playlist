Never was a cornflake girl
Thought it was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Giving us the yo heave ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go at sleepy time

This is not really
This, this, this is not really happening
You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
...
