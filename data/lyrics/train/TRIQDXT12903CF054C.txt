And it's been runnin' for a long time and it's runnin' out in my mind
I can't explain it all to you it's really jumbled up
So for longer now I'm messed up and I'm wishin' now I'd 'fessed up
That concern's no use to you it feeds the pain that stung

So forget how I am dealin' explain to me the feelin'
It gets to that point instantly you're ready to unload
And I'm the one you're spitting at and I'm ready for my fitting at
Doesn't make much sense but when I get it calm it's slow
