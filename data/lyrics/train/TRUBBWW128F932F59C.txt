you spent too many years
walking alone spending time
like I spend money on home beer
I used to be that way
expected to much I guess, to get me out of this mess
so come on now, let's catch an airplane, fly
don't be afraid, trouble will stay out of site

what if the plane crashed down
what if the sky grows too dark
will you ever see the spark?
what if the wind's to strong
what if the pilot does something wrong

bent once now I'm sore
I rather stay outside and have fun by opening doors
...
