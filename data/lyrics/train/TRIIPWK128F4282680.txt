Last night red lights and sirens sound,
Nine miles on a back street,
Sneakin' out of town,
Out of touch, goin' underground,
Look into the mirror;
Can see 'em bearin' down,

Long road windin',
Headlights in the dark,
Don't know where we're goin',
But it can't be too far,

Ten g's, three for you, the rest I'll keep,
No clues, no avenues,
It's a perfect scheme,
Look-out outskirts,
...
