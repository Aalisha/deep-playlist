[Guy] Yo we gotta get outta here, what's taking you so long?
[Jean] Alright alright I'm coming, I just wanna send out
[Guy] C'mon
[Jean] I just wanna send a couple emails, just gimme a second, I'll be like 5 minutes
[Guy] Alright

[Verse 1]
Whats up vicky
Man I cant believe you wrote to me
The last time that I saw you
You even spoke
Remember on 8th street
Chillin' with Peter and he was all this my girl wanna meet her?
That shit was bugged right
Anyway... hummhumm damn is been a long time
I see you're still artistic, talented
Vicky listen
I did some foul shit to you
Even though it's passed
I vow to you apologies a thousand times
How could you, even look me in the eye then
You're a bigger person then I ever was
Or at least I'm trying
I should of never touched 'em
We should of never crushed and
Then straight lied to your face about it
No trace of blushing
But I was young and stupid
Shooting all crooked and keep it fucking up a friendship
For some ass, should of never pursued it
Just wanted to thank you for understanding and reaching out
Love Jean, holla back at your homie, peace, I'm out

[Chorus]
P.S. just had to get this offa my chest
I hope you're well, I really wish you the best
And as you can tell i've done alot of growing up
And time goes fast and no sign of slowing up
