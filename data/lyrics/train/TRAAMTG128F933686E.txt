Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

See, ah-ha-ha
Say, waa-ha-ha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Try fi show I, say
Your way is the right way, no now
Seek His Majesty way
That's right

The way of His Majesty
Is the only way for black people
Nations shall rise over nations
(Culture, culture)

Mixed up moods and attitude, won't work
Mixed up moods and attitude, won't work, yeah

The work is wonderful
Plenty of we here to feed
Show the children how wonderful this used to be
Nice up the dance, the children got to love
...
