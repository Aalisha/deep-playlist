Tell me 'bout your youth.
Ah, just tell the truth.
Was it nice and smooth
Or was it a lie?

And when you
were a child,
were you young and wild
Or just undefiled,
ready to cry?

It should have been me,
You should've believed in me.
It's all in the way you say
This doesn't happen every day.
It doesn't happen every day.
