(Baby talking)
Hey Fresh!
We back at it baby

(Manny Fresh)
Here baby doll, up against the wall
And through the sound, he broke it down
Only one more Hypnotic, and that's when he shot it
I'm not lookin' for love, up in the club
But I wanna go home with you, girl

(Manny Fresh)
I'm not your man I'm a pimp, baby please understand
But you hot, and they not, so we can hold hands
In a long truck, Cadillac
Surround sound, front to back
"Forever? Forever, ever?"
Forever, ever black
Ridin' in the sunshine, crankin' up the Alpine
Rubbin' down shorty's spine, she is fine!
Love 'um, leave 'um, go back and retrieve 'um
If their hair is bad, then I will weave 'um

(Baby)
Kick back in the Phantom, two clips and a hammer
Cruisin' through the hood on them Deion Sanders
Nothin' but red whips and all them candy
Two chicks, two chickens that flew from Atlanta, aye
Laid back in a Maebach, countin' stacks
Got work, go to work, nigga count that
...
