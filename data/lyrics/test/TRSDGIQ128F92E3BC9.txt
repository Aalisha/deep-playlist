Give me words noone yet spoken
Give me thoughts noone yet thought
Give me reasons never dreamed of
Give me laws I will never break

The sweet life-we always had heard of
The sweet life-like wine from jerefa
The sweet life-we always had heard of
The sweet life-we always had heard of

Give me words noone yet spoken
Give me thoughts noone yet thought
Give me reasons never dreamed of
