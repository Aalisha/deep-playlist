You try to tell me where your heart is
you say there's nothing wrong
and the honesty in your eyes tells me
that I should be strong
I don't want to get wrapped up in morbid reflection
because that's a pessimistic space
and the situations I imagine
are lost somewhere in you face

because when were together it's bittersweet
...
