a showdown at dusk, 
this old town is lost, 
I’m flat on my back 
and I can’t see through the dust. 
but you never told me that I was worthy, 
you didn’t let me live just to hurt me. 
desperate 
we will lift up our hands. 
stronger 
we will rise up against. 
freedom 
is a part of us all 
its time to let it go. 
desperate 
we will lift up our hands. 
stronger 
we will rise up against. 
freedom 
is a part of us all 
its time to let it go.
