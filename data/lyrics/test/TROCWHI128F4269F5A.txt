I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up, and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me.

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out of my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
