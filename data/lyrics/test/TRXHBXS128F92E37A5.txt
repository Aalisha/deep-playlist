I'm not looking for a sweetheart
Just a gentle lady friend
Someone I can softly turn to
When I need to now and then
When my head gets kinda tangled
And my soul is lying bare
I reach over in the Corner of my life
And I find you waiting there
You're a number I can phone
You're a letter I can write
You're my water when I'm thirsty
In the middle of the night
