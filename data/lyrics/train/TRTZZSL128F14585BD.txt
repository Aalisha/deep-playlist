When the blood in your drugs turns to shale
They had you hung, drawn and quartered tooth and nail
Empty pockets making idle hands
Mugging as a job requires good plans

Luck's up, tuff stuff
Luck's up, tuff luck
Luck's up, tuff stuff
Unlucky you

And where were you when the pickings were thicker than slime
A serious problem needs to be on time
Not good enough to crawl in the dark
You idiot, getting ripped off in the park
