SOPOR AETERNUS...
O mortis secretum, ubi finis nervorum?
O funeris algor, ubi sonus somniorum?
The insane wine of the night misled my soul
At the confluence of dream and of pain...
We dance under the closed eyes of paradise,
And our eyes tear the insane space
of the light.
Saltemus sub oculis coniventibus paradisi!
The voilence of the winter moon
spreads a mantle
Of cold icy pain over my petrified landscape.
Seized by the freezing frosts
of the diabolic winter,
Our hearts breathe the winds of sadness.
Saliamus, saliamus aeterno,
Saltemus, saltatum mortis!
Saliamus, saliamus!
But what is in my heart can only be read
by the winds
That gathered my words of pain.
The veil of the nigth falls at your feet
...
