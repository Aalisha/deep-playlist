I have lived everyday of my life
Thinking only of what I should think
When I read back on everything that I have written
On how I lived my life

And in the process of doing so

Just to stay an observer of an impartial observer

Here I go again, I'm chasing my tail around the sun
Standing beneath a tortoise under an elephant under the world
The gravity of the battle means nothing to those at peace
I can't believe, I thought my thoughts meant anything
