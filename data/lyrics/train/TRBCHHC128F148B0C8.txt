Please forgive me, I don't think I'm the same
Reconnect me and program back the haze
No way I could ever be the same
If I could have one day to sweep this all away

I'd find a million ways to feel nothing
I'd find a million ways to be free
And everything I've lost will mean nothing
And everything I am will be me
...
