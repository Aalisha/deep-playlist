The doors to the cinema are open for the taking
Like a cat on a mouse, I'm ready to pounce
Before my nerve starts breaking

And if I'm caught by the ticket collector
I promise I will always respect her
She might be feeling like her job
Is like that out-of-date ticket stub

And I get a thrill
I just take one seat that Hollywood couldn't fill
Because I don't want to pay
