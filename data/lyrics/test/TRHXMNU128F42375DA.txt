The winds are blowing every morning
Just to do her hair now
Because she cares you all

Her day oh wouldn't be right
Without her make up
She's never had a make up

She's just like you and me
But she's homeless, she's homeless
As she stands there singing for money

La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
La da dee la dee da
