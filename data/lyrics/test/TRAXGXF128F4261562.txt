Hey guy - you're the one for me
Your face - the sweetest thing I've ever seen
Stop by - dedicate to me
Your time - your time

At night - it really gets to me
I find nobody is here with me
Stop by - say you'll stay with me
You're the one I really miss

Every single day - single hour
I can see your face - single day
Every single day - single hour
...
