(Dieter Bohlen)
Producers for Bonnie: Dieter Bohlen & Luis Rodriguez

Some friends you lose
Some friends you win
Time will heal the pain
I would give up everything
To hold you once again

Sorry doesn't make it right
And tears are not enough
I can't take these lonely nights
And shadows from this love

*We are daytime friends
And night-time fools
...
