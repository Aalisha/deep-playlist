Tom's the name that you know me by
And I'm 5'11, brown eyes
Otherwise I'm just like you
See I've made my mistakes like we all do

But I'm skybound, I don't look down
I've got too much to live for

And I've learnt how to play it
With one foot in front of the other
There's no way to win it
Just spin around and around
