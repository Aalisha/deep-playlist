Like a brilliant thief
You stole into the room
Night was so long
Now all the lights are way too bright

One small voice
Of conquest and doubt
One deep breath
Easily sweeps the stars away

A world of pantomime in black and white
A wingless angel on a willful flight

With eyes wide open - through an opened door
With eyes wide open - swim the river running deep
...
