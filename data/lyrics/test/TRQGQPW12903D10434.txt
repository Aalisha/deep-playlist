Spend our lifetime reading
books that we've been told to
Are we catching the meaning?
Are we really supposed to?

It's time that we start seeing
the shades of color between the lines
Find a true way of being
Don't you think we're wasting time

Have you heard of Douglas town?

And the Irish of another skin

A million people have died there
how come we never heard a thing?
