Oh in the 80s
They weren't the gayties
They were the straighties
On in teh 1980s
It's a new taboo
What am I gonna do
Is it a shock that I rock
And think the way I do
No one came out
Nobody was ever going to shout
Homosexuality
Is what I'm all about
Oh in the 80s
They weren't the gayties
They were the straighties
