I'm goin' back to Indiana
Back to where I started from
Goin' back to Indiana
Indiana, here I come

I spent my weeks with greener pastures
I still ain't found what I was after
I got the blues and that is why I sing
I just wanna do my thing

I'm goin' back to Indiana
Indiana, here I come
I'm goin' back to Indiana
'Cause that's where my baby's from

Okay, Tito, you got it
