Can't you see
That love is all around me
Can't you see
That love is all around me, yeah

I dream, oh
That I could stay forever with you
I dream, oh
That I could stay forever with you tonight

I dream my dream in this dream with you
And we together share an ecstasy
So tell me where do you wanna dream
So come with me into my ecstasy
I dream my dream
I dream my dream
I dream my dream
I dream my dream, my dream, I dream my dream
