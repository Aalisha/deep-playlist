Hey now boys, take a lookit right here.
Only one comes 'round every million years.
She's a midnight rider on a shooting star,
Makes the whole world ring like a big guitar.

Well she flagged me down with the devil's way.
It was somewhere down that lost highway.
She's a lifeboat on a raging sea,
She's a high note on the harmony.
