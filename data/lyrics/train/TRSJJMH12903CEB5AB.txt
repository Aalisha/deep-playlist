Shine on Ruby mountain

From the valley to the sea
Shine on Ruby mountain
Shine your sweet love down on me
Ruby mountain has a sunset when my baby comes around
I believe we've got a love mess anywhere we walk around

I said, shine on Ruby mountain
From the valley to the sea
Shine on Ruby mountain
Shine your sweet love down on me
Ruby mountain grow no flowers
