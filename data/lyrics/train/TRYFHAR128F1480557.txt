i was a prisoner in a factory
i can keep nothing for myself
missing convenience
won't remember me at all
and now i'm relying on the well
i kept the questions to a murmur
you had an answer for them all
how am i take it home
how am i get you alone
how am i take you home
how am i get you alone
to remember why
they hung you out to dry
we're all alone
and unaware
you can't say what you want to say
?
i hope that you prepare
...
