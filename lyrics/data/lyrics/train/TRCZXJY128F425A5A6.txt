I ask you to hold me
But you don't wanna hold me
It don't work like that
I want you to love me
But you don't wanna love me
I'm losing patience now

(Oh, leave me alone)
Oh, leave me alone
Stop asking for more
I'm going home on my own
(Oh, leave me alone)
Oh, leave me alone
I'm walking out of the door
I'll make it on my own

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone
