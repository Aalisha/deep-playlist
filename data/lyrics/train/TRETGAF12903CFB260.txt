Looking on to the road of forever
finding my place along the way
longing to discover the places in my mind
trying to reach within my soul

Everyone`s in a race against the hands of time
now the time is at hand for us all
to face the truth on our own

Hearing the words, as we try to remember
a dream that was lost along the way

Longing to recover the memories of our mind
Trying to reach a common goal
and along the way they`ll discover
