Are you one foot in the grave, or one step closer to your savior
Brother tell me how it feels, it's much too soon to meet your maker
You ain't ever walked a line, boy, you always were a rebel
Now ain't no time to strike a deal now, now for someone to cheat the devil

Won't get a nickle for your name, no, 'course you won't need it where you're going
...
