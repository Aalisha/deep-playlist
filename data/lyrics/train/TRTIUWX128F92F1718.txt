Hands are shakin' got your finger on the trigger
Jesus ain't complainin' gonna figure it out
Somebody raped my tapeworm abortion
Come on motherfuckers and deliver the cow

Brain and body melting while there's roaches multiplyin'
It's the alien infection, it's the comin' of Christ
All these sentimental halos and these consequential angels
When I'm runnin' with the Devil don't deliver the fight

Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold
Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold

Yea, and when I want to
...
Yea, I will find you
...

Yea, and when I want to
...
Yea, I will blind you
...

Brains are frying while the kings and queens are dying
Satan won the race and the miracle mile
Somebody raped my tapeworm abortion
...
