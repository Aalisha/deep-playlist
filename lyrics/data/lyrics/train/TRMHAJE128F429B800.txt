It falls apart from the very start
It falls apart
It falls apart
Everything around me falls apart

It falls apart from the very start
It falls apart
Seems like everything I touch
Falls apart
Everything around me
Falls apart
When I walk away from you

I wish I could, but I don't always keep the promises I've kept
I wish I could, but I can't always give whatever I have left
And now it's all so clear, doesn't anyone see what's happening here?

It falls apart form the very start
It falls apart
Seems like everything I touch
Falls apart
Everything around me
Falls apart
When I walk away from you
