[Let me feelGrown up as a loner, I've never been in the right placeI always thought it will have to be that wayMisused in the childhood, I could not understand thatIt was hard to be always out of place]

Cut into my soul
Cut yet deeper
Show to me that I'm still alive
Pain kills pain - prain releases
Cut into my soul
Just this single time
Can't you see that I'm crucifying myself?
