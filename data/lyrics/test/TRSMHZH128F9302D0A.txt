The hurricane party's windin' down
And we're all waitin' for the end
And I don't want another drink
I only want that last one again

He gave me such a fine glow, smokin' slow
Now I should probably be homeward bound
There's just no one to talk to when the lines go down

I guess that in the morning I'll go
Lookin' for my gray-striped cat
My old house can take the weather
So I'm not too concerned about that

It was built to take the wind back in nineteen-and-ten
When this was one damned fine town
But now there's no one to talk to when the lines go down

Candles flickered on the back bar
And the building was shakin' with the wind
I bought a whiskey for the gypsy
And she turned my leather back into skin

Just a fleeting sense of that rare suspense
...
