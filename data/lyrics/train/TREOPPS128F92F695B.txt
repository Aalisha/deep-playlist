I could feel her soul, walking beside me
Like a thousand roses, with thorns that cut too deep
By her place I stand, with a picture in my hand
Now my tears are falling, leaving traces in the ground

Sail away
On my trail of tears from the other side
Sail away
>From the world you knew before it conquers you
Sail away
