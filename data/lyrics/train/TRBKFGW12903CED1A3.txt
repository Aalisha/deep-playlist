Time, time, time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities
I was so hard to please

But look around, the leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter

Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand

And look around you, leaves are brown now
...
