Death is the way
A passion to die
I see a world gone insane obsessed by a
fashion to try
Look to the rhyme
The words never change
Forever in line in search of a new game to play
(CHORUS)
Follow on
Along the line
Your fate is what you will find
Paralyse
Reality
You bear the scars of devilry
Don't play with fire
