I got a black top road out in front of me
And I might just tear it up
I gotta rock'n'roll jones pumpin' in deep
Just might tear it up
Gimme a bar room floor a back beat band
Play the kinda music I can understand
Sweet sixteen take me by the hand just might tear it up
Tear it up hey I just might tear it up
Tear it up Tear it up
Ya know I just might tear it up

I got a ticket from a cop on the way over here
