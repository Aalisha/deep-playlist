When the skies are wounded
And a beacon's ceased to shine
When dusk is coming all too soon

When we sometimes slip along the way
When we're haunted by a word we should have said
And all the things we should have done

There's a place to lay your head between the sun and moon
Deep within the mind and underneath the skin
Deep within the breath, behind a wakeful eye

Far beyond the sacred ground of an island in the stream
Riding the sea, riding the sea
Toward a secret place where our shadows sleep
