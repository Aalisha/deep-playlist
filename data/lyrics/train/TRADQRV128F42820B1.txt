Toca me

Esta tarde se me va, toca me

Hey yeah, hey yeah, miracle (miracle)
Hey yeah, hey yeah, miracle (miracle)
Hey yeah, hey yeah, miracle (miracle)
Hey yeah, hey yeah...

If you're gonna save the day
And you're hearin' what I say
I feel your touch, your kiss
It's not enough
And if you believe in me
Don't think my love's for free
I won't take nothin' less then a deeper love

Let me tell you, know
I, I need a miracle
I need a miracle
It's more than physical
What I need to feel from you
