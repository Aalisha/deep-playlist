You're heading south for the border
This is the site of the murder
This is the end, this is the end

Cause this is the day your life is gonna change
There's no escape, apology would be too late
Cause you're heading south for the border
This is the site of the murder
Cause you're armed with hate and a handgun
Girl get in the car I'm riding shotgun

You're armed with hate and a handgun
