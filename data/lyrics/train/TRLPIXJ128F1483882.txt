I just can't take it anymore
Your tricks have fooled me for the last time
You know I've had it up to here
With the way you bring me down, down
You're wreaking havoc on my world
You're calling question to my sanity
But I'm not gonna let you get the best of me
Not anymore, anymore

So here I go
Watch me run
A million miles under the sun
That's what I'll do
If that's what it takes
To get away

I gotta get away
(x4)

You try to steal away our kids
You try to tear apart our families
You bring lies into our towns
And watch our morals tumble down
We are a city on the edge
We are a world that needs a remedy
But we're still a nation under God
And it's time we take a stand
