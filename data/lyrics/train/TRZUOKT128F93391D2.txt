Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

I'm still smokin' out, pourin' up
Puttin' dick up in yo' slut
Niggas look, I'm sayin' "what?"
Hustlin' not in a rut
Gettin' down, on the grind
Puttin' meat up in they spine
Young girl lookin' fine
Comin' back with the whole nine
Grip the 'lac
Do the track
Young go off the mat
Hit the sack
Drop 7 grams
Watch it bubble back
All heart, never fraud
Only trust in the lord
Never in no (?)
Represent the whole South
Everybody wanna be the boy gettin' rich
Everybody wanna have a bad-ass bitch
Everybody want a 'Lac
Wanna blow the (?) sack
Everybody wanna come through with their foot packed

Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga I can't fuck with y'all

Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
Everybody wanna ball
