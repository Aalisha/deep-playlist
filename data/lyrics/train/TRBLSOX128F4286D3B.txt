I see molecules and I see you,
I see the way that matter scatters out and makes things move.
I see the backs of my eyelids have never looked so beautiful,
there's shapes and light with eyes so tight and swirling little pixels.
It's a funny seeming, fuzzy feeling to think about all I'm seeing,
all that is, birds and fish, plants and apes and annelids. Traffic smoke and atmosphere,
it's a one way ticket out of here,
it's a science you can trust,
...
