Well me and my baby, we're goin' steady
We ain't married but we're gettin' ready
To tie the knot
And I'm gonna make her my own

Now that I've found her I'm gonna keep her
Finders keepers and losers weepers
She's my baby
She's goin' steady with me

If I've been honky tonkin' 'round
Nearly all of my life
But now I got a steady babe
...
