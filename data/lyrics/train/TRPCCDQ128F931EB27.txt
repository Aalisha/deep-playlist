Well, they said, "it was the cheapest fare at this time of year"
And they said, "It's nice and safe, you got nothing to fear"
So I will take this old plane to get to you
Yes, I will take this old plane to get to you

Twenty minutes late the plane crashes down
And I'm one of three left amongst a priest and a clown
And then all I can hear is the hiss of the track
I said, "why the hell not" and I jump on the back
And I will take this old train to get to you
