Gunned down in a fight
It was a bloody pleasure
Though I couldn't walk
I'm not dead
I smell the pavement
At the end there's a light
And so pretty women
Though I couldn't see
I'm not blind and inside my mind

Fright night on the radio
Starving junkies on the TV
I ain't got nothing against them brother
I just sit and hang around
While there's Conan Something
MTV's burning up from lack of fever
...
