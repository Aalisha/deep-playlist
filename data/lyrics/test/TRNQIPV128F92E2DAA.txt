Life has made me
Pay an awful price
I try and gamble with ya
But you're using crooked dice

Somebody's gotta suffer
Somebody's sure gotta feel some pain
If it's gonna rain down misery
How come it always fall on me

Money you've made me
Some very fast friends
And just like you made them
You're gonna break them in the end

Somebody's gotta suffer
Somebody's sure gotta feel some pain
