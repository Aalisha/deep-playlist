You were the seven deadly sins
Making sense in your 'screw me' dress
The beautiful ones just slip away
To a mirror where we used to kiss
With your disco heartbeat
You're not even human
We're so electric
Do you have no passion?

Bring your sunshine to me, oh electric man
Bring your sunshine to me, oh you're so electric man
To me

Everything I touch
