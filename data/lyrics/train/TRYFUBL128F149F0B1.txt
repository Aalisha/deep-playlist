You brought this on yourself
The lack of a barrel forced into your mouths
Proves your actions won't be without retribution
Break down
Bloodshed, a sign of weakness
Just know you'll get what you deserve

Who do you think that you are?
Barring your teeth like the smile of the one with a blade in his sleeve
The thorns that line your back are all it took to slit the arms that took you in
Just who do you think that you are?
Suicide king dying to be seen
An image to build, cover you up
The damage is done
Just let them fight fight fight
