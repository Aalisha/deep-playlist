Throughout all divisions of concepts
That build fake images of paths to your ideals
You'll find mere disappointment
It's not the manner, it's the form of the starting point
That keeps the flower from it's beauty
Close your eyes and try to see what's real what's present
Dream awake through seas of color

Further and further
You're running in circles
The end is only visible from a distance
Take a breath and realize
Tomorrow's just a guess
