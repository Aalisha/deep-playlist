All you have to do is think about it
All you have to do is think about it
All you have to do is think about it
All you have to do is think about it

Baby, you drive me crazy all the time
When you play me
I'm burnin' with the lies that you feed me
Chasin' my despair
(I can see you smiling till I'm over the edge)

Do yourself a favor
Realize you won every game, yea
'Cos it's plain to see that I'm a mouse of a man, yea

Get me out of my mind
I don't feel so good
 (Breakin' down the walls while I'm fallin' apart)
Get me out of my mind
I don't feel so good
 (Try to understand)
(Just think about it)

Lately, you reply with your lies that I'm fadin'
 (Ahh, ah)
