PRODIGAL SONG
Everyday I wake up I see footprints on the ceiling,
didn't realize they come from me
All we ever wanted here was something to believe in
Heaven's closed down, Mecca's obsolete
Well it's a hallelujah day and I'm a Walther P.P.K

If I told you my story man you wouldn't believe it
'cos the things I've seen and do are hard to perceive
And so I'll stop my talking now and draw back the curtain
...
