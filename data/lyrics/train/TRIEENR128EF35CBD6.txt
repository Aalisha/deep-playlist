Life's a circle and it spins me around
A broken record, always making the same sound
Time and time I get my hopes up
Just to find I only get let down

Like a season that refuses to change
A stubborn winter growing colder everyday
Give me something that can warm me up again
I swear to let it in

You're my something
You are my everything
You're the one that makes me feel alive
