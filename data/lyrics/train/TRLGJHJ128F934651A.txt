No more, no more
The cries of the ones you
Serve go unheard, ignored
With patronizing smiles you move on, and on
An agenda all your own
While the pain and scorn
Are yours and yours alone to stop

It's been said all before
But you choose to ignore
And the ones that you burn
Will be the ones to see you fall

You test the innocent and watch them bleed
...
