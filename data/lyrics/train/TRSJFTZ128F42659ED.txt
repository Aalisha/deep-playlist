Softly
love is standing here with its demands
tell me what you want from me
Slowly
I think I'm letting go of all my plans
tell me where we're going to
But why why am I afraid 
to give in to this
why am I afraid
This doesn't have to be love
but it's all I can feel it's all that I fear
this doesn't have to be anything at all
it's so hard to fall (from this high above)
now do we have to call it love
I hold back
from anything I really want to say
should I let my guards down
I don't
I don't make commitments that could break
maybe it's just too late
