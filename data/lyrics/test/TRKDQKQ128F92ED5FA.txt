I think it? s safe to say you? ve had a bad day
And somethin? even tells me
Maybe I should stay away
But I can? t, I? m livin? dangerously

Baby, call me crazy
I think I know what you need
Girl, I? ve got your remedy

Somebody needs a hug, a little personal attention
Some good ol? lovin? and affection
Yeah, I'm talkin' full body, good Lord Almighty
Woah, c? mon and get you some

You need to be wrapped up
Snug as a bug in a rug
A big ol? teddy bear squeeze
Where you can barely breathe
Somebody needs a hug

I see you? re not convinced
