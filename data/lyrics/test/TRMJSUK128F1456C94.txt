[N.O.R.E. - speaking]
N-O-R-E, Nore, Niggaz On the Run Eatin *coughing*
So let's big up Kool G. Rap because that's the motherfucking man
You un' the dig, Kool G. Rap, man, you know what I'm sayin?
Godfather of gangsta, ghetto, project, complex, co-op, hip-hop
G. Rap influenced me in, not in any way but in every way almost, you know the dig?
N.O.R.E. - Nore, G. RAP!
If y'all don't know about G. Rap, y'all don't know about rap!

[G-Wise * vocoder]
G. Rap - see you again, baby (my life nigga)

[Chorus: G-Wise * vocoder]
All of my life, I live
I'll be thuggin with youuuuuuu
Rock it out baby, knock it out baby
Won't stop 'til I die for this
I'll be keepin it trueeeeeee
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[N.O.R.E.]
Yo, yo
It's mafia ties, rules, let 'em fuck each other's wives
Niggaz is real stupid and they think like chicks
They was dealing with ounce money 'til I bought the bricks
I done walked through the valley of the shadow of death (yeahhhh)
And smoked cigarettes, constant, step for step (oh yeah)
Island-style, four-bill and mop your neck
I got the bandana, see, it's already a "B"
I'm like Santana from American ME
They call me D.A.N. - Dead All Nore (D.A.N. - Dead All Noreeeee)
And I got guns, y'all ain't got nothin for me
