I never thought you were the letter writing type
Now I see the words you chose, the way you write
So I started to write back about the trees and the snow
And I saw a bird, couldn't say what it was
But I thought you'd know, you always surprised me

And if I wrote you, if I wrote you
You would know me and you would not write me again
