Silence swimming in a pool of dreams
Beneath its depths the forgotten streams
Above, the city of the evening star
Behind its walls, the Grand Bazaar

As she walks through its endless maze
Cursing those who mistrust her ways
Please my friend, no matter what she sees
Tell my lover come back to me

Doorways spilling out their sombre light
Casting shadows that will raid the night
Along the alleys of her ruling fears
Walk the visions that will cause her tears
...
