I've been crying
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry?
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby

I've given up my friends just for you
