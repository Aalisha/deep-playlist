Insomniacs making knives
Listen to them scraping after the last count
They are the ones I despise
Willing to kill but not to break out
We spent four months assembling tools
Two more trying to plan each step
Woah to stake our lives to stake all we had left

Woah it won't be long till dawn

[Chorus]
All we have to lose is lost
