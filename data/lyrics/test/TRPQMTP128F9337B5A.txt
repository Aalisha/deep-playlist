"She's just a friend," he said, "and that's all she'll ever be
But I can't get these thoughts of her out of my head
The cliche story once again, not as dramatic as it could be
But I can't help the way my thoughts are being led"
Can't you see she loves you in a special way?
Maybe more than you will ever really know
'Cause your mind is focused on a fictional storyline
You'll miss the happiness reality could hold
