I never knew you
But then who really did?
If you were at all like me
You managed to keep yourself hid
A patchwork quilt of a life
Memories embroidered
On your soul

So please forgive me
For putting you in my song
But the spirit she moves me
In fact she pushes me along
It's a patchwork quilt of a life
Can't stop the river
Just let it roll
...
