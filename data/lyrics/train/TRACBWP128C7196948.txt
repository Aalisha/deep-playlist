Nevermind the face you put on
In front of me
Nevermind the pain
That you've put me through

Cause every little thing you say
And every little thing you do
Makes me doubt all of this
What are you waiting for?

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me... no

Look what you did
Is this how you wanted this to be?
This life you gave away
...
