I can feel their branches like fingers
Flashing nimble signs of silent criticism
Dryly criticizing my entire inner workings, wet and dirty
Earthworms and insects
On missions of reconnaisance are welcome inhabitants

And every now and then I feel one exit
How many go unnoticed? How many interspecies languages have they decoded?
These trees are all so old, I really don't know why they're interested
Why they talk the loudest when they know that I'll be listening
I've tried to decipher the shouting of the rivers, and the valleys, and the mountains
Figure out what it's about
And all I've got is birds chirping, red Sharpie circles 'round my words
So they're converting all my thoughts to wordless noise

So I finally decided I would help them
If this is their intention, I could be the finest ally to the cause
The covert reports can all be called off
You wanna broadcast my thoughts? Let's get them straight from the source

I can stand on street corners, draw diagrams of strangers
Hand out pages from my diary, with footnotes and annotations
So that passerby can identify the remains of my life
(Don't even bother, it's all a bunch of fuckin' lies!)
