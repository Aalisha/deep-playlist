I'm red-hot, higher than high
Gettin' some action on a midnight ride
Feelin' alright this Saturday night
Your touch ignites the fire
Drivin' my heel to the edge of desire
Feelin' so right, it's Saturday night

No more lonely nights searchin' for this feelin'
Lovelight's shinin' in your eyes

Girl, it sure feels like love
I need it every day
Yeah, it sure feels like love
I wanna tell you
I've been waitin', so long waitin'
Feels like love
