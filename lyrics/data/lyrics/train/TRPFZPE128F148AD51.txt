Out of nowhere you just wanna be free
Cut me loose forget all about me
Baby, tell me, have you ever heard
About this little five letter word

What comes around, goes around
I'm telling you baby, it's called karma
What goes up comes down, hits the ground
You're gonna find out
All about, all about, k-k-karma

Go on, go on, go have your day in the sun
Have a blast honey, have you some fun
