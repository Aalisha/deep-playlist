Cover me
When I walk alone
Cover me

When my stance it stumbles home
Cover me
We'll trip on through the sands of time

And cover me
'Cause I've been branded
I've lost my mind

Lost my mind

But you'll cover me yeah
Won't you give me shelter from the storm
Over me
You fade into the night
Over me

You melt into the light
Over me
You will fear the things I need
Over me
You will feel the hate I breed
...
