You make me feel funny
When you come around
Yeah, that's what I found out, honey
What am I doing without you?
You make me feel happy
When I leave you behind
It plays on my mind now, honey
What am I doing without you?

Oh, took for granted everything we had
As if I'd find someone who's just like you
Oh, we got a little world of our own

I'll tell you things that no one else knows
I let you in where no one else goes
What am I doing without you?
And all of the things I've been looking for
Have always been here outside of my door
And all of the time I'm looking for something new
What am I doing without you?
...

What am I doing without you?
...
Well, I guess I'm ready
For settling down
...
