Ooh... ooh...
(Oh, I)
Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh...
(Oh, I)
(I miss you, baby)
(Oh...)

(Oh, I) Oh, I (Oh, I)
(Miss you) I miss you, baby (Miss you)
(Miss you, miss you) I swear I do
(Miss you) Mmm, hmm

Every since you went away
I ain't been doing nothing but
(Thinking, thinking)
(Thinking, thinking)
With my head in my hands
(Thinking)

You been away from so long
And I just don't think I can carry on so I start
(Drinking, drinking)
(Drinking, drinking)
Each and every night
(Drinking)

(Ah... ah... ah...)
Trying to drown all my loneliness away
I don't forget a day
Fall down on my knees wishing for your return
And oh, how I hurt

'Cause I (Oh, I) Oh, I (Oh, I)
(Miss you) I miss you, baby
(Miss you)
(Miss you, miss you)
Oh, Lord (Miss you)

You can look at my eyes and see
That a great big man like me has been
(Crying, crying)
(Crying, crying)
Crying my heart and soul out to you, baby
(Crying)

Sitting in my lonely room
Filled with nothing but gloom and I feel like
(Dying, dying)
(Dying, dying)
Hey, y'all help me
(Dying)

(Ah... ah... ah...)
'Cause ever since the day you left
I don't know what to do with myself
Oh... I wish for your return
...
