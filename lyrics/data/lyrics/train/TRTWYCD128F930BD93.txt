Seems like a dead man stickin' to you
Seems like his last thoughts are stuck to your shoe
Seem like a dead man stickin' to you
Seems like a dead man stuck to your shoe
Seems like a dead man stickin' to you
Seems like a dead man stickin' to you
Dead man hold me near with all that you hold dear
I can shut my eyes down tight and make you disappear
Then I fall down
Seems like tomorrow is yesterdays news yeah
Seems like you can't win, can't win for losing
