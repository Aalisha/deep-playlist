You say how life is treating you bad
But some would kill for what you have
With a place to sleep
And a roof over your head
You haven't seen how tough life can get
Why should you complain
With all of your advantages?
When people out there can barely manage
With a free education and no bills to pay
But you'll have to face reality someday
...
