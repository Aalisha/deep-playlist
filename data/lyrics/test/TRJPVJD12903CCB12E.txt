Takin' it slow
Savin' up, she
Before she knows it
All I ask before she goes home

She's tired of cryin'
And sick of his lies
She's suffered him
For far too many years of her life

Feelin' low
And scared that he'll say
Do you know how
Over time you drove her away?

I'm savin' up for
The day when she goes
The day that she stands up
For everything that she chose

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?

She can say, she can say, she can say
She can say, she can say, she can say
Who knows what she's gonna say?
