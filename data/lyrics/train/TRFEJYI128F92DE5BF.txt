Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Here's a new hit song from Kellie Pickler

When my time comes to an end
Don't be sad, don't you shed one tear
Take me back to the place I love the most
All my best memories were made in my time here

Don't be sad or broken hearted
Spread my ashes in the shoe department
Everybody knows that's where I wanna be
...
