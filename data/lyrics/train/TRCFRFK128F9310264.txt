I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me.
Knowing I'll be underneath them when they crumble, when they fall.
With clarity my scars remind me
Ash still simmers just under my skin
Indifference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth?
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you.

Tell me which is you.

Eerilly time made no change
Pointing fingers, laying blame.
Lying over and over and over and over.
