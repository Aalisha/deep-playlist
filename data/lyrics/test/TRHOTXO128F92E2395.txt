White dove lay lifeless on a crown of thorns
Beside a broken sword
Whirlwind blew out a candle
Heartrending cry

Tears were streaming down her face
Cold dread of death black cursed embrace
An endless nightmare croacked on the brink of despair
She felt she would die

Her thoughts flew to his brave betrothed
It was so long ago!
Sweet loving eyes of thee so far from mine
She felt she would die

Sweetheart, my light cruel fate calls me to fight

Sudden shadows fell on me
Was the dream of white dove a message of thee?
