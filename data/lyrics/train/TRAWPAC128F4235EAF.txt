Sort of wonder why
No one said a word
Don't you like it on the sly?
Don't you like it till it hurts?

Have I been on your mind?
What's a voice without a song?
Somethin? in your head
You've been fightin? all along, well

I don't want to say it
The news is not so good
We'll never get away
And even if we could

We'd just play the tambourine
Around an open flame
Oversleep and burn
To be back in the game

'Cause summer never comes
Nowhere near high noon
And winter never comes
Nor the harvest moon

Raw sugar, I don't wanna die
Living in a high rise grave
My baby, come home
...
