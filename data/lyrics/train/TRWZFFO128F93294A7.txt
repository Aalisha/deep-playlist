Damn you're getting old
You're not twenty-four anymore
You've been here five years
So many tears, good years
Everything I am
Everything you want
Everything I try to be
turns up being me
You said that it's not me
I'm wasting time on consequence

Rewind
Hope you've enjoyed
Spent too much time
Stuck in the noise
From everything, everyone, everybody move along
Get away from my space
Let me be
Give me peace
Rewind
