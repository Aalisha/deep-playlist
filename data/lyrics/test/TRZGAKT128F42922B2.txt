I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the changes you put me through
Stole my money, my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet

I wanna know boy, won't you tell me
Tell me how can I stay here with you

Chorus:
Won't you take me to the river
Wash me down
Take me to the river
Put my feet back on the ground
