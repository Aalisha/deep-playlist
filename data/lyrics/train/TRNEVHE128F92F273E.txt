I hope I never wake up
I dream about you all the time now
And I don't wanna face
Another night without you here
Someday, someway, somehow
We will be together again
You know I've always wanted
Just to feel the touch of your love
You know I've always hated
Knowing how far apart we are
Someday, someway, somehow
We will be together again
I just want you to know

[CHORUS:]
Baby I'm all messed up in you
