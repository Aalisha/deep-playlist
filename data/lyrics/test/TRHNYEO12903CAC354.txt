Tell me now, when does this start feeling
Like I understand everything I’m dealing with
First I was young, now it’s all just happening
And what about the way I said that
Made You turn around and shake your head
Like I don’t even know what I’m asking for

Well, this could be all about just letting go
Or this could be all about just holding on

I can’t get my feet off of the ground
I wanna run but I don’t know how
Can You reach down here and pull me out
Can You pull me out? Yeah

I wanna scream but there’s no sound
I wanna fly to You somehow
Can You reach me here and pull me out
Can You pull me out? Yeah
