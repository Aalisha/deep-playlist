Hi, I thought I'd drop by, so nice to see you
It's been too long since I was holding you
I've been holding on to a prayer
'Cause my dreams never seem to come true
Oh, I'm never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go, it's not that easy
Oh, I'm never letting go, never letting go
Never letting go, I'm crazy about you
But I can live without you
I left the kitchen lights on these past three nights
It don't know why just keep shining bright
And now your eyes ain't answering from a mile
