If the sun refused to shine, I will still be loving you
If the mountains crumbled to the sea, there would still be you and me

Kind man, I give you my all
Kind man, nothing more

Little drops of rain, whispers of the pain
Tears of love lost in days gone by

My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we will go until we die

But my inspiration that's what you are to me
...
