She was swinging from her handbag on the King's Road,
fresh from boarding school and double-barreled shame.
Now there are worms in her skin, she's razor thin, her eyes are pinned,
I get the "daddy never noticed" story again.

She takes me to her house in the city
Her gaze as vacant as a byline in the news
And I reach in disbelief and resign myself
She's slumming it in someone else's shoes

Burberry Blue Eyes
This town is not so small
If you take everyone to bed
And leave the lights all on
Somebody will see it all
The details; your midnight operations
The tears you've been spreading around
And your story's so predictable
You spent too long just hangin' around
Hangin' around
