Tonight, I'm finding for me it's getting harder and harder to sleep
I drained all my pens and filled all my pads
But these words keep coming again and again
And if timing is everything, well then what does that say about you and me
Was it our broken watch or busted start
I guess the time that we need is time apart
Let's get older, let's get wiser, so you can call me and I'll answer
And I'll say, "Dear, I was just thinking of you."
And we'll laugh like just like we used to
I know you're angry, you know I miss you
...
