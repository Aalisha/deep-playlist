Hello what's your name?
I've seen you before in a dream
hello what's your name?
I've seen you before in a dream

we was talking in the garden
we was talking on the sea
we was talking on a mountain
we was talking in the city

it was dark now it is light
and I feel all your love bite
and I want to take you home
yes I know we will be fine
