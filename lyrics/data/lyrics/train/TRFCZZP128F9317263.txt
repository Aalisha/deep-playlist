From desolation, silence
Ignite our master's violence
We feel our aching linger
We feel our fear
I never knew you felt this way
There's nothing left for us to be
We've fallen, fallen from desire
There is no cure, to kill my fire

Tie them down and use them up
Endless supply
With all this pain to fuel us
Endless will die
So incomplete
I won't admit defeat
So incomplete
The pain will linger

Wasted years
A waste of time
