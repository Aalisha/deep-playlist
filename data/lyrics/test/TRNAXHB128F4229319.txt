WHITE LIES
Every evening when I walk through the door
I hear the same old lies that I've heard before:
you're going out for the evening, going out with a friend.
Do you really want me to believe that again?
 You're telling white lies, you're telling white lies.
 I can see right through that this disguise.
 Can't you tell I can tell when you're telling white lies?
Take these chains and set me free,
release me from this misery.
