Works of art
Painted black
Magniloquent
Bleeding dark
Monotonous palate
Murky spectrum
Grimly unlimited
Food for thought
So prolific
In contrasting shades
Forcely fed
Abstraction, so choking
So provocative

A canvas to paint
To degenerate
Dark reflections
Degeneration
A canvas to paint
To denigrate
Dark reflections
Of dark foul light

Profound, aesthetic beauty
Or shaded, sensary corruption
...
