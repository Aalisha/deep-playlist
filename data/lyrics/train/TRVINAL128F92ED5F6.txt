I gotta diesel on my sleezebend
Plowin up a cloud of dust
I just called my buddy steve
He's been haulin here from dawn til dust
And cotton pickin ricky said he's ready for a cold beer
Kimmi called me from a party and said get it in gear
We got long necks and long legs waitin for ya over here

C'mon c'mon
We been knuckle bustin back breakin head achin all week long
C'mon
Hey were lookin for some lovin and a sip of somethin strong
Gonna get it right even if it's wrong
