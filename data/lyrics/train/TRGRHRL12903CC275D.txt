I'll admit it, I've done a few things
That I shouldn't be proud of
I've got no remorse, no regrets
Never happy ending's on these dark sets

And if you wanna get down
I can go down as low as you wanna get
I wouldn't try to push me
It'll only leave you with regret

Don't test me

I can rip you off
And steal all your cash
Sucker punch you in your face
Stand back and laugh
Leave you stranded
As fast as a heart attack

All day I think bad thoughts
I can break your heart
At the drop of a hat
Stab you in the back
In two minutes flat

Screw your girl
In the back of my Cadillac
I think bad thoughts

Take this to the streets
Finish it, flush it down the toilet
Like you're taking a piss
It should be good to see
For a change, just a day
How the other half lives

And when I take you out
I'll stare you down
Make sure you're getting nervous
...
