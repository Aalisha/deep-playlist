I dreamt that I was dreaming, I was wired to a clock,
Tickled by the minute hand tick tock tick tock,
I dream I'm on a train and it is making music,
I don't remember getting on clickity click clickity click,
I dreamt that I was very tall, I was bigger than King Kong,
I heard the bells the bells a'ringing a'ding dong ding dong,
I dreamt that I was sitting in the devil's company,
He gave a solemn promise fe fi fi fun for me,
I dreamt that I was chasing the monster out of me,
I caught him in the corner ha ha hee hee hee,
I dream I'm in a tunnel between here and now,
Scooby do-be where would you be bow wow wow wow,
I dream I'm at a crossroads no place left to go,
I look in each direction eenie meanie miny mo,
