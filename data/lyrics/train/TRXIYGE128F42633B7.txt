Up in the sky
It's a bird,
It's a plane
Yea, it's a plane.
I'm not afraid to fly,
I'm not afraid,
Yea, I guess I'm afraid.
Fear is a good thing,
It teaches us humility,
And it can keep us sane.
So I'll fly high if I have to,
If I could, I'd take the train.

Livin' away from home on the road all the time ah,
All the time
I've been up and down and back and forth,
No reason or rhyme, yea you guessed right.
Makes a grown man confront his fears,
Consider options, he'd normally decline.
I'm gonna find my ticket to fly,
I'm gonna fly, I'm gonna fly-high
