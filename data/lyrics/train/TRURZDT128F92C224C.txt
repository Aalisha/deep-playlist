O.A.R. (Of A Revolution)
Miscellaneous
King Of The Thing
It's been a long, long time since I lost myself.
Put my pride down on the table put my fear on the shelf.
So I bought myself a thrown to reside and let myself go.
But I've traveled much too far, where I've gone I'll never know.

What a long, long time
Long, long time
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.
Wanderin' in the rain.
Losing my mind.
What a long, long time.
What a long, long time.

My days I've spent relaxing turned to nights relaxin' too.
A thousand eyes upon me, but my sights are missing you.
So this time I swear I will loosen my grip.
