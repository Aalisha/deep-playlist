He likes to act like he's all grown up
He wanted to grow up to be
An actor, but he never told anybody

He likes to spill all of his guts
On the top of a well stocked bar
And then swallow them bit by bit
Remembering every scar

It's a valid reason for every drink
And a new tattoo is a new reason to think

He likes to pretend that he's all sewn up
It makes for a much stronger case
But there is blood underneath that skin
That scar is not so easy to erase
