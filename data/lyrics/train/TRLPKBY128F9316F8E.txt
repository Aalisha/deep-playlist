(Verse 1:)
Oh! It seems like this room is just too small
Like it's us and no one's here at all
But it's crowded you made me know 'em all
Cause you're so close, and you're so cold
You got me like, oh!

(Chorus:)
Out of everyone around
You've got me up in the clouds
How you stand out from the crowd
I wonder, what did you do to make me notice 'cause it's show it
Your sensuality
Sensuality
