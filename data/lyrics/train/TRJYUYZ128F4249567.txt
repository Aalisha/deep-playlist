[Intro: Hell Razah]
Yeah... yeah...
Yeah... Hell Razah... a/k/a... the Renaissance Child
Razah Rubies, the Rabbi
I wanna give a special thanks to everybody out there
That bout the album, you know, I appreciate that
For all the love and the support and everything, knowImean?
Yeah, wings up, throw ya M's in the air, let's go

[Hell Razah:]
I'm bout that jackpot-jackpot, keeping my gat cocked
Still Red Hook like the G train, last stop
Where black cops take, a percentage from crack spots
Where fans online like I invented the laptop
My black Godfather to match my black revolver
With bullets that'll tear through your vest and body armor
Get turned into martyrs and buried at funeral parlors
And covered up with make-up, keep, fucking our cake up
Your moms'll be begging the lord for you to wake up
Like Harry Melvin and the Blue Notes, I'll give you two pokes
Of gun smoke, from my toast, you get too close
This is BK, home of the bosses and kidnappers
Where ice like igloo, picks cold as Alaska
I spit that emerald, saphire and jasper
I'm where the coke so white they call it Casper
