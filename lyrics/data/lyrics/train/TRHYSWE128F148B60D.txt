He wears Old Spice, he got fuzzy dice
Hangin' from the rearview mirror of his 4 wheel drive
Yeah he's GQ, and he can do more
With cheap polyester than Calvin Klein
He drinks false staff, he got 27 ballcaps
He wears a different one every night
He'll tell you he's a lover
When he ain't pickin' a fight

He's a redneck romeo,
he thinks he's Elvis in a picture show
Silver chains but a heart of gold,
Lord you got to love his style.
A classic country Cassanova,
thinks all the girls are crazy over him.
