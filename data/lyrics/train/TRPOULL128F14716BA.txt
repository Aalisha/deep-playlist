I've been called an operator,
I can sell an eskimo snow,
Baby, your'e a calculator,
But all you ever tell me is no.


You make me run, run, run, say your havi'n none,
You make me run, run, run, chase me with a gun.
I'll never give up!
I've got to do or die,
I'm reach'in for the sky,
I'd like to make you mine,
You know I will in time,
? Do or Die,
No matter how you try,
You'll never change my mind,
I got to Do or Die!
