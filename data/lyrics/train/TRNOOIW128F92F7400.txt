Painted over the walls the saddest color of blue
Posters covered in glass, favorite curbside grab
Red Valentine's card, stuck on the mirror to keep
Record player made of tubes spinning Tommy by The Who

There's no time
To waste
There's no time
To wait

Keys on the hook by the door for the truck sold years ago
...
