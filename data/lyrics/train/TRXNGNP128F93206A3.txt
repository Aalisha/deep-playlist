Pressure
Pressure is all we've got

The less you know the more you strain to reach out to see in the balance there's nothing free
It took the best of them down with a single blow

Brace yourself for the challenge ahead,
Don't waste your breath on what you know
Brace yourself for the challenge ahead, you've got to pace yourself the last to go

I journeyed to the edge of all my tears and counted every night I fought alone/bartered
I pray that you could feel like I do, never to remain a martyr

The less you know, you're getting shadowed by vanity
Somehow rage becomes clarity
