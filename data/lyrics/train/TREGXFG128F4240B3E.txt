ok, lets set this straight
we have a joke of a welfare system
that we just won't tolerate
and one day you'll have to listen
'cos, what's more there's major flaws
with our views on immigration
we always attack the symptom not the cause
and don't address this: global deprivation
seems like we avoid the truth
we need a deeper understanding
education of the youth
inequity disbanded
the interests of the rich prevail
and they're far from humanist
the hegemonic base will fail
and social justice will persist
a cultural upheaval and an overhaul of the state
our institutions are breaking down
we want change before its too late
we shut ourselves away
won't accept our responsibilities
but through our unfair trade
we have a role in creating poverty
this is kept out of sight
mayb we're too inward looking
...
