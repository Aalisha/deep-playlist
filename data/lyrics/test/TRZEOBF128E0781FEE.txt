Life is the answer to all the questions
Take one at a time
'Cause there's far too many to mention
That's the way of life, come on now

Joy, it's a new sensation
New vibration, rocking the nation
Joy, it's a new sensation
New vibration, rocking the nation

It's time that we all joined hands
Living together as sisters and brothers
Learn to love one another
To survive in this life and live together

Let's get right down to action
Where we all can gain some satisfaction
That's the way I wanna live my life
