He won't pretend to care
He won't hesitate to tell you
That he hates your stupid hair
Don't ask him if he likes it
He'll set you up to knock you down
Truth be told he'd like to smash your
Heart into the ground
He's just the jerk and he's going to ask you
Where you're from and why'd you leave
He's just the jerk
And he'll make you want to
Squirt his eyes with Listerine
He's just the jerk and he's going to tell you
...
