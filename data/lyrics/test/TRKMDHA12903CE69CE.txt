Sun's up
It's a little after twelve
Make breakfast for myself
Leave the work for someone else

People say
They say that it's just a phase
They tell me to act my age
Well I am!

On this perfect day
Nothing's standing in my way
On this perfect day
When nothing can go wrong
It's the perfect day
Tomorrow's gonna come too soon
I could stay
Forever as I am
On this perfect day

Sun's down
A little after ten
