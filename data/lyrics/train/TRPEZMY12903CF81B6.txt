Oh Isadora how beautifully misunderstood
Is that what kept you moving moving
So ahead of you time but so far behind from where
You should be heading
Settle you heart settle you heart
Lead me with your little strong hands
I'll follow you to the top of the world (you could be better than this)
To end of the world where ever you wish If only you would let me
If only you would let me catch my breath (we could be better than this)
Rest your head and your weary eyes when we continue
We could be something so much more
