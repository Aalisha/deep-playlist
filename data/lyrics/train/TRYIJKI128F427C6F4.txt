Tell myself, on the ride home
Getting tired, hating all I've known
Holding on, like it's all I have
Count me out, when it's clear that I, find it hard to say
And you, find it hard to care

I wanted to see something that's different, something you said would change in me
Wanted to be, anything different, everything you would change in me

Got this way, upfront but never true
