The people in the city call me country because of how I walk and talk and smile
Well I don't mind them laughin' in the city but the country folks all say I'm citified
The fightin' men may say that I'm a coward because I never pushed no one around
Gentle people call me troublemaker cause I'll always fight and stand my ground
Funny I don't fit where have all the average people gone
