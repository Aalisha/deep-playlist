Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo
Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, love me, lo

I need it, I need it when the moon is bright
I need it, I need it when you hold me tight
I need it, I need it in the middle of the night
I need your honey love

I want it, I want it when the lights are low
I want it, I want it just before you go
I want it, I want it because I love you so
Have a little of mercy and give some honey love

Now throw your arms around me
Pretend that you're lovey-dove
