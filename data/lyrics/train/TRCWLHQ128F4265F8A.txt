In the night I hear you speak
Turn around, you're in my sleep
Feel your hands inside my soul
You're holding on and you won't let go

I've tried running, but there's no escape
Can't bend them, and I just can't break these

Steel bars, wrapped all around me
I've been your prisoner since the day you found me
I'm bound forever till the end of time
Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine

Trying hard to recognize
See the face behind the eyes
Feel your haunting ways like chains
Around my heart they still remain

I'm still runnin' but there's nowhere to hide
...
