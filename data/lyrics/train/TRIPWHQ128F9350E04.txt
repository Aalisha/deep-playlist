Amy's got an angel on her shoulder
Maybe thats why her eyes shine so bright
Every time I tell her she starts laughin'
Says boy, you're crazy but you're alright

CHORUS:
And I love that girl
Yes, I love that girl more than a million bucks
I love that girl
Let me tell you how I love that girl
Amy, she's a wild one, a rock 'n' roller
Tell you how she makes my heart so free
She can make me happy without tryin'
Unlock the thunder inside of me
