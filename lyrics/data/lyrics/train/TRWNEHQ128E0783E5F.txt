I can see the yearning in your eyes
I can see the hunger you disguise
I know that it's for me
So here's your chance to be
The lucky girl for me to love tonight
I'll be glad to take you on a ride
Satisfy your craving deep inside
But this I'm telling you
Tomorrow we'll be through
You're just a girl for me to love tonight
Come tonight and see
