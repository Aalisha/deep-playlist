Do you ever think about me now?
Do you ever wonder how I kept on going?
Don't you ever wonder why I kept my eyes on the prize and I kept on moving . . .
yeah.
People will come, people will go.
I learned that a lifetime ago.
The world keeps on spinning, and I'll keep on winning.
Just as long as I know . . .
That I'm stronger than you know.
Though at times it didn't show.
It's right there in my heart and soul.
And I'll keep on moving.
