Sweep slides on my stereo
Short wave ride my rodeo
Became from that of Savalon
But I'm flyin' to Istanbul
Oh, so why don't you meet me there?

There is no nation of you, there is no nation of me
Our only nation lives in lucid dreams
Lucid dreams, I'm livin' in lucid dreams
I'm livin' on shortwave streams tonight

Well, I'll dial Alexandria
