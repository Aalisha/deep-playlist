Yeah, I wanna know how you want it
Can you tell me?

We pulled up in a fifteen stretch limo
Once we gettin' in the club, we gon' scout solo
My boys say we gotta go upstairs
About fifty situations, and you're not up there

Teesha, Ranesha, Pamela, Renee
I'm the king of the night, I'm 'bout to have it my way
Girls lookin' good up in VIP
Low key gold diggers tryna roll with me

(I know)
What we came here to do
Give me the number, I'll holla later on if it's cool
(And I know)
What I wanna get into
Baby girl, I wanna sample you
Tell me how do you want it?

How do you want it?
How do you feel?
If you do the thing right
You could be one of my situations
That's for real

How do you want it?
How do you feel?
If you do things right
You could be one of my situations
That's for real

I can't believe what I see
Situation got a big bubble in them jeans
I see you sippin' on Crissy, 'bout to get pissy
Heading back to the hizzy with my izzy

Girl I like the way you shake your hips
I love it when you lick your lips
Talking to my niggas 'cuz we sexy with cash
