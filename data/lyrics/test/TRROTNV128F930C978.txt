So sad the story like a dream
Millions of voices suddenly turned to steam

The final battle has begun
A wanton war that won't be won
Mothers clutch their wailing child
The fig tree burns; their tiny cries can't be calmed

Raining fire from the sky
Arrows that hold the power of the sun
Like ants they scramble for their homes
The fragile walls cannot keep out the storm

Raging waters wash all hope away
All can hear a sound
Like oceans crashing down

Whenever the wind blows for 7 years
