A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I can give you life, I can take it away
A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I'm working it out, I'm working

Feel so underrated
Why'd you feel so negated?

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into my soul
I wanted to bite, not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

She don't think straight
