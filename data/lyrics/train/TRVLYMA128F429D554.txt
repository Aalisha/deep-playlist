Heh some of the harder shit 
Peep this 
Niggaz get vexed whenever I step in 
Always wanna flex so I got a weapon 
Which protects ME and mine 
Get too bold then you're seein nine milli 
I rhyme silly but it really don't mean nothin 
I seen thugs always want a mean mug so I bring slugs 
to the party to reassure I be secure 
Really don't know why they beefin for 
I leave teeth in the floor like fossils I toss flows 
Just to show you, what the boss knows 
I got style, to make men hostile 
I shall continue, then you still lost while 
Challenging in physical combat 
Show me the ringleader, and the wiz'll go bomb that 
I come fat, you niggaz front runt cease 
They say bigger punks fear but I don't hear what 
they say I should, and when a hood try to steal my goods 
...
