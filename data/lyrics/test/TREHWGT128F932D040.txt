Hello, dear friends
And gentle hearts
My mind can't be free
Please say a prayer for me

All I know is someday
There'll be no pain
And you stood your ground
But how long can you be beaten down?

But that's one more broken hand
From punching at the walls
I'll stare into the sun
'Till I can't see at all
