ROCK AND ROLL IS HERE TO STAY
Danny & The Juniors

Rock 'n roll is here to stay,
it will never die
It was meant to be that way,
though I don't know why
I don't care what people say,
rock 'n roll is here to stay
(We don't care what people say,
rock 'n roll is here to stay)
Rock 'n roll will always be
our ticket to the end
It will go down in history,
...
