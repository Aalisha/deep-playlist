You've gotta a lotta lotta nerve
Coming here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you, it isn't fair
Born March of '86, my birthday's coming
And if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it

When you're 'round
I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes
Like no one else
Baby make it to me

Again and again
...
