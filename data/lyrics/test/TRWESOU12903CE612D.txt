You're a work of art

You're the Trevi Fountain

You're a golden heart

You're the highest mountain.
You bring me flowers every day of my life

You save me from the worry and the strife.

Take me in your arms
baby
baby
I'm on a winning streak

When I met you I reached my peak.
Your perfect view makes me feel brand-new
yeah

Well
you're just right to keep me up all night
up all night.

Working all the time to make you mine all mine
yeah

Riding the love train
stroke it up
riding the love train.
