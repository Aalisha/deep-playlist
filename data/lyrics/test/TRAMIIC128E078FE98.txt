One day without you
And I feel just like I'm somebody else
One day without you
And there's a fear there might be somebody else

You know, I'd like to keep you
Keep you to myself and by my side
You know, I'd like to keep you
Just like I know it's wrong to try
Just like my baby is born to cry
Every bird that sings is born to fly
