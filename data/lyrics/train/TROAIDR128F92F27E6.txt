Tear me open at the seams
Take everything you need
Take my heart if you like the beat
Take my lungs if it's hard to breathe, to breathe

"I'm not cold", she said
But she's shaking as she's lying next to me naked
Pulled the hair back from her face to let that smile heat this place
And this feels so far from real, I'm lost and I love it

I can't take it, if you're waiting
I am ready to tell the world about a girl
Who showed me love again for the first time
And it's everything I dreamed of

Tell me what you thought about
When you were breathing, oh, so loud
Screaming, oh, so loud, tell me if this is real
