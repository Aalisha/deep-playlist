Unconventionally a believer
In the power of your fellow kind
But when your pockets fill to overflowing
You can use it better than they can

There's something that you do believe in
There's nothing anyone should need
And your philosophy is ever changing
It's the backbone of your greed

Aesthetic anarchist
