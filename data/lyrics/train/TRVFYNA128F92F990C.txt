She told me not to step on the cracks
I told her not to fuss and relax
Pretty little face stopped me in my tracks
But now she sleeps with one eye open
But that's the price she'll pay

I took a knife and cut out her eye
I took it home and watched it wither and die
Well, she's lucky that I didn't slip her a smile
That's why she sleeps with one eye open
But that's the price she'll pay

I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
