Well, I'm ready, I'm willing
And I'm able to rock and roll all night
I'm ready, I'm willing
And I'm able to rock and roll all night
Come on pretty baby
We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll until the broad daylight

Because I'm ready and I'm able
I'm willing and I'm able
So you'd better come and go with me
We're gonna rock and roll 'til tomorrow 'bout three
