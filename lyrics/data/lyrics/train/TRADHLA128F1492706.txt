[Chorus:]
Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone
I'll give it to someone... special
Halalalala-Halalalala-Halalalala-Halalalala

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me
Happy Christmas,
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you"
