Uhm, uhm, uhm uhm, uhm, uh uh uh Baby forgive me
For making you wait so long
Boy please believe that
It's due to my lack of funds
Baby I swear, I'm gonna find a way to get out of here
Cause I wanna be where you are

() I've got to get to where you are
Cause I can't stand bein apart, from you
Just to think of your smile sooths my soul for a while boy its true
I've gotta get to where you are
I'll take a bus plane train or car
