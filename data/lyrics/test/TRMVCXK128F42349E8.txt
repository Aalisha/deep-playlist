I'm so happy to be here tonight
so glad to be here in your wonderful city
I have a little message for you
and I want to tell every woman and every man tonight
that's ever needed someone to love
that's ever had somebody to love them
that ever had somebody's understanding
that's ever had someone to need your love all the time
someone that's with them when they're up
somebody that's with them when they're down
if you had yourself somebody like this you better hold onto them
let me tell you something
sometimes you get what you want
and you lose what you have
there's a song I sing
and I believe that everybody should sing this song you can save the whole world
listen to me

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody wants somebody to love
Honey to hug
Sugar to kiss
Baby to miss now
Baby to tease
sometimes to please yeah
and I need you you you
and I need you you you
in the morning baby you you you
when the sun goes down you you you
ain't no nobody around you you you

Whoa Sometimes I feel like
I feel a little sad inside
