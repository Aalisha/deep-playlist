I remember all the nights i used to stay at home
On the phone all night long
U used to talk about the things u really wanted to do
I believed in you
I remember how you used to say have no fear be ok
When you told me anything you want is possible
We could have it all
Refrein
I believed in you i must have been a fool
All my dreams were with you
