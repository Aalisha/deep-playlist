(Billy Sherrill/Glenn Sutton/Tammy Wynette)

Here's a song I love to sing,
It's about the man that wears my ring.
And even though he's tempted, he knows,
I'll make sure that he gets everything.

'Cos when he's cold, he knows I'm warm,
And I warm him in my arms.
And when he's sad, oh, I make him glad.
And I'm his shelter from the storm.

I'm his song when he feels like singing.
And I swing when he feels like swinging.
