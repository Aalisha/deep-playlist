Quite some time, I been sittin' it out
Didn't take no chances, I was a prisoner of doubt
I knocked down the wailin' wall, ain't no sin
Got the feel of fortune, deal me in

Comin' straight on for you
You made my mind
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through
Straight on, straight on for you
Straight on for you

Now I know I got to play my hand
