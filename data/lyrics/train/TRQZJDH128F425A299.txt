(Gerard Love/Brendan O'Hare)

Saw you there with long blonde hair
Eyes of blue, oh baby, I love you.
When you're walking (I love your walk)
When you're talking (I love your talk)
Look so cute behind your kit
I've heard some songs but baby you're a hit.
When you're rocking (I love your rock)
When you're ticking (I'm your tock)
