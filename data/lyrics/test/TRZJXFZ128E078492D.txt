(Behind the groove)
There is another side inside of you
(Behind the groove)
We can make your wildest dreams come true

So get on up
(Behind the groove)
Shake your body
(Get behind the groove)
Open up and take the music in
(Get behind the groove)
You better get on up
(Behind the groove)
Into the party
(Get behind the groove)
Life is waiting for you to begin

(Behind the groove)
You can dance whoever has a way
(Behind the groove)
There is romance just a glance away

Got to move, get behind the groove
Why don't you let your spirit play?
Another me, and another you
If we make it through to Xanadu
(shoob be do do, shoob be do be bop)
