"Stalkin. walkin in my big black boots" [Brother J]
[repeat 2X]
[Ice Cube] 
God damn, another fuckin payback with a twist
Them motherfuckers shot but the punks missed
Ice Cube is out-gunned, what is the outcome?
Will they do me like Malcolm?
Cause I bust styles, new styles, standin - strong!
While, others +Run+ a +Hundred Miles+
But I never run, never will
Deal with the devil with my motherfuckin steel - BOOM! 
Media try to do me
But I was a Boy-N-the-Hood before the movie, yeah
Call me nigga, bigger than a spook
But you the one that voted for Duke, motherfucker
White man, is somethin I tried to study
But I got my hands bloody, yeah
They said I could sing like a Jaybird
But nigga, don't say the J-word
I thought they was buggin
cause to us Uncle Sam, is Hitler without an oven
Burnin our black skin
Buy my neighborhood - then push the crack in
Doin us wrong from the first day
And don't understand why a nigga got an AK
Callin me an African-American
like everything is fair again, shit
Devil, you got to get the shit right I'm black
Blacker than a trillion midnights
+Don't Believe the Hype+ was said in '88 
by the great Chuck D, now they're tryin to fuck me
". with +No Vaseline+
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline." - HUH!
It's a great day for genocide (What's that?)
That's the day all the niggaz died
They killed JFK in '63
So what the fuck you think they'll do to me?
But I'm the O.G. and I bust back (boom boom)
