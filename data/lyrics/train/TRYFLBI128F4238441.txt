The sky isn't always blue
The sun doesn't always shine
It's alright to fall apart sometimes, mmm
I am not always you
And you are not always mine
It's alright to fall apart sometimes

After all is said and done
One and one still is one
When we cry, when we laugh
I am half, you are half

The heart isn't always true
And I am not always fine
We all have an angry heart sometimes
