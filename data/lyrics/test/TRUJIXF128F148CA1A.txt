Treated unfairly
You resent everybody that has so much
Of the things in life that were taken away from you
So wrapped up in your misery
You never feel the love that surrounds you
So wrapped up in your misery
You never notice that life passed you by

You've waited all your life for the pain to go away
Lock yourself inside a world that makes you hate

Left it all alone
Ignored by the one you need attention from
For the things in life you never achieved on your own
He can? t be bothered to care for you
To hold and respect and be there for you
He can? t be a real father to you
