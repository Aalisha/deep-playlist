All these things that you've taken for granted
I never had the chance to experience
But I blame no one (I blame no one)
For what I've been through (what I've been through)
It's only driven me to continue

Regardless of the obstacles
I hold on to the things I love
Adversity will never make me come undone

All these things that you've taken for granted
...
