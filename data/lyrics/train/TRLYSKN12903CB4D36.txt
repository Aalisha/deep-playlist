It's Black C coming through with the gat blast
Then I'm locced out behind the mask watching the gut cashing
I'm greedy, I'm taking it from the needy like a genie
I'm dissapear in the cut so we can't see me
My beanie is pulled down so low we can't identify me
I got 18 reasons case he wanna try me
I keeps my Glock cocked, I got to keep a mouth prop
It don't stop, and if the tables turn then I might flip flopped
Then once again up and down, it's like a bouncing ball
Is it the end of a soldier just like Mack Mall?
