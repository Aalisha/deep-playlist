[Chorus: 50 Cent]

Aint it amazing, how crazy, the hood dun made me
Feels like my emotions are froze
I stay G'd Up
Its the things that I seen
And the shit ive been through that made my heart turn cold
I stay G'd Up,
I'm a gangsta ya find out fo sho if u eva step on my toes
I stay G'd Up,
When im hanigin' out tha window wit that AK
Fillin ya punk ass wit holes
I stay G'd Up

[50 Cent]

Cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, marijuana,
Mule on that Greyhound from the N-Y to the Carolinas,
Paper chase, different name
Same face, don't catch a case
My road dog's on parole
His baby gurls 4 years old
We play tha block, pistol cocked
You could shoot or get shot
Kill u for ur crack spot
Take everything your ass got
Semi-automatic spray
Bust back or run away
Niggaz talkin in tha hood
We'll handle his another day
In November, you make my shitlist
