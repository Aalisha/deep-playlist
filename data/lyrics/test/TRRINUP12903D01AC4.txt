You're a dreamer and you
Live in a world of lies
Full of sinners
You'll never understand
Quick deciever
I'm a joke of a
System that's failed
Always haunt you
Are you in command?

This is a time to change
And make things right
This is a time to
Make it on your own

You'll never be yourself
Don't ever lose your pride
Just find out who you are
...
