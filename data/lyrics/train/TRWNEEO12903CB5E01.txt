she ain't got no money
her clothes are kinda funny
her hair is kinda wild and free
oh, but love grows where my rosemary goes
and nobody knows like me

she talks kinda lazy
and people say she's crazy
and her life's a mystery
oh, but love grows where my rosemary goes
and nobody knows like me
there's something about her hand holding mine
it's a feeling that's fine
...
