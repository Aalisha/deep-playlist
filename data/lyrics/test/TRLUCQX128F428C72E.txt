I want to get, you want to get
Let's go and get down and dirty baby
Play the game, play my way
But either way it's all the same baby

I want to get, you want to get
Let's go and get down and dirty baby
Play the game, play my way
But either way it's all the same baby

You're the type of guy to drive a girl wild
And you're the type of guy to make a girl smile
Boy you've got me tripping deep down inside, and all these feelings for you that
I have I can't hide
People say, don't get down with you, but I know how I feel for you
Though I may deny it, I'm digging you and that's how I...

Wanna get down
I want to get you, want to get
Let's go and get down and dirty
...
