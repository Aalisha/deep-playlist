Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
All his goods are sold again
His word's as good as gold again
Sez if you see jean now ask her please to pity me
Jean and I we moved along
Since the day - down in the hollow
When the mind went driftin' on
And the feet were soon to follow
Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
