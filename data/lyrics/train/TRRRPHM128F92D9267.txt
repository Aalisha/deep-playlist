And while the city sleeps
I won't weep because I didn't keep
My boyfriend and the summer's end is here again
And the leaves are golden
Under the grand silver birch tree

While we're thinking bout the people we meet
Dancing feet, wasters on the cover of a magazine
People you've kissed, people you lust
And the one's that you might not
Ever remember what's the use

I'm not what I was last summer
Not who I was in the spring
...
