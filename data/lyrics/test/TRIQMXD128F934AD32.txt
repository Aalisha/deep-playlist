A storm rolls in from the sea
Covering the land with black thunder clouds
Rain whips the ground at their feet
As they come ashore in this foreign land

Thunder breaks the silence of five hundred men assembled on shore
Gazing through the misty rain
At the mountain not a mile away
So dark and silent it stands there
The mighty AMON AMARTH
Reaching for the cloudcloked sky
So grim and fearful in might

With the wind in their backs they start walking
Decisive men of the north
They stride through this darkened land
With only mount doom in their sight
...
