Holla Holla Holla
Holla Holla Holla...

Holla Holla Holla
Maybe, it's me, maybe I bore you
But no no, it's my fault,'cause I can't afford you
Maybe baby, Puffy, Jay-z
would all be better for you

'Cause all I can do is love you
Baby when I used to love you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you, do anything you asked me to
But I tired of livin this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realized that I just don't love you

Not like I used to
Holla Holla Holla

Holla Holla Holla...
Maybe, I should rob somebody
