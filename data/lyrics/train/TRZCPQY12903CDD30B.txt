No matter gay or grim, it's those tiny little sparks
Daily life that makes me forget my wounded heart
It doesn't matter when, it may rain or it may shine
blurry memories of us come back from time to time
(repeat)

No matter gay or grim, it's those tiny little sparks
Daily life that makes me forget my sulky heart
It doesn't matter when, it may rain or it may shine
You will always be here stored inside my mind
