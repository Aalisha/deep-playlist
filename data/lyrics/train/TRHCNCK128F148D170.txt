Out on the range
The quiet, endless still
Where the wild S.S.I
Whispers from these hills
It's a petrified forest
Trailer parks and fords
And there ain't no goin' back
Rodeo girl
Saddle up
There's no more credit in this bank
Try your luck
Up in the East
Down in the West
Hold on tight
To the pony that you love the best

There's a medicine at the gate
And a number on your back
...
