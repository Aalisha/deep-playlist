Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Been floatin' around up here on cloud eleven
I did my best to make it to twenty-seven
Open up my eyes and I can see the glory
Now I'm alive and I'm gonna tell the story

Now I'm a superstar in the makin'
I ain't fuckin' around and there ain't no mistakin'
I never ask for somethin' worth the takin'
'Cause I'm a superstar, baby
