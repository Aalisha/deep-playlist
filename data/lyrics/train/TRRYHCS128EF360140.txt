don't you look at me so lovingly when i know you've been untrue
don't lie to me a thousand times and tell me you feel blue
dont break my heart and rip it up like i know you want to
my mind's made up i'm so fed up cos i'm too much in love with you
my mind's made up i'm so fed up cos i'm too much in love with you
oooo oo oooo
oooo ooo ooooo
they told me to be weary of but then they lied to you
i tried so hard but your round blue eyes they broke my heart in two
you cheat on me and lie to me and make me feel so blue
