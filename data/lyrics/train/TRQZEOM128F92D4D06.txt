[Verse 1:]
On that great day when he cracks the sky
When the world hears the trumpet sound And the dead begin to rise
I wonder how it would be
Will I be walking down the street
Will it happen right in the middle of the day
Or at night while I'm asleep

[Chorus]
All I know is I want to be ready
I want to be ready
And I want you to say well done
I just want you to say well done

[Verse 2:]
I can already see the signs
Each day the world is getting worse
It seems the world itself is crying out
For someone to rescue her
