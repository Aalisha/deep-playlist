Verse 1:
Every morning I watch you
Walk into the office
In your business suit
And matching shoes
With your hair pulled up neatly
You tug at your glasses
And you sit down
Just three desks down
And I watch you in the florescent glare
And my mind drifts away somewhere
And I see

Chours:
You
In a different light
Your hair falling down
With love in your eyes
In my mind
...
