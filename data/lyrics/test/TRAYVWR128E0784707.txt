He's got a shark skin suit
And a diamond earring
He's got jet black hair just like his mother
He's got a jail tattoo of his long lost brother
He's got a shotgun fuse don't you pull his trigger

Broke from jail without a gun
Public enemy Number 1
Killed a man on the run
On the lam without bail
Heading straight back to jail
Nowhere else for him to go

Daddy-O! Daddy-O!

He's gonna make his mark in a Vegas hotel
You roll snake-eyes Jack! (Yeah!)
He's gonna make his money
