No lies, no lies, I've got to tell you
That I don't want to hear
All those feelings and things that you said
When you want me to stay

I don't understand why you always turns
And make things so strange
Just to let you know that I really care
For the things that you said

I don't want to hear more bullshit
Specially from you 'cause you're so kid
Specially when you are in the mud
I can tell your really intentions
I can tell what you really want for me

I don't want to hear more bullshit
If you really tell me something now
Just cut the crap if you want to late down with me
Just cut the crap if you want to tell me, "I love you"
