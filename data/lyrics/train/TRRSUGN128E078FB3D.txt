"Everything that I have done this season has been turned into something negative," Iverson said. "People in the media have written some negative things about me and now that is the big issue with this year's 'Rookie of the Year' Award."

This just in the rap group, Lost Boyz, spelled L-O-S-T B-O-Y-Z are being charged with siting several riots during their performances. They are best known for sipping Hennessey and twisting trees backstage. This group is linked to the South Jamaica, Queens Lost Boyz. They are considered New York's third largest gang. Sources say that government officials have big problems with the way the group lives.

[Verse 1]:
WHY They won't let us do no shows in New York
WHY They won't even let us fuckin talk
WHY They say Lost Boyz be a gang
WHY Nah man kid we just do our thang
WHY Why we always in the cut sometimes
WHY Why we roll and sleep on bunks sometimes
WHY Why I be askin myself that
WHY Why I turn my cat to the bat
WHY Why I freestyle and write
WHY What dumb sharks that fight
WHY Why God take me to Queensbridge
WHY Why the fuck you did what you did
WHY I see be wild gettin down
WHY OOE J drama's in town
WHY I represent my crew
WHY Speak nice Freaky Tah pretty new
WHY I represent South Jamaica what
WHY Me and my team we'll get in your gut
WHY Stay trees with fam all day
WHY Write my name in the complex hallway
