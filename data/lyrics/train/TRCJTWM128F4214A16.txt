(Young Buc)Verse 1

Vacate your home i come to break your bones
i mans worse nightmare we at it again
a desert eagle and a black mac 10
they never know what happened
when we come through
them cowards dont want none
They screamin if the murder us for walking with no gunz
come with me but don't run
and die where you're standing
see i'm holding on this cannon
and your life i'm demanding
put the pipe to your melon
and your brains on the pavement
these niggaz is talkin' thinkin security gon' save em' (ha)
nobody gon speak when homicide pay a visit
look you right in the eyes and tell you 'we don't know who did it'
corrupted by street corner by shootin' at the police
the feinds up all night
and the neighobrs gettin no sleep
you better get used to it
you know how we do it
Shady Aftermath interscope and G-UNIT

Chorus (GIRL)
we got action were you don't
