You've come to me with your tears
But I just walk away in anger
I won't forget the years I lost
You took away my youth

You seek forgiveness from me
I close my eyes and pretend you're not here
I've moved one. I'm not afraid of you
I know you're weak

I'm here to tell you - you'll never own me
I will refuse you and laugh as you cry
You've violated but now I'm stronger
