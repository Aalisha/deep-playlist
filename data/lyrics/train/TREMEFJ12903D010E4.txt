You went looking for me, dear, down by the sea
You found some little silver fish but you didn't find me
I was hiding, dear
Hiding all away
I was hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away

Then you went to the museum and you climbed the spiral stair
You searched for me all among the knowledgeable air
I was a-hidden, babe
I was a-hiding all away
I was a-hidden, dear
I was a-hiding all away

You entered the cathedral when you heard the solemn knell
I was not sitting with the gargoyles
I was not swinging from the bell
I was hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I was a-hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away

All right now

You asked an electrician if he'd seen me round his place
He touched you with his fingers
Sent sparks zapping out your face
I was hidden, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I was not there, dear
I was a-hiding all away

A-well, you went and asked the doctor to get some advice
Well, he shot you full of Pethidine and then he went and billed you twice
But I was a-hiding, dear
I was a-hiding all away
I was a-hiding, dear
A-hiding all away
