No Santa this morning
I guess my note got through
I told him quit calling
Cos all I want is you

Gotta get a minute
Gotta get you on your own
Your baby sister's sleeping
And your daddy's on the phone
I'm sure you're hiding something hot
You wanna give to me
And not another pair of socks from
Underneath the tree

(CHORUS)
Ooh ooh you give me something I could never
Got from Santa Claus, baby
Ooh ooh I'll let you peep inside my stocking
If you show me yours
...
