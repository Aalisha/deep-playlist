I’ve got a friend of mine he need some peace of mind
I wanna make it right
I’ve got a friend of mine he needs some peace of mind
He needs a little time maybe a little wine
I wanna make it right
He needs a little time maybe a little wine
I wanna make it right! I wanna make it right
I don’t wanna fake it you know I wanna make it right
I don’t want to fake it you know I wanna make it right
