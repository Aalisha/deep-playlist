I guess it's hard to comprehend thing with your tiny brain
I guess it will take longer for me to try to explain
I figured that my actions would probably explain myself
I should have spoken slower when I said rot in hell
So I'll explain the following as detailed as I can
My patience has been wearing thin so try to understand

I guess you thought I wanted peace
Well I didn't mean to mislead
My point just did not come across
Somehow the whole meaning was lost
What I meant to say just might hurt
But my intensions are far worse
The confusion of my strange advice
Can be solved in just one simple slice
Mistook me trying to enlighten
But now you're just trembling and frightened
I guess you just can't comprehend
