I've got a baby at home
A to-do list a mile long
And a husband who comes home each night
I do the laundry, I cook and clean
It's my responsiblility
And I'm usually in the bed by nine

But I still like a cold beer and a long dirt road
And listening to some Keith Whitley on the radio
Don't mean I ain't a good mama
Don't mean I ain't a good wife
I'm just like anybody else
