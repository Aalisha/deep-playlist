We walked arm in arm
But I didn't feel his touch
The desire I'd first tried to hide,
That tingling inside was gone
And when he asked me:
'do you still love me?'
I had to look away
I didn't want to tell him
That my heart grows colder with each day

When you've loved so long
That the thrill is gone
...
