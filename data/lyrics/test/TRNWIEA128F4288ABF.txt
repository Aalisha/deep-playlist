[Reef The Lost Cause]
Yo, this young buck rowdy, my gun buck loudly
When I was a buck, they had me locked up down in
Buck's County
But I beat that wrap, you never catch me on a beat
that's whack
I can't eat like that
Reef that cat who cock back, let the Desert hit you
When you thought I was just talkin' shit like Freddie
Mitchell
You ain't ready, is you? I invest in every pistol
Aim on point like a steady missile
Heavy fiscal, I need that love, hundreds in dubs
Where the weed at? I need that drug, cause I'm
addicted to it
Rhyme-boxes start spittin' fluid
When y'all do it, seem don't nobody listen to it
Love from Philly all the way to kids in Munich
Germany, I murder beats and add the difference to it
Word to Pazienza, smack your men's up, crack your
limbs up
And leave you fucked up like a Latin's liver

[Chorus: x2]
So listen up
They be scrapin' your cantaloupe off the pavement
You know we in the place with the guns in our waist
Step through the door, tore the shit off the hinges
