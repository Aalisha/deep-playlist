Oh yeah, I wanna tell you 'bout my baby
I wanna tell you 'bout my baby, oh yeah now

When the sun goes down
Everybody oughta be with the one you love
When the sun goes down, oh yeah, yeah, yeah now
I can just feel you in my arms right now
Baby, please come back home

You see I love you, I want you, I need you, I love you
Baby, come on, come on, come on baby
I just wanna be loved, I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be loved, I just wanna be loved
Need you, love you, won't you baby, yeah
