Hey!
Here I am
And I want you to see baby
I wanna watch you watchin me in motion
To taste the secret side of me
Every time I look at you, I know
You're fighting your emotions
Now you have no choice but to let go
And dive into my ocean

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweeeeet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Yeah

Hold my hand
I'm going to set you free baby
