Have you lost your way?
Livin' in the shadow of the messes that you made
...
And so it goes

Everything inside your circle starts to overflow
...
Take a step before you leap
Into the colors that you seek

You give back what you give away
So don't look back on yesterday
Wanna scream out, no more hiding
Don't be afraid of what's inside

Gonna tell ya you'll be alright
In the aftermath
Anytime anybody pulls you down
Anytime anybody says you're not allowed

Just remember you are not alone
In the aftermath
...
You feel the weight

Of lies and contradictions that you live with every day
...
...
