I know everything you're doin baby
and I know every game you're runnin
You must think that I am blind
Cause it's right before my eyes
So don't get it twisted baby

Don't say that I got it wrong
Cause there's just no way out for you this time
And don't say that our love is strong
Cause we both know you want to crawl
Back under the rock you came from
And hide away
