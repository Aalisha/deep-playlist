Dirty street and dirty hands
A broken kid and a helpless man
All that they know given the barren land
A storefront clerk told me, "Walk away,
You need not live this life of shame."
I said, "Hold on my friend, for you will find a way."

You cannot break it, love will help you make it
Don't throw yourself in a burning fire
And when you come home, singing all your sad songs
Why don't you leave it in the water
For the friends and all the lovers tonight

Turning back I want to leave it again
Losing track I want to leave it again, leave it again
...
