Indian summer, Abeline
You were new in town, I was nineteen
And the sparks flew
They called us crazy behind our backs
Romantic fools, we just let them laugh
Because we knew

It may be a long shot
We may get lonely down the line
Love knows no reason
And I won't let 'em make up my mind

My money's riding on this dark horse, baby
My heart is saying it's the lucky one
And it's true color's gonna shine through someday
If we let this, let this dark horse run

Stars are brighter in a desert sky
No need to wonder or justify
...
