No weapon formed against us shall prosper
Our enemies will not prevail
Through the lightning and the thunder
Your light will guide us as we sail

The music is gonna play
And God, You will have Your way
The nations will stand and sing
Glory to the King

We will stand as one in singing
We will live in harmony
We will live lives of compassion
Lord to You all praises be

The music is gonna play
And God, You will have Your way
The nations will stand and sing
...
