This is a war we live
And the sides are drawn, sides are drawn
And we're all wrapped up in fatigues
And they wear us out, wear us out
There is a storm at sea

If we fly a white flag under a black and blue sky will the red sun rise?
(The taste of your kerosene lips burn me up)
If we fly a white flag under a black and blue sky will the red sun rise?
(Eyes glare from your enemy sights make me go blind)

Blinds divide the sunlight into thin strips the size of a blade
In this trench that we dig for ourselves fourscore and fade
Glare with the enemy heat of the bodies in the bed
There's no retreat

This is our war we live in
