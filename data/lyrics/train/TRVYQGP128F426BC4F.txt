Drive Drive it home right now
Drive it home know how
Take it from the heart
You gotta tear yourself apart
From hell... sinking hell
Like disease where I dwell
Burning kidneys where I roam
Never taking you back home
Let it out ride tonight
Drive Drive it home right now
Drive it home know how
Told you from the start
tear your fucking heart apart
Drive me home right now
Drive it home right now
Take from my heart
