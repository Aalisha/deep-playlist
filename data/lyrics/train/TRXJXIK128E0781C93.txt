Jen thinks it isn't fair that I don't really care
if she likes me or not
1-2-3-4
and Jen doesn't like to settle
till she makes me feel like Howie Reynolds, yeah
she thinks that I'm all that I've got

Chorus:
No Jen doesn't like, like me anymore
no she doesn't, no
Jen doesn't like to come to my shows
she don't like my whoa-whoa's
...
