Let's get wasted
It's all we ever do,
We're so stupid
But that's ok the drunks are your friends
We'll just sit here
Wasting our time
Thinking out loud
There's nobody listening
Well I'm ever so cold
Is all I get told, I'm ever so cold
You're ever so shy
You keep it on side
It's more than just lies
You're ever so cool
And I'll be a fool if you let me
I'm ever so shy,
...
