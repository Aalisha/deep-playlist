Listen, baby not with your ears cuz this song will pass you by
So this is the language of love, not every man can read at times
So forget about whatever you learnt boy,
You don't have to speak your mind to me no
With every page you tum you'll find me, in between the line so

And we don't even have to spell out
What "you in love with me" is about
And being in love with you is louder than I could ever shout

Cuz no words can explain what I feel each day
Every time you're around Seems the ground slips away
When you come down to me and I just could not speak.
It wasn't hard to see, you silenced my whole world and left me breathless
I don't need No Words, No Words, No Words, No Words
We don't need no Words
