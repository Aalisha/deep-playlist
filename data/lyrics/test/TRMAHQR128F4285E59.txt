The strong belief
that keep on dragging him down
The voice of her religion,
the pain and the greed
is bringing him to his knees

He need no eyes
to see that she's bleeding on the inside
The maker of her mind
The shadow right behind
Salvation's so close
but too hard to find

The next turn must reveal a lovely day
The next turn must reveal a lovely day
