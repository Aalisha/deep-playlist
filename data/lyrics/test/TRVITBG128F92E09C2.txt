No one's born into this world without a soul
Some will follow every single road trying to find a home
But when you're sheltered by the ones you love
You can stand protected safe from harm

In your life, don't ever let me fall
'Cause sometimes I think I'm falling like a burning satellite
You sacrifice, it doesn't matter who you are
We all fall down

We're moving slowly past the point of no return
Silence is a deadly potion when you have no words
And we can put the pieces back together
Find a way to make things right
