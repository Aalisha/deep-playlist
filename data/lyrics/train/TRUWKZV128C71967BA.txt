Forget me not
Those weren't your words
I'm home haven't you heard the ring?
The sound of my voice
I know it isn't much

That's why I say your name
When I fall, when I hit the bottom
Say your name
When I fall, when I hit the bottom

Girl, play on
The boys will stay even if you're gone
Go girl, play on
...
