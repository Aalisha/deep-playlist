Moon over me
Looking at the stars dancing up above me
Sometimes I feel it calling to me
Heaven's infinite dream
It's such a sobering thing
In all the universe You would chose
To love me
I feel the arms that carry me througgh
Feel my heart close to you

Took some time to know how much you love me
To know how much I need you
To know how much I want to see You there

It's my destination, and it's my inspiration
Just beyond this place and time
