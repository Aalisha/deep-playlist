(Chorus)
Time, time is on your side
It's a lovely ride you wanna step inside
Time, time is on your side
It's a lovely ride you wanna step inside
We all fit to glide

(Verse 1)
When the time tic Pipe rhyme sick
Call em' Jorginho Pull a dime chick
Run with a click like Al Pacino in the God Father
Bitch why bother fahgetaboutit
I'll bang ya grand daughter if she in college
Don't ever doubt it keep it cracked open like crack flowin' in western Oakland.
Tryin' to stack somethin' from rap bustin' and keep on goin"
Like a drive by I ride high
With 90 guys that shoulda died high from bad vibes in 95
But I surprise guys
Never been thuggin' robbin or muggin doin' my thizzle
But kept under you gotta love 'em bodies is missin'
Sleepin' with fishes feedin' the worms
If I ain't eatin' then I ain't concerned
I'm out of time
