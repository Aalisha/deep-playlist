I was not looking for Linda but Linda found me
Hiding away on the slow train home
"Is this one for Paisley? Oh, you've got to help me"
(She used to work there a long time ago)

She'd spent 35 pounds on one pack of ciggies
Running an errand for him indoors
Then she kept running straight down to Leeds Central
Took Intercity and left her remorse
I'm looking out for Linda

Never stop looking, never stop looking for Linda
Never stop looking, never stop looking for Linda
