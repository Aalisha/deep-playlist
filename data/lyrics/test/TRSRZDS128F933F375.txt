Be the one (repeat)

The stage was set for me to play
but I decided on the day that i did not believe the page
I walked away because of you
just like Tiresias I knew
that me and you were fated too

we asked the church to save our souls
they said me were too early and to join the fold (?)
i lay and watch you sleep beneath the citrus sky
pretending not to see you through my wanting eyes

i knew you could (be the one)
i knew you should (be the one)
i knew you could (be the one)
be the one be the one
