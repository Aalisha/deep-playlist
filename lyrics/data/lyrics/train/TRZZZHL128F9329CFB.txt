You're far too strong, it couldn't happen to you

(Me) But what if there's truth in the words that they speak
What do they signify?
(Pride) You worry too much
(Me) And what are the questions to answers I seek
What will they clarify?
(Pride) Yeah, you're losing your touch
(Me) Help me out, this means nothing to me...
