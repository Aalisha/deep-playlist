Sitting on the green green grass
i know the sky is blue
and i know that this is true
so do you
In this world the rainbow has
so many colors to see
there is red, red yellow and green
and there's blue
there are so many colors
what color are you?
when i look at the rainbow (oh oh)
i only see them with you
oooooooooh...
Red, yellow and blue and green
and i only see them with you
(i only see them with you)
red, yellow and blue and green
and i only see them with you
(i only see them with you)
...
