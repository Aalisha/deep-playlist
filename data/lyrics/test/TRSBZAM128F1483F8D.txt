This town is full of monsters
Holding hands with other monsters
And attempting to be human beings
Shuffling around the shops
And waving at balloons

This town is full of monsters
Sitting on park benches
Eating little packets of sultanas
Licking chocolate off their chubby little fingers

And I don't know why
It is they scare me
But they do
And the thing that really frightens me
...
