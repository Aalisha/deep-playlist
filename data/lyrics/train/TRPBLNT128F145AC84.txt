It's been too clear for so long, I knew that there was something going on
Wanted to know what it's about, walked to your door, so we could talk it out
And as I got to your door that night, what did I see through the bedroom light

Chorus:
Two silhouettes, standing at the window
Two silhouettes, standing face to face
I turned away, didn't want to see, there ain't no more sadder sight to me
Than two silhouettes, yeah, ain't stopped crying yet, no
Still can't believe it yet, no, two silhouettes
