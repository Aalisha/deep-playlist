Oh, you were born with the sun.
Oh, you will die with the moon.
Everything you thought you had you lost.
But now you'd never lose what you don't have.

Prayers from above, never answered quite enough.
Now the only one you have is you.

With this cruel and bitter heart,
you were cold and in love,
left here naked in the sun.
