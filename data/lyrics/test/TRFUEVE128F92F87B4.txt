We've come this far by faith
Pick up your pace and don't you be late
I'm hear to tell ya about the good news
Somethin' about the path that we choose y'all
Wisdom has built this house now
Integrity will bring your pride out
If you know how to pray the situation out
Prayer is the answer..There is no doubt

Monday we held it together and..
Wednesday we had stormy weather and..
Friday we prayed it all better and..
Sunday we heard the news.

He won't stop blessing you
What he'll do is keep testing you
And a begger is no less than you
Cause' one day it could be you..
So get your folks together for some church y'all
Some good music and prayer in service won't hurt y'all
Even if you don't believe in the preacher
It's bound to be a few things she could teach you.

Monday we held it together and..
Wednesday we had stormy weather and..
Friday we prayed it all better and..
Sunday we heard the news
