You can't escape now
I got you locked inside this room
You know I tip good
And soon you will love me too

Don't be upset now
You know I get angry too
Don't make me hurt you
It's true, no one hears you in this room
No one hears you in this room

This is what you get when you're talking back baby
I never bounce a check so give it up, baby
Open up your eyes, I want to watch you cry
Come on, come on, the camera's on

This is what you get when you're talking back baby
I never bounce a check so give it up, baby
Open up your eyes, I want to watch you cry
