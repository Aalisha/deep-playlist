The path that we've made
We'll not be afraid to say what we know
We will not let... go
Don't hold your breath, find a way out
Don't hold your breath just find your way out
I'll watch your collapse
You'll try to fight back but you're falling through the floor
Gasp for air

And they say we'll never make it out alive, but at least we'll try
(I'll let you know, let you go. I don't know where I'm going.)
