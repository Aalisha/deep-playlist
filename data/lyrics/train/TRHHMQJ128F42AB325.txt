First off she's a lady
And this is a ladies' world
Man, she drives them crazy
Dancing like a cheeky girl

All eyes on Maria
No lies, she's the bomb
Oh my, they all wanna see her
All wanna be the lucky one

Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh... yassou Maria
Turn around, bring it down, go slow
Heads up, Lord have mercy

Shake it up, shake it up, there you go
Oh oh... yassou Maria
Ai ai ai... there she goes
...
