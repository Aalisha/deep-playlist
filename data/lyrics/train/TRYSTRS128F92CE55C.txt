I'd like to take this time to detach my jaw,
And really take a look.
I think that I'm done.
Put away this old guitar,
And on my way out,
Hang my vocal chords up on the door.

If I could just do these things
(If I could do these things)
If I could maybe do these things
Each and every day wouldn't pass
The way that they so often do
That they so often do
And maybe, just maybe.
