'Cause I don't like to be cold and lonely
So I can warm myself by your fire
And keep myself warm, oh

'Cause I don't like to be cold and lonely
So I can warm myself by your fire
And keep myself warm, oh

No time to cry when I'm needing
I need you in my soul, yeah
'Cause that's when you're strongest
And maybe it's time for me to move on, move on
...
