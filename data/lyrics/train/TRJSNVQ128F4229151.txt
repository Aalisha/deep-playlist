Why are you hesitating
How long must I keep waiting
I know you say you love me
Why don't you show me
You talk but you don't listen
You don't know what you've been missing
I just don't have time to play these games
My love is never ending
Too little time we're spending
This broken heart is mending
C'mon and love me
C'mon and love me

Chorus:
I know you love me, love me (4x)
