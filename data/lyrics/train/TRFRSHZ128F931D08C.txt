Stand up, and with your hand on the bible
Tell the truth to one and all
'Cause you know that feeling
When you've got your back against the wall

My god, it's only tuesday tomorrow
And "loved one's" gone and blown it all
Now you've got no money
And you feel your back against the wall

Well, if you talk to your brothers
And they don't give a damn
And you look like you're gonna fall
You can call my number
...
