On my mind, oh
Oh yeah

I'm out for the weekend
Da do do daaa
With nothing to do
Da do do daaa
I'm missing the good times
What about you? Yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Now we could be lovers
Da do do daaa
Now we could be friends
Da do do daaa
Now we could do anything
We can pretend, yeah

Once upon a time
Don't you know that I was wrong and you were right

Something's coming over me
Changed my mind, now I can see
You're my hope for the future
Girl you know we've come so far
Don't let go and break my heart
...
