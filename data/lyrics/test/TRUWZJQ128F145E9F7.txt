Let's all get drunk tonight, I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
Let's all get high tonight, maybe nobody will die tonight
Let's all sell yell tonight, I hope I don't go back to jail tonight
Let's go to the club tonight, find a woman that wanna make love tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Let's get dumb, drink some rum
Make my teeth and gums feel real numb
We'll be thinking 'bout surviving
While we're drinking and we're driving

Hope I don't wreck when my vision gets blurry
Sober up looking at an all white jury
Judge don't like no drunk like me
Punk might give me strike number three

'Cause when I'm drunk and when I'm high
I don't give a damn 'bout a DUI
Let's just get lit, dance like a nitwit
Try to talk to the women that we can't get with

Me and my staff make everybody laugh
If the beer runs out, we can all go half
It's Friday night got the perfect weather let's get drunk together
Come on hoes

Let's all get drunk tonight, I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight
