Here I come again now baby
Like a dog in heat
Tell it's me by the clamor now baby
I like to tear up the street
Now I been smokin' for so long
You know I'm here to stay
Got you in a stranglehold baby
You best get oughta the way

The road I cruise is a bitch now baby
But no you can't turn me round
And if a house gets in my way baby
You know I'll burn it down
...
