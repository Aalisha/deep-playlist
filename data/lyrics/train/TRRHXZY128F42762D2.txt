Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene Can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of Spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

And there is nothing I can do to keep
From cryin' when he calls your name Jolene
And I can easily understand
