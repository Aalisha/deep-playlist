Say what's the matter with you?
Knocking me out like you do.
You're kicking me boy, you're kicking,
It's like nothing seems to boom in your box, baby,
Nothing seems to boom in your box.

I sit on fences with my defences and devices,
The pressure ices baby, tell me why's it so?

It's like nothing seems to boom in your box, baby,
Nothing seems to boom in your box.

Said boy why did you do that,
Said boy why did you do that?

I won't hurt you girl,
I won't hurt you girl.
