Well the cold wind blew the preacher grieved
He said they're comin' after me
And I ain't exactly what I seem to be

He pulled his pistol from his side
Pointed it at me and cried
And then he laid a bullet deep in my chest

Well he stood still revealin' the story
That I knew was true before
And now because of it, I lay dying

He claimed to run with Jesse James,
William Bonnie, and they all the same
I ain't no preacher man I was born of fire

Hey can't you hear that train comin' now
...
