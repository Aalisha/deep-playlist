I had the craziest dream last night
There was thunder and lightning everywhere
Hell hounds reached up and ripped a hole in the sky
Pissed in the water and spit black smoke up in the air

Demons were chasin' me all tattooed
In dollar signs, suits and ties
They wanted me to party
I woke up just in time, I heard somebody say

Better days are comin'
We're gonna wake up and break this curse
Better days are on the way 'cause you know and I know
It can't get no worse

Sometimes the dream seems so real
Comes to me over and over again
Last night I swear I saw America sleepin' in the streets
