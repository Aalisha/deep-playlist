There is no easy love
The one I'm thinking of
I miss you every day

Please just stay around
You are my beat, my sound
My light, my destiny

You rang the door one of a Sunday morning
Said that I was always on your mind
Smiled and said it's meaningless without me
Girl, you're really one of a kind

There was never anyone
Until you just came around
So afraid to be abandoned
Can't afford to lose again

There is no easy love
The one I'm thinking of
I miss you night and day

Please just stay around
