We like to stress a lot
Never blow our top
That red light pace
Screaming in our bus
There goes the blood
Too cold tonight
On board a mother crys
Over a passing daughter
Spike in a line
Heartbeat not fine
Let's shock and go

Stray shots ignite this city
Into a casualty zone
Goodbye young girl, farewell cruel world
She's never coming home
Stray shots ignite this city
It's all so heartbroken and torn
Goodbye young girl, farewell cruel world
