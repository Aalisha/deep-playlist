So wonder if there’s anything left in your one horse town,
I wonder you’d get if I never was around,
Don’t you know we love you,
We love you

I’ve given you all my heart in this one horse town,
I should thank your lucky stars, thank them you were found,
Cos you know we love you,
We love you

Oh I know you must be frightened in this one horse town,
Come into my arms and kiss this sacred ground,
Don’t you know we love you,
We love you
