His host's to fight
It's close to mine
You blow on the dice
the game begins...

They're close to fight
the creed, the blame,
the clearing flame
telling your scaring fears

I Only hide...
my soul is not white...
Your side should...

You, why do you scare
up my soul,
a preacher told me
the white side should die...
...
