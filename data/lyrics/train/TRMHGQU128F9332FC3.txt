Baby you're perfect for me
you are my gift from heaven
this is the greatest story of all times
we met like in a movie
so meant to last forever
and what you're doing to me
feels so fine

Angel, I wake up
and live my dreams
endlessly
crazy for you

Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
the beats going Düm Tek Tek
always out it like there's no limit
feels like there's no way back
Can you feel the rhythm in my heart
the beat's going Düm Tek Tek
