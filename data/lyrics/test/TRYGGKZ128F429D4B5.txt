Uncle Ray is gone, a relative they couldn't find
Finally free of his insanity, they covered him with lime
In a ditch outside the old junkyard on 17
Well that crazy drunk I swear he was a gentleman to me
So take him far far away
Take him far far away
Out past all discussions, far from what they said
Take him far far away
Take him far far away
cause we're sort of related
Here lies Uncle Ray

Dry rough skin, his hands, a working man, like bark from trees
He'd come to the back door of my familiy's house
For coffee and something to eat
...
