One, two, three, four

Underneath the lilac tree
I close my eyes and suddenly
I'm ten years old and running through
An open field, chasing after you

Sounds of summer fill my ears
If I live ten thousand years
I'll never feel as good as this
Moments before our first kiss

There is nothing to demand
No algebra to understand
Just sunlight on a freckled face
And everything in its right place

Simple things turn magical
...
