Do not bury your best intentions
Said you never would, swore you never would
Follow your heart to the place where you missed it
If you only could, if you only could 	
They all say that we've been burning out
Too young to know what it's all about
I say I say we get away
Forget this town and get away

Outside, outside lookin' inside
Inside we will find
Everything's easier on the other side
Everything's easier 

Crawling out of the life that we built here	
Fought so many times just to feel alive
All the years well they came and they left here
And we've grown so tired never been so
They all say that we've been breaking out
To broke to know what it's all about
