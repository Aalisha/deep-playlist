I’m no stranger to loving arms
I'm accustomed to lady’s charms
You know I didn't just arrive into town
You might say I've been around

I've seen the fighter in lover’s eyes
I've seen the lost pay in my time
I didn't think that there was much I’d missed
But let me tell you this

I've never been so loved in all my love
I've never felt the way I feel tonight
You came along and made my world turn bright
...
