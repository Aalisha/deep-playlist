Sleepless,
Can't ignore the radio on the second floor
Red dress,
Hanging on the chair where she sat down before

Taking at to
Trash it by mistake
I throw away the kiss

Just before I left
I've found you've been gone for weeks

What a man suposed to do when I don't know
Seven twenty-five, I'm leaving for big plans

What a man suposed to do when I don't care

It beats me everytime
Just don't understand what's wrong with you
It beats me everytime
