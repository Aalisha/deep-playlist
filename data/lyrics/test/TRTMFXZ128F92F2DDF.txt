Hole In My Pocket (1989)
I got a hole in my pocket and I can’t go to the fair
I got a hole in my pocket and I can’t go to the fair
Well I’m blue cause I gotta take and meet my baby there

Well if I don’t show up what’ll my baby do?
But when I don’t show up what’ll my baby do?
She’ll travel through the Tunnel Of Love with somebody new
