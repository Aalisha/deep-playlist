Yeah you know, we always tryin to get this money, that's what we do
It ain't easy but I'm tellin you, it ain't hard either
All you gotta do is keep hustlin man, don't ever give up
I don't care what it is, handle yo' biz
Forget about the woulda, coulda, and if I did's
Cause that's just the past, you know it never lasts
And you know how time flies by so fast
Look at rap music, they said it was a fad
But now it's takin over, and I'm so glad
Cause I never stopped rappin, but that's what I do
If you quit yo' thang, you might never find the truth
I had choices in life, I coulda did somethin else
I did what I wanted to, I did it for myself
Now whatcha gon' do with yo' life
People try to tell you what to do, it's yo' life
You better make the most of it, live to the fullest
Think positive and don't dwell on the BULLSHIT
I can't tell you no better
If you thinkin 'bout quittin, don't ever

Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin
You already knowin, you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin
You already knowin, you can't give up, you just cain't
