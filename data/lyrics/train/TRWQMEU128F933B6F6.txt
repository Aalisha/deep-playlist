And there will be angels for you to see
Ones who will love you, if you love them or not
And you wont rely on fantasy, you'll be
Strong enough to be
And they'll sing for you when you don't want to hear
And they'll carry you when you don't want to stand
And they'll be there when you don't want to be
And you wont rely on fantasy or fairies
