I'll admit it got to me
Hearing your voice on my machine
It took all I had to just let you talk
And not pick up where we left off

Chorus:
Every night since your goodbye
I hit my knees and close my eyes
And I pray that you'd come back
Too many tears washed out that bridge
You wanna cross, but baby, it's too late for that
Last night would've been a different story
But the morning sun must've done something for me
...
