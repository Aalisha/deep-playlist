I found God... on the corner of 1st and Amistad
Where the West... was all but won
All alone... smoking his last cigarette
I said, "Where've you been?"... He said, "Ask anything".
Where were you... when everything was falling apart.
All my days... were spent by the telephone
It never rang... and all I needed was a call
That never came... to the corner of 1st and Amistad
Lost and insecure... you found me, you found me
Lying on the floor... surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?... Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late... you found me, you found me.
