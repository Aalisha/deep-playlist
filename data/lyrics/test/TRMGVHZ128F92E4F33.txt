Drag me through these awful scenes
Of messed up lives in magazines
I will be there for you,
Can you be there for me too?

I'm still here, you are there
I'm sick and tired of being left in the air
And I will be there for her, can she be there for me too?

No mundane options for you today
Don't give up your life in any way
No mundane options for us today
Don't hang up your boots, don't throw 'em away

They will come, and they will go,
...
