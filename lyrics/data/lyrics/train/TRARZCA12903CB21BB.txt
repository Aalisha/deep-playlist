Seems like only yesterday
Life belonged to runaways
Nothing here to see
No looking back

Every sound monotone
Every color monochrome
Life began to fade into the black

Such a simple animal
Sterilized with alcohol
I could hardly feel me anymore

Desperate and meaningless
All filled up with emptiness
Felt like everything was said and done

I lay there in the dark
And I close my eyes
You saved me the day you came alive

Still I tried to find my way
Spinning hours into days
...
