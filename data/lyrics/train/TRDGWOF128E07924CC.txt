Escucha el ritmo de tu corazon (feel the rhythm)

From the coast of Ipanema
to the Island of Capri
All the way to Kuala Lumpur
I will follow you wherever you may be
From the moment, I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free

Have to hold you in my arms now

There can never be another for me

All I need is
The rhythm divine
Lost in the music

Your heart will be mine
All I need is

To look in your eyes

Viva la musica
Say you'll be mine

Can you feel the heat of passion

Can you taste our love's sweet wine
Join the dance and let it happen
