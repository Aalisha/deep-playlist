Sometimes when I'm driving in my car
I check the rear view mirror and there you are
With a smile, it seems like only yesterday
And while I never want your memory to fade
I'm happy were I am with the choices I've made
But sometimes I can feel you like you're next to me

And the boy in the backseat had eyes of green
Like fields of forever
Do you know what I mean
I don't know if at seventeen

You can ever see beyond the dream
Or the beat of your heart
Flush in your face, it had to be true
Like the love with the boy in the backseat I knew
...
