faded,
away like the color
in a blue sky
at the end of the day
night falls,
and the search begins
for something
something better than this

scream or a cry
the truth or a lie
i'm not sure they will save us this time
i don't wanna be around
when it all comes down
to watch something beautiful die

you said the only way is to run away
you're sick of me so you just can't
stick around to hear me pleadin
i'm pleadin
does it show, i'm pathetic i know
i just cant stand here watch you go
i'm runnin after you, i'm runnin after you
