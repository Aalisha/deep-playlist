The stars won't come out
If they know that you're about
'Cause they couldn't match the glow of your eyes
And, oh, who am I?
Just an ordinary guy
Tryin' hard to win me first prize

Oh, Candida
We could make it together
The further from here girl the better
Where the air is fresh and clean
Hmm hmm, Candida
Just take my hand and I'll lead ya
I promise that life will be sweeter
And it said so in my dreams
...
