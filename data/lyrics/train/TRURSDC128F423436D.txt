(Bert Berns / Jerry Ragavoy)

Didn't I make you feel
Like you were the only man?
Didn't I give you everything
A woman possibly can?
But with all the love I give you
It's never enough
I'm gonna show you baby
That a woman can be tough
So come on, come on, come on, come on

(Take it)
Take another little piece of my heart, now baby
(Break it)
Break another little bit of my heart, now honey
