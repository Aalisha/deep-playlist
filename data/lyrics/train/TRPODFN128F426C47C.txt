Well if you've been a married woman and things didn't seem to work out
Well Divorce is the key to bein' loose and free but you're gonna be talked about
Everybody knows that you've loved once, and they think you'll love again

And if you're rated X you're some kind of gold even men turning silver try to make
But I think it's wrong to judge every picture if a cheap camera makes a mistake
