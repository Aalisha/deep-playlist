Watch out when they start to twist
Hold tight with a leather fist
That's what his daddy told him
How to ride the bull
There's a jingle in his jeans
Sore places in between
He's leaving me in Tennesse
With a push and a pull.

Ten four, honey, come on back
Horse trainer on your Cadillac
I'm calling for the cowboy in the Coupe De Ville
Chug a lug up one side
Glide down the other
He's a lover of the other side of the hill.

Turn up the radio, don't think about rodeo
