Check it out-check it out without a doubt
This is the new sound coming around
No we never lost sight of the fight on our hands
People of colour listen up we're giving you the first bite
Home grown-many seeds have been sown
We're developing our sound now it's fully blown
Creative movements-moves made to make you think
Sounds shaped to take you to the brink
Midi warriors
OMNI on
This is R.A.F.I.'s revenge

This is R.A.F.I.'s revenge
