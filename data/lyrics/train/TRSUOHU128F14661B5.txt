If you see a change in me, don't wonder
There's someone in my life
A peace I can't describe
For I've been reborn

If you see a change in me, don't wonder
I've found a whole new life
And hope that I can't hide
For I've been reborn

Have you ever felt
A longing, a searching within your soul
Soul for something more
But you don't know what for

There's one who will reach across the distance
From the Heavens to the earth, the earth
Because he loves you
He loves you

If you see a change in me, don't wonder
There's someone in my life
...
