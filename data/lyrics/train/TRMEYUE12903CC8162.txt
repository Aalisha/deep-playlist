Sometimes i miss the circus
but i know why i ran away
i stepped right out of that song
while it played
lit it like a stage
gave it like a gift
what i got out of it is this;

Be suspicious but friendly to elders.
Be friendly but suspicious of other circuses.
Trust your friends even if you can't trust your friends
after all you've already agreed to travel with them

*chorus*
So long to the circus, so long to it all
i've always had a good sense of when it's time to get gone
...
