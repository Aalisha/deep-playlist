As long as I live
I won't know why
Why some of my friends
Turn to indigo, God

They just gave up
Thats what they did
The secret thing they very well hid
Everyone loses when heroin wins
I just miss my indigo friends

These are not bad men
These are not bad girls
They just stray by
In their own little world
...
