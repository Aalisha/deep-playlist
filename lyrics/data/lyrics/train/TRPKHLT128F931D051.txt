Burning down, we can't stop it,
We gotta get out, start again,
Our memories are gone forever,
Don't try to turn this around on me,
I'm the one that saved you
This was my own, this was my life
It's not always just about you
And as I heard, the sirens begin to chime,
I can feel my heart begin to race

Chorus 1
I can see through the flames that the fire cleanses me,
Mind and soul, now the same
And my body guides the way
