Ballad and dagger
Amazing grace
Sons of rock bottom
Take your rightful place

Gold tooth and top hat
And an ace up your sleeve
Show me your pistol
So I can believe

(Make glad) Find the beauty in the broken
(Make glad) May your heart always be open
(Make glad) Keep an eye out for your brother
(Make glad) I will see you in the other, oh yeah
