Your face is hiding deep inside my mind
Your touch is on my tongue
Your face is in the deepest depths of my eyes
The eyes inside of my soul

Once I was free but now I am trapped
Once I was trapped but now I am free

I taste the tears you bled
I felt the fears you shed
You thought I did not feel
You thought I could not taste
