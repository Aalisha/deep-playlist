It's the same in every country
When you say you're leaving
Left behind the loved ones
Waiting silent in the hall

Where you're going, lies adventure
Others only dream of
Red and green light, this is real
And so you go to war

For the passion, for the glory
For the memories, for the money
You're a soldier for your country
What's the difference? All the same

Far away from the land of our birth
We fly a flag in some foreign earth
...
