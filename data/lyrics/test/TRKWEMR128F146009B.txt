Dawn in a distant city
I'm wondering where you are today
Here in my waken dreams
So far away
Lovers walk hand in hand
Under an early morning sky
Reminding me where we've been

The days we drifted far apart
And we're still travelling through these changes
I'm getting closer to the truth
No matter where I go
Every road leads back to you
Whenever you think of me
