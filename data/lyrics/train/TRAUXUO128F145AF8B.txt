Your time is gonna come!

Thunder and lightning is striking you down
And you feel in your head there's no one around
You count the troubles standing in your way
Look outside, it's a brand new day
You'll know the moment, you'll know the sign
There won't be a mountain that you can't climb
You'll know what it is when it comes inside
Could be anytime, in the day or night

Get up, get up, get back on your feet
Bang the drum and start the beat
Get out, get out, get out of your seat
Dance away your troubles out on the street

It's your turn to freak out; it's your turn to win
It's your turn to take out all you put in
Your time is gonna come
Your time is gonna come

Your time is gonna come
...
