I gave up on you a long time ago
How can you blame me?
We made plans to meet and you never showed
You kept me waiting

They said everything would work out just fine
They said you'd help me
But as it turns out it was all a lie
And they're off someplace far away laughing at me

You've been there for me one time in my life
But it didn't matter
You came and went so fast all my hope
And faith in you shattered

And now here I sit, alone in this room
...
