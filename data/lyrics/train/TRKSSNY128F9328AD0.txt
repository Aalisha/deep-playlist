I don't want to scare you.
I don't want to be you anymore.
What's in store? Well, I don't want to be popular.
High school superstar.
Didn't take it very far.
So pick another winner 'cause I won't buy in.
I'm sick of hearing what you see in me.
Fake the smile.
Working mode.
Sitting in a cubicle and doing shit that I don't want
Like organizing back to front.
Wipe the smile off my face.
Stuck here in the same place.
Where everybody's moving forward and I stay stagnant.
I'm sick of hearing what you see in me.
You're not anything I want to be.
All I ever wanted was to do something right.
And now that chance is gone.
