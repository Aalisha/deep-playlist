I thought that I knew about 'em
Thought that they would never do me wrong
Well, well, they smile in your face
When all the time they wanna take your place
Them backstabber's

Same old scene that you've seen for so long
Always want to be around you but as jealous as they come
Well, don't want you to win that race
'Cause if you do it's gonna lessen their space
That's when I decide to say

Goodbye, goodbye to all the fake people in my life
I never wanted you around me so be on your way now
You better think twice before you let people in your life
Because when you put down, no one is around you
You got a case of the fake people
Aye, a case of the fake people, oh oh yeah
