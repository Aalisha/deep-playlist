Crave for no more, nor the self that would
Not even that which always is there
Needy of naught, but to be constrained
From any care and want of a selfish urge

What is needed save strengthened will of man
Fulfilment of all that is latent within
What is to fear, what do they hate?
How can they even bear to look at themselves
Those who love to crawl?
