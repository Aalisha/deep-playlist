Saturday what a day what a silly little day
Time to kill take a pill as I sit and contemplate
How I'd like to be around all the people in the town with their fancy cars and things
But I've got time

Each moment has got a lesson for the day
Take something with you if you drag your heels in yesterdays
Oh these Saturdays

In the haste in the grace I've been up to my waist
