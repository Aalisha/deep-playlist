(S-A-F-E-T-Y)
(Safety Dance)

We can dance if we want to
We can leave your friends behind
'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
Well, they're no friends of mine

We can go where we want to
A place they'll never find
And we can act like we come
From out of this world
Leave the real one far behind

And we can dance
And we can dance
Let's safety dance

We can go when we want to
