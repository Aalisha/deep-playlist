He sits alone in a crowded station
And lights his cigarette
The light flickers slightly
And tells him politely
His life's not at it's best

She weighs him up 'cos his love's taken lightly
And love's her only regret
But love's not a sin in her eyes
And she's asking him why -
Why are you leaving
I just can't say
Why are you leaving
...
