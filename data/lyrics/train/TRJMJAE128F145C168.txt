While you were out
spreading the gospels
according to whatever you believed in
at the time
Her Majesty's axeman cameth
and closed the hospital
the birthplace of our bonny baby Brian
Yesterday they took away our bus stop
Today they'll try and take our happy home
Tomorrow I'll be burnt as a witch
for playing punk rock
You picked a fine time to leave me
on my own

I know that what you don't know
doesn't hurt you
And the only time you get homesick's
when you get home
...
