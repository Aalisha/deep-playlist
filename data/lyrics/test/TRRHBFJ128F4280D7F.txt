This rhapsody of tension has lifted from my chest
As my flying connot destroy the nest
It is merely a new chapter of this dream
Shinning Brightly does not quell the flame
It mearly adds to the symphony of colour
That is this tapestry we weave

And i dont believe it sings any louder or soars any higher
But it will not fly at all if not given freedom to be

Bluebird fly
[x4]
