(Jorn Lande/Tore Moren)

It's late at night
And I'm watching the news
There's blood on the screen
And I felt guilty somehow
Escaping from reality
When I close my eyes
Don't wanna see them die
Hear the children cry

There's been so much trouble
Too many sad songs have been played
And when you think you've found something real
It's suddenly so deceiving
Hard to believe in changes
It's a faded paradise
And I'm running out of strength

In this house made of cards
Smoke is rising
Playing in the fire
