Come with the bloody moon and the chaos,
Gog and magog triple six reigns over spirits lost.
Satanic nations and thrones reign and slay,
but solid is super-souls love and righteous pathways,
Asking me why I ain't down with the bloodshed,
wicked fool we approve of lies as eternal truth,
Worship the mark of the beast demonic feast,
Seven the seals sacred faith no need to pack steal,
No "geed-up" rap anywhere up and on me,
Strictly KRS, Public Enemy, Bob Marley, Mad ups to MLK and the infintie Ghandi,
Doom to the demons that dominate all around me.
