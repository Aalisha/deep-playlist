Sentenced to this lifelong sequence of watching your back
A second guess
Sink into the feeding of essence to the vultures of another yesterday
Save us from indolence, save us from this fate
A black cat tradition damned to the genetics of our parents' ways
Half dead, on your way out
Sent back to these days of heresy
Look at these things that they've tried to do to me
Every supple opinion counts
Roll her over when you're done
Son, don't let them see when you reach for the gun
Turning backs on father time
A problem with consistent faith
