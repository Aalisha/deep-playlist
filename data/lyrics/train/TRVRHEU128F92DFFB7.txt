Parted from the caravan during the sandstorm
Lost to the desert of the creeping death... 
Wandered for days and for days, under the burning sun
Eyes beneath the sand, are watching me

During the night I heard a scream
Something awoke from beneath

Horror within this sand, now roams across this land
Awaken by the stench of human flesh

Nameless terror - Lurking fear
The creature of the desert plains
Chaos Creation - Evil Incarnation
The hunter of the shadows is here
Awaken again - To walk among the living
Risen again - In the valley of the corpses

A chill ran down my spine, as I sensed the nondivine
Oh can it be the one, One without a name

Nameless terror - Lurking fear
