President Bush
Come out with your hands up
You're under arrest

Think about it
What the fuck is going on
Think about it
You better think about it
Just what the fuck is going on
Think about it
You better think about it
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME

Dont you tread
Dont you tread upon me NO
Dont you tread
Dont you tread upon me NO

All the world
And come with the CHAOS
All the world
They wanna CONTROL
All the world
And come with the CHAOS
All the world
They wanna CONTROL

Tread on me, tread on me
Dont you tread upon me NO
Tread on me, tread on me
Dont you tread upon me NO
Tread on me, tread on me
Dont you tread upon me NO
Tread on me, tread on me
Dont you tread upon me NO
