"I hear the sound" she whispered softly and this is what she said
"He has come to take my sins away"

This is the worst thing that I've ever done
And now I'm asking you to clear it from my soul
How could that be, I've hurt someone that could have been me
But now I'm trying so hard to believe
This is the worst thing, this is the worst thing, this is the worst thing that I've ever done

And my heart is heavy from the pain I have
Building up my tears I can't control
