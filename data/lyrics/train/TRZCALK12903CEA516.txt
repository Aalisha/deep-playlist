I talk to you as to a friend
I hope that's what you've come to be
It feels as though we've made amends
Like we found a way eventually

It was you who picked the pieces up
When I was a broken soul
And then glued me back together
Returned to me what others stole

I don?'t wanna hurt you
I don?'t wanna make you sway
Like I know, I've done before
I will not do it anymore
I've always been a dreamer
I've had my head among the clouds
But now that I'm coming down
...
