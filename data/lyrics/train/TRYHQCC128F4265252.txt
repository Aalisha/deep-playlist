It's lonely here in outerspace,
the nearest stars are miles away,
but I believe I'm on to somethin' big.
I've only come to not be found,
to circle high above the ground,
and watch everyone else for a change.
Don't you ever
wish you'd never?
Don't you wonder if your face might shine
without the piles of lies?
I've arrived.
I'm doing well.
Quite a view from the top,
where it is cold as hell.
I've arrived,
and it's hard to tell
the bright lights from the starlights
and the canyons from the hills.
