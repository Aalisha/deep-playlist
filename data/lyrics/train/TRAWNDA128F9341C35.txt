I'm still waiting

Tell me you love me and make me feel it
Convince me that your heart is true
Don't say you need me if you really don't mean it
'Cause boy, I ain't nobody's fool, yeah

Baby, I'm trying to find a place inside your heart
Oh, but it's hard to start a fire without a spark
If you wanna be the man that rocks me to my knees
Baby, just make me believe

'Cause I'm still waiting

Every night I bring you all my broken pieces
