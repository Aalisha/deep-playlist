"Who am I to behold?"

Time revises the existence
Forms the timelessness of substance
Thousand paths of furious chaos
Circles the spine of the universe

All the ways that I have been
All the stars that I have seen

I have seen the haven of eternity
The hive of random universal unions
Expire, expand to extinction
...
