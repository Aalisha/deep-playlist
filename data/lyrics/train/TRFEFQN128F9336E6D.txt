Ah, ah, yeah, yeah, uh
Better pump this in your jeep
Gotta turn the volume up
Wanna smoke a little of this stuff
That's the way we blaze on up

Better pump this in your jeep
Better turn the volume up
Wanna smoke a little of this stuff
That's the way we blaze on up

Boy, ain't a freak like me
That do it constantly
Make sure you keep busy
Wanna feel the part of me

You make my heart beat faster
(Yeah)
You got me ill flow like a rapper
(Ooh)
I'll blaze you with good sensations
Your loving be my first occupation

This is how I'm puttin' it down
For my peeps on the other side of town
Can you tell me are you feeling me?
And if you're feeling me then bump this in your jeep
Play this in your jeep

Oh, ah, baby, show me love
