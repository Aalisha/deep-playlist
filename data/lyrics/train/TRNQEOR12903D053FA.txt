Black Cat
Black cat, black cat's gone
Gone for good, gone for long
Don't believe that he left me alone
And i hope he don't come home
Looking back, the black (past)
Trust him once, lost my map
Trust again to save my bones
And i never made it back

Black cat, black cat's gone
Gone for good, gone for long
Don't believe i made it home
And i hope he don't come home

Never had anything
Never lose and i never win
Lost my only love, never get her back
There's a black cat on my back
