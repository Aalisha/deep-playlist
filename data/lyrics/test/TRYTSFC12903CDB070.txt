(Medicine)
(Running through my veins)
They say that your kiss is like a pill
Designed to change the way that I feel
For every heartache you gotta cure
That's why I put my trust in you
Everybody's looking for what they want
And everybody's looking for what they need
Gotta keep on looking for what I want
(Gotta keep on looking for what I want)
