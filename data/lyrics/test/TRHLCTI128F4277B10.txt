I gave my heart
And soul to you, girl
Didn't I do it, baby
Didn't I do it, baby

Gave you a love
You never knew, girl, whoa
Didn't I do it, baby
Didn't I do it, baby

I tried so many times
And that's no lie
It seems to make you laugh
Each time I cry

Didn't I blow your mind this time
Didn't I (Oh, baby)
Didn't I blow your mind this time (Baby)
Didn't I (Listen)
