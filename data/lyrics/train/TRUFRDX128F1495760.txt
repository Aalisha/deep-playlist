(verse one)
She's been going out with him
She's been going out with me
Said she'd let us know by tonight which one it would be
So I waited by the phone
But she never called me up
Had to know what was going on
So I drove by her house, and sure enough...
(Chorus)
That ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all
...
