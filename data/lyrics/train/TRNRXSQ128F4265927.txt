Beats! Bass!

The sound sinister
Administer ways to set the world ablaze
Tracks flamed
Untamed bass raps unchained
Overseer saw the skys turn grey
Doomsday tidal waves from the US to the UK

Back against the wall
I stand tall
Face the grim
Blow decibals way past known levels
My method of madness is this
Sadness, gladness
All emotions evoked
Thoughts provoked
Beats come cloaked and daggered
Torn and tattered
Sleep the dreams
Dreams get shattered
Witness sound transformed to matter
Bone, flesh and plasma
Bone, flesh and plasma
...
