Head toward the island
On its shores we saw a cross
Priests of the new white god
Who want to replace our pagan faith
Approach to a silent land,
On which holy chants resound
Give them a dreadful lesson
The Raven flies over the Dove
May I die in Odin's name, the monks shall be tortured and slain
This is now land of the greatest of all
