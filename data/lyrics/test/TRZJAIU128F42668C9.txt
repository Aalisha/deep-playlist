WE GOT MARRIED ONE AFTERNOON IN MAY
NEVER DID SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY... ON OUR HONEYMOON
WE DIDNT HAVE MUCH WHEN WE STARTED OUT
YOUR GRANDMAS BED AND A THREE ROOM HOUSE... BUT WE MADE DO
OH, OH I Got You... OH, OH I Got You


YOU COULDVE HAD THAT BOY YOU USED TO KNOW
HES A MILLIONAIRE FROM OHIO... YOUR MAMA TOLD ME SO
WHEN THE BEST I COULD DO WAS THE FACTORY
