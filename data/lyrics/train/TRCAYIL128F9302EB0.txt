Im trying to find my place in this great big world 
Well, Im trying to find some grace and some loving arms 
Well, I looked inside my heart and I found a vacant lot 
Can you tell me where to go when this love runs out? 

'Cause I'm digging in the dirt trying to fill this hole 
Put my spirit on a billboard saying 
Save my soul
