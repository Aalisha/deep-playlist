Oh, I'm giving up
The one I love
I'll conduct the great disaster
To scar my skin, to own this hurt

They offered their hearts and we tore them apart
They offered their blood and we left them so parched
I don't know if I can give you
Anything you want

Go on and give me the gun, never mind what I've done
They left me no choice, oh, they left me no choice
Go on and give me the gun, let me blow them open
It's out of my reach, never mind what they think about me
