I can't wait to do my thing
But the school bell won't ring
It's time to make my escape
First, I crawl across the hardwood floor
Sneaking out the back door
Feed my Walkman another mix tape

I feel no danger, oh no, macarena
Who let the dogs out of the container?
So feel the rhythm' call, have a disco ball with me
Hey DJ, come on and play a song and it'll set me free

I don't wanna dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone
No, I don't wanna dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone

I don't wanna dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone
No, I don't wanna dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone

Now I'm looking fine, taking my time
Waiting in line, inching forward some more
Oh no, check the list, stamp our wrist
Now class is dismissed
And I'm through the door and I'm on the floor

Don't wanna dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone
...
