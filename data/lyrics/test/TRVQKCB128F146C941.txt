Sanitize the party
In some sick disguise
We re a different colour
Some plain eyes

It s shining, clear, advancing
Our competition s taste
Oh my infidels of blooded face

No look don t jump in now
Or you ll be the next
You ll know what it is to lose conciousness

Take that chance
One More Time
Shout it clear
London s mine

Raise them kids
Decorate that line
London s mine

Your pulse will climb
