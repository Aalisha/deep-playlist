Lose Your Mind? Oh No. 
If You Lose Your Mind, To Call On Me To Temper.
If You Lose Your Head, To Count On Me, Whatever.
Lose Your Mind, Leave For Good This Time.
So Don't Fool It, That You Were Mine Forever. 
Don't Lose Your Mind,
Don't Change This Time Together.
Oh No! Oh No! Oh No!
Don't Change Your Mind,
Don't Lose This Time Forever.
Oh No! Oh No! Oh No! 
I Know.
