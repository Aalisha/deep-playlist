Get your boogie back down, y'all...
Indistinct talking...

Where's all the humpin people at?
Where they at?
Say it loud
Oh!

()
You've got me humpin'
Day and night, oh baby (baby)
(Continues in background)

Where's it at?
Say it loud

A hump for one, a hump for two
Humpin is the newest thing to do

I say sixteen tons of coal, what do you get?
You get a hump in your back, sucker
Oh!

Oh! Put your back down sucker,
And raise your rump
(Into) And do the vicious hump

Where's all the humpin people at?
Where they at?
Say it loud

Eeny meeny meeny meeny miney moe,
Catch a humper by his toe

(Refrain)
We are those humpin people
We love to hump around
We are those humpin people
We love to hump around

()
You got me humpin'
Day and night, oh baby (baby)
