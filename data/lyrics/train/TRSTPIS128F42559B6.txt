Here comes the evil man
Pray for their lives, you'll end
Smashing [Incomprehensible] he throws
[Incomprehensible]

Like I'm losing with my wings in orbit
Try my best to make the moment awesome
If you remember not to tread with caution
I'll make your body speak in full distortion

I can't sleep at night, I fear death's warning
I keep afloat by holding tide so cautious
Somebody dragged me here, I'm trapped with wild horses
