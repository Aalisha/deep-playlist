I always believed that if I ran off to India
Wore sandals and shaved my head
And used Body Shop conditioner, burned incense like crazy
I could call myself a spirit head
But I only went to India to look on top
I wore sandals 'cause I'd smoked all my money
And I shaved off all my hair 'cause I had the fleas
I'd been sleeping all over
And the Body Shop conditioner was a present from a friend
And the incense used to hide the smell
Of the drug den that I lay in

And so I ask myself what my motives are
For this lying need to look so free
And if I tell myself real honestly
What more can I admit to, open up a door
He said I'm gonna find out what I'm here for
He said I'd find out soon
