Raindrops are falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet
Are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Those raindrops
Are falling on my head
They keep falling.

So I just did me some
Talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way
He got things done
He's sleeping on the job
Those raindrops
Are falling on my head
