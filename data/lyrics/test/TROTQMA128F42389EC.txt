You know I never meant to see you again
But I only passed by as a friend, yeah
All this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why

Now I, oh, now I wish it would rain down, down on me
Oh, yes, I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Oh, yes, I wish it would rain down, down on me
Oh, yes, I wish it would rain on me

You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh, I guess you were right, yeah
Oh, I never meant to cause you no pain
