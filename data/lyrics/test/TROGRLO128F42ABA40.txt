I'm imprisoned with the entire world, I'm insane
Enslaved to suffer your madness
Torn is my mind, destined to magnify all my hate
I am meant to rise above you
Fooled will be your entire purpose to stop me
I will defy all your kind
You have no idea what's aiming for your heart
I shall bathe in all your blood

I shall rise before you, look in your eyes, tear off your limbs
Peel off the flesh that I loath
Rapturous are your screams, I gain pleasure,
Erase my pain through the spilling of your blood

I will not be stopped, nothing will quench my rage
For your horrid ways
To control all my thoughts, my very action
Dictated by your laws, enforced by your greed

Strengthened now to become my only purpose
To cut your throat and tear out your ruling voice
Your voice of resentment for all that we are
Soon our voices will ring loud through all the world
...
