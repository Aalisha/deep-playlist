Can you say Omarion?
There's just something I wanna do to you
I been watchin you all night long (2x)

(Chorus)
Beg For it
Don't panic, when you see it you betta hold on
You said you need it, well damnit come on
Imma lay right here while they play my song
and watch you beg for it
Take that off, when you go in there you betta get it all
Dont play wit it baby, go head get it all
Imma beg for you baby as soon as you get all

(Verse 1)
Aint neva had body make yo hood friends
ask you "how long does he give it"
Baby, get ready to know (they ain't ready)
For the play, I'm a game
When its up, I'll make you

(Chorus)
Beg For it
Don't panic (hey), when you see it you betta hold on
You said you need it, well damnit come on
