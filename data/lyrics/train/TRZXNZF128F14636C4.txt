She's gonna leave me on my own again
I guess it happens every now and then
She closes her eyes and says goodnight
God only knows the reason why
We get together and we fall apart again

Don't want to forgive me now
You want to forget it
But I know I'll be happy in your heart

She spends her time so easy
She casts the spell then leaves me
She's on the make, she's out of touch
...
