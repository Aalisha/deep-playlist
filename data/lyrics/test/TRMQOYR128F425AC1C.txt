I want to be him
Want to be that guy
Who'll open your eye
In the morning
Spending all night
Within your embrace
You are the one to make me happy

Slapstick
Of course I love it
You know
The proof is solid
Slapstick
Becomes a habit
Until
You think about it

I want to be him
Want to be that guy
Who'll open your eye
In the morning
Spending all night
Within your embrace
You are the one to make me happy

Give me some more
I will tell you why
You re making me smile
And I like it

I enjoy the style
