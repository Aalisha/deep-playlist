She read the news, she was alone
A one-way ticket flight to Rome

She left the town, a lonely child
Breaking out, she's running wild

She's dancing like the majesty
She said, "It's over now"
All the best things in life are free
She'll take it anyhow

Dream on, dream on, ballerina girl
On a clear day, you can see forever
Dream on, dream on, ballerina girl
I wanna stay with you together
