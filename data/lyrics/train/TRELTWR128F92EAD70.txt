Miscellaneous
Dangerous Game [jekyll & Hyde]
[lucy]
I feel your fingers-
Cold on my shoulder-
Your chilling touch,
As it runs down my spine-
Watching your eyes
As they invade my soul-
Forbidden pleasures
I'm afraid to make mine.

At the touch of your hand-
At the sound of your voice-
At the moment your eyes meet mine
I am out of my mind-
I am out of control-
Full of feelings i can't define!

[hyde]
It's a sin with no name-

[lucy]
Like a hand in a flame-

[hyde]
And our senses proclaim

[hyde & lucy]
It's a dangerous game!

[hyde]
A darker dream
