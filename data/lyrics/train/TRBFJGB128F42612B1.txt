I'm watchin' day time TV
I'm young and I'm restless
I'm on no sunset beach
I'm burnin' up in here in Texas

Paranoia on day street
Not enough to eat
Too many burgers and these fries
Are makin' me crazy

It's kinda strange growin' up here
Never less safe but don't be afraid
You gotta take what you get here
'Cause nobodies gonna change their ways

Many places to travel in this world
No matter where I go I'm an American girl
This Disney World's your underworld
Try to escape it just face it you American girl
