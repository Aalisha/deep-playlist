Wait your turn
You always go for the jugular
Like a juggernaut
Spinning off the asphalt
We wait around pacing round this table
You arrive on time to help us lift the trophy
Bunker or basement the bills pile up
The street level it's a mining disaster
The options are blocked
Wait there girl you leave this place like a smuggler
Across the borders and the trenches we dug
We wait around in the resident's lounge
