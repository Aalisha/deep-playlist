What would i have to do
to get you to notice me too
do i stand in line
one of a million admiring eyes
Walk a tightrope way up high
write your name across the sky
I'm going crazy just to let you know
you'd be amazed how much i love you so
when i get my hands on you, i won't let go
this time i know it's for real
