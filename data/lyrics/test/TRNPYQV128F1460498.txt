Well, I woke up last night
In a technology haze
My eyes were all sparked
From this common malaise

So, I found me a doctor
Who said he'd even me out
Take my highs and my lows
'Cause the colors were just too loud

And as the day becomes night
And we only want grays
And the innocence runs out
Well, this is the price to pay

Mr. Jangle what you gonna do
When the sun breaks down
And the rain pours through?
Tell me baby, what you gonna do this time, time?

Mr. Jangle what you gonna do
When the sun breaks down
And the rain pours through?
Tell me baby, what you gonna do this time?

What you gonna do, what you gonna do this time?
What you gonna do, what you gonna do this time?
What you gonna do, gonna do?

You got caught on my teeth
So, I spit out my tongue
And I cut off these hands
