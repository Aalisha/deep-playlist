Hearts go astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away just when you needed me so
Filled with regret, I come back begging you
Forgive, forget, where's the love we once knew?

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my
Everlasting love
Need you by my side
Girl, to be my bride
You'll never be denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
