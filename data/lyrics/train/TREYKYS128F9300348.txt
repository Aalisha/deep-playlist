Yeah

Oh, I've just got to let her go
Because this little girl is runnin' wild
I said I got to let her go
Because this little girl is runnin' wild

You know she whupped this whole game on me
And now she won't even apologize

Oh girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
You take all the happiness out of my live
