Headlines today simply read American dreams shattered

(Mr Lif)
As the woe of the common man grows I suppose I should flow
think of all the things that we should know
the hood grows out to the burbs
too many words to describe how we got and what we didn't deserve
the nerve of these leaders to cheat us danglin the sweetest opportunities for home ownership then flip



Now it's over foreclosure
four soldiers died in Iraq
stumbled in the trap, ain't no bringin'em back
i'm swingin' that axe to chop off whatever pop off that NASDAQ dropped off and people


Pissed off fucked over overlooked overbooked for unemployment
Lost and ready to destroy shit b-boy shit

that's what i remain on
i stay strong
call me up when they rain napalm
Your funding a war, but you can't fund us? and you plann'in to turn the planet to dust

I heard it today
I heard it
I heard it today
I heard it

it started when the planes hit home, then it really hit homes
