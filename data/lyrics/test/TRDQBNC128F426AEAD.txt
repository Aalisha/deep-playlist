Mask of shadow's sole, liebst the night he owns
The grace of the beast, the solace of the sleet
A sea of colder rain, gives him life again
To hunt mortality, precious pearls of grief

Murder draped in dusk, the thief's not one of us
Came here with the shrouds, sweet talks, charms and bows
Feeds on your sorrow, drawn to the horror

Welcome... Assassin of light
