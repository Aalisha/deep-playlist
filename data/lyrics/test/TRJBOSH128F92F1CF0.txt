I never thought that we would ever get this way
I never thought that we would ever see this day
Of the billion people that couldâ€™ve took your place
You found your way, somehow someway

I still remember the first time I heard it, at least in a sense
not one particular occasion but a series of events
That somehow, in the long run, guided my way
since the very first time,???

And then I knew I'd never leave it,
keep it beneath the surface
hidden in my decisions, I'm certain I found my purpose
So I became a soul searching individual
my main focus in life was really quite spiritual

But it was music that opened up my eyes
a sound so profound like a voice in the sky
Speaking in ways, amazed at this message inside
over time I realized that those voices were mine

And there was something alive,
but couldn't quite get it right
something in the vibe of my soul I just didn't like
I spit it tight at times at other times my rhymes felt wrong
until I found you my one perfect song

Beat and words and melodies combined
