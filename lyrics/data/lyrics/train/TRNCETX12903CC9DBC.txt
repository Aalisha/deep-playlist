We had two bags of grass,
seventy-five pellets of mescaline,
five sheets of high powered blotter acid,
a salt shaker half full of cocaine,
and a whole galaxy of multi colored
uppers, downers, screamers, laughers...
and also a quart of tequila,
a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether
and two dozen amyls.
But once you get locked in a serious drug collection,
not that we needed all this for the trip, tendency is to push it as far as you can.

When the truth is found to be lies,
and all the joy within you dies.


Don't you (want) ... don't don't you (want . want) ...
don't you (want) ... don't you (want . want) ...
...
