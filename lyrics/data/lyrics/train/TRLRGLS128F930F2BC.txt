Oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh ah
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh ah

I think it was the summer time
When I laid eye's on you
I didn't even know you're name
Some how we'd end up in the same room
Never crossed my mind
I never saw you like that
I should've listened to my best friend
She knew we'd be a perfect match

It's a typical love story
We started out as friends
We met way back when
This is just a
Typical love story
The boy you never wanted
Just steals your heart
I never saw it comin'
Till I fell so hard

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh ah

I always made up some excuse
Sayin' that you weren't my type
Didn't wanna face the truth
Didn't wanna cross that line
