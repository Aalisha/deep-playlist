Gimme love, gimme love
Gimme baby, gimme, gimme love

Gimme love, gimme, gimme love
Gimme baby, gimme, gimme love
Gimme love, gimme, gimme love
Baby, gimme your love

Oh, gimme your love

I remember when I saw you
Never thought that you could care about me
Then we had a conversation
Boy, we couldn? t imagine how we would be

Gimme love
Gimme baby, gimme, gimme love
Baby, gimme your love

When I spend my time without you
Everything in this world means nothing to me
