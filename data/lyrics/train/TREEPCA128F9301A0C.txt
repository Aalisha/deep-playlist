On the banks of the river stood Running Bear,
Young Indian brave.
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid.
Little White Dove was her name.
Such a lovely sight to see.
But their tribes fought with each other
So their love could never be.

Chorus
Running Bear, loved Little White Dove
With a love as big as the sky.
Running Bear, loved Little White Dove
With a love that wouldn't die.
