(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)
(You got nothin' on me!)

Summer came it took me by surprise
A California sunshine in my eyes
Driving with the top down
We sing along to our favorite songs
Nothing could go wrong

Laughing as we gazed under the moon
You kissed me and it never felt too soon
Hard to believe that anything
Could tear us apart
Then you break my heart

Now I know who you are
You got nothin' on me
I see I should have known it from the start
(You got nothin' on me)
You can't tell me lies, don't even try
