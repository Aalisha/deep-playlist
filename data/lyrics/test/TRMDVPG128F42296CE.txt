I'm not in love with the plans you've made
You know I'm afraid and you play on it
But I'm tempted to take whatever I can make from it

My mouth is open but my eyes are closed
You're feeding me lines that are a hundred years old
There's a place at your table and I'm hungry for more of it

Apart from the questions
What's going on in your mind?

See what you want to see
