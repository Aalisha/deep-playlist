I thirst but never quench, I know the consequence
Feeling as I do
We're in a spinning top, where tell me will it stop?
And what am I to say?
Open our music book, that only few can look
And I'll write a song for you

Love is a symphony, hearts in one melody
'Cause I'll write a song for you
Sounds never dissipate, they only recreate
In another place
There's in your silent night, joy of a song's delight

'Cause I'll write a song for you
You'll write a song for me
