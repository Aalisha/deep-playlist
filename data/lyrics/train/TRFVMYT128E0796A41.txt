They say love keeps on growing
But that's something I've felt I've always known
Cause it wouldn't matter where you're going
Cause where you are is where I wanna go

I know why the heart gets lonely
Every time you give your love away
And if you think that you are only
A shadow in the wind
Rolling â€˜round but when you go
and let somebody in they might fade away

Tell me why the road keeps turning
When everything you want is straight ahead
