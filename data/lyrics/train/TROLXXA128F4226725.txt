It's too late tonight
to save all of you
I've got to hold on
make myself like you

you went on the velvet way
and every dying day
you've got your own love to shake
into your mind again
baby I want to know
every breath that you save

And I'll be there when you burn
And I'll be there when you turn

It's too late tonight
to go racing back for
It won't work anyhow
...
