It's time to stand on tough fingers, and (?)
Tell me sugar how you felt here, yeah c'mon sugar, tell now
Stand your face until it (?) on fire
Won't keep up with the law, it's such a long walk
If this all goes well you won't have nothing
So tell you dead wrong, dead wrong
And now you're long gone
Hang out for minute and rethink
Question, tell me what she'd done
Just one, cause I can't see nothing

So, one, two and...
You got it, I want it!
You got it, I want it!
You got it, I want it!
