Baby baby, don't you cry
Wipe away that tear from your eye
Sailing on a sea of blue
In my dreams theres a place for me and you

Baby babe don't say a word
In this life you get all that you deserve
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I can't believe that I'm just an ordinary guy

When all is said and done
...
