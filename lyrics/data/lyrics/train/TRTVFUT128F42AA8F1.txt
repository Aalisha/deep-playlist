I'll find a way
to see you again
I'll find a way
to see you again

I used to think that anything I'd do
wouldn't matter at all anyway
But now I find that when it comes to you
I'm the winner of cards I can't play

Wait for me
wait for me
Darling
I need you desperately
desperately here

And I'll find a way
to see you again
...
