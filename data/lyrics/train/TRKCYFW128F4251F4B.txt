Don't wait for me
'Cause I'll be running late
By the flowers upon my grave
Don't wait for me
'Cause I'll be coming home
Don't wait for me
Long by the telephone

Chorus:

'Cause I'm wild running through the hills
And my eyes are wondering how you feel
And the miles upon miles keep falling from the sky
...
