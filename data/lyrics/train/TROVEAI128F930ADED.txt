Hello Morning, Now when does the fun begin?
Goodbye Morning, Sorry it had to end
But see I cried just a little too long
Now it's time for me to be strong

Hello Morning, I sure missed you last night
Goodbye Morning, You just won't do me right, ight, ight
I stayed just a little too long
Now it's time for me to move on

They say I'm hopeless (hmmmm mmmmm)
As a penny with a hole in it (penny with a, penny with a hole in it yeaaaaaah)
They say I'm no less (no less, no less, no less, no less)
