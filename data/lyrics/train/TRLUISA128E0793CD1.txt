All:
Ooohviva la fiesta

Jo/All:
Dancin' in the moonlight
Until the break of day, just
Let the rhythm take control
Can you feel the spirit
I know that you can hear it
There's a fever in your soul

Jo:
Take a chance
Come on and dance, dance, dance
We're gonna salsa yeah
We're getting down tonight
Everybody
Come on and join the party
Where the music never stops

Chorus:
Don't wait up
I just wanna party forever
Never Stop
Everybody's dancing together
Don't wait up
I just wanna party forever
Never Stop
Viva la fiesta
