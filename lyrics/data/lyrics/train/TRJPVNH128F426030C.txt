Is it daylight, i can't tell no more
never had this condition before
Everywhere i turn (it seems to hang on)
everything i do (it seems to hang on)
was i mistaken (it seems to hang on)
about you (it seems to hang on)
Aside from wantin' you (it seems to hang on)
aside from needin' you (it seems to hang on)
let me give you some idea (it seems to hang on)
it ain't just the tears, the fact of it is
I can't go nowhere
i can't be the same
i don't know my name
i can't understand just why
(it seems to hang on) oh, ooh, why
(it seems to hang on)
Wasn't i clever
as only i can be
but tell me what's happenin'
what's botherin' me, yeah, yeah
Aside from dreams i had
nothin' else exists
honey, it's you i miss
don't leave me like this
I can't go nowhere
