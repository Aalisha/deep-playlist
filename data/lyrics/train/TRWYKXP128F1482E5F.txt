This is the sweetest moment
This is what we both wanted
We are the same
But we're so different
I un-tie your shoe laces
We touch each other's faces
We start to sweat
And the sky turns red

Tell me that you know
Life's not fair
If we're gonna make it
Then we're half way there
Tell me that you know
That I really care
I swear

Let's melt the sugar
Under the meteor shower
On the hottest night
In July
A sticky alter
There's nothing but a towel spread out
As we both lie
...
