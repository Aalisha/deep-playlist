Cry, don't cry for me
I can't take it no more, that's the way it must be
You can't lie your way back in
Back into my heart, I won't let it be broken again

Well I took a tumble, I started to stumble
That's when I fell
Into a love I thought was sent from above
I was under your spell

All the things that mattered were broken and shattered
One by one
