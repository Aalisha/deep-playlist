I pull into my driveway
While the day is slowly dying in the west
I look in that direction
To the setting sun and the one that loved me best

We cried and said goodbye
Seems like a million years ago or was it yesterday
She swore she'd always love
God, I wonder if she still feels that way

I did the right thing
I did the right thing
I went back to my wife
Straightened out my life
I did the right thing
