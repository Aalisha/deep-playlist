If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break,
If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break,
When The Levee Breaks I'll have no place to stay.

Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan,
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan,
Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home,
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

Don't they make you feel bad
When you're tryin' to find your way home,
You don't know which way to go
