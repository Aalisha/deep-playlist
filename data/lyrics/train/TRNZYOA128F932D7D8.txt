There are colors flashing
People wearing stars and stuff
There are engines cracking
There's a way to turn it off

It gets so hard at times
To take it serious
It really gets to be a drag
When all we really need is love

Here come cowboys
Here to save us all
Here come cowboys
They're so well inside the law
Here come cowboys
They're no fun at all
...
