They say sister take your time
it's better that you wait
Better if you show some restraint when
There's too much on your plate
and when time can't seem to find you
and all along you still remain

I tell you patience won't change a thing
Patience won't change a thing

They say sister go out and get yours
go on and get what you deserve
...
