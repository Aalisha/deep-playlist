Somebody saw you at the station
You had your suitcase in your hand
You didn't give no information
You walked off with another man

I'm always standing in the shadows, baby
I watched you give yourself away
And you take them home into your bedroom
Oh you had another busy day

I tried to look the other way and fake it
You push me to the limits I can't take it

One down, one to go just another bullet in the chamber
Sometimes love's a loaded gun
...
