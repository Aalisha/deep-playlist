It all started late on a saturday night, said whos got
the spliffs and who's got the pint?
Look out the window said to my surprise
Here comes the man in blue and his flashing lights
He said now "your party's fuckin' over with
Because ya smokin' joints and you're rolling spliffs,
Now tell me what'cha think i oughta think of this?
Say want'cha pull out your sack or you be missed."
Say now mr.officer come charge me all the time
You got me for possesion, but i swear that it's not mine
No matter what you do or say
It's bound to come right back this way
And if you want a moment's peace say
This what you'll say c'mon an'

Let's get this party started
Until the break of dawn an'
Let's keep this party movin'
Until there's no one home an'
Let's get this party started
...
