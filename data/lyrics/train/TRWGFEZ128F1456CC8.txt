It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad

Today you had a visitor
Or should I say, an old friend
But wait a minute
That's not where it ends, no

Is there something
That you wanna tell me
'Cause I'm believing what your friends say
About your hidden secrecies
Your girlfriend

Your girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
In fact, she's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her
Holding a baby with eyes like yours

She said it's your child
And it really messed me up
How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood

Gotta face reality
There can never be any more us
Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious

She said she never
...
