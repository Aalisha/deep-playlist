Fools in love, well are there any other kinds of lovers?
Fools in love, is there any other kind of pain?

Everything you do, everywhere you go now
Everything you touch, everything you feel
Everything you see, everything you know now
Everything you do, you do it for your baby love
your baby love, your baby love
your baby love...

Fools in love, are there any creatures more pathetic?
Fools in love, never knowing when they've lost the game
