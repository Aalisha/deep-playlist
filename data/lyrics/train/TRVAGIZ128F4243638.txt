I believe
In the faithful and true
And I believe in silly things
Like everlasting love
But I could never ever believe
What was struck upon you
You fell away
But this time it was for goodÂ…

Let me die young, let me die young
So I can be with you forever
Let me die young, let me die young
So we can laugh again in heaven

Once again
You broke my heart (you once again with me)
