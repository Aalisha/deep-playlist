Oh reckless, a boy wonder, so quiet, nose broken 
Oh, you're standing there, look tired as your singing
And you're on fire, they're throwing punches
So backwards the landscape you thought you knew, it starts unwinding
Now you're jumping through their hoops
You're just trying to dodge all their questions
They're shooting bullets
Cause we all want to hear but you can't, you can't
And we all want to see but you don't, you don't
