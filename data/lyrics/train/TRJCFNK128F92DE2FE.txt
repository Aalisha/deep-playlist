Sometimes, people play with love
Falling in love is just a game
Don't think I don't know love
You'll never be alone again

(Let me) Show you how I feel
(Be the one) That I need so much
(Let me) Give you what is real
(Be the one) That I long to touch

Only you can make me feel this way
I'll give you all, come on, let's get away
This love I feel will never ever fade
I'll give you more and more so

(Let me be the one) Hold onto the dream
(Let me be the one) You can trust me at anytime
(Let me be the one) Give you all the love
