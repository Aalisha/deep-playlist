Disregard the name
"Ann Hampton Callaway"
English, Scottish, Irish
A honky all the way
Lionel wasn't pappy
Neither was ol' Cab
Ev'ry day I curse the way
My life is dull and drab
Go on and spread the news
I've got the I'm-too-white-to-sing-the-blues blues!

Got a payin' job
A man who's good and true
A spacious flat in New York City
How could I be blue?
My credit cards are paid up
Except for MasterCard
If my life is such a piece of cake
Tell me why is it so hard?
I ought to hit the booze
I've got the I'm-too-white-to-sing-the-blues blues!
