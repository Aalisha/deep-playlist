In an endless maze begotten
To dead ends led by fools
I sought a plague
For those who smiled at walls
In humble fear

Yet, belligerent ways came to an end
No war could ease my hunger
By craving death I was
To darkness reborn

No sacrifice too great
Caught in another maze
Truly endless
Still
This maze is mine

No peace for me
No peace I seek
My quest goes far beyond
