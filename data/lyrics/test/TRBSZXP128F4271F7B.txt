Baby i don't want what I got
I'd give it back if I could I'd let it all go,
Make a move over again
Just like we never met (let me out)
Make it stop (I want out)
Fill me up

Baby I don't want what i got
Let's say with hindsight a cosmic relief
The grass is greener on the other side 
I don't wanna lie (let me out)
Make it stop (I want out)
Fill me up

Don't be upset - I'm coming out -
