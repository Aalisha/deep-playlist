I'm so sick of this emotion, and the torment that it brings -
Drawn in by its illusion; Just a song the siren sings - I've crashed full force upon your shores -
I am strewed upon your beach -
I hold your body close to me, But your heart is out of reach - She loves me! She loves me not! -
It's tearing me apart - Like a sentimental parasite feeding off my heart - She loves me! She love me not! -
