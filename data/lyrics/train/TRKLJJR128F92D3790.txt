Got guitars that I've never played
Every Elvis album ever made
Got the cars that I should learn to drive
I got a house that would blow your mind

You can take what I got cause I don't got nothing
Worth havin I if I aint got you
You can take what you want cause I don't want nothing
I'm nothing, if I don't have you
Yeah

I've been to places all around the world
I've seen the faces of so many girls
Never thought I would fall in love
And with the songs I write I'm not enough

You can have what I got cause I don't got nothing worth havin
