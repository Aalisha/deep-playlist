When I'm gone will you take good care of everything
Will you keep wearing your wedding ring when I'm gone
When I'm gone will you take at all the photographs
Will you stay ï¿½ .and to the past when I'm gone
Will you miss me in the nights
Will your arms reach out to hold me tight
and keep me in your dreams, in your heart, in your life
sometimes I wanna run to you like lovers do
when love is you
just for a moment be close to you
pretending I'm still holding you
...
