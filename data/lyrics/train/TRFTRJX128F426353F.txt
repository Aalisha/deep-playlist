Listen to the rain come down on the roof
Someone needs a miracle
And I'm the livin' proof
Drink
Light a cigarette
And let me count the ways
I can hear a whisper
In a haunted house these days
She won't set me free
She won't let me go
She won't leave my soul alone
She just leads me to the river
As my heart goes down in flames
Till she comes back to me
I'll have to pray for rain
Wrap yourself around me
Only you can pull me through
Through this desert that I call my heart
I'll pray for rain to you
To you
To you
I can see the firelight reflected on her skin
She was smooth as alabaster
With a taste of salt and sin
