You've got your own way of looking at it baby
I guess that proves that I got mine
Seems like our hearts are set on automatic
We say the first thing that comes to mind
It's just who we are baby
We've come too far to start over now
I know what you're thinkin'
I'm not always easy to be around

Chorus:
But I do love you
