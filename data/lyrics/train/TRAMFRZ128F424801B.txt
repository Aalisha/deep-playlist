Good morning to you I hope you're feeling better baby
Thinking of me while you are far away
Counting the days until they set you free again
Writing this letter hoping you're okay

Saved you the room you used to stay in every Sunday
The one that is warmed by sunshine every day
And we'll get to know each other for a second time
And then you can tell me 'bout your prison stay...

Feels so good...
You're coming home soon!
