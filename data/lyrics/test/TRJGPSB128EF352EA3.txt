I hear a knock on my door
I hear the telephone ring
But I can't break away
I'm just ignoring all those things
My eyes are glued to my TV
You're up there making love to me

I fell in love with you
I'm watching your love scenes
I had to have you every night upon my TV screen
I rent your tape again and again
I never want this love to end

[Chorus:]
