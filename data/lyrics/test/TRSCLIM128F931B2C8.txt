All through this long and sleepless night
I hear my neighbors talking, "She don't love him"
Saying that out of my life
Into another's arms, you'll soon be walking

Somebody shake me
Wake me, when it's over, when it's over
Somebody tell me that I'm dreamin'
And wake me when it's over, when it's over

They say our love ain't what it used to be
And everyone knows but me
I close my ears not wanting to hear
But the words are loud and clear
