When I was a child my dreams were the sky
Above the clouds when I learned how to fly
Now I'm a man who standing on the ground
I found the balance but I still fall down

I can't go out of line; I cannot change my mind
I waste an eternity, I wish I could turn back the time
I seek for a guarantee, a key that sets me free
Another lie seems just a self-deception
