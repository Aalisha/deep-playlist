I'm on the outside looking in
An' I wanna be, an' I wanna be back on the inside w-i-i-th you
You are with somebody new and I don't know what to do
'Cause I'm still in love with you
(In love with you)

I'm on the outside looking in
I don' wanna be, I don' wanna be left on the outside all alone
Well, I guess I've had my day and you left me go my way
