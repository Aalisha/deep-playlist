Oh mercy, mercy, mercy me
I look around I need another remedy
The "I don't know" is philosophy
Better yet, I'll let you get ahead of me

Oh mercy, mercy, mercy me
Come around I need another enemy
Anyone could clearly see
A summer breeze is part of my anatomy

When it's written in Britain
We get a little smitten
Like a kitten, a cuddle is where I'm benefitin'
Any higher the fire would have to petrify her
Upon the wire the flayer is gonna satisfy her
