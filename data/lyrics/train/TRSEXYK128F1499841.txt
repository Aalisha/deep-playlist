As I look back at the things I've done and see the person that I've become I realize I have to pay the dues for setting loose this sea of flames
As I review the path I chose, all the damage caused
Judgement day for me has come, I ask myself was it right, was I wrong?
This is the night all angels cry and their tears set heaven alight
This is a night of screaming, the sky is bleeding and no one but myself to blame
This is the night all angels cry as they're falling with wings on fire
