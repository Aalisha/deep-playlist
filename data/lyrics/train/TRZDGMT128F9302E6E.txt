Angel's on a subway
She's buried in a magazine
Stuck inside a replay
Of someone else's dream

Prophets made of paper
Don't tell her anything
She wants something just to save her
So she lifts her head and screams
She lifts her head and screams

"I don't know you but I love you anyway
I can't see you but I hope you're here to stay
I don't know you but I need you here with me
'Cause I'm falling down, falling down"
