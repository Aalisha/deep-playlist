For real - right!
now hear this original Dr. RD
longside DED
coming with original ESB - see
special dedication to all the hard working people out there
come in

my mother would say there'd be days like this
the boss is a jerk it's getting you pissed
sometimes it makes you wanna quit - I know
you gotta have faith
remember be strong
it's not a race
it's a marathon
you set that pace and you carry on - go on

this one's for the loser
buyer and the user
endless self abuser keep trying again
this one's for the dreamer
plotter and the schemer
endless self believer
keep dreaming believing

yo we never give up the fight
