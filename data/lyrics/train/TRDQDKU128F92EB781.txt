Well he's waiting at the bus stop, seven years old
Breathing on his collar in the freezing cold
And he doesn't know a thing about minimum wage
But his mother's gone early and she gets in late

And by the time he's 18 he's got nobody else
But god knows college won't pay for itself
So he traded in scraping for a uniform.
And I'm starting to see what he's fighting for
Standing on the front line
Now he's waiting on a land mine

And maybe there's a better way

From the people she knew, now she works all day
