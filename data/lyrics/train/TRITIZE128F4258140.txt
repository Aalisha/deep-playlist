Nights grow dim
I'm soakin' wet and afraid
A loaded might
Heading towards my innocence
Diggin' my foxhole
Hiding from what can't be hid from
The fright is so bright
It burrows through my brain

I'm gods favourite child 'ya know
Like dump I'm hading for the pit

A black tank in my sight
Is it the devil or jehova mighty?
Fuelled on fury
Searching, destroying, breeding the dead

I'm gods favourite child 'ya know
Like dump I'm hading for the pit
...
