I ain't your friend, you a tattle teller
You rat, you snitch, you jealous nigga
You coward nigga, you teller nigga
Tuck your tail, pluck your whiskers you tattle teller

I ain't your friend, you a tattle teller
You rat, you snitch, you jealous nigga
You coward nigga, you teller nigga
Tuck your tail, pluck your whiskers you tattle teller

There's rats in the street and rats in the jail
In the feds, rats wear wires in they cell
Shit, Steven Seagal, I used to love his karate
But even he snitched, he told on Peter Gotti

Pillow talk wit'cha girl about that German Ruger
Got her in a small room with the prosecutor
Watch ya shooter, them feds givin' years for them guns
And there's nowhere to hide, when the marshals come

D.A. don't play, giving life off of hearsay
And right hand on the stand for conspiracy
Kingpin charges and that RICO law
Got agents in your spot for them bricks of raw

And people tellin' on you that you never saw
Like your next door neighbor that live on your floor
The game over, man everybody wanna snitch
Fat cat and Alpo nigga started this shit

I ain't your friend, you a tattle teller
You rat, you snitch, you jealous nigga
You coward nigga, you teller nigga
Tuck your tail, pluck your whiskers you tattle teller
