Do you want to dance under the moon light
Squeeze me all through the night
Oh, baby, do you want to dance?

Do you want to dance and hold my hand
Tell me I'm your lover man
Oh, baby, do you want to dance?

Do you want to dance and make romance?
c'mon pretty baby and take a chance
Hey, baby, baby, do you want to dance?

(Do you...) Do you want to dance?
...
