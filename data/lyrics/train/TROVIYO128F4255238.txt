Chorus x4 
 Orange mound nigga orange mound 
 Orange mound nigga then we gonna turn it out 
 
 Mafia is what I claim 
 O-D-P is where I dwell 
 M-town with a prophet mind 
 To make you will live in hell 
 Stickin' to my plan 
 Deep in evil land 
 paper chasin' money freaks 
 Make em' chrome 
 Move it watch my murder rate (quickly increase x2) 
 Teh god god is on my (?) 
 Like a (shadow master x2) 
 Beat through your windows 
 On the news I'm labelled child molester 
 But I'm just another orange mound nigga that you love to hate 
 Slowly risin' to the top and fuck what a nigga say 
 Niggas ain't shit but a nit from a monkey's dick 
 Slapin' on bananas with no peel bitch 
...
