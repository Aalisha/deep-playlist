Let freedom sing from the bells that ring
Lets make a bomb attack
It will be a great comeback
lets make those bastards pay
on your daughters wedding day
Lets start a fire that is burning from the sky
Demolition going down at the skating rink
Lets tell world
make them think we care
lets fly our bombs high
...
