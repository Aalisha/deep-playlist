I went upstairs to pack my leavin trunk
I aint see no blues, whiskey made me sloppy drunk
I aint never seen no whiskey, the blues made me sloppy drunk
Im going back to Memphis babe, where Ill have much better luck

Lookout Mama you know you asked me to be your King
She said you kiddin man, if you want it, keep it hid
But please dont let my husband, my main man catch you here
Please dont let my main man, my husband catch you here
