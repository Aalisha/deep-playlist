(Speaking)
What we gonna do right here
Is take you way back
Way back into time
My man Ginuwine
For all y'all people out there
Bobby to the speaker
It's sung by me
Now, Ginuwine speaking

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
