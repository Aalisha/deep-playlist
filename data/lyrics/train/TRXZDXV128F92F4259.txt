Well I wonder which song they're gonna play when we go
I hope it's something quiet and minor and peaceful and slow
When we float out into the ether into the everlasting arms
I hope we don't hear Marley's chains we forged in life

'Cause the chains I've been hearin' now for most of my life
And the chains I've been hearin' now for most of my life

Did you hear the '59 sound
Coming through on Grandmama's radio?
Did you hear the rattlin' chains
In the hospital walls?

Did you hear the old gospel choir
When they came to carry you over?
Did you hear your favorite song
One last time?
