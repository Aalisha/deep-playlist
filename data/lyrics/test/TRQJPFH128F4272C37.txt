Sweet as a honey bee but like a honey bee stings,
you've gone and left my heart in pain.
All you left is our favorite song, the one we danced to all night long.
It used to bring sweet memories of a tender love that used to be,
now it's the same old song but with a diff'rent meaning
since-a you been gone.
Now it's the same, same old song,
but with a diff'rent meaning since-a you been gone.

Fool am I to hear a old love song.
