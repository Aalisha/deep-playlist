the fairy tale has found an end 
the beauty that belonged back then 
had gone 
i wonder where it all went wrong 
the dream, the love, the recompense 
the song 

and here we are leaving each other 
wandering around haunted like rain 

and why do we dance in sadness? 
and why do we hold it in? 
why do we smile in madness? 
can't you see i need you 
can't you see i need you 
can't you see i need you 
can't you see i need you, i need you 
the end. 

the salt has never left my eyes 
the honey in your words still seeps inside 
i walk the night with ghostly steps 
i wander up and down the past again
