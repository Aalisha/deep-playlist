I had a dream last night
I thought my good gal had gone
Well, I woke up this morning
She really had done me wrong
I know it's not fair
But my good gal has done caught air

I'm goin' away
Leaving today
I'm gonna bring my baby back
If that eight wheel driver don't jump the railroad track
I'll take her from that man
Gonna bring her home if I can
