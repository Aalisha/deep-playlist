You are now listening to the Audio of Being

Between the night and day
Lost in the law of averages
What would you know
Unless you'd lived a life of it?

They say the kid sold out
In love with himself, run ragged
Always looked to be a man of action
'Cause that's what the old man
Should have been, but...

This world it wore him out, eh Pa?
This world it wears you out

I disappeared today
I went under if only for a second
