You're fadin' now like a stereo
Your signal's week and you're feelin' low
Don't try to think you know what I'm thinkin'
So give it up now, just give it up now

Give it up, whoa oh oh whoa
Give it up 'cause I can see through you
Give it up, whoa oh oh whoa
You know that I'd do anything for you

It's obvious that you're feelin' down
And you don't want anyone around
But you know that's exactly what you need
So give it up now, just give it up now
...
