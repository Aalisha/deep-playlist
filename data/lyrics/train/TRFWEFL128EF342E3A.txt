Remember Belgium and the Brussels museum
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
Our code of living meant little to others
The few francs we saved, bought some cheap souvenirs

But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium
Just like Belgium
