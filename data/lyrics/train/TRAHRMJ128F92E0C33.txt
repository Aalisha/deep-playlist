Maybe I've forgotten
The name and the address
Of everyone I've ever known
It's nothing I regret
Save it for another day
It's the school exam
The kids have run away

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain of my wounded heart
I was upset, you see
Almost all the time
