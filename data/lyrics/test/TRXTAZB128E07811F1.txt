Hmm Yeaa (Ooh Ooh)
City Lights
It's on tonight Yea Yea (ooh ooh ooh ohh yea)
Out on the street, I'm looking for a celebration
Come roll with me, together we can crash the party and
Get on the floor, DJ please play my song
And we can do this all night long
Once again, it is on

I'm on a high
I feel like I'm on medication
I'm open wide, and we don't need no complications
Cause I feel alright
And all I see is red lights, and blue lights, and street lights
And it's real life, is that a sign?

I'm under the city lights
It's on, its on tonight
My mood is right, its on its on tonight
Me and my girls (me and my girls)
Tonight it's our world (tonight it's our world)
ooh yeah
I'm out tonight
See I'm out tonight (Heyy)
Come on now

It's after dark
