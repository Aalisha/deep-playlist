I don't believe it
I won't believe it
I'm not sad
I understand that's how it goes

Take it easy
There's no time to be mad
That's their job
Blood on their teeth
Death on their mind

Pretty baby
Please just get out of the way
Where it's safe

Eyes will follow you
Weapons can't break through
Tears will swallow you
...
