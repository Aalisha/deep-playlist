"What you lived, what you felt is worse than treason
I have wasted what you gave and you've lost your faith
What I've done has no sense, though it fed the pain
But my pain, in a way, was nearly the same"

Do you really think it's time to blame an enemy that 's born from your own vision of life
From wonderful rules you may betray?
Don't you really think you could be what you denounce?
Indeed, our laws can choose the other side, and who would be right?

I slept, you see, now I know,
Truth is never the same
Seeds you fed were scornful
