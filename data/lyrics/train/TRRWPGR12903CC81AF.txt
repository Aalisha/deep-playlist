Caught the green line down at Bleeker and Broad
And now it's dropping down to thirty below
I can't feel my toes, but baby I'm on fire

We'll sleep in subways, we'll spend time in cafes
These pretty girls and these Manhattan apartments
These New York police are all fuckin' liars

Staten Island princess, so pretty in pearls
Drop it down, make it an uptown affair
You got the money and I got the drugs
You're pretty, pretty for a white, white girl
