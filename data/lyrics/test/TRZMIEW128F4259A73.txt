Lookey here
Better hurry up and check it out
Lookey here, lookey here

Your steak ain't no hipper than my porkchop
Your Cadillac ain't no hipper than my bus stop
Your champagne ain't no hipper than my soda pop

Lookey here, I'm ready to take care of business
Have no fear, I'm already here

I'll Tell you now (I'm qualified)
You know that I'm qualified
(You know that I'm qualified)

Your top hat ain't no better than my ginger brown
And your sharp skin ain't no badder than my Levis Jim
