I remember you
do you remember me too
born on the 14th of July
the smell of roses made her cry
though you're going far from home
rest assured you're not alone

Cause I would give everything that I own
I'd give you my heart and this skin and these bones
the sun the moon the Earth the sky
I've never even stopped to wonder why
I would do anything
and I would give everything
to be your everything
