I know it's going to last all night
It's the only way to do it
No other choice to make it happen
Make it happen, make it happen

Might seem easy at first sight
But you're wrong, it's not like that
And if you're pleased we make it happen
Make it happen

We know we're gonna make it
You know you're gonna like it
We know it's the new hit
We know we're gonna make it
You know you're gonna like it for sure
You're gonna love it
