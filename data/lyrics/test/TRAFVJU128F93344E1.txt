The morning star, I covet your throne
Denouncing your slaves I claim as my own
Master of darkness, creator of lies
Burdened with envy my beauty despised
I born of fire I will not prostate
He made of clay I will seal his fate
My music of beauty now music of sin
Devouring mankind I will draw him

Bow down to the king of hell
