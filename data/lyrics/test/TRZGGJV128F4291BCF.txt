Blasphemer, heretic, defiler of the sacred ones
Thou art deprived of your limbs
Thy nose shall be split
Thou art cast down and overthrown
Ra-Harmakhis destroyeth thee
He damneth thee and driveth hooks into thy body
Isis sayeth in mighty voice
"The number of they days are cut short
Thy bones are broken to splinters, thy vertebrae are severed."
Horus hammereth thy head
The sons of Heru smash you with their blows

Thou art decimated by their violence
Thou fallest backwards as thou retreateth like unto Apep
The great company of gods gather in retribution
They hath passed judgment upon thee
They cast down your heresy
They spit up on thee and thy rebellion
And turn their back upon thee
Horus repulseth thy crocodile
Sut defileth thy tomb
Nephthys hacketh thee in pieces
