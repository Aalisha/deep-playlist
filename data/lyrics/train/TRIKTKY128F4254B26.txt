Don't give me that look don't show me
those tears
I don't believe 'em
I gave you my love I've had it to here
With all your cheatin'

You never believed I would find you out
It took some time I know what you're about

Kiss my love goodbye
I've had it with your lyin'
Kiss my love goodbye
You weren't even tryin'
You never thought about anyone else
You were just takin' care of your self
You were never mine
So kiss my love goodbye
