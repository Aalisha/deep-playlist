I've got a secret I've got to keep
No turning back I'm in too deep
I know it's so hard Coz I shiver
I knew you were trouble from the moment we met
Look in your eyes pushed me over the edge
Can nothing save me
When love bites

And I can't stop
And I won't stop
And I can't hold back

(chorus)
Coz love bites and there's nothing you can do
...
