Somebody give me a sign,
That everything's going as planned,
And then everything falls away,
Into the darkness of this shallow place.
The detail is striking,
The room's cold and frightening,
You'll kick and you'll scream,
You'll try everything to survive,
But you should know your fate by now.

They told me (they told me)
How I should be,
\"But I broke the mold somehow!\"

It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now,
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done to me.
