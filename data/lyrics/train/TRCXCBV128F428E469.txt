It's easy to fool around it's harder to keep the faith
But I wanna settle down no matter what it takes
If I ever break your heart if I ever do you wrong
I hope I never give you 'cause to doubt where you belong

If a million miles were between us
I'd want you to know

If I had to drive all day take that flight
Across this ocean I'm coming home tonight
Don't let it play on your mind
'Cause my devotion is for all time
