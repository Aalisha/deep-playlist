Heart is heavy, my soul is thirsty, body's aching
I am desperately in need of restoration
And I am ready for You to take me higher, yeah
The only thing that I can do is, keep on praying

'Cause on my own I just can't get it right
It doesn't matter how hard I try
But with You I become a much stronger man
Getting on my knees puts me back on my feet again

Load is heavy, too much accumulation, yeah
These possessions that I have amount to nothing at all
And I am willing to hand over every one of them
'Cause they won't profit me, anything in the end
