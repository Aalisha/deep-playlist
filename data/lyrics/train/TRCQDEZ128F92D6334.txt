Jimmy was a bareback rider
back in my hometown
cowboys fall hard
the whole town saw
Katie let him down

Saw him just the other day
15 years since I've been gone
Couldn't believe it when I heard him say
I don't think she's comin' home

That was a heartache
no little mistake
a pain down in your bones
too much to take
Time keeps rollin' but you aint movin' on
You and I had a pretty good time
...
