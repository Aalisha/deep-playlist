I've been watchin' you for days now Louie
I just love your sexy ways Louie
You know my love will never stop me Louie
Just put your lovin' in my pocket Louie

No more will I shop around Louie
I've got the best thing in town Louie
I've seen all I wanna see Louie
Bring your love straight to me Louie

Wrap it up, I'll take it
Wrap it up, I'll take it

I've been watchin' you for days now Louie
