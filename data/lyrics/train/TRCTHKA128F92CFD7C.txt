My beginnings
Were a lesson learnt
Adding up my years, I was just 19.

At this tender age
My brain clicked on
Who are you to point
And who are you to judge me

I wasn't perfect but I knew wrong from right
Maybe I partied just a little too long sometimes
But I pulled together and I did alright

I been ripped out
And washed up on a highway
I learnt from went down
Who's there from the right things
Now I'm, now I'm strong
With a nineteen turning point
Nineteen turning point
