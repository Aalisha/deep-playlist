Through the mist on the harbor
Dancing lights on the water
Shadows move, I see you smilin' again
When I reach out to touch you

Like a ghost lookin' through me
Sendin' chills deep into me
Shattered dreams fallin' like teardrops again
As you make me remember

Strangers of the heart
Always safe with words unspoken
Strangers of the heart
Don't take chances, they'll get broken
...
