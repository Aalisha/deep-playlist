Meat
In a plane
Locked in chains
High above the trees
Roller coaster, ground gets closer
Had to hear their screams

Weed flavoured
Weed flavoured meat
Weed flavoured
Weed flavoured meat
Weed flavoured
Weed flavoured meat
Weed flavoured
Weed flavoured meat

I've got it
I've got it
It sounds a bit perverted
To get my meat
Most of my mates had to bleed
I've got it
I've got it
Bridged a gap in the market
