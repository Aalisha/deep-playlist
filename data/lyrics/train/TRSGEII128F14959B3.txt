Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
My heart is aching for you, I can't stand it
I need your love, am I so demanding?
I'm givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
I'm Givin' it up for your love - everything
Givin' it up for your love right now
Well I thought about it
you know I'm not playing
You better listen to me
