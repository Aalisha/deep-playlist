Parrish smith:

One hot summer day back around the way
A new kid moved onto the block and his name was jay
Jay was cool, he trucked jewels, packed a nine mil
Yeahhh, and kept his smitty's on his tool

Erick sermon:

Anyway jay portrayed to be like gard
So we took him in, and put him down with the hit squad
His house was phat, full court in the back
Jacuzzi in his bedroom, a welcome on the doormat

P - plus azt, full house alarm system
One rottweiler, one pitbull, no one could vic him
E - something strange about the crib, I had to think
Why the whole God damn house was dressed in hot pink
P - yo jay, where's your bathroom, bust a move I gotta piss
E - three doors on the left homeboy, ya can't miss
P - my head was busted
E - disgusted
P - I said, what's goin on?
I seen a douche bag, and safety maxi-pad tampons
