This is a real addiction, confusion and cheap tattoos
A princess, a car thief, and a lost shoe
Lonliness, laughter, lust, the promise of pain
Judas in blue jeans tell me your name

Eyes across the room, unspoken
Eyes, glitter promise
Cheapness and beauty
Trickery and lies
Cheapness and beauty
Oh I'm so weak sometimes

Glue for the broken toy, the wings for the saint
A buddah, a false god, and some war paint
Wasting your wisdom, yes, but who can you trust
Love holds a mirror up to all of us
