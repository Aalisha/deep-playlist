Get off the fence
Free fall on one side
To meet the end
A waffle effects pride
Get off the fence
You typed out the email
Now just push send
And deal with decision made

It's consequence
So handle it right or wrong
Get off the fence
And let go of the bong
You've made your bed
So sleep in it peacefully
And get off the fence

Direct or indirectly your fault
Straddling the wall you can't have it all no

Well get off the fence
...
