(Paul Kennerley)

When the sun goes down on the other side of town tonight
And the world is asleep dreamin' in the deep moonlight
I'll slip away in the shadows out of your life
You don't want' me anymore so I'll close the door when I leave
My bags are packed and I'll give you back your keys
You keep your ring and I'll keep your memory.

But in my dreams at night, oh, oh
Everything will work out right
