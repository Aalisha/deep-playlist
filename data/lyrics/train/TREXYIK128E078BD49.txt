{Intro: Misty}
Everything's good. Everything's good.

{Red Dogg}
Ain't no stoppin, it's on & poppin. Red Dogg, yeah I keep the bunnies hoppin.
Don't quit on the microphone I spit & spat, so get wet cause I get it like that.
GO/HEAD act like ya knew, that I'm black infact & I'm staying true.
GO/HEAD now feel the bass as my homie POP spit to ya face

{Mr.P}
As I spit to your face, burning eyes like Mace. Pump your fist in the air as I take.
Your mind to another journey another level. Raisin up got my grip on the shevel.
Diggin them up, diggin them up. Sittin them up for the groove, you better not move. Raising them up, raising them up in the hood.
