3LW (Three Little Women)
Miscellaneous
Crazy
[Verse 1 (Kiely)]

I don't apologize, that i have compromised myself and other guy.
Its you I'm talkin' 'bout.
I've been with him for years.
but baby you uh, I must be crazy.
I want you for my own
You've been with her so long.
she never done you wrong and she's so nice to me
we should have never touched cuz now we're in love.
We must be crazy

[Chorus]
You got a girl, i got a man but i can't lie.
I wanna leave him when i look into your eyes
you never thought that holdin me would change your life.
I guess that __ stands for two
