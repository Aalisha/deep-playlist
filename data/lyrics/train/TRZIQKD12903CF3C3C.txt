Till the end of time...

How do you think we can survive?
No angels by your side
This is no dream
It's here and now

How can we make it
Through the night?
This demon we must fight
Visions of hell within my mind
But we must carry on
Carry on...


Till the end of time
We will stand
Till the end of time
Oh, we lost the spark
Till the end of time
...
