I am the passenger
And I ride and I ride
I ride through the city's backside
I see the stars come out of the sky
Yeah the bright and hollow sky

You know it looks so good tonight
I am the passenger
I stay under glass
I look through my window so bright
I see the stars come out tonight
I see the bright and hollow sky
Over the city's ripped backside

And everything looks good tonight
Singing... la, la, la, la, la la la la
la, la, la, la, la la la la
la, la, la, la, la la la la

Get into the car
We'll be the passenger
...
