You can be President Carter,
maybe Idi Amin, or say Muhammed Ali
Make yourself Marlon Brando, Mickey Mouse,

Throw away your old cloak, put on your mask,

Close your eyes to be there,
even though you may be sitting at home.
Listen to all these songs
tell yourself that it's wrong to even go your own way
Throw away your old cloak, put on your mask,
