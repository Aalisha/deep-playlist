You went away, I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind

Still the magic if the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
...
