I break away from every situation
Like this one most times baby
But since you been 'round here I've given in my dear
To your captivation daily

Well, I'm not the type who gets voted most likely
To be victimized by those old butterflies
But you're the exception, your love is infectious
The fever is climbin' high

I hope you don't mind if I fall asleep on your shoulder
Now turn out the lights and let the night begin
I hope it's alright if you're still mine when we're older
'Cause I won't spend another day wonderin' what might have been
No, no, no

I was so cynical, just inconvincible
...
