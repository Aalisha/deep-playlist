God of all nations, Lord of creation
It's in the bonds of love we meet
We come together at Your feet
Equal in Your sight, made one by Your might
You've called us to restore Your lands
And place them back within Your hands

So tonight, be glorified, be magnified
As every nation lifts You high
Oh Father, tonight, it's our desire
To see Your kingdom shine
On earth as in Heaven tonight
