I never can say goodbye, no, no, no, I
I never can say goodbye

Every time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says, "turn around you fool
You know you love him more and more"
Tell me why is it so
Don't want to let you go
