Fire up the engine
Switch another gear
While the road is bending
We don't even steer
So far to go
We move too slow
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know it

Running all the redlights
Trying to get ahead
Turning on the headlights
Hanging by a thread
So far to go
We move too slow
And you know it
Yeah, you know it
Yeah, you know it

Now the brakes are quitting
We're missing the stops
Got a one-way ticket
We're not getting off

Go!
