You were my first mistake
And even if that's true
I would take that punch again
If it would bring me back

I thought I'd changed for you
It turns out just not enough
Distance and telephones
I'm no good at being alone

The last sigh is the last word spoken
Everything else is bent and broken
I would still be there for you
The twilight of the love I cheated
...
