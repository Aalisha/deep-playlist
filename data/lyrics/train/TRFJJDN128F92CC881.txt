Sitting in a corner all alone
Staring from the bottom of his soul
Watching the night come in from the window, window

It'll all collapse tonight
The fullmoon is here again
In sickness and in health
Understanding so demanding

It has no name, there's one for every season
Makes him insane to know
Running away from it all

"I'll be safe in the cornfields"
He thinks. Hunted by his own
Again he feels the moon
Rising on the sky

Find a barn which to sleep in
But can he hide anymore
Someone's at the door
Understanding too demanding
Can this be wrong
...
