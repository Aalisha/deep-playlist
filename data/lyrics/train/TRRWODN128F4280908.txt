Please Baby Trk 17 3: 17
The Mississippi Sheiks
Sam Chatmon - bass guitar, (brother) Lonnie Chatmon - fiddle
(brother) Bo 'Carter' - guitar, Walter Vinson - guitar

Please, baby
Ple-eease, baby
Won't you come back to your daddy
One more time?

Please, baby
Ple-eease, baby
When I get my money, I will
Give you my last dime

When you left me, babe
You left me feelin' so blue
You know babe, I didn't love
No one but you

Please, baby
