Here is your crown
And your seal and rings;
And here is your love
For all things.

Here is your cart,
And your cardboard and piss;
And here is your love
For all of this.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, goodbye.

Here is your wine,
And your drunken fall;
And here is your love.
Your love for it all.
