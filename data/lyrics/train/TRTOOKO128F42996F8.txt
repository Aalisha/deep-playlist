Needed some time
So I could find
A little strength to redefine
What I've become
What I have done
I never asked to be the one

I'm riding it out
This storm that you brought in
Bringing it down
On me around
For you, I'd go again

It's gotta be
Easy to see
What everyone takes out of me
Knocking me down
Dragging me out
How did you end up in that ground?

Did you run away?
Did you fall apart?
Did you see yourself
For what you are?
Will you be looking for it anymore
When five becomes four?
When you're all alone
With the melody
Do you close your eyes
And think of me?
Will you'll still hear me singing anymore
