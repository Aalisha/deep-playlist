Step into the great outdoors
After all it would be wrong to stay inside
I know
When the first chimney takes its chances
And despite their branches all the leaves decide
It's time to go
And cover up the crimes
Of the seasons passed before

Every footpath leads into another footpath
I can't find the place to stop
The endless chore
But it's time that I went visiting
These guys I know who've bought themselves a shop
A record store
A humble hole in the wall
Could you ever want for more?

I'll be hanging in the record store
...
