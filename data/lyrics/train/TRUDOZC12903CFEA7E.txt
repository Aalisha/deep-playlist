breathe in
kindle the fire
a new plague now living so deep inside
this pharaohÂ’s found in the mirrors on our walls
war
the addicts scream war yet fault is solely self-imposed
truth or denial hold the options in our heart
and we choose truth
combating poisons while the sun still shines upon our lives
breakdown decide
just what would it take to be on the other side?
its within our hearts
within our mindsets
within earshot and eyeshot today
within our skin
...
