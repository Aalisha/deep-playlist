Can I play for you baby
Ey yo Woody help me out
Ey yo Jazz you chill for a minute
Nokio come on
You like that i'll sing a song 4 you

Last night we had an argument
Afterwards I'm feelin pretty bent
Then I took a drink and I didn't think
What was in store for me
So I wrote a letter
Dropped it on the bedroom floor
I never felt this way before
So I grabbed my coat and closed the door
Baby I'm sorry

Baby I'm sorry
Sorry for what I've done
Will you forgive me
Will you forgive me
And let me be your only one
Cause you are
