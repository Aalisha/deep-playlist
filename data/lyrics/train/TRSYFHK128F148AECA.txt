Song: Girl
Artist: Latif
Album: Love in the First

Hold up, what's up, why you got a nigga wanna get with someone come on
Hold up, what's up, why you got me back up on the ropes

(Verse 1)
Is it Prada or Gucci jeans on yo bootie
You look like a star straight out of a movie
I just really think its wicked how you move your body sicken
I aint really sho with it I'm tryna slide up and meet you
You got me, who's taking who
Im in the pearl x5 sitting right outside
Tell me are you here alone
