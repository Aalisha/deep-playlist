Over the mountains the first lights of dawn
the rocks around are covered by snow
(Iras Algor:)
“Come here my friends, enjoy this last view
the sunlight's reflections, the shy fading moon
Many legends told by the jesters
were inspired by the facts
of a time now forever gone
when our friends the elves lived in these lands
when our friends the elves lived in these lands”

OLD AGE OF WONDERS, OF ELVISH EMOTION
PROUDLY SURVIVED IN THE MYST OF THE STARS
MAGICAL DAWNS, HOLY VISION OF ANGELS
