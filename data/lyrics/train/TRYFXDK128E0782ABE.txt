I might be old but I'm someone new she said
I'm so sore that I could cry always
In the night lay your tired arms

She will have her way
But somehow I will still believe her

She's the life I've been frightened of
Seems like deathly silence and especially the dark
Feels like I am heavy and my spirit has died

She will have her way
But somehow I will still believe her
She will have her way
And one day I will come back
...
