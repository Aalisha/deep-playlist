What is Courage
Is it Brave
What are Lions
I've only seen them in parades
How is love supposed to read
In a footnote of history
What's a tap on your shoulder
That you're afraid to look over
A soldier's down in a fire fight
No one can look me in the eye
This is what it means to be alone.

Tear out my Heart
Feed it to Lions
For this one wish I beg you this tonight
Show me no mercy
But spare me my pride
I'm going for a drive

And if you find out he's coming home
When I come around the corner
I'll know that it's alright
Just leave me two lights
