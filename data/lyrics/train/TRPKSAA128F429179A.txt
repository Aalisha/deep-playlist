Mama said before I'm grown
I'll find somebody I can call my own
So when the stars are shining bright
I dream about the boy who's gonna hold me tight

And I wonder who he'll be
I wonder if he'll be good to me
I wonder, gosh oh gee
I wonder if he'll love me forever

Every night I close my eyes
And there is something that I visualize
I hear a voice, say, "I love you"
I picture all things that we're gonna do
