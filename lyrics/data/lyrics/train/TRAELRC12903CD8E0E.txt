So baby don't play games
You're on the road to something
Don't wish it all away
Just because you feel like nothing
When you don't know how to feel
And you don't know how to cry
You can find some hope tonight
God only knows just where you are

So move a little closer
Take it even slower
Don't let this be the end
She's falling even faster
