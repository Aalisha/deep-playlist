what I'll give you is sweet music
right
you take sugar and i have none
you take your coffee black and I have mine white
life is a mystery
so let's live for today
we don't know our destiny
so lets love each other
never gonna give you up
no matter what your mama says, girl
cause you promised me that you'll always love me
never gonna give you up
...
