probably the thought of angels playing with my time will fade
no ones gonna say anything for me cause there all at home where they stayed
build up and squash between an air of beauty is what we all should breathe
and here you see is believers...

fill in the pages of tomorrow's yet to be
well life is changing slowly with it inside me

homegrowns the way that it should be
...
