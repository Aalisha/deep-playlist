Come make we play some
ketchy shuby
and when me shuby
you feel ketchy

And when you're ketchy
don't make it drop
'cause if it drop
it will pop

And if it pop
no one can mend it
'cause if them mend it
you can easily bend it

so we ah go
Chorus:
ketchy, ketchy â€“ shuby, shuby tonight

all night long we ah go
Chorus

tell me if you like it
Chorus

all night long we ah go
Chorus

It don't take too long to learn
just you do as I say
It may only take one hours or two
...
