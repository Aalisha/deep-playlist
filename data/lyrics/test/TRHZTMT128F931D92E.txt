He died on a Friday
by Saturday night she
was out on a club drinking
all through the night
and she was too happy too soon

In the casino he didn't
think twice by gambling
it all on a roll of a dice
and he was too happy too soon

-CHORUS-
Well you just never know
how it's gonna go
Well you just never know
how it's gonna go
...
