I smile at you at the show 
Bullshit along with your niceties 
Then I sit back and watch you go 
Suck up to people you wanna be 

Oooh, but I've got it 
Oooh, that you're not it 
Oooh, and it's just a matter of time 
Before one by one, your friends 

Fully discover 
The real you 
The real you 
The real you 

I gotta say you're good at what you do 
...
