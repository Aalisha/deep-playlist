I remember it well like it was last night
Maybe the night before
Standing there sweating under the 40 watt light
For a kiss at my Daddy's door
Every star blazed above and the moon was a yellow ball
We were there trying to connect the dots
And make a little sense of it all

Slumped down behind the wheel
And the radio played the tune
Well I loved that boy with all my might
At least a month or so
Then he ran off with the girl next door
