Oh Darci, Darci don't look so sad
Don't let the daytime get you down
Because we will be wild like children once the black has veiled this sky
No pushing buttons, no telling lies
No pointed fingers trying to keep you quiet
Just you and I misbehaving
Oh trying our best to feel alive
We won't ever let them win
When we are younger oh our hearts are so much bolder
The pressure is not as great
We floated weightless through the tops of trees
But as we get older oh our vision becomes blurred
And then the fog it slips right in
Now you're wondering how oh yeah, you're wondering how you ended up here
How you end up here
