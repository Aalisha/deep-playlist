Suburbia, 1 am, you're walking home again
shopping bags and broken glass
I hate going through the underpass
I wish there was some other way around
but you got beaten up by the playground and it's no use
we'll have to go through the deserted shopping centre
pedestrian walkways I think they were meant to
make things better
but it's just emptier, and scary at nighttime.
Hatfield at that time.

This is the place I live
