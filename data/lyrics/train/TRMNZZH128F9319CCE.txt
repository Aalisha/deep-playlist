Things been rolling by
All this time I thought you were mine
All this time I thought you were here with me, yeah
But you were right on the town
Haven't thought that whenever you see
When all the times I just needed you here with me
Guess that you should know

You should have waited, yeah
Waited for my love
Waited for it, honey, but now it's gone
You should have waited
Waited for my love
Waited for it, honey, but now it's gone
You should have waited

Sometimes I think about you
How you were doing and how you're living
Things just flew to my mind all the time, yeah
I couldn't give up but how
I was feeling about love so deeply
You were a part of my life, but you wanted to go
