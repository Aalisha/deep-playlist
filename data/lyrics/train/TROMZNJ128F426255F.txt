All of the Malice imploded towards silence
It's my time to rest so just kill all the nonsense
I already know you and you'll never know me
Be just who you are and others will agree
With you because you make sense
In this world full of clones that just copy each other
And as I get older the voices get louder
They tend to get in the way
