Mocked me when I was singing the songs
Trying to get back to something more simple than we have
They mocked me? cause I told it like it was

Wrote about disappointment and greed
Wrote about what we really didn? t need in our lives
Make us feel alive and whole

Illusions and pipe dreams on the one hand
And straight reality is always cold
Saying something hard edged is off the wall
And it might seem too bold

Mocked me when it got out of hand
Nobody tried to understand
Now we got to keep it simple and that? s that
