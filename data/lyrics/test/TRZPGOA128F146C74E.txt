Long time ago and the times we had were so and so
It was the worst days of your life
So I called you home your so-called father was on the phone
He wasn't easy to ignore
But we're all happy 'cause the streets they're always there for us
And it's quite scary when you wake up in the same old clubs
It's getting darker and I know this time wasn't meant for us
So won't you please please please come back to me
