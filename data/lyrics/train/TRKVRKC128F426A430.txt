CRYINâ€™ IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA
Writer Hank Thompson

Well, I went to see my baby
She said stay away from me
'Cause I'm a hot wire
And you're a flat tire
And I'm a-lettin' you go, you see

(Chorus)
And now, I'm gone
You can look for me
Down by the ocean
Cryin' in the deep blue sea

Well, I never thought my baby
Would ever say goodbye
