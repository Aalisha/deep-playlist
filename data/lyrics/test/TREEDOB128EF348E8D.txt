Yeah, Scientific Shabazz, the Holy Psychiatrist
Coming down with that spiritual rain
Six thousand years of darkness
Four hundred years of pain
As I attract the wicked into the Sunz of Man Court
He shall be tried for his ways & actions
Death shall be his penalty...
As I embellish, mentally I nourish
Resuscitate a mindstate that has perished, you shall inherit
His blood I require back, to Earth
We rise out of spiritual darkness, six thousand year curse
The lost disciples, bound, to the midst of the
Bottomless pit, trapped behind the gates of the wicked wilderness
I hear the sound of the trumpets, blowing across the heavens
It's calm - prepare, for the storm, of the seven
Shabazz, the Disciple, the holy, exalter
Condemning those, who sacrificin, babies on the altar
I hear the cries of innocent black babies who are aborted
And unmercifully slaughtered
Loud screams echo, skulls of angry slaves
Turning over in their graves
The white sheets are like white flags, you need to wave it
