Here's a girl that came back
Though her memories are cold
Barefoot summers a long time ago
Believed in things she never could own
She's been waiting to come home

Where the windows are cracked
Faith is peeled off the world
Eyes are open but vision is blurred
While the reeds have grown as high as before
You can't see them anymore

Once in a lifetime
Gold in the rye
...
