Fallin' down on me, before you taste the rage
Burn me down, I'm a book, not a page
Lend me your dream, here's a wing for my pay
When the shoe's on the other foot, you ain't got much to say

I know you see the ghost on the side of the road
Silhouettes of headlights are where ya gonna go
You see your mama smile, you hear a song that you adore
...
