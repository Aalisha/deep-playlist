Is this muthafucka on?
(Check-check 1-2
Yeah bitch, go check your muthafuckin puss
Yeah, this's your homeboy Jay from the Romper Room Crew
We just lounge here in the Country Club right about now
You know what I'm sayin?
But now I'm gonna pass this to my young dog Mac Mall)

[VERSE 1]
Passin Mac Mall the mic is like lighting a fuse
To a fat pipe bomb in a packed-ass room
Full of broke pimpetrators who be all tryin to dis
And them hairshop hoes playa-hatin for the dick
Now naw, I can't forget all them rumour-spreadin tricks
Chocolate nuts for your mouth when this dope album hits
Like a? hoe? out of China, ballers say I am a timer
Cause I was shootin game since I was a minor
Some of these rappers is liars, candy-coated and shit
Counterfeit-ass nigga, you can't blow up in this shit
I went from bein broke to havin fat accounts
From Ben Davis to wearin clothes you can't pronounce
From spittin lines to the ladies to bust the game to a bitch
First they hung up in my face, now I got em doin flips
So when my cuddies ask, "Mall, you stress offa what suckers say?"
I tell em, "Naw folks, it's all in the game"

[CHORUS]
I'm comin up on the playa tip
Your boy done bubbled, so be prepared for some major shit
