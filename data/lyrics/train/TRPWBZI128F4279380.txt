Well let me tell you I have seen a monster age of seventeen
Who'll let you in to kick you out and knows what love is "all about"

And long ago you used to stop and talk now you just wink your eye
and I'm surprised you look all grown up
A champagne glass next to a paper cup
I stopped you just to say it
