Well Ann she bought me a bottle of wine, it was a sultry 93 burgandy
She never minded to dine, on me
We stare across the sad cafes like we're waiting on an accident.
When what we think to say makes less sense
And I'm waiting on the drinks to bring me consent.
Cause lately this is just the way it has been, the way it shall be
Two tables down an old wise man shoots a grin,
You can tell he's happy, happy for me

Hang down your head just like Tom Dooley,
Poor boy, you know you never once fooled me.
You put your trust in the thought that grace was on your side
It's such a beautiful day to die.

Well I guess it was thoughtful, after all it had just passed my birthday.
