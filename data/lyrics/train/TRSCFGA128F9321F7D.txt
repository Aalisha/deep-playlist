Your love
Lifted me higher
Than I've ever been lifted before.
So keep it up,
Quench my desire,
And I'll be at your side forevermore.
(Chorus)
You know your love (Your love keeps lifting me, your)
Keep on lifting (love keeps lifting me)
Higher (lifting me)
Higher and Higher (higher and higher, higher)
