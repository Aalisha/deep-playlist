It ain't safe to walk out tonight
There's always someone ready to start a fight
What did I do? What did I say?
And did I look at you, the wrong way?

I don't know what's going on
But instead of having fun, you're gonna spoil the night

So don't you tell me that you're sorry
And don't you tell me it's all good

Leave it leave it leave it out
If you're coming in for trouble then you know you're going out
Leave it leave it leave it out
What's the point of acting big just because there's a crowd
...
