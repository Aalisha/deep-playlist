How I've waited for you to come
I've been here all along
And now that you've arrived
Please stay a while
And I promise I wont keep you long
I'll keep you forever

Graze the skin with my finger tips
The brush of dead cold flesh appeases the means
Provoking images delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
...
