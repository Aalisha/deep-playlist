Go!

You read Grisham novels, I'd rather watch a movie
Baby, we're like night and day, yeah
You like frappacino, Leonardo DiCaprio
I like Al Pacino and I take my coffee straight

It's no secret
Girl, we're different
It's not like we don't know
Every single hesitation
All goes out the window

When you say my name, I can feel forever
When you touch my face
Girl, I feel invincible
