A long time ago in a swamp far, far away...
Where Louisiana meets Texas and the snakes fall off the tree
The critters are gettin' restless, gettin' greedy and mean
The frogs all hate the toads, crocks all hate the gators
Ain't nobody gettin' along, they ain't teams, man, they just players
(Oh no) They all hatin'
They don't know
They all gonna get it!
