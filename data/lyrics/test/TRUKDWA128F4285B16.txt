They took a long, dark journey back into the void
Escaped the earth's black world of decay
They watched as mankind brought about it's own demise
Fell down to satan's slaves
Upon a world unknown came the future

With all the hate and greed far behind them

Too soon the poisoned earth was forgotten
The sons of freedom now in their graves
Inside their children's hearts grew the darkness
