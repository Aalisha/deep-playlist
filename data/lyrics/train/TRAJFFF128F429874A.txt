Sometimes we fall
Ain't nothing new to me
Don't care move on
I must say you gave up for this time now

Stop tell me, where you going?
Maybe the one you love isn't there
You're going under but you're over it all so you don't
Care about all that I had to see
Watch, you wait until you come around, around

Don't close your eyes
You need to see it all
