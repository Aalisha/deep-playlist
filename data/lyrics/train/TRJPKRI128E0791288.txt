Sirens ring, the shots ring out
A stranger cries, screams out loud
I had my world strapped against my back
I held my hands, never knew how to act

And the same black line that was drawn on you
Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in
6th Avenue heartache

Below me was a homeless man
I'm singin' songs, I knew complete
On the steps alone, his guitar in hand
It's fifty years, he stood where he stands

And the same black line that was drawn on you
Was drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in
6th Avenue heartache

And the same black line that was drawn on you
...
