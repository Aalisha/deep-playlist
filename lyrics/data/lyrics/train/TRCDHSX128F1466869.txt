My life is ever so perfect
My life has been a bed of roses

And you might think I'm crazy
So what if I am
My head is full of good things
Enough for everyone

Beautiful
Is all I see when I look at me
Beautiful
Every mother's dream

Day by day
Things just keep getting prettier
Beautiful
What a wonderful life

And my life is really quite simple
My life is just what I make it
