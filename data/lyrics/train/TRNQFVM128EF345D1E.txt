I've been thinking i've been tryin' just to figure how you claim
how these things that you're sayin' are even close to a truth
i've been thinking i've been tryin' just to figure how you remain
when the fusion of cultures is the sound you produce
I've got a feelin' that sooner or later
you're gonna get what is due unto you
and i'll do my best to make it sooner not later
I'm sick and fuckin' tired of the ignorance portrayed
in your messages hatred that caused nothing but pain
yeah we're sick and fuckin' tired of progress being delayed
