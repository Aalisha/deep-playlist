[Fredro Starr (Sticky Fingaz) {Sonsee}]
(Yo what's up baby?)
Ay yo Stick man, shit is fucked up!
(Who the fuck this?)
It's fuckin Fredro man!
(Yo yo yo, turn the muthafuckin music down god.)
It's my fuckin word, Sticky, man!
(Yo what's up nigga?)
Muthafuckas wetted everything out there.
(What the fuck you talkin about?)
Muthafuckas is dead, son!
(Yo yo, calm down nigga, calm down!)
Word to fuckin mother man!
(Just tell me what happened, god.)
It had to be about eight o'clock (Uh huh, uh huh)
When niggas sprayed the block, it's mad hot
Yo half the spot got locked
(What? Who got shot?)
My little nigga Bill from down the hill
We had a one through five
I heard he might not survive (Aw, damn)
He caught one in his leg
Two shots hit him in his upper (What?)
Part of his chest, two inches above his vest
Heard you next (I'm next?)
That's the word in the projects
(What? Them niggas ain't no threat
They'll whole set'll get wet
Yo go get the AK, and my two nines with the silencers
And at seven thirty, y'all niggaz meet me at Veronica's)
Aight, no doubt, yo be safe, yo nigga I'm out
{Let me talk to him, let me talk to him}
Yo yo Stick hold up, yo yo yo Stick, talk to Son
(Aight, aight) Don't even wet that done, yo I'm bringin mad guns
{Ay yo Stick, that's my word
It might be them niggas from Riverside
Cuz I heard they knew somethin
About how my little nigga died}
(Who who, little Dave with the red car?)
{Yeah, he had beef up there
With the same ones we seen at the strip arcade
With the scar by his head}
(Aight aight, get the big shit, no bullshit, it's time to flip
And I'll see y'all niggas later, be safe)
{No doubt, aight kid}
