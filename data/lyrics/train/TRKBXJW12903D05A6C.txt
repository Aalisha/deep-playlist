Stop the rock. Stop the rock.
Stop the rock. Stop the rock.
Stop the rock, can't stop the rock
You can't stop the rock, stop the rock
Stop the rock, can't stop the rock
You can's stop the rock, can't stop the rock (repeated 4 times)

Shake that paranoia, can't stop the rock!
Shake that paranoia, can't stop the rock!
Shake that paranoia, can't stop the rock!
Shake that paranoia, can't stop the rock!
Shake that paranoia, can't stop the rock!
Come move me move me
Dancing like Madonna, into the groovy
