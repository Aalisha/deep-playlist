Now, er, has you got it, sister Constance, er tell me, has you got it?
Oh, yeah, I got it, brother Bingstance, now you know I got it
Now, has you got that rhythm in you, mm?
Yeah, yeah, I think I got that er rhythm in me
Then you got it, sister Constance
I swear I do believe that you got it

You will shout when it hits you, yes indeed
Oh, you'll shout when it hits you, yes indeed
Oh, yes indeed
When the spirit moves you, you'll shout hallelujah!
Hallelujah brother!
