Been a mighty good girl
Living like a slave to your words
And I thought you should know
I'm coming up with nothing to show
Mama, no more charades
Saying it ain't gonna play
Mama, what do you see
Is anybody looking for me

Everybody's looking for love
Everybody's searching above
Everybody's looking for love
Everybody's searching above

Life is no walk in the park
