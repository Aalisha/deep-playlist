This is for my sisters
And all my sister girls
Um
Yeah
She was five foot nine
And she didn't wear shoes
Body like a goddess
Walk by her own rules
Reign supreme over her ghetto kingdom
Possess interlectually wisdom
Any man she met wanted a piece of her
Qualifying things in hopes to creep with her
Talk like twenty-five
Look like twenty-three
Who could believe the sister's only fourteen
Hold On
If You Can
Cross Your Legs
Forget that man
Someday
you'll look back and understandddd
Sista Girl
You're only a child
Walkin' around, sista girl
Don't let 'em rock your world
Sista Girl
