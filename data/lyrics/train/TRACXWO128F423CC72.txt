Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You're my Lord
And I know loving You
Is what my heart is for

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You're my Lord
And I know every day
I grow to love You more

You are my King
You are my Song
You are my Prize
I love You, I love You Lord

So Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You're my Lord
And I know loving You
