Daddy's gone
left his spawn
he won't return before dawn
she's the nurse
she's perverse
by the end of night you'll need a hearse

trapped with this furious hag
the children start to cry
no rescue anywhere
they know they have to die

as she scents
excrements
she smears the shit with her hands
in their eyes
on their thighs
sharing that feast with the flies
