I knew I couldn't trust you back when we were kids
You sold me out, you ran and hid
From all your problems, can't even face your friends
Your best friends

You're holding something in tonight
And I can tell you're not alright
Your poker face concealing
All the cards that you're not dealing
Cross your arms, avert your eyes
You're like a child ashamed to cry
The words inside your head
When I find out you'll wish you said

I let you down so many times
But I can't ever tell you this
There is no forgiving it
I promised you I'd always be there
But that couldnâ€™t be less true
It's the worst thing I could do
