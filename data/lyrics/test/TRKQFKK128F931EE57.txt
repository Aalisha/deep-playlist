No Satisfaction guaranteed
Saturday means something
Crave the thing you know you need
Right now you're worth nothing
Going places you don't know
Days keep going nowhere
One last coin wont save your name
Or get that ticket out of here
Work all week get some say
Feeling 5 years older
Make that vote get off your knees
