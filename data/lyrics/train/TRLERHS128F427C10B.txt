Somebody's screaming out
Somebody's knocking out
Somebody's calling out
Come, hear it again

Street bells are ringing out
Young girls are singing out
Boys are building up big to be men

You've got the love then here comes the blood last
The father, the mother, the sister, the chain
Sweet inspirations or a cold hearted nations, baby
The young man, the brothers, the killers explain

Oh jungleland, they call you home sweet home
You make me feel so sad, to leave here all alone
But there is a kid called Hope and he's holding out his hand
He sees the northern lights above this high rise land
Oh jungleland, oh jungleland, oh jungleland

In the city, get out the city pretty quick
