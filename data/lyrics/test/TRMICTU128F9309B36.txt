In the kitchen of the party
I was sitting on your coat
Your finished sentences for me
Among all the things that you quote

If you're feeling ?, I'll guide you outside
Where the star of the sea YEAH!
If you really cried than I'll take you outside
Where the star of the sea were blinking at us

Your ? on the door
And the click of the light
And you're here to have a good time

Your car and your rent
And your money's been spent
And you're here to have a good time

Ever so
Ever so
...
