Betrayed one more time
But somewhere down that line
You're gonna get what's coming to you

Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now!

Pull it out from my back
Soon I'm the one that's on attack
Can't wait to return the favour

Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now!

Too many times I've seen it
Rip a hole into our friendship
This is how it's been, how it always will be

You think you're above me (You think you're above me!)
But now I'm here to envy
