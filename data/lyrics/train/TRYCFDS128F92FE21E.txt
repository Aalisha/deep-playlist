I'm not afraid of the darkness
Whom shall I fear if God be for me
What shall we say to these things
What shall we say to these things
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid of the darkness
Whom shall I fear if God be for me
What shall we say to these things
What shall we say to these things
I'm not afraid anymore
I'm not afraid anymore
What can separate you from the love of God?
Nothing shall separate me from the love of God
