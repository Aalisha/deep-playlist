So I'll write these words now
For you, my friend, here after all this time
We may never sing this one, it's just here
As a light to help you

When the power goes out
Like the moments you might shake yourself awake
From those horrible dreams
The only ones we never talk about

The glare of madness in grown-ups' eyes
The rage that takes the whole room by surprise
This vicious trap, the male cultural disguise
Is the one we fight against

We go, we go, we go
The one we fight against
We go, we go, we go

So I'll write these words now
...
