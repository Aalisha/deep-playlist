Will My Ankles Touch The Floor 
Cause I Can't See Them Anymore And 
Why Are These Things Now So Clear To Me 

The Past And Present Only Make The Proof 
Of Humans Big Mistake 
And Others How Have Sight Refuse To See 

In The Future 
All The Strong Will Meet The Wise 
In The Future 
I Can See It In My Eyes 
What Does It Mean 
At The End Of It 
What Will It Mean 
When Our Voices Quit Sound 

Contraception Obsolete 
The Water Drank Will Do The Deed 
And Nary Will The Men Suspect A Thing 

Power Aphrodisiac 
Where Nature Comes To Bring Us Back 
Without The Consequence Of What It Brings 

In The Future 
All The Strong Will Meet The Wise 
In The Future 
I Can See It In My Eyes 
What Does It Mean 
...
