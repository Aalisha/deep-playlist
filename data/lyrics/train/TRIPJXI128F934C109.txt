Tell me all the things you want
I shall prove myself among the wise
I have failed you
Grant my wish I beg of thee
For I have done all the deeds you have asked of me
That whimpering wretched whore who birthed your adversary
I retrieved her head and mutilated every last remain
The blood of the innocent I have spread with no fucking remorse
How dare you interfere my monumental wake
