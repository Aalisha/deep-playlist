Where was I when the lights went out?
Up in my room listening to twist and shout
Hot summer nights by the window fan
Out on the airwave, a big dance band
On the All Night Radio...
I gotta hear the new sound
From across the ocean
All strange and soulful,
full of new emotion
Make ya wanna miss
somebody that 'cha don't even know
Lying there in the darkness
with the sound down low
...
