Words are sometimes funny, they can change the way you feel
I've seen them break a heart, save a soul, make a grown man kneel
Now, I don't want to sound like I'm a fumblin' fool
But I can't find the right ones to tell you the truth

I could tell you that I need you, I could tell you that I care
Or that my heart broke down and told me, where we go from here
No way to tell you what I'm feelin' in a way you've never heard
...
