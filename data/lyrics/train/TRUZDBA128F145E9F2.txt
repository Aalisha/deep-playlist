It's like I dont care about nothing man...
Roll another blunt.
ooohh
la da da da la da da la la da da

I was gonna clean my room until I got high
I was gonna get up and find the broom but then I got high
My room is still messed up and I know why (why man?)

'Cause I got high
Because I got high
Because I got high

I was gonna go to class before I got high
I could'a cheated and I could'a passed but I got high (uh uh la la da da)
I'm takin' it next semester and I know why (why man?) (hey hey)

'Cause I got high/
Because I got high
Because I got high

(go to the next one, go to the next one, go to the next one)
I was going to go to court, but then I got high
I was going to pay my child support (no you wasn't) but then I go high
now they took my whole paycheck and I know why (Why man?)
Because I got high
Because I got hig
I was gonna go to work but then I got high (ohh, ohh)
I just got a new promotion but I got high (la da da da da)
Now I'm selling dope and I know why (why man?)
