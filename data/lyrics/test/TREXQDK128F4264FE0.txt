Once I ran like the wildest horse
I reached up high and I clinched my fist
What happened then goes just like this
Oh, the tender branch is gonna fall

I was young and I thought it brave
Fighting to find the mystery? s face
You got to give it a gentler chase
'Cause oh, the tender branch is gonna fall
Oh, the tender branch is gonna fall
