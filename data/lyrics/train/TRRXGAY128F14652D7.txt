Why don't we wrong the right

You wanna know
Just like before
Well I don't really think you need a
Fucking explanation
For how we read
And how we write
Too much of that's a social abomination

And death becomes your one reality
It's out of my hands
What you think of me
Let's rip down this
Enterprise so

Why don't we wrong the right
The right (The right)
Wrong the right now
Why don't we wrong the right
The right (the right)
Wrong the right now
