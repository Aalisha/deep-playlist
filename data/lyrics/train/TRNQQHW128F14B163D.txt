You were born on a windswept morn
Under the summer sky
They moved you past all the kids in your class
You never even asked why

Oh the golden days
Lying awake at night
Hearing the ocean spray
Nobody counting the lives you've cost
No mothers crying for sons they've lost
Nobody watching at all
Just you and the road as it curves and bends
Doing little jobs for your daddy's friends

One day when the world is right
We're going to walk in the bright blue light
When your kingdom's gone
And your friends moved on
We're going to watch you fall
We're going to watch it all
One fine day
