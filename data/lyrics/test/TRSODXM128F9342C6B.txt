I've been living for years in question, some obsession
Was I less to live with no answers, as a life cried wolf
I'm ashamed to mention my anguish, but silence lies empty

If I say it again can I kill it, will you lend me your ears
Breathe in breathe out exhale, acting sweating
A broken smile provides them a view, projection is nothing new
Just once I would like them to feel it, suffer in my skin
For a moment stand in my shoes, filled with swelling blues

I keep this room, and this room keeps me, chained to my organs
I am quarantined, to a place that's dark, staring at three walls
The door is locked to them
