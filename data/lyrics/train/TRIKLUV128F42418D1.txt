Oh my god, this hurts like hell
I had that dream again
Where I was lost for good in outer space
Tell me, doctor, how to shake
A waking nightmare that is only worse
When I am sleeping

Kill the messenger
I swear it's not me
It's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And I never told you that
And all I need from you
Could be the thing that leaves us both up here forever
I'm gonna send alittle rain your way
I'm gonna send alittle rain...

It's not so easy, caving in
...
