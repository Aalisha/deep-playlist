So sweet caress, never long to last!
You entered my soul and gave hope to my life.

So sweet caress, never hope to last!
You left me behind all alone and aghast
Captured inside such an austere Elysium

Imperfect feelings, futile grief
Love a device against all solitude
As it all went on, the love became
A field in a dream that once had been real
