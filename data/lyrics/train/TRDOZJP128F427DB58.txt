When she goes, she's gone
If she stays, she stays here
The girl does what she wants to do
She knows what she wants to do

And I know I'm fakin' it
I'm not really makin' it

Such a dubious soul
And a walk in the garden wears me down
Tangled in the fallen vines
Pickin' up the punchlines

I've just been fakin' it
...
