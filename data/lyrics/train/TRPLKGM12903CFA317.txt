The system is fucked, things aren't fine
Out of control, the world's lost it's mind

I know this sounds like some trash from the right
My compassion was stolen, smoked in a pipe

Deception and fraud, too many acts to mention
Pushed to the end this is my declaration

Lost, lost, lost, I lost my faith
Lost, lost, trust no one
