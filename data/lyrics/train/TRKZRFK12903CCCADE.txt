The Beau Brummels
Miscellaneous
Laugh Laugh

I hate to say it but I told you so, don't mind my preachin' to you
I said "don't trust 'em, baby" now you know
You don't know ev'rything there is to know in school.
Wouldn't believe me when I gave advice, I said that he was a tease
If you want help you better ask me now
So be sincere, convince me with a "pretty please"

Laugh, laugh, I thought I'd die
It seemed so funny to me
Laugh, laugh you met a guy who taught you how it feels to be
Lonely, oh so lonely
