Did you ever get the feeling
that the truth is less revealing
than a downright lie?
And did you think your head was hip
to certain things it's not equipped
to qualify?

All day long the sky is blue
and everyone says "how do you do"
in Shangri-La
Every day's a perfect day
and you can go your own sweet way
in Shangri-La

In Shangri-La...
In Shangri-La...
You can be whoever you are
In Shangri-La

Investment with a good return
provides the means through which we earn
our daily bread
...
