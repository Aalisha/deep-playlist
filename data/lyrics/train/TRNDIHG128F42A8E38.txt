Hey I know your game
I know you need me
Say isn? t it great
I? m always here
I, as in I
As in the one in front of you
I, I never lie
I? ll make sure that you? re alright

Goldrush
Everyone wants some of that stuff
It? s the cure but you can? t get enough
Go on have another
I think you? ll discover
You may never recover

Who can you trust
I? m always watching
I? m the one you love
The one you can? t get rid of
We, like you and me
It? s you and me
Please, you? ll never leave
What would you do without me

Goldrush
