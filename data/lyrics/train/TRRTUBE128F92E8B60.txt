I'm caught in a moment out in the rain
Tell me there's something we can say
Help me to find a light, something that's worth living

She's walking the back beat out in the grave
Tell me there's something we can change
Help me to find my way back down

'Cause Annie's got to get out before she never can
We're chasing for the ceiling, I'm grabbing for her hand
We're calling on a thin phone line tonight
'Cause Annie's got to get out
