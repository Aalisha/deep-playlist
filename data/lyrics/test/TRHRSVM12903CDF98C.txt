Drinking and dancing and female nudity
Dancing round the bonfire as they weave their witchery
Disembrained bodies coming back from the dead
Disembowelled hands take the brains from your head
Because once you look into their eyes
You'll see their faces is full of worms
A heap of guts in clever disguise
Their aim to make you zombified
...
