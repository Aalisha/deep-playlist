I can't believe that your wasting your time
Thought you could find your way back
You heard my story but heard it all wrong
Nothing...

Well it's just so little
That I can see through you
We know it will end
This distance is secret
It's seeping out my skin yeah

I was over it before
But you brought me back to where I began
And I'm starting well again
And I remain here until the end

I can't believe that your wasting my time
...
