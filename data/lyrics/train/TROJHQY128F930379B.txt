I don't believe in miracles
I know what's real I don't pretend
I don't believe in miracles
or stories with a happy end -
life is no one's friend

but when we met I felt so free
and suddenly I felt a change come over me
do you suppose a miracle is happening to me

I don't believe in miracles
I've been around i've seen enough
...
