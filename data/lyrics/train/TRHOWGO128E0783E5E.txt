Lock the door and stop complaining
Gather 'round and listen well
From now on we're entertaining
How to hotten up this hell.

Hold the mood and hold the chatter
Skip the food and stop the clatter
Can't you hear that pitter-patter?
We're not here to eat.
We came for the heat!

Let's raise the roof
Let's make a scene
Let's hop the gods of love
Will shine above
And show the way.
Let's call the shots
Let's roll the dice
Take my advice
It always pays
To raise the roof!

Crush the ice and shake forever
...
