With every breath
I breath you in and out
With every touch
I fall to deep in love
With every look
I lose a piece of my heart
Yet I don't know who you are
A strangers kiss is not a risk worth taking
But I'd kiss you for sure anyway
Why don't you steal this smile?
But swear you won't leave me alone
Or I would sink like a stone

Silently you slip in
And totally change everything
Suddenly I hear you breathing
And now I am sinking like a stone

With every word
You spell out destiny
My world just spins
Into a crazy dream
