Been a whole lot easier since the bitch left town
It's been a whole lot happier without her face around
Nobody upstairs gonna stomp and shout
Nobody at the back door gonna throw my laundry out

She hold the shotgun while you do-si-do
She want one man made of Hercules and Cyrano
Been a whole lot easier since the bitch is gone
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong

Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
Ain't nobody gonna bow no more when you sound your gong
Little Miss, Little Miss, Little Miss Can't Be Wrong
What'cha gonna do to get into another one of these rock 'n' roll songs?

Other peoples thoughts they ain't your hand-me-downs
Would it be so bad to simply turn around
