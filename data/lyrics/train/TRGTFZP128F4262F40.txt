We've been lovers
For a very long time
Been friends much longer than that
But due to circumstances beyond our control
We had to hide the very thing we know is fact

Now the rumor has it, we're messin' around
People seein' us together all the time
Things you say to your friends 'bout me
Things I say 'bout you
It becomes obvious and such a clear sign

So baby
Why don't we just stop playin' the masquerade?
