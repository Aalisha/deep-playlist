Open up your mind now
And let the restless winds blow
Now is the time man
Let your feelings show

Moonlight lovin'
The stars will never tell
Of the rendezvous of me and you and you
Moonlight lovin'
It's not a wishing well
But all of your fantasies come true
Mènage á Trois, Mènage á Trois, Mènage á Trois

It's time to discover
Love's generosity
Uninhibited lover
Like one two three
