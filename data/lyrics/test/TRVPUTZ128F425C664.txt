Step up it's time to face
Punishment from a different age
Are you witch or heretic
Wandering lost convicts

Take a look you'll see
It's much bigger than you or me
Future sadomasochism
Leather whips and hardcore rhythm
Make you fear make you tear
Memories that scar for years
Drain your brain of guilt and regret
What's your last request

Endless pain
