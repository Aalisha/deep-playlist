The time is 8: 09
I'm running to the line
The one that takes me down
Down to Chinatown...

There's shouting in the streets
A pattering of feet
Intrigue is everywhere
Total chaos...

Chinese restaurant
We're meeting here tonight,
We 'll say goodbye
For one more time
Chinese restaurant
Keep breaking up and mending
Seems to be the pattern of your love...
