It's under control but the sun and the moon
Have been after each other from night until noon
Chasin' around like a couple of fools
In a race of the clouds like a bloody cartoon
I hope I find my way home someday soon

Comfortable creatures and wonderless moves
Have been tirelessly learning their lines and their rules
turnin around in their colorful shoes
and surprising themselves with their wonderful moods
You know I would do anything for you
I hope I find my way home someday soon
...
