I cannot follow you, my love
You cannot follow me
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be

You know who I am
You've stared at the sun
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one

Sometimes I need you naked
Sometimes I need you wild
I need you to carry my children in
...
