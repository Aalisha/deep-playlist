(All through the lonely day, I pray with all my might
And then once more I say, maybe, maybe tonight)

Tonight could be the night when you kiss and hold me

Chorus
Oh maybe tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Maybe tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Maybe tonight (maybe maybe, maybe tonight)
Maybe tonight (maybe baby, maybe baby)

Tonight could be the night when you say things you never told me
