I asked why I was there
And my answer came in two
You are a victim of a predator
And this time he'll get his due

The pressure, it swelled in my brain
There was nothing I could do
I was just as much a prisoner
Now another would be too

And the truth is what we've told you
Don't answer, don't speak until we've spoke
Keep your neck under the yoke
