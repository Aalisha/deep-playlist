The day you died, was the day I cried
All alone on that hill with all of my friends by my side
That's the fucking world and the way that it works
Everything I loved, eight feet in the dirt

I've been here before, and I'll be here again
God took you away and I buried my friend
My heart feels empty and my blood runs cold
Your life came to a halt and you slipped in the ground
...
