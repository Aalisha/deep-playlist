come on now you sinners and angels without wings
the dance of the fools is about to begin
why should you fear what cannot be avoided
it is time to dance your lives away
it's the losers ballet
the mission is set - let it be done

put on your dancing shoes before you enter the heat of the ballroom
enjoy the masses coming to see you perform
while you dance in the fire of your world going down
and you will dance like the maggots in your flesh
