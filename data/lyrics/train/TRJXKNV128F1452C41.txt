Do you remember when men wore skirts? - so hip!
In kipper ties like jealous flirts - so hip!
In calico and in brocade shirts - so hip it hurts!
Do you remember when girls wore slacks? - so hip!
Traffic stops, men get heart attacks - so hip!
Seems so strange that they took it like that - so hip it hurts!
He's so hip - so hip it...
She's so hip - so hip it...
They're so hip - so hip it hurts!
