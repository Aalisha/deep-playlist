There I was
Sitting on the top of the world
In a coin laundry
Well I could have been royalty
Sitting in the palace like a queen

Do you have a dollar?
Do you have a dollar for me?
Have you got a house on a hill
And a bed for three?

Oh do you have a story
Do you have a story for me?
Do you know the one where
We'll all live happily

Do you, do you
Do you, do you
...
