It’s sad and it hurts.
The deeper it is, the harder it gets to gently say bye
It’s sad and it hurts.
The deeper it is, the harder it gets to gently say bye

Will we ever meet again, will we ever?
Feel our hearts hardly beating, will they ever?
Stop beating, break apart, will we ever?
Lose all our hope, hope to get lost - want to fade
