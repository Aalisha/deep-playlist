When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrow's like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot you have taught me to say
It is well It is well with my soul

Though the devil will ruin, the trials may come
Let this blessed assurance control
That Christ has regarded my help less estate
And He shed His own blood for my soul

It is well, with my soul
