I promise me, I wouldn't cry
When the time came girl too say goodbye
I always knew that one day we would part
I always knew that you would break my heart

But that was a chance I had to take
And even though I knew that it would cause me pain
Just one look and I lost my way
And if you ask to do the same again

Standing in the shadows of love
Waiting for the heartache to come
In the shadows of love

Some things in life are too good to resist
...
