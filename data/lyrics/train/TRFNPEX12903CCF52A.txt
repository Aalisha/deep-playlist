Strapped in the mercy seat in Kansas City
She's ringing hell bells from Seattle to Philly
Got an Indiana heart with a lone star state of mind
Black Tooths any worries lines 'em up knocks 'em all back

Well the bad times ain't so mean
When she's sippin gasoline
Raise 'em up, lets fire it up

Tonight is what we make it
You give it up I'll take it
Girl be my heroin
