Yo, I'm a, I'm a crazy fresh, crazy fresh,
crazy silly fresh DJ. Bam! Cradle rock style!

Yo

Now sit right back as I bust a rhyme
I've got the freshest beats and I'm always on time
I'm the baddest of the best, yeah,
I'm the king, word

Master of beats, and the cross-fader
I'll cut off your hand just like Darth Vader
You Step to me,
And you're gonna get dissed, homeboy

Come into my crib,
Maybe we could chill
I might cap somebody,
Or kick 'em in the grill

I'm the DJ, he's the rapper
And the homeboys try to stand
I'm the DJ, he's the rapper
In the Valley of the Shadow of Def
