Don t you blame me
For wanting you
Don t you blame me
For wanting you
Baby you just don t know
How I like when you are near
You just don t let me show
That my feelings are sincere
Thought you don t notice me
I m so much in love with you
Darling you re just too much
I like the way you do what you do
Yeaheayeaheayeah
Don t you blame me
For wanting you
Don t you blame me
