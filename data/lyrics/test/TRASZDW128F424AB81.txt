Carrier of my charging minions
You should stand by my side
You've proven yourself worthy at many occasions
Holding hard on my line

You betrayed me when I needed you the most
Never have I ever let you down
Forcing me to face this shameful scene alone
Pathetic little useless worm

How dare you to defy my orders?
Hold the lines and advance
