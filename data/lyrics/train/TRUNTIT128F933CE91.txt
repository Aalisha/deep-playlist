This is my last chance to ask for permission
This condition can't be fixed with a prescription
And don't you love the way it tastes?
Humiliation
And don't you know control requires my submission

So now you're just in time to
Throw out my automatic world
Takes non-believers and turns tables around

So now the walls you built, I'll take down your automatic world
Makes running easy and turns tables around

This is your last chance to make a confession
