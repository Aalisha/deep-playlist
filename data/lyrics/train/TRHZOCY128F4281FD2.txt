I live on a chain
you, share the same last name
as a joke
i sent a bottle of whiskey
as you choked i knew
it made you feel dirty
I was waiting over here
for life to begin
i was looking for the new thing
and you were the sunshine
heading my frontline
i was alone
you were just around the corner from me
Time alone is good
i spend my days in the city
dirty neighborhood
you know you'll never convince me
...
