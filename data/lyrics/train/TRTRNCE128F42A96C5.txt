Everybody in this place get up and move away
For all I care this towns already dead and empty
Im told that Im the victim of obsession thats what my friends say
Oh Im a fool for having ever let her tempt me

-Chorus-
Well I turn pale when she walks by
I am lost in her eyes
She is always on my mind x2
