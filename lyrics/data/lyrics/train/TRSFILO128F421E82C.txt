The Breakup Song
The Greg Kihn Band

We had broken up for good just an hour before,
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing 'cross the floor.
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
And then the band slowed the tempo, and the music gets you down.
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.
It was the same old song, with a melancholy sound.
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah.

They don't write 'em like that anymore.
