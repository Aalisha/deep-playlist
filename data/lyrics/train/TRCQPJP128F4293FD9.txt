Girl, it's all over
This time, it's all over
I swear, it's all over
On my name yes, it's all over
Believe, it's all over
That baby, it's all over now
It's all over, this time

Thought I was made for you
And you believed in me
I thought this was
How love was meant to be
Didn't know it
But you were foolin' me around, oh

You had a hold on me
I was to blind to see
Could have been yours for eternity
Didn't see it
'til it was all up in my face
No no

Do you recall?
The times that we shared
Moment alone and your promises
But now the days are gone
Now you're on your own
Tonight, never again 'cos

Girl, it's all over
This time, it's all over
I swear, it's all over
On my name yes, it's all over
...
