Summer comes and rain falls away
But the very next day it seems
The snow comes to stay

And you too will go just like the dog days do
I'll put on my hat, my gloves, my scarf
To keep the cold apart

But there are no hats, gloves, scarves for the heart
Just a cold wind that leaves its frosted mark

Don't forget that I will always love you
...
