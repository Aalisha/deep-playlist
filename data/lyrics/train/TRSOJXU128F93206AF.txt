It hangs on a wall, museum hall
As it calls to passers by
A picture so bright, seen without light
And nobody wonders why

A tired old man stares at the wall
Said, "The color's blindin' me"
How can he see anything at all
Since he's got no eyes to see

It's not too faded
I still see that color comin' through
It's not too jaded
The more you look, the more you see

Years ticked away, colors turned gray
...
