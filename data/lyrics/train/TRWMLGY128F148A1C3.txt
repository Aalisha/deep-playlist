I'm not seein it, baby
I gotta hear what you say, say it
Come on, say it, come on
You got me walking right on broken glass
And when I start to bleed
Is when you start to feed

Leakin through to the basement of my soul
I've been on fire before, but I never felt so cold

Standin on the edge (shooting you down)
And I'm lookin down (shooting you down)
And I try my hardest just to shoot you down
...
