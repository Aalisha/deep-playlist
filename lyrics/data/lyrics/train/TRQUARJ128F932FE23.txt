Gunman, bloodshot eyes
Gunman, grain of sand
Sisters could not sleep
Father is a holy ghost
And there's lions in a cage

It don't matter don't try to explain
You're just another dog to be trained
Choke chained
You gonna end up under tooth and nail
If you catch a tiger by the tail
Don't fail

Brother does not dream anymore
Sisters could not sleep

Transformation incomplete
Mercy killing, those counting sheep
...
