Selecta, yes mann.
I like the way you push up on me (3x)
Selecta.

Oh my Selecta's got the spot on fire
Spinning all the joints that make me wanna wind
Yes me ready, show ya how me mash it one time

It's about to get dangerous
The rhythm got cha girl right here open
So island man can you handle this?
Gimme a little taste of what you gonna do
Boy, I wanna feel your move
Grind it up
Let me feel the truth
Work me up slow and drop it down low and break me off

Don't know what I do without cha baby
Can't afford to leave from this club without your name
And number up on this card, so call me
Twirk it, I like the way you push up on me

Don't know what I do without cha baby
Can't afford to leave from this club without your name
And number up on this card, so call me
Twirk it, I like the way you push up on me

Don't know what I do without cha baby
Can't afford to leave from this club without your name
And number up on this card, so call me
Come here boy and push up on me

Ohh wee
(You look so right its kinda) scary
(Ya whole get up, you swagger) daddy
