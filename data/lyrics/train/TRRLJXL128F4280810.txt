Stay away from me - 4x

[Trae]
Guerilla Maab, coming up out the gates
It'd be best, to go and get out the way
Running around, with a K and don't play
All about Dougie D, Z-Ro and Trae
See we don't know, what the fuck you say
If I get agg'd, better move around cause I'm gonna spray
Starting from my own letter zone
Not too many people can relate
Didn't wanna say that I'm wrong
Cause I'm walking around, with a frown on my face
I know, you wanna hate me
But if you don't know, you better reach back to G

[Hook - 2x]
Stay away from me
You niggaz, oughtta know
Stay away from me
My pain, won't let me go
Stay away from me
It feels, like I'm going insane
Stay away from me
The streets, keep calling on me

[Trae]
I might as well recommend, you leave me the fuck alone
Before I get pissed off in the zone, running with chrome
