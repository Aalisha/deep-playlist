I was looking at you
You were looking at me
It was easy to see
That it was one of your lies
Is it working for you?
Cause it's working for me
Let's count to three
No it's not hard to disguise
Was it part of the plan?
Taking me by the hand
Being one of the damned
On this merry-go-round
It's not hard to explain
Don't hide your shame
Just play the game
