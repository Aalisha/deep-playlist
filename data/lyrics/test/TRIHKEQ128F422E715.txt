An empty stare, a stupid grin
Sweating palms and cold within
Delete past calculations, adapt to a brand new breed
Sudden movements, the smell of caffeine
Won't ever see me turning the other cheek, tooth for a tooth, I want more than you lies
Won't ever see me walking away, not forgiving, I won't admit that I'm wrong
Can't rid the disease, a need of release, the source will pull you under
