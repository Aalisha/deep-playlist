Fall into the sea
Arms spread, wide into the airborne breeze

Away
Fall away

The creatures I might meet
They wonder how a man makes such a feat
But I wonder
How long I can last if I don't breathe

The world is blue
But it's such a shade that makes you think
It's new to you
A color never seen

I swim into the deep
Beyond the cliffs and coral reef

The rippled silhouettes
Of ships passing overhead
The rays of the sunlight
Fighting for their lives

The silence never told
...
