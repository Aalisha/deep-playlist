When your life is tossed and scorned
And the hope you have is gone
Don't give up on Jesus

When you've tried everything you know
And you're looking for a place to go
Don't give up on Jesus

When you've gone past your limit
And you can't take it another minute
Don't give up on Jesus

When this world spins round and round
