Potpourri of uselessness.
Sit with much pain as I watch a summer go by
with the boredom of watching paint dry.
Why this time? Gone away. Nothing good can ever stay.
Basic freedom, cigarettes and free pornography.
It always takes so much longer to find out what you want, not to get it.
Of course I don't know the latter or how to do the first.
Once I occupy myself I'll end the hurt.
And the flame dies out again.
