Run, run, run all you do is fucking run,
But you'll never run away from yourself.
I know it's hard but you've been there before,
and you know you're gonna be there again.
I don't care what the stars may say
because they always feed their bullshit to me.
It's kinda sad how you lost what you had,
and you're never gonna have it again,

And so I said:
"Hey Sergio, you've got to get us out of here "
And so I said:
"Hey Sergio, it's getting kind of hot in here"
And so I said:
"Hey"

Every other day you don't care what they say
because they always leave you two steps behind.
