So Now I Know Better
Than To Leave You All Alone
Cause Days Like These Babe
I Won't Make It On My Own.
Lonely Nights, All This Endless Heartache
Cause Here And Right Now
It's My Life That I Forsake

I Know I Spent The Past
Just Waiting For Your Call
This Thing We Had Will Last
My Back's Against The Wall
