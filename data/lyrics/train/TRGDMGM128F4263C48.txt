This is my story, I was a girl who came from nothing
And life in my surroundings was bad, yeah
But deep inside me, I would pray for God to guide me
'Cause I knew he'd give me strength for life
And all its problems back then

Living wasn't easy 'cause we didn't have much money
But I knew I would make it someday
They told me I was nothing, that I'll never be something
But I knew I would make it someday

Hey, hand me down clothing, empty shelves inside the cupboard
And mama kept three jobs to make do, yeah, yeah
I'd hear her cryin' but she never stopped believing
Three girls, light bills and the rent y'all
'Cause livin' wasn't easy back then, hey
