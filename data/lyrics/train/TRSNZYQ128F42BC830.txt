He picked her up some flowers
On a sunday afternoon
They sat out on the porch swing
Underneath the cresent moon

A life timeseemed to pass
Staring at the skies
And on the swing he gave her the ring
There were tears in her eyes

He said I pray I'm not alone
In my dreams about forever
That you and I could become one
And always be together

We'd grow old and wise
Through all the days
For worse or for better
...
