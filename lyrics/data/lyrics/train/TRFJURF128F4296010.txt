I walked the miles
Down the road that took me here to you
I travelled down those everlasting highways
You lit the candle to start this love anew
Just couldn't wait, life was a desert
Without the cure, without your love, so blue
Can't wait to see your face again
Only you can stop the pain
Girl my love has never been so true
