Hey Mike, I wish I could help you figure something out
But it's been too long since we spoke
Your sarcasm radiates unhappiness
So withdrawn and rooted deep inside

Are you content at 27?
Were you hopeful at 17?
A void the size of oceans stretches out between us
I guess our blood is supposed to be a bridge

Can you pull yourself up
From this self hatred?
Can you pull yourself up?
Frustration's driven you to angry dreams

Let Nebraska disappear in golden flames of grain
...
