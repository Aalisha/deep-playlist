When you can wear what you feel
What do you wanna say?
Now love is a little number that you can wear each day
As long as you let me be the accessory
Simply send me on my way
'Cause I love love
I look good in love

When it's been out of sight and out of mind for such a long time
That's how one forgets
So I reached in the back of my closet, pulled it out
And tried it on and it still fits

Some cover their pain up with lots of MAC make-up
...
