Beat is getting stronger, feel it getting stronger
Sound is getting longer too
Music is a thought to me
I want to, I want to

I wanna take you higher
 (Take you higher)
I wanna take you higher
 (Take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire
 (Light my fire)
I wanna take you higher
 (Take you higher)

Beat is nitty gritty, feel it nitty gritty
Sound is in your city too
Music's been a thought to me
Don't you, don't you, don't, don't

Don't you wanna get higher?
 (Take you higher)
Don't you wanna get higher?
 (Take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire
 (Light my fire)
I wanna take you higher
 (Take you higher)

Boom shaka-laka-laka
...
