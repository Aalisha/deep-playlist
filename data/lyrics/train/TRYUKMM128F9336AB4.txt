Riverside (Lets go!)

Me plus you, that equals better equations
We must do, subtraction of your clothes
Me and you, got a date tonight
I'm gonna be so straight tonight
These chicks wanna come take me right

So walked in the club looking so fresh
Chicks on set, drinks on deck
Hickeys on my neck, but they donâ€™t care
Got they hands up
Put put em in the air
Spot this fly chick, ask her name
God damn girl you got ass for days
Took to my crib we can catch a train
Ain't got no whip cause my cash ain't straight

Walked to the club, forgot my swag
But its okay, I got a chick to bang
Prim tuck low, passed this side
Haters on the wall, looking all night
Jack the club, no jack and coke
