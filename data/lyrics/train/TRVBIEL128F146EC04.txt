You don't need, to hang around
You don't need, to talk right now

Gotta feel it, same mistake
Gotta feel it, its gonna break

Some days, some times just don't feel right
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Too hard too touch
Its getting too much
You know its just a state of mind
Driving you wild
You turn up inside
You know its just a state of mind
(A state of mind)
