Woke up with a start, your voice in my head last night
Now I can't remember a single word
Images come back flashing like a broken light
Everything has gotten a little blurred

Snapped another thread, burned another bridge last night
How come I can act like such a fool?
I'm chasing it around, feels like an addiction
Guess I'll disregard it, make it disappear

Everything we said is messing with my head
I'm hanging by a thread and it's waning
