"My friend" come to the end,
fuck off I'm sick of your words
and the way you shout loud
"I'm proud, I'm proud"
proud to be a German and proud to be white
but your eyes aren't blue,
what a shame, oh look at you
alone a piece of shit, but strong in a crowd
then you loose your cowardice
and another black girl cries

God damn your kind
