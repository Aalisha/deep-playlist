This is your lifetime
no matter what time of life

there's wonder in the air if you stop to care.
Look at heaven
it's kissing clouds

Everybody's living
everybody's proud.

Sweet dreams tonight and forever

secret lives we live together

feel warm inside
this is your time

peace
harmony and love divine.
