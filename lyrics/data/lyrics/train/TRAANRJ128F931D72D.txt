I know a ghost
And when doubted his truth reveals incredible vengeance.
Vanity is a sepulcher.

Do as you please, shame will follow.
Do as you please and shame will follow.
Languages rot and insects lose interest
Mountains of plastic; melting away

As long as these struggles are aimless
We will all be standing still, standing still.
When worded correctly, truth is never a cliche
