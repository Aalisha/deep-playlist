I close my eyes, and say goodbye to the day
And I'm feeling older, but I've missed it all somehow
And I begin to wonder if we've forgotten all about
Why are we here and what we should know
These things that we fear are only the unknown

And I'm looking to the son and I'm asking if he knows
Of wonderful places where everyone's supposed to go?
And the seams have come undone, scattered pieces of my soul
Now the pressure is taking it's toll

Changing reasons - Changing through time
Won't come between us
And it's changing our lives

And the winter's colder
...
