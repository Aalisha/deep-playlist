Ah ah ah ah
Okey

It's so confusing
You sure been messing with my mind
Eh eh eh eh yeah
You cut me loose and
Suddenly we're doing fine
I'm not a perfect little girl
But I should get what I deserve
And I refuse to be your mother
So tell me

I really gotta know
This ain't no one man show
To in my life
You come and you go
Ain't happy about it
So I gotta know
What's in it

(What's in it)
(What's in it)
Yeay!
(What's in it)
(What's in it)
Aaooo!

Please understand me
Your games ain't working anymore
