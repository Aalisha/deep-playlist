well I've been a public figure for quite a long time
known to the whole world for what (my style of rhyme)
but tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
although they know they won't (never get it right)
because they have no (class) and they have no (shame)
they'll bite another brother to boost their own (name)
get paid correct on a one way gimmick
I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say

teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the master will be
the creator of the style (Ricky D)
teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
it looks so easy like there was nothing to it
but they don't understand that the master will be
the creator of the style (Ricky D)

when I walk into a party cokesnorters laugh
as the girls be crazy coming for my mere autograph
and it seems that they aspiring my new style of rappin'
and brothers all around me out of vanity are snappin'
the girls say 'wow Rick you're so unique
please tell us how you organize the words you speak'
but my will says chill and I go upon my way
'cause class will be taught some other day - so say
