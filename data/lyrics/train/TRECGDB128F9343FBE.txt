There's war in the headlines, war in the heads
Of the leaders who feed us til we're overfed
We're not hungry anymore for your diet of war
Malnutrition for the global poor
The people stood in breadlines
Are still paying for the landmines
Are being cursed for nothing worse
Than living on the pipeline

One war ends and the next one starts
The oil pipe dream leading straight to the heart
Of capitalism and market chains
That supply the demand to feel less pain
But the pacification is wearing thin
Global domination has its cost
