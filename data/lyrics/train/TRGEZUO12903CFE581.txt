You gotta answer to yourself
You can't depend on anyone else
You gotta know where you stand
And what's in your hands
Yeah, you gotta answer to yourself

You gotta write down what you know
You gotta make sure that it's known
Because they're coming along to see what you've done
And they're gonna claim it for their own

You got a rabbit in your hat
You got a few tricks up your sleeve
Don't get stuck in a rut
