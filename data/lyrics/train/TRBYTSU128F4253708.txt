Armoured horses gloves of steel
Silverblades... time to reveal
We're the tyrants that guard the land
Proud upon our gilded thrones
Servants of... our great ancestors
Who guarded the gates... to infinity
Once kings of shadows
On these blackened fields
All might and domination
Ruled the realm of the above
