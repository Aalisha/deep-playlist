I was perched outside in the pourin' rain.
Trying to make myself a sail.
Then I'll float to you, my darlin'
With the evening on my tail
Although not the most honest means of travel
It gets me there nonetheless
I'm a heartless man at worst, babe
And a helpless one at best
Darling, I'll bathe your skin, I'll even wash your clothes
Just give me some candy before I go
Oh darling, I'll kiss your eyes and lay you down on your rug
Just give me some candy after my hug
Oh, and I'm often false explaining
But to her it plays out all the same
And although I'm left defeated
It gets held against my name
