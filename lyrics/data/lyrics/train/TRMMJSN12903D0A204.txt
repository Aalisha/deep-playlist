More and more, growing and growing
Spreading and spreading, taking and ruining
The cancer is growing, the cancer is spreading

Purge the world, remove them all
Purge the world, remove them all
Reaching out further, absorbing the earth
Ever expanding, never stop breeding
No room to move, no room to breath
...
