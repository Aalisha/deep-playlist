Alright! Jump up! Get it! Hey!
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with the blue dress on, ooh yeah
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress
Devil with the blue dress on

Fee, fee, fi, fi, fo-fo, fum
Look at Molly now, here she comes
Wearin' her wig, hat and shades to match
She's got high-heel shoes and an alligator hat

Wearin' her pearls and her diamond rings
She's got bracelets on her fingers now and everything
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
She's the Devil with the blue dress on, oh, have mercy

Devil with the blue dress, blue dress on
Devil with the blue dress on, hey

Wearin' her perfume, Chanel No. 5
Got to be the finest girl alive
She walks real cool, catches everybody's eye
She's got such good lovin' that they can't say goodbye

Not too skinny, she's not too fat
