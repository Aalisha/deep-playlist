I want to hurt you and don't know why,
Though I know it's not like me
I cannot help it,
Though I try to keep you away

And all this time I thought I knew who you were
But this time all your words were just lies for demise
And your thoughts were found unpure
So when push comes to shove I found reasons
To not work it out or relate
And get off on the fear that I give when you're near
And the problems that I create

This time, I think you'll finally see
This time, I will not break
This time, I'm smart enough to know
There is only so much I'll take (this time)

This time, I'm gonna make a change (this time)
This time, you're in my way (this time)
