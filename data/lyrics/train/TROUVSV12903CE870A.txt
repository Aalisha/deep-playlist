I fall asleep at night with the TV on
Subliminal message, manipulation
It's hard to catch what goes on inside
When you're too busy swallowing your pride

Sick of waiting for the chance to come
I'm pretty sure you're not the only one
I'm not gonna do just what you tell me to do
I guess you think that I'm afraid of you
I'm not gonna be just what you tell me to be
Now I think you're totally afraid of me
