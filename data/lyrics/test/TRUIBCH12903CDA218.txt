People living in the dark
State protecting life then tear it apart
Cause commotion cause a scene cracking skull expanding seam
Every time there is a choice it's tear it apart

Fall high
Don't ever touch the ground
Know no wars are ever won
When they can't kill me then know that it's safe
To come back, come back, come back
Exploding head
