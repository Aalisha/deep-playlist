They can't see your heart.
They don't care to see who you are.
They're just a pack of wolves.
Don't let them break you down, don't let them break you down.

You are the starlight that sparks up the whole night.
Just let their voices fade out and stand in the spotlight.
Take a bow.

Everybody's lost.
Most people think they're not.
But I'm not losing you now.
