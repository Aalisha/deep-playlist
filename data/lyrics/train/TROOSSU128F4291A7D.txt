Goodnight Rose
We're going to win
Put your troubles behind you
And go on to bed

Let go of the worry
There's so much nobody understands
Don't live your life in such a hurry
Life goes by us all so fast

And the sun will come up again
And I will be here
If you get scared just hold my hand
Tomorrow is yours and who knows
...
