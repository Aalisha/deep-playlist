Baby I was nothin’
Just a music man
Didn’t even know what I was trying to say
Life can be so funky
For the crazy music man
Got no peaceful state of mind where he can stay

Then I fell into your arms girl
I’m ridin’ high
I’m ridin’ high
I’m ridin’ high – I do believe

Nights can be so lonely
When you’re talking with your mind
No-one there to hide you from the bitter truth
