(Intro: Killah Priest (Tragedy Khadafi))
Yeah, knawhatimean, it's coming down like, that man
(What we gon' do, now, man)
Sorry to break up the radio, for a minute
(What the fuck we gon' do now, they hear now)
But it's gotta come down, it's gotta be real
We gotta come through to the heart (they back now)
And I wanna talk to the hoods right now
If you a thug and you real, muthafuckin' speak
(What the fuck ya'll gonna do now muthafuckas)

(Tragedy Khadafi)
I'm like Osama Hussein, hotter than the whole
Population control, I'm seein' soldiers fold
As I release the scroll, I spit perpendicular
Walkin' barefoot across peninsulas, freein' slaves and prisoners
Black Market Militia is revolution, the mission is
Free the minds of our listeners, resurrected with militance
We ain't beggin' politicians for nothing
Government funded, comin' gunnin' and stunnin', seein' the D's running
God bless us, Supreme Team, extreme measures
Max under mattress, C-4 in the dressers
The D's who wanna test us, and feds wanna arrest us
Fuck professers and their lectures, I'm talkin' to ancestors
True story, give the glory to God, receive the blessings
Made in an image, of his likeness, my true essence

(William Cooper)
