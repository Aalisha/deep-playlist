Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday

Happy, happy birthday in a hot bath
To those nice nice nights
I remember always, always
I got such a fright

Seeing them in my dark cupboard
With my great big cake

If they were me
If they were me
And I was you
And I was you
...
