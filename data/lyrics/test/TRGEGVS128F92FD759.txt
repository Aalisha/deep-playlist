Your lipstick
Smeared beside
I adore you
I always have
And everytime you overdose
I rush to intensive care
Another said I stare
Before you disappear

If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it me baby
If this is the last dance, this is the last dance
Then, save it me baby

Ooh, ooh
Then save it for me baby
Ooh, ooh
Then, save it me baby
