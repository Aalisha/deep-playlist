From my soul
I dispose the weak
Enslave, all kings left dethroned
I pronounce
My oath in Blood

Withdrawn from my veins I spill
An existence defined
By the paths I saturate

Laws you impose
Get overruled
Irrelevant ways of the fools
Sentenced before higher courts
I'm self detained,
In ways you judge not

Detours denied,
...
