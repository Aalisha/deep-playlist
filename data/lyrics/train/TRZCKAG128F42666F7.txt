(Michael Dulaney / Jason Sellers

Tired of channel surfing
El Camino ain't working
It's Monday night and I'm hurtin' for company
Bummed a ride to the hideaway
I'm the only guy in the place
Bored silly wasn't gonna stay
Then she walked in, heaven sent
And it occurs to me.

Chorus:
What a good night to be lonely
Somebody's looking out for me
Oh, what an opportunity
Right out of the blue
Is it luck or a twist of fate
Doesn't really matter, either way
...
