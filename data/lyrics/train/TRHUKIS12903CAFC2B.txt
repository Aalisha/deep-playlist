This time
I know it's gonna be for real
This time
I know it's gonna be for real

Full stand still
I miss the chemistry of your kiss

This time
I know it's gonna be for real
Full stand still

This time
I know it's gonna be for real
Full stand still
I miss the chemistry of your kiss

This time
I know it's gonna be for real

Full stand still
Alone
And it's for real

Oh full stand still
Alone
And it's for real
