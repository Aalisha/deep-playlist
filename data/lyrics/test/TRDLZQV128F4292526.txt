[featuring ish]
Ish:
Don't give me your swing

I got mines and that's the thing
Blahzay blahzay blahzay who name bell rings
Geechie:
Don't give me your swing
I got mine and that's the thing
Blahzay blahzay blahzay who names bell ring
Verse one: geechie suede
Now for the grab the stash(?)
To the alley varner(?) any splash
Tryin not to crash
Swervin got the la la on the dash
Getting bent up in the armored truck
Stuck him for his glam
Shit is candy yams
Now we movin on the ancient mans(?)
They using psycho vision
For the valentino gorabani(?)
Fuck armani butter
We above these climbs
Hiest the harbours
Word to godfathers getting bleed
Chasing on (?) down to venice
Tellin sire bout my alley runnin ways
