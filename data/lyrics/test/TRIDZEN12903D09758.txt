Flo Rida
Alexandra girl I know what you like
(Bad boys, bad boys...)

Oh, oh
Hey, yeah

Some people call them players
But I'm far from terrified
'Cause somehow I'm drawn to danger
And have been all of my life
It feels my heart's divided
Halfway between wrong and right
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't mind

Yeah the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh way, ooh wah)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh way, ooh wah)
