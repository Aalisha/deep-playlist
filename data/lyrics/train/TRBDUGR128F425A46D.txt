You've got clueless commentators
Telling folks to stay inside
You've got light investigators
Pulling shades and terrified
You've got powers of the darkness
Blowing smoke to dim the skies
Your psychics look a little anxious
Anybody out there wonder why?

I've got a bottle rocket
I've got a bottle rocket
I've got a bottle rocket
Got a little light to testify
No power's gonna block it
No darkness gonna stop it
I've got a bottle rocket
Gonna let it fly
