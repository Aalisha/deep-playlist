We've got to fight just to find something to talk about
It ain't right that we're got nothing to say
I always thought I could run
Now I'm under the gun
And I fight just to find something to say

It used to be we could walk around in silence
You could see things were good
Now the pain of what ain't said
It's gone to my head
Cause anyone can see things ain't good
