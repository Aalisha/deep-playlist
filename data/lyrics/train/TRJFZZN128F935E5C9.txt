Good morning
You caught me starin at you again
While you sleepin
I promised God I'd your protection
And when you woke up and smiled at me
I jus knew that there was nobody better, no
The luckiest man on the planet is me
And I pray that we'll forever be...

On & on & on & on & on
I want us to go...
On & on & on & on & on

You bring out the painful sad in me
I'm a clown whenever your around
Oh, the tone of your voice
The frequency
I can't thing of a more pleasant sound
You got me thinkin bout you havin my babies
I'm changin from the inside, out
...
