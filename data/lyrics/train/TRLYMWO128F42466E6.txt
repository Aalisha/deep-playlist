Embraced in my dream, absurd as it may seem
You're slave under my illusion, the everdark of mine
Sodomize your shallow mind
Swirling images rise, constructed by my lies
In my shadows all your fear is true, it is all too real
Resurrect the toughts I steal

In my darkness, in which you're lost
Dreaming blindly, the line is crossed
Agitation, you're giving in
Submission, a life without sin

Crucificxion of your will, your conscious cruel demise
If you sin the beast inside arise, I sense it now, join me
