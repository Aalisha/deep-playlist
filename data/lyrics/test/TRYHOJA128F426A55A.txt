Won't do no good to hold no seance
What's gone is gone and you can't bring it back around
Won't do no good to hold no searchlight
You can't illuminate what time has anchored down

Oh, Honey (I've gone a-)
Oh, Honey (I've gone a-)
Oh, Honey (I've gone away)

Won't do no good to sing no love song
No sound could simulate the presence of a man
Won't do no good asking no questions
Your divination should acquaint You with the plan
