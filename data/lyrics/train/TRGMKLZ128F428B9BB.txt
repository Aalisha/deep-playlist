This comes as no surprise,
We're emptying our supplies 
We're only thinking about the 
Size of the pile of shit to buy 
Over and over we take what we want 
To take even if the bond with nature will break

And when I lay me down to sleep 
I wonder why I'm feeling fucking incomplete
and I must try to be the guy that defeats all the lies 
Wiser than the ones that I despise
So listen now

We're living in this world and we're killing it 
It's so absurd, and for dollar bills 
We keep on drilling it, until we're mentally ill (ill)

A big burial site, no light in this endless night (endless night)
Please let me rewrite the story to get it right (get it right)
