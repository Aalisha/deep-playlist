Oh the sun is shining far too bright
For it to still be night
Oh the air feels so cold
So cold and old
How can it be light
Oh let's take a walk outside
See the world through each other's eyes
I wish I was your only one
I think you're beautiful but your hair is a mess
And your shoes are untied, but that's what I love best

And I, I wish I was the one
You lonely, lonely son
And you looked at me that way
I wish for long lingering glances
Fairytale romances every single day
And you look at me and say
I'm your best friend every day
But I wish for something, wish for something more
...
