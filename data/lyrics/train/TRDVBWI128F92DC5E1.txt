I was hangin' round Nashville writin' songs and playin' them for all of the stars
Watchin' them laugh and hand 'em back livin' on hope and Hershey bars
So I pawned my guitar and bought a ticket home
And I's a headin' for the trailway bus
When I seen an old fountain pen layin' in the gutter so I stopped and picked it up
It was worn out and bent and cast aside kinda sorta like myself
So I sat down on the curb and wrote a little song
That told the world how both of us felt
Then I run that song down the Music Row and before I had time to spit
It's pitched and sold and cut for a record
And movin' up the charts and damned it's a hit
So I wrote me another winner then I wrote me a smash again
And it's a flyin' off the ground cause I knew I found me a sure hit songrwiter pen
