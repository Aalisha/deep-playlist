You can hear, hear it comin'
Like a train out of control
Surely leaves you wonderin'
Exactly where your ticket goes
Scream at the conductor
He's been deaf for twenty years
Hear the other people laughin'
As he grinds through every gear

You go to grab your nerve, you find that its been missin'
Seems you've lost your faith in everyone you know
Well I surely hope that you don't plan on winnin'
Better start payin' more attention to the ones that throw you clear
You are seconds from the impact, but you're movin' way too slow

You say time will surely mold you
Into something you don't like
Now you're runnin' like a rabbit
Stick your finger in the dike

Look around your room you find the paint is peelin'
Your reflective skin is fallin' off your bones
Well, I must admit I know just how you're feelin'
...
