In the morning I raise my head
And I'm thinkin' of days gone by
And the thing I want out of life is

I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you

You can run, you can hide
But you never get away
You can lie and deny
But you know you're gonna pay

You never loved, you never thought you could
Treat you right, girl, you know I would
You can fight but tonight
...
