Lost from the start, I might as well be on the moon
Much colder than I thought even in the month of June
No communication makes you feel so alone
Well, all we need is patience of which I've never really known

But now it's too late, it's taking over me, it feels so supernatural
And I'm pulled the other way, it's more than I can take
And I'm losing hold of everything
And no matter how I try you know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural

Every step I've taken has led me here to where you are
