Putting all my power, righteous as a rose
Dynamite the mountain, now I'm walking up the road
Oh, love we made at gun point wasn't love at all
The dancing in the valley, and the moon's the mirror ball

Blew open my mind, now it's an empty room
Swinging in the hammock, dogs are walking 'cross the roof
I watch you braid your hair, you're from another time
When the earth wasn't so angry, and God was on our side

Searching West and East
And all points in between
Underneath the lines of thought
...
