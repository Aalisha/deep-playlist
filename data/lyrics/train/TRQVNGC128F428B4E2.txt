tonight I am so free
that my feet are in flower
I could sow a garden for you
but tonight you are so far away
and I don't know what to do
facing down this army of nows

tonight I am so restless
and the moon is coming down
in a gown of eyelets of blue
she says
"worry not about the future
you have plenty here to do
