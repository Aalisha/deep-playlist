Mystery surrounds me, and I wonder where I'm going
There's a cloud above me and it seems to hide the way
I'm going straight ahead, 'cos it's the only way I know
I wanna leave the past, and live just for today

Now then tell me baby, do you need my love?
Tell me baby, are you thinking of me?
Tell me baby, what it is you need?
What kind of satisfaction guaranteed?

Sitting in the gutter with my head wrapped in my hands
I've been drinking all night, and I just can't stand the pain
It took an awful lot of trouble just to make me understand
