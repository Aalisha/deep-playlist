[Altus/White]

The future is scarred by the bloodstained past 
Haunted by disgrace
Holy wars that are never ending 
Forever fight of faith
Don't accuse these meaningless symbols 
Created by mankind
Will they recognize their own creation? 
Can they be so blind?

Fools manipulating all they see 
Cruel as the world can be
Cries of pain as the tortured souls 
whither away into the dust
Power is the fix
And man is drawn to it 
The illness and the lies 
The virus never dies
...
