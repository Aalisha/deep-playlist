He will be there the unhallowed redeemer
The great accuser - The man of the future
Embraced by bitterness and cold compassion
The burning wonder... tears heaven apart
There is no salvation
The end is failing no need to remain
This stained procession of religious failure
Is the birth of tragedy
If there's no future... No bright tomorrow
The end is failing... No need to remain
Love was just another reason for hatred
...
