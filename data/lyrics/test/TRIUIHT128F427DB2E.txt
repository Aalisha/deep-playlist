Awaken the beast born of sin now it rage
The curse that we bring has been dormant for ages
Ripping an dtearing the flesh from its victims
Begging and pleading for god to forgive them
Immortal it crushes and pounds all its rivals
Nothing else matters except for survival
Crashing and thrashing the earth with a swiftness
Drop to your knees now and ask for forgiveness

Fire in the sky now you're dying embers
No one will survive this night
Now realize that you're dying embers
Earth purified by fire

Prophecy that was foretold now beginning
