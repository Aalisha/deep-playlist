Love is cast ornately
In your heart flame
Chakra wheels are turning
Like a love train

I could pray a hundred times
Keep these demons from my mind
Yeah, I could pray a thousand times
Stay in your lovin' arms entwined

Oh, that I should be ever so lonely
Drivin' the pain right through to my heart
Oh, that I should be ever so lonely
Ridin' the pain like a fool in the dark

We shall blur the lines of definition
Waves of love, our only ammunition

Tear my head out from the sound
Throw myself upon the ground
Take me to the ground in your loving arms

Take me to the burning tree
It has this strange effect on me
Riding on a train, baby, I could pray
...
