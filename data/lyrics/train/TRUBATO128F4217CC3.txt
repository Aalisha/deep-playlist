If we've ran a million miles to get to this place we'll keep the pace. because i haven't found answers yet along the way to all my questions on where i need to be or what to believe. if i can lay claim to any achievement here's my secret: i'm still unsure of everything. but i'm sure that hell has our names cause we're failing everyday as we search for a home where we won't die alone. i need to back up from these dead ends.
