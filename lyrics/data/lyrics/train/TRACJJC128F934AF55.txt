Deathless sin
Led to the place of atonement
Repent through pain
Slicing off proof of guilt

Immortal lust
Blood craving torturers revel
Pain through penance
You will plead for your scourge

Burnt with iron
Retinas scorched
Eyes are blind
Purge the mind

Enter the chambers of blood
Slave to the cruelty inside
Die in the chambers of blood
Cleansed of the sins of your life... bleeding

Walls are stained with blood of vice
Learn through scourge
The errors of depravity

Immortal curse
Inquisitors for eternity
Scourging to learn
...
