who's that that girl that everybody watches when she walks by
(walks by)
who's that girl she's get herself together and she's not shy

*chorus*
whenever we're together and the sun is shining
and there's magic in the air
cuz we're young and free feel like we can live forever
one, two, three we'll always be together
L.I.F.E. it just keeps getting better now
