Before a word is spoken
Everything is broken
Even what you hid inside
The world has let you down
Wrung shame out of your pride

Even as you falter
Like sunlight on the water
You shine on my face
This darkness in your heart
It's just a shadow in the way

Ohh, just a shadow in the way
Ohh, it's just a shadow in the way

When the fire leaves you
When no one believes you
When you give yourself away
To a stranger on the road
Who gives you nothing in exchange
