Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself

I'll wear a shield

I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you

Don't, tell me what I wanna hear
