She's floating like a butterfly
So charming
(Baby girl)
She recognise the man in me
(Number one in di world)
There's something in her eyes
Like a spell
Getting me hypnotised, ooh Lord
She give me one smile
Two smile, three smile
She got me going wild
(Worth more than
Diamonds and pearl)
So baby don't
Change your style
(Sweet honey)
Oh no, no love

Tease me, tease me
Tease me, tease me baby
Till I lose control
Tease me with your love
Until I lose control
Take all my body
And soul, oh girl

Woman your love is like
Burning fire inna me soul,
Woman tease me
Till me lose control,
Woman your love is like
Burning fire inna me soul,
Woman tease me
Till me lose control.

Me gal tease me and
Take a look me fancy
Right from the clock
...
