It's in the lood
Good times that's when you feel
You're something special in the family wheel
Bad times they hurt so much
The reason for so many people losing touch
I am your next of kind
You see we're family underneath the skin
Whatever crime we're guilty of
We; re all in need in need of a mother's love

It's in the blood all about the family
It's in the blood
It's in the blood all about the family
