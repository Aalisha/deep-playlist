I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine.
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine.
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight.
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light.

I see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshine.
We've walked along St. Thomas beach a million times.
Hand in hand, two barefoot lovers kissing in the sand.
Side by side, the tide rolls in.
I'm touching you, you're touching me.
