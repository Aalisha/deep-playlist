Baby im going out of town to handle some business
For a few days
But don't you worry
'Cause I'll call you
Like it's not
Long distance
'Cause I hate being away
I hate being away from you
I gotta go
Even though I don't want to
I'd rather stay
Than to be away from you

Since absence
Has been known to
Make the heart grow fonder
Then you know
That I miss you
And this song
...
