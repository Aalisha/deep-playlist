Two lanes closed northbound
Got home way past nine
Changed the message on the phone
And I pulled the blind

My friends treat me kind these days
But they hate to hear your name
They say still two years and counting
And it's much the same

Midnight radio station is keeping me from dreams
You and Frank Sinatra make one hell of a team
...
