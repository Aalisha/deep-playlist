I'm so sure this love is forever
You can see the way that I feel
There's not a thing that passes me by
That I dream of having you by my side

Like that moon and the star
May our hearts never part
As times passes by
Forever be mine

You pick me up, when I'm down
Life has no meaning, when you're not around
...
