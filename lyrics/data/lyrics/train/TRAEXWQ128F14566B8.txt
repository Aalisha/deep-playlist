He was born in a depressed nation
Started tough and worked his way right off the street
Thumbed his nose at a graduation
Wheeled and dealed, his education was complete

He's got all his hair, but his life is a wreck
Always been a brat, he don't get no respect
He's got the time, he's got the money
You better get out of his way
You better watch out for him, sonny

Back to school
He's gonna take that plunge
