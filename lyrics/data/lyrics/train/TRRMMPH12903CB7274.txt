Can you raise both your hands and clap 'em
Can you say, "sure, I'll always try"
Can you make friends among people and animals
Basically, everything is easy
Give it a try, you'll see I'm right
Cause if a mouse can be special, well so can you

Chorus:

And my name is Mickey Mouse
To my right is Minnie Mouse
And we own a little place in Disneyland, California

Let's have a party and be happy
Can we invite our closest friends
We can ask Donald Duck, Pluto, and all the gang
