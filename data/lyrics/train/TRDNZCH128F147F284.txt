Hey, they're playing our song again
I like it when you make it bounce
Your healthy body
Sticky wet when you do that thang

Love, they give you the lines
Full of game supreme
Trying too hard to get you on their team
That's when you tell them that you came with me babe

I know what you like babe
I know how to make you ooh baby
You don't have to cry ever again
Keep me satisfied baby
No pigeons on my mind babe
No body can love me like you do baby

All I want is you (all I want is you)
Baby all I want is you (all I want is you)
