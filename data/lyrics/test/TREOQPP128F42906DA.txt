(tim johnson/tim ewing)

Bobby got down on his knees, said becky would you marry me
He slipped that ring up on her hand
She ran home to show her mom, said look here what I've got on
That diamond sparkled on the band
She looked her daughter in the eye, said girl you are so young
I just pray that in your heart you know that he's the one

'cause without love it don't mean a thing
It's just a rock on a golden ring
You could take it down to an old pawn shop or toss it in the sea
