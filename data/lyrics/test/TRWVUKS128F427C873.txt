Everyone's saying that you're here for me
But you're here for them
If it wasn't for me, if it wasn't for me
Then you would even not know them

You move in those circles
For a brand new squeeze
For an average girls with bad teeth
You'd do anything to please

It makes me cringe
I'd like to stick a syringe
In your arm
Sedate you, then berate you
...
