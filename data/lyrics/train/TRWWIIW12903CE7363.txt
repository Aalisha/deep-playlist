send me your message, if you can 
and brake the silence, if you can 
and i will know that you exist 
and you will know now what i've missed 
and maybe i'll get kick for my emotional life 

another warning, another haze 
another try to get away 

let's leave this fallacious world 
let's leave this fallacious world 
let's leave this fallacious world 
...
