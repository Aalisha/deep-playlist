i did not forsee the one for me to be you
like a memory deep inside of me
laughter and tears fighting off the fears
you're so good for me

i want you to love me

if you want me too i can walk away
so not to cross the line we safely made
i've resisted this you have too
but i'm so good for you

i want you to love me
