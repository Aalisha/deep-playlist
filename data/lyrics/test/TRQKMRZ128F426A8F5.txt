Time has come, now it's our turn
To start building up our way to the stars
Here and now, scream and run
For the dreams we have and for the visions
That we have fought so long years after years

No hesitation we're heading forward
There's nothing that could stop us now
We are here to stay, never fading away

We have a power and will, dreams to fulfill
...
