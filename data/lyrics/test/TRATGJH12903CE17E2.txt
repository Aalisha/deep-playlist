Soldiers of fortune,
kings of Hades,
in our quest for power unite,
black messiahs,
devastation angels,
gird our loins -
prepare to fight:
With weapons drawn in anger,
at last we stand our ground,
crusaders of damnation,
in death our purpose is found at last.
Charge!
We're cleansing the world with
destruction and war,
fear for your life when we knock at your door,
there will be no salvation,
just death and starvation,
and Earth shall be Hell evermore.
Hark! The fallen Angels sing:
"Glory to Satan our King,
the Holy Church we thus defied,
the usurper crucified."
