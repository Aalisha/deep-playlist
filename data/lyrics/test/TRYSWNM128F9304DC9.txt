On the outskirts of my mind
there's really nothing left
eternal is gone, I lost myself
again and again and again

Violet dreams of a violent kind
kaleidoscope mind of hate
The battle with everyone
was really just the other me within

On the outskirts of my mind
there's really nothing left
Hell is lose and it's only just begun

I hold the truth, I am the cure,
I hold you down, I beg you now
Try not to look me in the eye, as I'm headed for the kill
