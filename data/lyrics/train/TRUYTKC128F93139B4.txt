Yo, you got trash niggas that's sellin
Street niggas that's tellin
Niggas named Henry dressin like they Helen
The kids don't listen, the third grade's rebellin
We got cops killin the blacks, blacks killin the blacks
Niggas with jail time that's not comin back
Even the females wild, they don't know how to act
(B-b-b-but wait, it gets worse...)
Niggas scared to get scorched, they ain't passin the torch
Claimin the new niggas don't really walk the walk
Really talk the talk - really, that's they thought?
(B-b-b-but wait, it gets worse...)
The muthafuckin stakes is high, gas rates is high
People get taxed and told on every dime
It's white collar, blue collar, wife beater crimes
(B-b-b-but wait, it gets worse...)
I figured it'll get better the more that I'm gettin cheddar
The more that the guap came the more they wouldn't let up
Back in the days niggas'd go head up or shut up
Now in the days they go, come back, you get wet up
