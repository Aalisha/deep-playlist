Like water you see into me
You reach into me and I ripple round in circles
Reflections of my dreams in yours
Bring me to the shores of desire

I have been like a desert creature
Wandering on this earth so cracked and dry
But now your love is bringing me alive

Like water, how could I do without you?
My body heat will not cool down
Like water, I could not live without you
I want to dive so deep into you, I might drown

Tu eres como el agua

You know me, an invisible line connects us in time
