Whenever I'm down
I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend
In my time of need

Whenever I'm down
I call on you my friend
(I call on you my friend)
(I call on you my friend)

Listen.

Whenever I'm down
I call on you my friend
A helping hand you lend
In my time of need

Whenever I'm down
I call on you my friend
(I call on you my friend)
(I call on you my friend)

Whenever I'm down
And all that's going on
Is really going on
Just one of those days (and ju-h.)

You say the right things
