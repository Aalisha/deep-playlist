From the heavens I can see the world
Hardly moving
What could make it turn?

Maybe life itself
Or could it be love
Or God with a gentle shove?

I fear what I know, not what I wonder
All the weight of the world on my back finally kills me
But I know that it won't ever take me

So take your money
Right back to the hell it came
Don't wait and don't worry
...
