Chemical halo
Burning bright in a sodium haze
All meaning is lost
But this confusion remains
I'm going to tear myself apart
If I can't get myself together
And spread my pieces around like waste

Every time I laugh I feel like maybe I'm choking
I know you'd laugh too but it's not the funny anymore

I kissed the floor on my way down
