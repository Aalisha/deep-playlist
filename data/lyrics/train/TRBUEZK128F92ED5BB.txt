I never knew just what to do,
When I came to life and all those promises,
Always earned every word that came along the way,
Now I know that what I sow, will always be the way things really just grow,
Forever now, please show me how,
To fight these feelings, they're still reeling

(Chorus:)
No longer will I have to remind the past,
Those I've come to glimpse of it, (Yeah)
No longer will I carry this weighted past,
...
