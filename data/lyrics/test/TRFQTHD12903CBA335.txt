Here I come, the king of clowns
As I hide behind this smile and paint the town
Though I cry since you're gone
You'll never know because the show must go on

I've been sad, I've been sad
I've been blue, I've been blue
Ever since the day that you found someone new
Someone new
I pretend but you can't tell
With my broken heart I play my part so well
