Wait a minute, hey just a minute
I just need a little time
I can't get myself together
Give me half the chance

Baby to collect my mind
Wait a minute, hey just a minute
I need a little room to breathe
Slow down, slow down

We can turn it around
Baby you don't have to leave
I just want to call the time now baby
Things are going way too fast

I've been having trouble keeping up with you
I don't think I'm gonna last
I love you like there's no tomorrow
