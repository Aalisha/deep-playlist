It's magical, the way you make me feel inside
Can't let you go, no matter all I try you stay on my mind
I can hold your hands and you can hold mine

Now we can rock until the morning light
If I could I would change back the hands of time
That we can do everything so right

I'm just a thought away for you, babe
I know we had our ups and downs
But we say it gets crazy
But trust me girl, you can always count on me

'Cause my love, my love, your love, your love
Our love, our love, our love is magical
'Cause my love, my love and your love, your love
And our love, our love, our love is magical, girl
