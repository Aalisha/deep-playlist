Ha-ha I don't need no sex
I just wanna get with you

Oh, all I wanna know is can I get with you?
Don't lead me on
Can I get with you?
Girl it's you, it's you
It's them things that you do
It's all about you, it's you
I just want to get with you


Girl, I see you shaking your butt, baby what?
What'cha trying to do?
I don't need a little time cause tonight you're mine
Have a drink or two yeah
Girl let's have some fun
You said that's what you really want
I got what you need
And I will fulfill all of your dreams

We can ride all night long
If you want
