People will tell you that this kind of love will fade
That being in love like this is only a phase
But baby after all this time ain't nothin' changed
All you gotta do is look at me that way

And there you go makin' me fall in love again
There you go makin' me fall in love again

Oh, and I gotta tell you there's nothin' better
You and me together, workin' on forever
Everyday with you is always somethin' new
You only gotta be yourself
And there you go makin' me fall in love again

Baby sometimes you can say the craziest things
I love how you don't care what nobody thinks
