Apocalyptic Havoc

Watch the skies as hell comes riding in
On a horse of pale to name this wrath
Torturing worthless souls as this reign begins
This hand of doom is set to rule the world.

A wilted faith in these times of regret
Sculpting death in madness obsessed.

Words of this mayhem cast out loud
A timeless torture foretold in a sky of black
Torn souls from the mold of flesh and bone
