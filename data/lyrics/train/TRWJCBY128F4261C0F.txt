You coulda heard a pin drop
When they walked through the door
Had to turn my eyes away
My heart fell to the floor

Someone whispered, "where's her halo?"

He stood there smiling, holding on
To the one who took my place

So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
