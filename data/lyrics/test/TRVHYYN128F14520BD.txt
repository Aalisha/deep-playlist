You're just a face in the crowd
A tiny hole in a cloud
You're trying to find your way in
To let your soul shine back out
We're just a twist in a seam
A splash of paint on a screen
We're making all kinds of shapes
Somehow we can straighten out the bends

This is our time we can't rewind
Our place to shine out
And we can live it anyway
This is our time to feel sublime
Our place to shine now
And we can do it anyway - we can't rewind

Do you think we can change
