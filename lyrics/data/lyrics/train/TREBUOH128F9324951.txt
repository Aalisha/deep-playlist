Sound the alarms all eyes to the horizon
Prepare for war put down the fear in your eyes

We fight and die, bearing arms, free of fear
Our colors nailed to the mast

I may not make it back
But I'll make sure someone never forgets me
I may not make it back
But I'll make sure someone never forgets me

No regrets nothing left to loose.
I may not make it back
This night is mine
But I'll make my stand
This night is mine
So take a good last look at the blackened sky
