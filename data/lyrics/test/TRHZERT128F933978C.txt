I'm broke and sorry
You should have heard that one last night
It broke my heart and I woke up sick and cold inside the van
I'm still coughing those songs I sang last night

I'm a ghost
Separate from that guy you knew
And these songs that I sing won't do anything
But get us to the next town and the next town and the next town, yeah
