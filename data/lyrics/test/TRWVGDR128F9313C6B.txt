You know girl, all my life
 I've been looking for someone like you
 And you know true love
 Iis so hard to find
 
 Since we've been together
 True love is forever
 So let's be lovers for life
 
 We're meant for each other ain't no doubt in my mind
 We were put here together that's the way love's designed
 So that we could be happy it's up to us to decide
 This incredible feeling could be passing us by
 What's the point in giving up when, when we're doing fine
 We don't need to be lonely when our love is so right
 I wanna be true
