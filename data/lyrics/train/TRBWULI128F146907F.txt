So glad you could make it
Bring the slaughter to the lamb
I may look like some animal
But I am who I am, a man and I love you
And I'm hoping you feel as I do
I cover my face in terrible shame
And Open my heart up to you

Look at my friends they're always laughing
Think they're doing alright
Maybe it's me they think they're fooling
It's a general insight
Who knows what you see
Maybe it's Lies, All lies
