Another day burns away into darkness
Another blink on the eye of time
I am straining through the blackness
Ever searching for a sign

Days grow long and the days grow dark and the days grow ever colder
The trust that I started with fades as I get older
Though the road is hard it seems to me there is no way around this
From all you've done for me I know you'll never break your promise

So here at the end of this day where the world is shaded in gray
I will look to the blue horizons and watch for you to come
When my hope is shattered and torn, when my faith is weathered and worn
I'll look to the blue horizons
