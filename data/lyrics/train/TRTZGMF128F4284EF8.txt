'Cause if she cheated on him, she could cheat on you
Don't listen to what she say, watch what she do
She's like a thief in the night the way she be creepin' through
An' like the worm in the apple, she gonna eat right through

'Cause if she cheated on him, she could cheat on you
Don't listen to what she say, watch what she do
She's like a thief in the night the way she be creepin' through
An' like the worm in the apple, she gonna eat right through

Just because she knows what to say
Doesn't mean that she's trust worthy
Just because she's got a pretty face
Doesn't mean that she's not dirty

After all the talk around place
Is that she's got a man in each state
What you gonna say when she starts to creep?
An' you're wonderin' where she's been

'Cause if she cheated on him, she could cheat on you
Don't listen to what she say, watch what she do
She's like a thief in the night the way she be creepin' through
An' like the worm in the apple, she gonna eat right through

'Cause if she cheated on him, she could cheat on you
Don't listen to what she say, watch what she do
She's like a thief in the night the way she be creepin' through
