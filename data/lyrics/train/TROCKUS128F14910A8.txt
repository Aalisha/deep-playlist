Sew a late seed, and so inside
A cast out, unwanted son
A crawl, to do what you want
Sit down, your fault
You run away from anyone

And where you live, I feel most on
A corner of space, that you do right
And guards off, I'll pass you by

Makes no impression as you stand
Makes no impression on me
Left out holding sand

A waif across the sea, aloss
Because you can't think straight
It's your calling, wasted mourning
...
