So you got a bad report
And it doesn't look good to you
Put a praise on your lips
This is what you gotta do
Speak to your situation without hesitation
God gave me this revelation just for you

[Bridge 1:]
It ain't over (It ain't over)
No matter what you're going through
It ain't over (It ain't over)
God's gonna work it out for you
If you can believe
It ain't over
Trouble don't last always
It ain't over (It ain't over)
It ain't over (It ain't over)

So you gave it all you had
And you still came up short
You been faithful through it all
And you answered the call
Keep your eyes on the prize
Don't give up the faith
God has a plan for you
That's why we say

It ain't over (It ain't over)
Weeping may endure for a night
It ain't over (It ain't over)
Joy's gonna come, joy's gonna come
It ain't over
If you just believe in the morning
It ain't over (It ain't over)
It ain't over

[Bridge 2:]
Whose report will you believe
