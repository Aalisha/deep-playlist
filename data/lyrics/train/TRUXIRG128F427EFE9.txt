Been good, been bad, got worse, got better
I feel I know myself when I'm looking in the mirror
Been hurt, been loved - I'm scarred, I'm not bitter
I'm an angel with knowledge of a sinner
But what do I do and how should I be?
When I look at myself I can only be me

I need a little patience...

Been hard, been soft, been both, been neither
...
