Two, three, four
I drank all my fuckin' brew and I ain't got no more

Feeling so damn tired
Running on desperate fumes
For the end is always near, now
Empty handed it's always soon

Psychocise me terrify me
Jeopardizing all that's mine
Megolamize me certify me
On my knees until I cry

Lord only knows
