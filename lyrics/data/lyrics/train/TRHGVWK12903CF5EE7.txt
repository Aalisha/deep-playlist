Societies collapse
End of days begins
Men and women young and old
Fight a war they cannot win
Democracy in ruin
Battling in vain
End of modern era
Tyranny rules again

Man against machine
Hunger in its eyes
Man against machine
Killing through the lies

Wake up to the nightmare
Innocent legions fall
...
