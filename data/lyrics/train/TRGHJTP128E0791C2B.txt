St. Lunatics and we here now, we never give up
Swallowin' Cris' till we spit up, put your shit up 'cause now
We navigatin', wood grain, hood slang, collaboratin'
God over Satan, no debatin', so I'm celebratin'
This new life, off the block buyin' stock
Divin' off the dock in Bangkok, I used to slang rock
And it was so hard, but now the wallet sport a gold card
Bitches goin' nuts when the rims hit the boulevard

Hustle hard, the whole inside glowin'
From the TV's, diamonds went from hard to see to 3D
Double VD, bubble Lex with the CD
Puffin' seaweed, I'm free, hit the slope and ski
DC to France, finance is too advanced
Wit' plans to 'cause a trance, money stands ' yellin' "Romance"
I never stop comin', gunnin', runnin' and sunnin'
With Cuda spinnin' them hun'neds on hun'neds spinnin' and blunted

I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin'
What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the infinite?
I'm like okay, niggas brought they cars out
Thick broads out, all the stars out
We ain't been here two minutes, mami already yellin'
What a nigga gon' do with it, can we hop in the infinite?
I'm like okay
