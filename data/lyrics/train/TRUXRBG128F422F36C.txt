Would you just say something, please just anything?
Because I can't stand that look on your face.
We're in over our heads, we're in over our heads she said.

I beg to differ with all your pointing fingers.
And second guessing, my second chances.
Because you're whats been keeping me up at night,
One last time before I'm out that door.

The bells keep ringing wine and roses. This needs a compromise.
Back and forth, here we go, we lose our self control.
This old flame, it won't light itself. This needs a compromise.
You're the spark. I'm the fuse. We'll make the perfect match.
