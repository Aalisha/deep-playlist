The world is turning in front of me and sometimes it's hard for me to let go
My flesh begins to rise and then I find out there's things I don't know
I'm standing here but no one cares, I'm crying out but no one is there
And I am me but who am I and will I ever find the reason (for life)

CHORUS
But I see you there, Your arms around me, Your arms around me
And I have no fear, You're all around me, You're all around me
