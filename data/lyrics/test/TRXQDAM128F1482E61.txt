Hanging over a few lines
Still I'm bored
Swallow pills and chase you down and drink 'til I'm sore
I read a book to stay awake
But all the pages make me wait
For something great

My real friends say I'm waiting for what's gone a long ago
And life is what you make of it
So come on now, let's go
But still I'm bored lately
Do you feel sane?
Being out all drives me crazy (?)
And this world's insane

And this world's insane
