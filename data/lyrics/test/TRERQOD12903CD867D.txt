Exploited, avoided
Where have the efforts shown?
Got loaded with steel coated
Ready to explode

As the strings you try to hold
Get entangled around your throat
We'll gaze out to the sea, when you're sinking your own boat

Yeah! The gun - to make justice for your deeds
You'll get what you need - Look who's laughing now and who's to bleed
