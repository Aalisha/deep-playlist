{intro: '59 Les Paul and amp start oozing}

I've been a b-bad boy baby
I've been a bad boy all night long - oh yes I have,
Yes, I've been a bad boy honey,
I've been a bad boy all night long,
That woman, she don't even let me,
She did not even telephone.

I'm gonna leave my little honey,
Like a rabbit leaves the hole,
A-ow-ah leave my little honey baby,
Just like that little bunny rabbit leaves the hole,
