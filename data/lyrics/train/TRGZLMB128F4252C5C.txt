she's wearing her don't talk to me face
as she makes the kids lunches
I oblige and quietly shut the front door as I leave
drive into town before the fog lifts
I sell sporting goods
I've got a shop not far from Cathedral Square

I like to open up early
so fellas can come in on their way to work
daydream around the rods and reels
while their breakfast's still warm inside them
go on have yourselves a look
crowd my shop
almost everything's from overseas
you won't find a better selection
