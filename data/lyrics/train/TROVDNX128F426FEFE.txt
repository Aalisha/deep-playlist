So sweet you're my desire
I dig deep and feel the fire
You can use me my love for hire
I can't sleep you got me wired

When you get close to me
My temperature's up and I feel the heat
And then you get close to me

Ah, do me anyway you wanna
Do me anyway you wanna
Do me anyway you wanna
Do me anyway you wanna

Throw down, see it growin'
My heart's poundin' keep it goin'
...
