Wanna cry for you
Would it do any good?
If I rained for you
It would just be water

And the night's with you
And the storm's in your hand
And you're down, and you're down
And I can't lift you

I'm powerless to change your world
I'm powerless to stop the hurt

But I'll give you my heart
Give you my shoulder

I give you my heart
Give you my shoulder
Over and over

Wanna run for you
...
