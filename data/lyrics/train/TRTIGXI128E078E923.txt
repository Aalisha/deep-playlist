Some fellas only think of themselves
Themselves and no one else
Don't care if it's good for you
And fall asleep before you're finished too

Let me be your Tarzan
Swingin' from a tree
Triple w dot superhero dot me
I will show you things
You've never seen

All about you
What you wanna do
Everything you like

Pullin' on your hair
Keep it right there
All night, all night

Can't go too long
Put it down strong
'Til your work is done

Somebody said
Relax don't do it
When you wanna come

I'll do whatever you want me to
For as long as you want me to
...
