I heard she broke your heart again
So now you're gonna come and see me
We're back to the start again
When's she gonna set me free?

I've been there time and time again
The girl's no good for me and you
She hurts me too

I heard she broke your heart again
I heard she broke your heart
Well, that girl's a heartbreaker
