I wanna rot in the sun
I wanna rot in the sun
I wanna rot in the sun

This is a beautiful life
Just 'cause it catches the light
Gonna let it all slide
Like butter on a warm night

This irrelevant high
This p-plentiful sky
Y-y-your hair is blond
But not the brow above your eye

I take my mouth off my foot
Give up and I feel good
Give up and I feel good
I'm gonna riot in the sun

In the sun
...
