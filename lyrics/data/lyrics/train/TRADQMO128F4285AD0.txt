Better than you ever were
Better than the day before
Spinnin' in a circle
Is more than you could ask for
Remember the landslide
Remember the time you tried
To stand, you couldn't stand at all
It was more than you could hope for

[Chorus 1]
Now you're makin' some weird friends
And you're makin' some weird plans
And you're takin' off again
But tell me where it lands
