Tonight she'll be waiting in the place
If she can get away
For a secret rendezvous
(Secret rendezvous)

We've got to keep our heads down low
There's places we can't go
Though we both know
The harm that it would do

If he knew about us
It would break his heart until forever
And without her he would fall apart
I wish I never fell for my best friend's girl

I know it's wrong and he's a friend
Someday it's gotta end
...
