Along the sand, let's walk the shores together now,
Yes, hand in hand, it's gonna be fair weather now.
When the stars come out, stop,
To count them in the sky.

Love California nights when I'm walking with you,
Hand in hand by the shore.
Yes, I love California nights,
At the beach where we'd swim with the tide rolling in.
