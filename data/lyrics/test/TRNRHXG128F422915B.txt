They're playing our song
Don't you hear the music
Repeat (4x)

From the moment you entered
My eyes have been on you
You're making me weak
Simply by the way you move
I want to be with you
Out here on the floor
Sure seems to me like we danced somewhere before

Is this a simple case of dejavu
Am I mistaken or have I danced with you
Won't you correct me if you know I'm wrong
But if you think I'm right then let's dance to our song
