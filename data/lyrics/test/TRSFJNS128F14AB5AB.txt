Sun rise this is the last day
that I'll ever see
out in the court-yard
they're ready for me
but I go to my Lord with no fear
'cos I did what I did for Maria.

As I rode into town
with the sun going down
all the windows were barred
there was no-one around
for they knew that I'd come
with my hand on my gun
and revenge in my heart for Maria
my dearest departed Maria.
