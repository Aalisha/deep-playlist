Couldn't have fallen higher
You left a lewd desire
Shot down from the sky like a hunted bird
Pressure of circumstance
You have been taking chances
Now it's going to wrack
There's a knife stabbed in your back

You're the victim of deceit
It's all been covered nice and neat
To make it all fall down on you like pouring rain
You're the wounded and the clown
The target for contemtuous frowns
Like you're the only one, redeemer of the stain
...
