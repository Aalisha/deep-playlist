Teach me to learn to lose myself
my finger was pricked by someone else
pull my blood up through a mixer straw
Spread the words all wrong on the neighbor's lawn and on
Don't cry for sleeping kittens
cause they won't die today
we'll cover them with flowers
they dream their dreams away

Disconnect the feeling factory
put your tongue up to my battery
