Don't Call Me Andy
By Andrew W.K.
Close Calls With Brick Walls (2006)

She Said, �Andy What You Doing On The Mountain?�
She Said, �Now, Andy, What You Doing On The Air?�
And He Said, �Andy Doesn't Live Upon The Mountain.�
�If You're Looking For Andy��
�You'll Be Looking Everywhere.�

So Don't Call Me Andy
