what were you dreaming? . . . that made you sweat . . soaking wet . . . in a fever?
dark wings circling . . . slowly around . . slowly around . . slowly around

what grip held you? . . tossed & turned you . . tossed & turned you?
where were you going? carried away . . carried away . . & calling?

oh . . then mourning flies . . the fields awake & come alive . . darkness goes . .
the crows appear . . the scurrying squirrel . . the apple tree deer . . the sun fills
our bed . . the sun fills our bed

some cloud's caught us . . trouble all around . . trouble comin' down
