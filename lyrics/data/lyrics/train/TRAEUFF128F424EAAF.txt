Oh, like many a male,
I get angst in my pants
And goddamn it to hell,
It don't help if I dance

And you, you're not doing too well
All the blogs are about you, girl
They caught you in the park after dark
Giving head to a statue, girl
Oh, cruel!

I didn't mean to do you no harm
I just underestimated my charm
And if I ever bother to tell you the truth, oh baby
You're too much sugar for my sweet tooth, all right I

Didn't mean to do you no harm
I just underestimated my charm
And if I ever bother to tell you the truth, oh baby
You're too much sugar for my sweet tooth, all right now

You're on your honeymoon
And you're sending me notes
...
