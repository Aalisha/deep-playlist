I don't love him anymore just ask all my friends
I've told them and I tell them time and time again
I don't have no regrets no I'm not that kind
Honestly he's the last thing on my mind

When the day turns into dusk
And the shadows start to fall
And this empty bed's as big as Arkansas
And when I'm driftin' off to sleep
Something in my broken heart rewinds
He's the last thing, he's the last thing on my mind
...
