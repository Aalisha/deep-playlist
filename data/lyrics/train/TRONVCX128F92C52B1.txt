The Harlem mammas they are laughing
They call me punk rock think they're cute
The pizza boys they keep on starin'
I guess they finally made it off their stoop

I don't even know and I don't even care

Since I've been hanging round
Machines go up and down
Spray paint gospel on the beat
Another billboard reads
Come to Miami Beach
A man sells pretzels in the heat
Riding on the subway
