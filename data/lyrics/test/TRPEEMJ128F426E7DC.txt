Timeless love is livin' on

Here in my heart baby and here in my song
I miss your laugh and I miss your smiles
I hope you hear this across the miles
And if you do, maybe my nights won't seem as long

So I'll sing about you in the morning sun
And I'll sing about you when my music's all done
Then I'll smile
Because it feels good even missin' ya

Now I'll sing about the day you said goodbye
