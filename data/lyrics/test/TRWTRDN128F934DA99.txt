Ooh! My soul

Baby baby, baby baby, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey honey, honey honey, honey
Get off of that money

Love love, love love, love
Ooh! My soul

Baby baby, baby baby, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey honey, honey honey, honey
Get off of that money

Kiss kiss, kiss kiss, kiss
