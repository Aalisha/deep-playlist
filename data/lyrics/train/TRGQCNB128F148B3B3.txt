You know I'm on a slick trip.
I'm always ready to kick ass.
Up on the stage I'm in a rage.
Yes, I'm havin' the time of my life.
Yes, indeed. What a sweet, sweet life it is,

Until some loco two-bit floosie
With a Louie Le-strange.
Ain't good for nothin' but trouble,
They're just two fools livin' up to their names.
And now it's startin' to rain on my parade.

(You) know there's nothin' like the real world
To get me down.
Nothin' like the world outside
That turns me upside down,
Makes me feel like I'm headin' down a one-way, dead-end street.
