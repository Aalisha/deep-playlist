Seemed to stop my breath
My head on your chest
Waitin' to cave in
From the bottom of my
Hear your voice again
Could we dim the sun
And wonder where we've been
May be you and me
So kiss me like you did my heart stopped
Beating such a softer sin
(I'm melting, I'm melting)

In your eyes I lost my place
Could stay a while and I'm melting
In your eyes like my first time
That I caught fire

Just stay with me, lay with me now
Never caught my breath
Every second I'm without you
I'm a mess
Ever know each other
Trust these words are stones
