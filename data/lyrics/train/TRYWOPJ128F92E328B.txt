Oh
No, no, no, no
Ah ah

I tell a story how,
I tell that hands and
Reach through love.
I came without his crown,
Falling queen
As tears come down.
Secretly words
Shedding his demise.
Next to his body,
You know what's found.
I believe
I can live without,
The one who cares for me.

[Chorus]
You are only mine,
I am only yours my baby,
You are only mine,
I am only yours

Oh So where do we go now?
When can we fly
...
