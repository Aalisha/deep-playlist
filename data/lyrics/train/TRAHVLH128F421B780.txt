Never thought I'd be caught in the web
Like a lamb lying down to be slaughtered
Put down your walls for a minute
I want to let you know what is on my mind

I am trying to find the words
To reveal the scenery
I was never enough for you
And it splits my soul in two
Every time you go

My heart is crying
Every time you walk away I'm dying
I know I have to be strong and fight it
But when you look at me I fail to hide it
