I heard stories about you
I'd like to think that they were true
I did not know you'd be like that
with those surprises under hat

be my (echo), be my (echo), be my maybe baby
be my (echo), be my (echo), be my maybe baby
be my (echo), be my (echo), be my maybe baby

when you dance between the stars
in the night late sweet and dark
turn them over one by one
you don't need to jump the gun

be my (echo), be my (echo), be my maybe baby
...
