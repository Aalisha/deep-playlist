The truth is in the dirt on the ground
The truth is in the dirt on the ground
Not in your gilded cage with your rusted spoon
When the ground splits open it will swallow you

The truth is in the dirt on the ground
The truth is in the dirt on the ground
Not in your poison tongue or your acid tears
Let the truth howl in your ears

Here she comes, it's killing time
