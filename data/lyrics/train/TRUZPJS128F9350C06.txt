The way you move your hips
When your struttin' down the street
Oh it makes a mess
Oh we bend the knees 

Lipstick on your lips
When you say those words so sweet
Oh have mercy darlin
I'm beggin you please

When we're all alone girl,
And there's no one else in sight
And I'm holdin' you so tight
And so true

Well then you pull away girl
Just when I think that I'm home
And you leave me all alone
And I'm feeling so blue, well

Your easy lovin' ain't pleasin' nothin'
Baby, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forget teasing, loving
