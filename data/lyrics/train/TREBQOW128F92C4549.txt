I got so much trouble on my mind
So I take time
Out my day
To pray and I say
Now I lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep
My soul
Peep I'm gettin' old
And it's a cold cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma
It's the same routine
Keep my room clean
I'm lookin' to do some new things but ain't shit to do
I'm twenty two catch
In the prime of my life
I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel
Disgruntled, tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness
Aiight you sing, I may not be the darkest
Brotha
But I was always told to act my age and not my color
Knowin' that my color was that of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes get up stand up... etc.
It's like how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain
When it rains it pours, and it's about to come down hard
Thank God I found you
As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance
