Where did she go I do not know
And which direction was it snowing?
I'll turn around again
Paint over pictures on the wall
I can't believe she gave me alcohol
I thought of Jezebel

Hung from a wrecking ball to see a fashion show
I think you know me well
I think you know me well
You know me well
You know me well
