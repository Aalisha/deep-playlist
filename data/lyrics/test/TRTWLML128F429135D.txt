Built from
Blind faith
Passed down from self
Induced fantasy
Turn a page, to justify
...
Conjuring power it opens wide
On your seventh day
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want
...

To assume, from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your cross-turned dagger
...
Inside crystal mountain

Evil takes its form

...
Inside crystal mountain
