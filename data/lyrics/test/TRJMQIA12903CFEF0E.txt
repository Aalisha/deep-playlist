Shattered dreams of you and I
Awoken consumed by tortured lies
Growing throughout eternity
The love that died is now eating at me
Choice made to prolong the death
The empty feeling of your last caress

Nobody knows where the time has gone
Destined to stand all alone
Thriving off the anguish of life
The broken hopes of yesterday
Forsaken to believe
