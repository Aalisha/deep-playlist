Lucy the castle, shes my new friend,
L-L-Lucy the castle she will never a-pretend,
Shes a real one a dancer, want a castle fort,
She's a true bird, a raver, a diamond on the run,

We are terrorists or teachers,
Or maybe we're just raw,
They all try to cock us,
and scratch us with their paws,
While im raving with Lucy,
I feel like i can fly.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Everyone you meet wants to meet you again
Everywhere you go you leave something behind
Meet the dark souls,
Gunna make em shine.
Lucy the castles gonna blow your mind.
