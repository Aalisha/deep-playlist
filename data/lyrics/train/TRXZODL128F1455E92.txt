She still answers whenever I call
We talk about work and the weather and all
If I mention the past or maybe coming back home
It ain't long till I hear that old cold dial tone

I still got her number but I can't reach her anymore
I can't reach out and touch her heart the way I did before
She don't have much to talk about
Since my feet did the walking out
If she could only see them walk the floor
...
