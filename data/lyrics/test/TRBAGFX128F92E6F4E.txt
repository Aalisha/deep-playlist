Like a kung fu maniac
Drunk on the blood of a thousand victims
My case in point is I don't have a system
No need to knock them down
What's that sound or uplift them, yeah

Well, maybe in space no one can hear you scream
Now is it yourself or is it a team think fast
'Cause you might get caught while you're asleep, yeah
The forces of evil run deep, they're so deep

Gettin' organizized, gettin' organizized
Get it, get, get, get, get organizized
Gettin' organizized, gettin' organizized
Get it, get, get, get

Confusion is the heart of stability
Stability is the heart and soul of insanity
It's going, it's going what's going is got you gone
There ain't nothing here so move along, yeah
