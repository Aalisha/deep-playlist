Run

Run away screaming bloody murder
The doubt of question will be murdered, murdered, murdered
Deception is charming
I don't think so, lies, I don't think so, lies
I don't think so, lies, [Incomprehensible]

No, I don't think so, don't think so
I don't think so
No, I don't think so, don't think so
I don't think so

These things will harmonize and overthrow
These things will cure, but they will tear down
