We met two men from other sides, on a walk down by the river side
Trigger finger itching to see some action, he would tell me what I'd need to know
On a mission sent by the high command, proceed with caution this man's dangerous
Double agent works for the other side, get what you can then terminate his life
Reached for his lugger but I drew mine first
You're a better man than I were his last words
You're a better man than I were his last words
You're a better man than I were his last words
