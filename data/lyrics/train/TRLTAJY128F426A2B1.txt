Certainly someone who is frozen is not alive
But neither are they dead they are in a third state
A biostasis what I would use to describe
Liquid cool

Make me immortal, yeah, yeah
I am immortal, yeah
I am nothing, yeah, yeah
Becoming liquid cool

Waves of oblivion, yeah, yeah
Lap at my feet, yeah
Laugh in my face, yeah, yeah
