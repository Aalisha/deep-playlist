I drowned my conscience and cast another stone.
I took to preaching while dancing on the coals.
I can't see where I've been, and only God knows where I'll be,
But there must be a place for the wretch like me.

Oh, Lord knows I'm tired, but I won't rest my head until I'm home.
And if my hands find themselves another body, well, you can't blame them for trying to keep warm.

Morals are simply a matter of time.
And where you lay your head's a question of pride.
But it's said and done, you'll find it in the lines
That privilege and wit made me misfortune's child.

Can't tell collapse that it needs to slow down.
Can't tell death that it shouldn't come around.
And when they take my head and put it on a stake,
I know the guilt and disgrace keep the dead man awake.

Bartering your figure for a paralyzing love.
What have you done?

I took the scaffold and laughed until I fell.
