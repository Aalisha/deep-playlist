My wishes, they grow stronger
I feel the change inside
Can't hold on much longer
My death will be my pride

I fight for my freedom
A stain of divinity
Controlled by emotions
Roaring and unreal

I'm waiting for a miracle
Not knowing where the road will go
I stand tall

I am torn in the maze of corruption
...
