She looked so good movin’ ‘cross the dance floor
Better than the day she left me
Arm in arm with somebody new
Holdin’ hands and laughin’ like we used to
I got my best smile on, but it’s no disguise
It don’t hide the pain in these eyes

I did her so wrong, for so long
Turned my back on her love, now she’s long gone
I did my part, to break her heart
She walked out on me, and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
