You know, baby
I love you very, very much
And I just want you to know that
There's nothing can divide us
No, no, hey

Nothing can divide us
Nothing separate us
Nothing can divide us
No one can stop me from loving you, oh, no
No one can stop me from loving you

Nothing can divide us
Nothing separate us
Nothing can divide us
No one can stop me from loving you, oh, no
No one can stop me from loving you (No way)

ÂCause I was born to love you
You were born to love me too
And I can't deny it
Baby, I love you more each minute
