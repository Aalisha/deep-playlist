You say you fight to give us freedom
But often more than not this is abused
And the faces of a tired generation
have decided they are sick of being used
for the purpose of current declarations
Still the same, it'll never change until the end
Is to buy appreciation of the nation
To cover the mistakes you must defend
And you say there'll be a chance for evryone
to proptest against your calculated greed
But I can see into the future
Won't be long before the welfare
Send me letters telling me how much they need
And it's not been in my interest to please them
For the only interest rate to fall is mine
