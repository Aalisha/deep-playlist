For what it's worth
A nickels just a nickel son
Your pleasure becomes your pain
It's gonna hurt
Your out on the road
Your just an old horse walking alone
Shaken off the miles been rode
Pardon me
Through the valley of the shadows
Wickedness unravels

Some crooked man
Dealing cards to an honest man
Stealing up all his farming land
It's a damn shame
His oldest son is starving now
There ain't no mule to pull the plow
There ain't no rain
Cause all the crops are burning dry
Except for the tear in his mama's eye
In her eye
Everything is fine

With one touch
The water turns to rust
Tell me who is there to trust
Anymore
