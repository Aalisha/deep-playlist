I've always tried to break through your walls of fire
An angel in love can always fly much higher
'Til I looked in your eyes
That's when I left the skies

Take me now I'm your fallen angel
You taught me why angels fall
Watch me fly, your fallen angel
I can break through your walls

With all of the dreams that we have together now (we have together, baby)
It's hard to believe this is forever now (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And when I heard your call
You were there to catch my fall (catch my fall)
