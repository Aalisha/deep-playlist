Steam rising and spiraling then vanish in the wind
I cant tell where the land ends and the sky begins
Are you acquainted with the threat of being killed?
Or are you conversing with pigeons on the windowsill?

Every battle has been fought
And everything I think was thought
Down we, down we've descended

Every day keeps getting shorter
As my sleeves start getting longer
And the sidewalks overflow
So we patronize pedestrians
With no sense of direction
When you're lost and can't ask a question

Steam rising and spiraling then vanish in the wind
I cant tell where the land ends and the sky begins
...
