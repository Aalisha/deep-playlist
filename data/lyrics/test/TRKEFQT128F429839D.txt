When you think you've reached the end of the line
Walls that once blocked your way come tumblin' down
And you'll find the answers were there all the time

When we turn out the lights and we sit in the dark
Is the mountain too high to climb? Halfway to Heaven
When you're flat on your back you can still see the stars
Guidin' you through the night, halfway to paradise

Tin gods plan, life's doors slam to hold you back
When you're born on the wrong side of the track
...
