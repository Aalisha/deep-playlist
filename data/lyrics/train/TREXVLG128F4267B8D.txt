Ride the bike like if it's on
clear water
Leave speed behind
Fill it with adrenaline
Medals made of gold not
silver
Challenge the races that
others can't win
Audit me, however you may
want
I own a slang that you'll
never pronounce
Wild-child like you
wouldn't know
Young reckless offspring
That's out of control.

Blasting me up
Up... up... I go
Rebel, Am I?
Who... me? Oh no...

To be among the bona fide
trail blazers
Gotta jump in, no wetting
your feet
Lead in ferocious
spaces
Cowards can sleep, while
you swallow
Your feast.
