We made Oklahoma a little after 3
Randy, his brother Bob, and my old GFC
We had some moonshine whiskey and some of Bob's homegrown
We were so messed up we didn't know if we were drunk or stoned

Randy was a sad sack, tall, kinda frail
Bob was a raving maniac, crazier than hell
we been kicked out of high school several years ago
for kicking over port-o-cans at the 4-H rodeo

Since they done the little dance right outside the law
popped twice in Oklahoma and once in Arkansas
and I don't know what possessed me to want to tag along, 'cause I was raised a Christian and I knew right from wrong

Chorus ----

Right or wrong, black or white
cross the line you're gonna pay
into the dawn before the light
...
