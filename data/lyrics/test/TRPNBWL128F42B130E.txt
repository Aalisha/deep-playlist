When your money's gone, friends have turned you down
And you wander 'round just like a hound
(A lonesome houn')
Then you stop to say, "Let me go away from this old town
(This awful town)
There's a place I know folks won't pass me by
Dallas, Texas, that's the town"
I cry
(Oh hear me cry)
And I'm going back
Going back to stay there 'til I die
...
