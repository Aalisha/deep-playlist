Over that mountain, straight down this highway
24 hours from you
Counting the headlights, billboards and raindrops
Somehow I'll get through
Crossing the border, no danger can stop me
Oh Lord how I've been missing you

Tonight beneath the moon
One million dreams reach out to a star
Tonight I'll say a prayer
And tell the world how lucky we are
Tonight, to be in love
