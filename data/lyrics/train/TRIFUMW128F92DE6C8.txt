As the cold comes to claim up
I take the air and know your pink aroma
And I should haunt your very vestibules
And hover like the smoke over Tecoma

If I could dive my hands
To the roots of your tallest trees

And it was all I ever do
And it was all I ever do
Never feed from the hand
Never beg, never stand on two feet
