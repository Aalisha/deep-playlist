The truth is unspoken, a promise is broken
I’m under surveillance, they know what my name is
I need some protection, some love and affection
There’s 1000 reasons but one is the number

Welcome to my spaceship
It’s beautiful forever
Well, she’s right here where you left her
And the heart’s a lonely hunter

Save bottles of water and flour and sugar
Turn off the AC and hang up the bed sheets
Cover the windows, careful when the light goes
Yank out the cable and blow out the candles
...
