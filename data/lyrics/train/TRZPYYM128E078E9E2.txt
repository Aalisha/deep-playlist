He is following me
See you tomorrow
See you on monday
OK, girl
Oh, don't be, don't be late
It starts to rain

The sure is
Everybody is trying to get out the rain
Oh It feels so good
The rain and thinking of you
So as I get home, I'm gonna call you
And tell you how much I love you
Oh I feel so good

Oh, I can walk in the rain with the one I love
Feel so fine,
Walking in the rain with the one I love
All mine
Two years is all I have
Didn't say
Well I got mine in so many ways
