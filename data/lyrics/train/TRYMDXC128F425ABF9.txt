Twenty years it's breaking you down
now that you understand there's no one around.
Take a breath, just take a seat
you're falling apart and tearing at the seams.

Heaven forbid you end up alone and don't know why
Hold on tight wait for tomorrow, you'll be alright

It's on your face, is it on your mind
Would you care to build a house of your own?
How much longer
How long can you wait?
It's like you wanted to go and give yourself away.
