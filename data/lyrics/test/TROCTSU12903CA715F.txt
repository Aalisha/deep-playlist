Nothing you say or you do
Matters when I'm with you,
I think about it all the time
And realize it's not right.

I saw you, you saw me
Pretend you never known me.
Don't hold me, don't touch me
I'm not! Feeling Lonely.

Sometimes I can't help but fight
Don't you see I'm not nice?
I'm not hungry tonight
So don't! Feed me that lie.

I saw you, you saw me
Pretend you never met me.
Don't hold me, don't touch me
I'm not! Feeling lonely.
