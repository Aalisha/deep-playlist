I'm just a loser in the game of love
I'm just a stray boy in the shade
And how I wish to know what love is like
To find someone to contemplate

There's a voice and a million answers
To the questions I don't ask
A demon - I've got to contain
When I'm walking through the fen
Gonna deep into the black
There are whispers that I can't restrain

Don't give in

Rise to fame - time will come
Make your claim - time has come
For the crow to fly away

(Jorn Lande)
So you're an angel meant to walk down here
And you believe it's all divine
And you don't play by all those temporal rules
Watch the world begin to die

Alright - when the lamb's been torn to pieces,
I've been crashing from the sky
Fallen to care for the pray
They put a spoke right in your wheel
I'm the one to dare the weak
To push you all over the pain

You give in - oh

Rise to fame - time will come
...
