Walking down some highway midnight North Dakota 
Somewhere 'round late fall I knew that the time 
Has come for me I'm willing a million stars above me 
I tried to catch their fall I tried to catch their fall 

Inside I felt so empty 
A stranger to this world so lost 
And as the winter draws I'm turning north 

I'm leaving things behind I just don't need 
The only things in life of worth are free 
To anyone's who's heard the call 
And turned and walked away 
...
