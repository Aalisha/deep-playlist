Ripples round the bar they don't know what to think
For prince of the pen has himself a new favourite drink
To blow on bruised skin takes away the sting
I've half a mind to take him for a fling

The most uncouth of colours that you have ever seen
30mls of vodka lemonade and grenadine
The smoke makes me sick and i don't know where to look
...
