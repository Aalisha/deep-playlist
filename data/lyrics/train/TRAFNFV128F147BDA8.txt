I've been waiting for the longest time
I want you to come back
Maybe if the sun would shine
It'd bring my happy back

In the dark
So tired of waking up and its dark
So tired of being stuck on my own here
Norway is cold dear

And here comes June
The sun is gonna shine in June
The doctor says I'll feel better soon
Fills my vitamin D pills
He hands me the big bill

Cause I've been waiting for the longest time
I want you to come back
Maybe if the sun would shine
You'd bring my happy back
