When I was young, I was frightened by shadow monsters on my wall
And I was convinced, they would get me in the dark, if I slept at all
I knew she was there in her bedroom, so I'd tiptoe down the hall
Lay my head on the floor and try to see under her door

When it was on, I knew everything was all right
Before I could knock, she'd open the door
And I'd look up and seen that smile
