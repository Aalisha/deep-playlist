Flying chunks of hot debris rushing through the air
Vapors causing blisters, eyes blinded by the glare
Clouds that shower death, hell falling from the sky
Searing rain of molten rock, flesh begins to fry

Burning fragments, steaming stones tearing through my skin
Lodging near my organs, Iâ€™m burning from within
Parts of human bodies lay strewn on the ground
Survivors holding bleeding ears, deafened by the sound
