Corrupt politicians, purveyors of law
Give us daily bread, but not a crumb more
Premiers, Presidents and leaders of men
Fleece us like sheep again and again

We're nickel'd and dime'd into despair

If we should ever come on days
When all would start to change their ways
There'd still be some who would only see
