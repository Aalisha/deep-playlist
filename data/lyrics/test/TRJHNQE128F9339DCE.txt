At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me, at the dark end of the street
Just you and me

I know that time is gonna take its toll
We're gonna pay for the love that we stole
Ah it's a sin and we know that it's wrong
...
