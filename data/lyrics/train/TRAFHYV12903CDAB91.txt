(Peter La Farge)

Ira Hayes,
Ira Hayes.

Call him drunken Ira Hayes.
He won't answer anymore.
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian,
Nor the Marine that went to war.

Gather 'round me people there's a story I would tell,
About a brave young Indian you should remember well.
From the land of the Pima Indian, a proud and noble band,
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land.

Down the ditches of a thousand years,
The waters grew Ira's peoples' crops.
Till the white man stole the water rights,
And the sparklin' water stopped.

Now Ira's folks were hungry,
And their land grew crops of weeds.
When war came, Ira volunteered,
And forgot the white man's greed.

Call him drunken Ira Hayes.
