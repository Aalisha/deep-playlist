Positively meant to be Jimmie Vaughan

Hey baby, let me talk to you.
I wanna tell you the truth about the way I feel.
Now you know I love you.
I know it gets crazy sometimes and I’m not at home and then I’m back and then I’m gone
You’re doing your thing and I’m doing my thing and I really love you but I just want to tell you how much.
So scoot a little bit closer, please baby, and let my words put you at ease.
