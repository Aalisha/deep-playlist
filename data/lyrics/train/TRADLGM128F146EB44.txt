As I walked past Portlaoise Prison
"I'm innocent", a voice was heard to say
"My frame-up is almost completed.
My people all look the other way. "

Seven years ago his torture started
A forced confession he was made to sign.
Young Irish men specially trained and chosen
Were on the heavy gang that made him run the line.

Others in the Bridewell heard him screaming
Even prison doctors could see
His injuries were not self-inflicted
Those who tipped the scales did not agree.

Give the Wicklow Boy his freedom
