Beware the bottled thoughts of angry young men
Secret compartments hide all of skeletons
Little girl wants to make her home with him
In the middle of the shore she wonders

Don't know what you asked for
Don't know what you asked for

All young lovers know why
Nightmares blind their mind's eye
Your rube is young and handsome
So new to your bedroom floor
You know damn well where you'll go

I've loved so many times and I've drowned them all
From the coral graves they rise up when darkness falls
