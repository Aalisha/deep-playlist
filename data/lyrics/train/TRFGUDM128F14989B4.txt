I don't need anyone
To tell me how to run my life
Got along alright so far
I don't really think I need to hear your advice
I've got my mind made up know what I wanna do
I'll do it anyway I choose
So just sit back shut up for a minute let me show you what I'm gonna do

I ain't got no time to waste on you
You ain't got no time to give
Too hung up on all you did

If you don't like it
If you don't like it I don't care
If you don't like it
Hit the road cause I just don't care
If you don't like it
If you don't like it I don't care
If you don't like it
Hit the road cause I just-just-just don't care
