So every single day begins and ends the same.
I see them pushing to get on board a crowded train.
Out of the pouring rain, to face another pain.
Why you so afraid of the other side?
It's just a big parade, it's people on display.
If one should stumble, imagine what the rest would say.
They're making harmless sounds.
Their heads go round and round.
Why do you stay away from the other side?

Now you have to believe in me.
I'll live Until The Day I die.
You have to believe in me.
I'll live Until The Day I die.

Until The Day I Die
