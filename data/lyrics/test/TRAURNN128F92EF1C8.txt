The rain wasn't made of water
The snow didn't have a place in the sun
So we slipped behind the rainbow
And laid back till we had done

And then the rain wasn't made of water
And the snow didn't have a place in the sun
So we slipped behind the rainbow
And laid back till we had done

Through northern lights on back streets
I told the coachman "just drive me on
It's the same old destination
But a different world to sing upon"
So he threw back his head and he counted
I got out about five to nine
And I waved at the stage door-keeper
Said "mister, get me to the stage on time"
