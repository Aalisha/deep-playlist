My phone is off the hook,
You're cramping up my style.
I can't believe you feel neglected,
You are such a child.
I'm going off the edge,
I think you too obsessed.
You're so attached.
I'm about to unthe phone,
It needs a rest.

Won't leave me alone,
Get a busy tone,
Stuck inside my home,
I'm going crazy.
Need a little space,
I am sick of your face,
Now a mental place,
What have you done to me?

I'm insane,
You want make me insane.
