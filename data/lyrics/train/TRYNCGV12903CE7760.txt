This time I'll tear it all away - you're holding me up
But I don't think that I said so
One glimpse my throat sinks down in chains
You're holding me up
But I don't think that I said so

Fight to fight but make it reciprocal
Blindfold judgement made me so clinical
So - so not
A hand meets fury mindless and minimal
I've been chasing time but I'm cynical
So - so not
