Where you come from
You learn to disappear
To cover up your fear
With punk rock and stuff
When you were a kid
You listened to The Clash
You learned to never ask
Where your daddy was

Once more around the old main drag
They never said it but they thought you were a fag
Some people push till a kid goes boom
Late at night it got dark in your room

Ah your love in a car
You promised her everything
Not knowing what everything
Really was
She's the first girl you kissed
