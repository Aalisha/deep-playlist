I'm on the road with the best band I know
And Fia's asleep on Mono's shoulder
We're on our way to Oslo, yes, we are
We are on our way Stockholm

Gustav's asleep with his headphones on
He made a joke and fell asleep
And I can hear a soft sound, oh yeah
From Elvis Presley's Return to Sender

What would have happened if I'd never asked you to play in this band with me?
I don't know what I'd do without you
I don't know what I would do without, what I would do without you
