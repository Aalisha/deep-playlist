Fortunately you have someone who relies on you
We started out as friends but the thought of you just caves me in
The symptoms run so deep, it's much too late to turn away
We started out as friends

Oh, sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

All alone with you makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love and the earth rotates to our dictates
Slowly we make love
