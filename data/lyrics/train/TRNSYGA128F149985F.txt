Stranded
I've been watchin' while you're burning bridges around you
Think you're helpless
Broken by the alibi's and promises that weren't true

But it's not all bad
You know that you can bring it all back
Reach out and find what you once had
And you'll see if you read all the signs

I can see that you're in need of some protection
Don't fret, don't cry
Just go ahead and change it, just gotta face it
Everybody needs a little high

I can make you the centre of attention
Let me dry your eyes
It's kinda been rough lately, live it up, baby
Everybody needs a little high

Say it now, if you wanna run away just
Say it now, use a little self control
Say it now, oh yeah

Oh, your life is wasted
