You thinks it's a joke, I find no reason
Why I should laugh at you?
You think it's a joke to take advantage
Of the life that supports you

Push and push suppress the weaker ones
You can find two words, with emotions you are numb
You think the world revolves around the things you buy
I think of loneliness that you will die

I want to defend defenseless, let the meek inherit the earth
And your intelligence gives you nothing to mask your ignorance
If there's a God above to judge what's right and wrong
