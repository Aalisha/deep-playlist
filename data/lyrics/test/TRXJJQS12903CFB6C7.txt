Stand back and watch - order falls in place
Left by the wasteside - misled in our haste
Following leaders - but they should follow behind us
Bearing the clout - casting more doubt
Drowning in water too shadow

Nip at your heels - they gnaw at the rope
Hung by a thread - left without hope
Look up and focus - gamble and risk your routine ways
Turning the gear - time drawing near
Embrace the plain we face our fear

Time consumes time
Quick to grasp - too tough to find
Time consumes me
