It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now
It such a sweet memory
Baby of you and me
And how we used to beautifully young
Sometimes I just sit and smile
Thinkin about ya for a while
Wondering how ya doin now

I heard you were married
Had a few babies
Put on on a few pounds, that grown man weight
But heard you looked real good
Makin six figures
Well I could of figured you were always ambitious
You went to college, I did my singing thing
Moving around it's hard to stay in touch
But I've missed you so much over the years
Just wanted to give you a hollar say hey
How you doin these days
