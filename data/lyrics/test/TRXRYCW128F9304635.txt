Baby love, sometimes it's hard for me to tell you what I'm thinking of
So I try to find a way that I can show you love
What you mean to me

It's not enough to give you everything that you were ever dreaming of
I could never find a way that I could pay you love
For all the things you do

'Cause when my life gets crazy
The only one who comforts me is you, is you

When I'm feeling all alone
When I'm searching for someone I can run to
I reach for you

When I need a hand to hold
Or a place where I can feel what love can do
I reach for you

Needing you is something that I've really gotten used to
...
