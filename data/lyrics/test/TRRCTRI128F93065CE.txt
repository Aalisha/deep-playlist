She said,
"I'm jealous of Los Angeles, she gets to keep you for a month or two
And I don't know if I can handle this the thought of being without you."

I know it's cold, but baby maybe we can stay a little longer
Then warm up those toes, the last thing we need is to blow our cover
And I know it's tough to reconsider what you thought was love
But I'm so proud of all the plans you're speaking of

Lay with me stay with me now, oh
'Cause you are all I think about

She said, "I'm jealous of Los Angeles, she gets to keep you for a month or two
And I don't know if I can handle this the thought of being without you."
