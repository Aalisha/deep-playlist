It's your smile it's your sight when I turn and just leave you there
Please, don't say you adore me I'm already too aware
So, I'm off to keep my distance
My minute of control

Is this love, is this love, is this love
Are we getting old?
And I'm so scared nothing seems to lack
Still I won't go back to love
To love I won't go back to love

For striated I feel it'd tremble beneath your skin
...
