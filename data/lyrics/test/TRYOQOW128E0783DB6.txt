you look at me
curious what i'm made of
sugar or steam
and what kind of man i love
what i believe
what i know and what i crave
all my pet peeves
where i've shed and when i stain
do you know

cuz i'm not here to be around
and be that girl that you forget about
cuz all i want is just to be a song
that you can feel longer than just right now
so come on baby let me be the girl
that you can count on to rock your world
and then you'll see there's so much than curves
...
