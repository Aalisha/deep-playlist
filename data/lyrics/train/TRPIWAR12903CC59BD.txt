Start digging

You have to dig through the cold hard ground
To find people like me
They don't make 'em like this anymore
I'm an obsolete machine

So say goodbye to those empty faces
And run to the fields
And start the digging the cold hard ground
In hopes to find me

Start digging

Been digging for days and nights
Not finding a thing
