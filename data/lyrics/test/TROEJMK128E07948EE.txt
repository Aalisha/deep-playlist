Walk of life
Walk of life

Let me care for someone else
I don't wanna talk about myself
I need to shed the light on you
To understand the things you do

Could we share a little time?
Break the bread and sip the wine
Now's no time to hesitate
Save me from this heavy weight

Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?
Are you gonna see more than you dreamed you'd see?
Are you gonna walk hand in hand with me?
Can you be the one who sets my shadow free?

Are you gonna try and understand with me?
Are you gonna be the best that you could be?
Are you gonna walk the walk of life with me?

Walk of life
Walk of life

Losing my reality
You could bring this back to me
With you I wanna spend my youth
