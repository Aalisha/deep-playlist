Can I have your attention
What are we starting here
Just look around you 'cause the answer is clear
Listen, listen
And hear the coming sound
All of the children are singing it loud

Let's be the revolution
That lives for hold nothing back, nothing back

We're after your heart, after your heart
All of the walls now, are breaking apart
Live like we see it, love like we mean it
This is the start, we're after your heart
