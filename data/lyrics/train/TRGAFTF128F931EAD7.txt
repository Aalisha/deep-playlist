I am the boy your mother wanted you to meet
But I am broken and torn with heels at my feet (?)
And with your purest light why don't you shine on me
Well I should have been an angel
But I'm too dumb to speak
Now as she gets nearer, the visions get clearer
I'm kneeling, weeping
I will hold her dear
Oh, If your eyes water, you've got your favorite number to spin

And oh, what a crying shame, a crying shame
