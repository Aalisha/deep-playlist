Small talk on the radio
It seems I am going nowhere today

Small talk gets you nowhere choose
Between a curtain or a star
And I'm silent to the dark

'Cause when I needed someone to talk to
You were the only one around
Small cost, it pays to be alone

Small talk on the radio
It seems I am going nowhere today
(Not today)
Small talk gets you nowhere
I'm silent to the dark and tepid
