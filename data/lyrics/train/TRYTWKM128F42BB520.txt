Lucinda Jones workin' at the I-Hop
Ten years worth of bacon, eggs an' tears
She's waited on every creed an' color
While waitin' on this day to get here

Graveyard shifts, two big tips
Makin' every quarter count
Was worth it all to see her son
In that cap an' gown

There are times in life when you gotta crawl
Lose your grip, trip an' fall
When you can't lean on no one else
That's when you find yourself

I've been around an' I've noticed that
Walkin's easier when the road is flat
Them danged ol' heels'll get you every time
Yeah, the good Lord gave us mountains
So we could learn how to climb
