On your guard as you lurk along the sand,
A paper face won't mask your fear.
Unrelenting consequences for this inquisition,
Venture forth and give yourself away with the scent of unfamiliarity.

For razor teeth love their human silk,
They long to savor unexpecting flesh.
To drink a carcass dry is to taste the Sunderban.
