I've been listening to this song for hours
And my head aches but that doesn't stop me
It keeps repeating and now my eyes burn
They have turned red
And I do this to myself
I should get out
But there is nowhere to go on a Tuesday night
This restless feeling
There is no cure for
So I wait

It's a lovely day
To never feel this way again
And will I ever find
Someone who understands my mind?
I don't think so
It's just a sea of faces and vacant stares
...
