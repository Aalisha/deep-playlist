Hey girl it's Shayla
Oh my God, have I got a story for you

I got a call from my agency and they asked me to play at this club
You are never gonna believe the shit that I had to go through

So anyway, I'm walking to the club
And as I approach this massive line up a front
I walk up to this big fat guy at the door and introduce myself
He was like "Look, stop wasting my time
And line up just like everybody else"
I was like "What?! I'm wasting your time?!

Motherfucker, you waste time
Motherfucker, you waste time
Motherfucker, you waste time
Motherfucker, you waste time
