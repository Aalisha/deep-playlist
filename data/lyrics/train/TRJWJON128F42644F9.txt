OH OH OH
gotta gotta get away

There is a place where we can go
(but you're got to leave behind you're worries)
There is a place that you don't know
(but you're got to leave behind you're stories)

'cause the summer's gone
and you're so alone
but the show is on

OH OH OH OH
can we go? can we go?
...
