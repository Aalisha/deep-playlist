Deep in the darkest mental recess
There dwelt a force within the abscess
That you called fear
You were never alone

One final victim's dying dreams
An ecstasy of filth and screams
Emancipated nightmares
On a bloodied floor of dead prayers

In the walls you've built around your feeble mind
I'll sleep through the cracks
Think of me as something you can control
But not predict the backlash
Suppressed inside, pent up terror mounts
