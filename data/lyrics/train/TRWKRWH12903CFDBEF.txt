(VERSE 1)
Girl I've been waitin' on this long hard day to get over
So I can rest my head right here on your shoulder
I just wanna lay here and feel ya breathe
Listen to the rhythm of your heartbeat
And see where it leads...

(CHORUS 1)
We're wide awake but girl I wanna make you close your eyes
And say my name like only you can say it and hold me tight
All I need is only you and me alone tonight
(1) I wanna make you close your eyes... Oh yeah...
