Baby I miss you can't wait to kiss you It's been a minute since I've seen you
and the kids, last show is over and I'm that much closer to holding you in my
arms again. I'm coming home tonite

Tonite, tonite I can't wait til I get home
Tonite, tonite I can't wait til I get home

I'm boarding the plane now can't wait to touch down. I hope your ready because
I am, to touch you to feel you only God knows what we'll do its been so long
