Oh
End of another long show and I search for the love of a lifetime
This is the best that you gave because stars aren't allowed to get lonely
My heart screams look past my frame, I'm in need of some laughter
Oh, please let me live in your world I hope that eyes can see
That I need someone to love me for me, me
So you ask yourself oh, this feeling is it true from the heart
Was it my fame and glory why the stars in your eyes wrote the story
And if I want satisfaction, I can have anyone that I see
But why should I settle for less wen I need you to love me for me
Oh, so confused, is this real, do you love me
Give me the feeling you care endlessly, my love
