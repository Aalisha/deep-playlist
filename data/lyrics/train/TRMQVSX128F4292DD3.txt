It's high on a mountain, the warm winds are blowing
And where the winds are blowing to there ain't no way of knowing
The mountain grass is short, it's dry and close to burning
Crying out for water as the season's turning

The sweet smell of the pines, the tall western cedar
Drifting on the wind through the mountains like a river

And I've been too long away from this wild open sky
On the concrete trails that wind through the canyons dark and wide
