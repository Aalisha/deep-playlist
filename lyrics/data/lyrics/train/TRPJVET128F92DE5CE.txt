Anytime you're feeling low
And you got no place to go
You don't have to be blue
Here's all you gotta do

Call me on the telephone
Tell me that you're all alone
And I'll come a runnin' to you
Baby thats all you gotta do

All you gotta do when you're lonesome
Is to call on me
And I'll come a runnin' to you
As a fast as I can

I'll love and squeeze you uh huh huh
...
