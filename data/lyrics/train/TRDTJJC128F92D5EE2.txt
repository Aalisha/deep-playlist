Through the marshes
And through the filtering glades
Through the corn
And through the scything fields
The summer sun
Dances and rages
The summer sun
Flies burning into the light

And who shall die
At the death of the corn?
Rise, rise, rise

The sleeping giant awakes
He circles into circling
The wild Wild Hunt
Dawn dies at dusk
...
