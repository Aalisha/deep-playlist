I sold my old Camaro
I sold my fishing boat
A friend said he would cosign
On a small commercial loan
So I shopped around until I found
A rig within my means
I put fifteen thousand dollars down
On the Kenworth of my dreams

My sister s husband helped me out
When we took the thing apart
Every bolt and piston
I knew them all by heart
We cleaned her out and painted her
And brought her up to speed
I proudly put my name upon
...
