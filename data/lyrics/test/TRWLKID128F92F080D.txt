Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You naughty bad, bad, bad, bad, boy
You make me feel so good, knew you would

The way you hold me tight
You get me so excited
You do me, oh, so right
My heart goes beat beat, beat beat, beat beat

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
I want you, bad, bad, bad, bad, boy
You make me feel so good, knew you would

(Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy)
(will be boys)Boys
Always get so restless
(Bad boy, bad boy)
(Boys will be boys)
