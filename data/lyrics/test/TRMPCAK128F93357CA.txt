She held lightning in her hands
She's been cornered by the man
I pretend no answering riot
As we hid it on the hill we ran
Fuel the mission 
With our passion
Fighting still we ran

Do you know the way
To the silver coloured road
By the city that's run dry
On a sequin covered horse
And they're waiting for us to arrive
200 naked pure gold girls 
...
