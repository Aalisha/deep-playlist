Be not a Dread, neither a baldhead
Just be a Ras with your pretty curly locks
Because the name "Dread" portrays viciousness
While the name "Ras" portrays righteousness

It's true, it's true
You know it's true, so true now

Therefore not curse at what I might say
Neither cut your locks and go astray
For they are Ras in Africa
A place called Ethiopia, yeh-hah
Where bredrens grow their curly locks
To show the world that they are Ras now

It's true, it's true
You know it's true, so true now

So be not a Dread, neither a baldhead
Just be a Ras with your pretty curly locks
...
