Face to face, we've come from lands undone.
We bend and twist this broken mess, yet to see the sun.
And now soon you'll see the glory.
And I'm proof of living dead.

DESTROY WHAT YOU'VE BUILT, GIVE UP THE WILL
(Trust me, 'cause so far I've stood strong.
Trust me, 'cause so far I've stood strong.
Trust me, 'cause so far I've stood tall.
Just listen to what I say.)

This is how we live. This is what we breathe.
And it's insulting to my face.
It's something I'll take under my wing,
I will fly until I sing this free. (Stop, surrender to fate.)
A servant to your dreams, this blood will spill.
