Last night he called from Dallas he was havin' a beer at the Crystal Palace
He said honey you won't be alone for long
I got to make just one more stop to pick up a ring in Little Rock
And I'm gonna head this semi straight for home
Fourteen wheels a whinin' four big headlights shinin'
Him and that semi been away too long
Hope he don't get stop from speedin' cause I've got everything he's needin'
...
