Cheated again 'cause I play by your rules
Cheated again and now I look like a fool
Cheated again by a trick from a book
Cheated again, well, you sure got me hooked, yeah

Cheated again 'cause I'm always too kind
Cheated again 'cause I was too blind
Cheated again, yeah, I fell for that one
Cheated again by your silver tongue

Oh, oh, now I know
I've seen your true colors
