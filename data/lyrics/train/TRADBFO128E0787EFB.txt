So you're eager to fly on a silver wing
Left soon in the morning on a silver wing
It was high over housetops and the chimneys of this town
You made your getaway, and you never looked down

I mean all else failed and you counted on a silver wing
Came break of day and you sailed on a silver wing
There was no time for eulogies
There was no time for song
...
