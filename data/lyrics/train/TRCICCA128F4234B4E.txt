Oh, don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
He made this world for us to live in and gave us everything
And all He asks of us is we give each other love, oh ya

Don't go and talk about my father
'Cause God is my friend, Jesus is my friend
He loves us whether or not we know it
