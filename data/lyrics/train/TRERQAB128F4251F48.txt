When I die, Lord
Oh, won't You put my soul up on a train
Won't You send it southbound
Give a cool blues man name

'Cause I've been lost on them back roads
And many times, I've gone blind
Losing faith in my family
Had drew me out my damn mind

But on the south side of heaven
Won't You take me home
'Cause I've been broke down for so long
And Lord, it's getting cold

I've been a desperado in West Texas
