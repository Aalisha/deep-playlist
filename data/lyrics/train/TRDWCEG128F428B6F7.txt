Hey baby, you never felt this good
Freedom through the stereo and you wish you could
Take a bite, do a dance and get lost on a crusade
Jump on this soul train, destination unknown

We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up with nowhere to go
I told you so
I told you so
We're all dressed up
We got nowhere to go
All dressed up
I told you so
I told you so
I told you so
