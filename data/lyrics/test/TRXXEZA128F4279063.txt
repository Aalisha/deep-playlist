Gotta get, gotta get away
Cause I really don't belong here
Gotta get, gotta get away
You're all a part of my biggest fear
Gotta get, gotta get away
Cause I really don't belong here
Gotta get, gotta get away
Won't you get me the fuck out of here?

Everyone's so happy
But I couldn't care less
This whole situation
Brings the worst out of me
