[Originally performed by Heart]

I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
no answer on the telephone
and the night goes by so very slow
oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
...
