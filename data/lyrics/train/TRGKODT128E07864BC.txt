You blame no one there’s no one to blame
Now only your name remains
You’re not a ghost you're just a girl who lost hope
And certain words spoken convince you to call

Just give me one more chance
One more chance to claim
Why people don’t feel the same

I need one more chance
One more chance to explain
Why there’s no such thing as a claim to fame

So you hold your breath until it feels like it’s left you
