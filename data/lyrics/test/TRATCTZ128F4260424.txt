If tomorrow all the things were gone
I'd hoped for all my life
And I had to start again
With just my family by my side

I'd thank my God above
To be living here today
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away

I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me

And I gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt, I love this land
...
