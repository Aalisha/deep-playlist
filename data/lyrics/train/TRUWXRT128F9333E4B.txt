Ooh, yeah!

Desert of ashes and ruins
Poisonous rain falling from the sky
Falling from the sky
Torture of fever and wounds
Soldiers of pain only born to die
Only born to die

Deep in the night far away, far away
I see the light
The sun also rises in hell
The sun also rises in hell

Underground cities of waste
Angels in black screaming out for blood
...
