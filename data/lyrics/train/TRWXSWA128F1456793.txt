Look in my eyes
There's a genuine attraction
Your love has taken over me
And I'm so surprised
How I'm controlling my intentions
'Cause in my heart
I know you're not ready
Ooh baby
I'm living off a fantasy
Dreaming of how it will be
Oooh the touchin' the kissin'
Is what you been missin'
'Cause if I had my way
You'd be lyin' here next to me

I'm waitin' for the day
That you will stay all night
Baby I'm waitin' for the day
You say the timing's right
I don't need no explanation, girl
I know just how you feel
The love is real
Your love is real

(I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for the day)
