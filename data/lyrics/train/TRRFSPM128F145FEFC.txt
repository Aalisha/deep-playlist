It sure is good to see you, girl
You're still the only one
You're looking just as lovely
As the day our love was born

Remember when you told me
I could make it on my own
Without you here to hold me
I'm afraid, I'm not that strong

Happy ever after's
Not so easy to acquire
Only you could ever measure
Up to my desire

Baby, you gave up on me
Just a little bit too soon
And left me here for lonely
Howlin' at the moon
...
