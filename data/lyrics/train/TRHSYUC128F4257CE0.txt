I have become endlessly numb, I don't know myself anymore
Things I have done always on the run, I can see myself in deep fall
Within or without but never allowed to be first in line in this life
Pushed to the limit the edge I have seen it, I'm loosing my will

All these years and all these days of my life
I've been blind and never saw through the lies
Now it's time, time to unchain my heart
Release myself and to be me
...
