Will you becoming when the War call comes
Will you be coming when the War call comes
Will you becoming when the War call comes
Will you becoming when the War call comes

Spread your wings and fly
The future ours
Be masters of your own domain
In the 13th Hour

Give peace a holiday and time to grow
...
