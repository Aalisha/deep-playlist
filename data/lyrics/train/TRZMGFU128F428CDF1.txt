You're born dead
Into oblivion to be brought back
To our world - you have no soul
Lifeless your life is, no one can tell you why
Why this life, why was I brought to this place
Why must I deal with this fate
Why must I feel this disgrace
Why does my soul have no face
Where's my life
I have no more will to live
There is nothing I can give
Living in your borrowed time
That you gave me
