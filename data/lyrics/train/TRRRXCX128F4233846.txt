Would it kill you to breathe easy?
Only seventeen miles lay
Between you and me
I could make it if I had to

I don't break easily
You've got my counsel, thick as theives
If there's a crime, we'll keep it secret
For there's only trace amounts left in your blood

You may be a sinner, but you may be justified

Just keep your mouth shut
Keep your guard up
I swear I'll make it right
