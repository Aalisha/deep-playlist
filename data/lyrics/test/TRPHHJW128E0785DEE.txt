Fate took a freeway to my room
Said too much while he stayed and left too soon
Bright on an evening sea
He washed in with the tide
Deep in each other's dreams
Where all but dreams had died

Wretched in your thoughts
Gentle hate within the love you bought
Words fade like flowers shadowed
There beneath your wall
Wind cries from every angle
