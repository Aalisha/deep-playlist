we held each other tight
and ran away into the night
oh baby you were so afraid
we knew we couldn't stay
our parents didn't understand
the love we had together

we were teenagers
far away from home
we were cold and all alone

tell me baby all through the night
that you'll never let me go
tell me baby cause I want the world to know
