Born from shade
And undead desire
In the glade
A secret fire

Hidden from
Time and sin
Ardent gods
Stir again

Surge, Baphomet
Graint me Anathema
Purge me, Bephomet
From worlds in denial

Through demise
And desecration
In disguise
Dwells the lord of ecstasy

Defies the lie
Of divine castration
Claims his prize
The awoken few's apostasy

Intoxicate me with ambrosia
Thawed on mother nature's
...
