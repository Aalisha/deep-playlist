Disgusted by your weakness
You have no right to live
To know you is to hate you
But your life? s yours to give

You monkey see, you monkey do
You? re always doing what they tell you to
You? re such a puppet on a string
You don? t get it

I won? t bow to something
That I? ve never seen
Can? t believe in something
That doesn? t believe in me

I? m not blood of your blood
