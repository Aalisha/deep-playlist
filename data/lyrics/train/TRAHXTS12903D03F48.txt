False hearts have been my downfall, pretty women have been my craze
I’m sure my false hearted lover will drive me to my lonesome grave

They’ll bite the hand that feeds them, spend the money that you saved
From your heartstrings and silk garters they’ll build a doghouse on your grave

When my earthly stay is over, sink my dead body in the sea
You can tell my false hearted lover that the whales will watch over me
