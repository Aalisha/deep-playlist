Seventeen, seventeen
She's a solid seventeen
Young enough to dance and sing
Old enough to get that swing
Past sixteen just been kissed
Graduated and got that twist
The kind of love you can't resist
At seventeen

Now sloppy shirt, old blue jeans
Dirty shoes by all means
Patch of blonde, peroxide hair
