Hello and good day dear,
How do you do this to me, over and over?
Tell me your secrets, tell me the truth,
I'm drowning deep inside of you.
If this tears, it's tearing in two,
It's so close
I'm turning into a stranger.
I'll know this for sure,
When you're here again,
Oh no it's here again.

Not you, not you,
These two souls just can't be one,
These two souls just can't be bound.
