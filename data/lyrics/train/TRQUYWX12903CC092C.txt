Separate yourself.
Fuck it all.
Go ahead without the slightest thought of concern
The bitter taste of frustration can't catch me by surprise anymore
This time we're going all out
And we just don't give a fuck

When the time has come
And all the songs have been 'sung.
We will burn our bridges
In the night of love
I search for another choice
To keep me sane
And put my feet back on the ground
Separate yourself.
