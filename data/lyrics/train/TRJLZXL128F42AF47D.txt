Na na na
Na na na
Na na na

If he cute then he got bad credit
If got good credit then the sex is so so
Hot sex but he's stayin wit his mom
He in between jobs and he ain't got no dough
If his dough right then it's so tight
Way too nice, where can a girl get a thug
With Puffy money, street cred, good lookin great in bed

How come them guys we like so much can't come through for us
How come them guys we like so much can't be serious
He's lookin good as can be (or)
He's switching harder than me (or)
All females know that mans uneligible
How come when the type of guys that I like that they come into my life
they never stay I let em go... they so... uneligible
