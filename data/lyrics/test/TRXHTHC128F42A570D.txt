I lay at night and wonder, will you be here by Christmas
Though you're far away from me, I still need you near me
What will it take for you to know, I want you here with me
What will I have to do to show; I need you here with me

This Christmas, could be the one that I get to hold you
This Christmas could be the one that I get to hold you (Hold you)

I decorate the tree and hope you'll be here by Christmas
