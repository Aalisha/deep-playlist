Honey I'm a good man
But I'm a cheatin' man
And I'll do all I can
To get a lady's love
And I wanna doo right
I don't wanna hurt nobody
If I slip well then i'm sorry
Yes I am

When I was a young boy
I use to watch my daddy play
And in my heart I'd always say
He was wrong
He had to be crazy
Knocked stoned cold out of his mind
To be leaving my pretty momma all alone
She'd always sit patient and waitin' then cussin' and cryin'
And who would have to be there to comfort her
And I would have to look my momma
Right square in her eyes
And I swear that I would never hurt no one like that
