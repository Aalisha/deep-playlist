I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never wanna let you go
'cause you started something can't you see
that ever since we met you've had a hold on me
it happens to be true I only wanna be with you
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I wanna spend each moment of the day with you
look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
