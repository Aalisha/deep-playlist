I woke up this morning and my head, i started roaming
Now nothing's right, nothing's right
Don't remember being born, don't know why we're being torn
Now nothing's right, nothing's right
I open up my mouth just to let the demon shout
'Bout my dirty little schemes, that the wettest of my dreams are you
Nothing's right, nothing's right

Over and over I'm feeling the same of loneliness
And under me, under me feeling the madman

I'm breaking off a piece of what's left of what was me
But it feels all right, it feels all right
I'm laying on your road 'cause I thought that it might hold
It feels all right, feels all right
