I will be waiting right here only to roam
When the bells chime like there is no tomorrow
(And you're gonna take me home)

Never gonna ever gonna belong to another, no
Never gonna ever gonna belong to another, no

Leave me alone, I am not an angel yet

My candle shines at night time through the dawn
But my darling you have fallen and don't belong
(And I can't carry on)
