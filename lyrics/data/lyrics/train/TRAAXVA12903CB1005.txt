Everything goes around there is no need to stay...
My world turned upside down I feel on black day

And how to disappear away?

I'm mislaid, I'm deprived, and my heart was beating down
I can read on you face the time I've lost until now

And how to disappear away?
And how to disappear away?

I carry the wreck of my soul
Under the surface, the world is off
...
