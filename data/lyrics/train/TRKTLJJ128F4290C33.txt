We've been so close to each other
Can't think of a moment that you weren't there
We've been through so much together
Can't think of a feeling that we haven't shared

Ooh, how many lovers
Ever find the kind of love that we got
Ooh, ain't many others
Because you know what we got is a rare thing
Oh, it's everlasting

This love is as strong as steel
Can't break it up or break it down, it's always gonna be around
This love is a love that's real
It's as deep as any ocean goes, it's gonna last, don't you know
This love's strong as steel

We've been right here for each other
Even through the times when times were hard for us
