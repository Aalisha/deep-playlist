I woke up with a scream in my throat
Something evil I saw then I choked
Never thought I would dream of LaVey
And never see the light of day

Then the dawn reeked of swine like a slut
I'm in bed as the light got so dim
And the globe of ascent turned to suet
A new night came rolling in
New night came rolling in

When you come I greet you, we are the same
And we make love in the dark
You can hide, I see you, the night's alive, I know
To survive, I need you and you need me

Cruel and corrupt, please make it stop
I should be fast asleep but I'm still up
...
