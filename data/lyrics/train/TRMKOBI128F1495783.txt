She's got a sticker on her pickup
Says made by Smith and Wesson
She's a little Texas twister
In a big old black Stetson

She's an angel in red ropers
And a devil in blue jeans
She's every cowgirl's nightmare
And she's every cowboy's dream

She can rope and ride 'em
Bareback and tango with the best
Brand a longhorn, down a long neck
Lord, tame the whole wild west
