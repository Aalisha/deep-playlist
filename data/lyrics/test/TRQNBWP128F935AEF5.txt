Here they come, the winged minions of the dark lord
As black clouds, they block the light of the sun
By their side, flies the king of the demon locusts
The destroyer lord, and chosen son of the apocalypse

This for sure, is the end - of human race
Thunder roars, the abyss now, gaping wide
Darkness unleash, it's armies upon the world
The air filled with the stench of sulphur...
And burning flesh...

When the humans thought, they had seen the worst of hell
The ground explodes and fills the sky of dirt, and shattered bone
...
