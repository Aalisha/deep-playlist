Farewell Angelina,
the bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits,
I must follow the sound,
The triangle tingles
and the trumpets play slow,

Farewell Angelina,
the sky is on fire
and I must go.

Theres no need for anger,
theres no need for blame,
Theres nothing to prove,
evrythings still the same.
Just a table standing empty
by the edge of the see

Means farewell Angelina,
the sky is trembling,
and I must leave.
