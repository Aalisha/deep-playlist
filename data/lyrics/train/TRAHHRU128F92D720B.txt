In August I went out to the country for resting
There was a family of swallows in the barn there nesting
I saw the little ones and their feathers were breezy
I pictured their life and I thought it was easy
I said these guys just have to sit there and squeak
And their mother comes back with insects in her beak to feed them

And I said I had never heard of such a journey
But someone knows better than me
