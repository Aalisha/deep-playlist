(Margie Hendrix)

So if I give up (yes, I'm packin' up)
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of the town)
Packin' up (yes, I'm packin' up)
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of the town)
I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound

Said if I get up (yes, I'm packin' up)
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of town)
Oh yeah (yes, I'm packin' up)
Movin' out of the town (movin' out of the town)
I'm not chained and I'm no longer bound

My suitcase's ready
My clothes are too
And these are the things
You took me through
