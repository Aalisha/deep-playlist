Lonely days and lonely nights
Life's been full of misery
I've been rcying, crying, crying
Since you walked out on me
Woman, one day you will know
You gotta reap what you sow

I've been watching you baby
Tears in my eyes
See you laughing pretty woman
But some day you'll be crying
You just wait and see
...
