There are times that I should try, to be so much more alive
But if time was right then I would be with you again
Or do you worry that I try to avoid the point and then deny
The time I spent deciding it was you again

It's when I live in a hiding place
It's the only way I feel safe
When I'm safe in a hiding place
(that's not hidden now)
I'm safe in a hiding place
It's the only way I feel safe
When I'm safe in a hiding place
...
