Loving, fresh as the morning dew
Sunrise talks just to you
Nocturnal night one last adieu

I'm coming, I'm going
I'm swimming, I'm flowing
I'm right here beside you babe

Passion was not the answer
Was not the question
Yet it was all of this and more

Your river and heart light
The ebb in the tide at night
The do, in the do me babe

I'm dreaming of the one I love
I fall into a slumber deep
In eyes as black as ebony
And if there ever was a spark
It's when we're shadow boxing in the dark

(I love you, shadow boxing baby, in the dark)
Do I have to break it down for you?
(I need to break it down babe)
Straight from my heart
(Straight from my heart)
My love is found baby

Ooh, baby
Loving, warm as a zephyr breeze
Soft when you're touching me baby
...
