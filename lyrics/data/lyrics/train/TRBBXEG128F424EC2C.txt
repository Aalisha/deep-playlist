Published by goody two tunes, inc. - bmi

You got your hands in my pockets
You're whisperin' lies in my ear
Such promiscuous intentions
Don't mistake me for someone who cares
There were times I fooled myself, yeah
Thinkin' I was someone else
Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I could do, yeah
Lovers are babes in arms (babes in arms)
Yes it's true, that's right, true, yes it's true, ooh

Such a restless condition
The way you're turnin' it on
