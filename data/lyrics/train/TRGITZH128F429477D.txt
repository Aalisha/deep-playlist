The bottles are all empty; the potion’s gone
Powers promised like the dawn
It just won't carry on
I leave the empties on the doorstep to be filled by time
Is he a wizard or a teacher? Is she a friend of mine?
I left a note and signed with haste
“Give me a packet of peace to taste
And if you're willing, an extra crate
Of any power to combat hate”
Cause though I heard that hate brings pain
And I need love to take the strain
