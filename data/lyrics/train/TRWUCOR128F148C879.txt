it feels so good outside
i think i'll stay here (stay here)
and if you want to die
i think i'll care
same kind of gateway without time
the rocks are tumbling
if you want to die
i think i'll care

i don't want to say
it happened to me
i am going away
i think i'll care

it feels so good outside
i think i'll stay here (stay here)
and if you want to die
i think i'll care (i'll care)
same kind of gateway without time
the rocks are tumbling
if you want to die
i think i'll care

i don't want to say
it happened to me
