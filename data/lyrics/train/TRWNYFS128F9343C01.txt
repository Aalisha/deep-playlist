I've had enough, the morning papers chill me to the bone
Eyes sewn shut, stilted conversation breaking up
Heads cracking up, biological depression, drugs aren't enough
The travesty of science waking up

I've had enough, my thinning blood
Reaction based anxiety

I've had enough, frustration isn't helping, turning black
...
