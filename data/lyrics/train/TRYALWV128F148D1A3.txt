I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk up on the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic, the power of the spell
Not to serve in heaven but one day rule in hell

Power
 (Power power power)
Power
 (Power power power)
Power
 (Power power power)
Power

This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill, the power to feel
The power of blood, the triumph of steel
Greater than the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy, to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the Master's plan

Power
 (Power power power)
Power
