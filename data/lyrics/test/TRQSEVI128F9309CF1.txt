They face the night
Will they return again?
Eyes wide with fright
Religion they defend

Holding their guns with a tight grip
Hiding their "sighs" as they tray...

And they pray
So I pray

The last thing to remember
You can't run away
There'll be no surrender
The lives are lost but they are free at last

Marching on - Can you see the children of the dawn
They are the chosen ones who suffer in the end
Marching on - Can you see the children of the dawn
...
