nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah

When you and I first met
We were so inseparable (So inseparable)
And on that last day I left
Thinkin we'd need a miracle (Need a miracle)
Cause every little word that you said to me
Became the biggest pain in my heart
And all my pride making me pretend
You'd be so happy that we're apart
You just don't understand

You just don't understand
You got to be there for me
You hold my heart in your hand
You got to be there for me
You just don't understand

nah nah nah nah nah
nah nah nah nah
