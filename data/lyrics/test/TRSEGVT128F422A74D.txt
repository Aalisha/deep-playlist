Screaming in flames, down from the sky
That's how he comes in my dream
Trail of tortured souls, a black boiling wake
A ghost ridden string with a bone-aching hum

And the crows fly black
Now the crows fly black
When the crows fly black
Only crows fly black

Breathing the fumes of cities ablaze
A god descends crushing us all
...
