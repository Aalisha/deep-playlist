Yeah, there's so much that you can't see
So many things that you can be
Your in the black, so you can be free

So many places you can hide
So many things you never tried
No need to know who's on your side

I got secrets in the night
And I've got confidence in the night
And I've got a chance in the night

No one cares who is who
