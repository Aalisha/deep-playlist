We are saying goodbye dear forever
I'm leaving your false love behind
Every promise that you made has been broken
You're no longer a sweetheart of mine I wanted someone true and faithful
For that's the way it had to be
You wanted your honky tonk love dear
You're no longer a sweetheart to me Go back to the bar down the street dear
