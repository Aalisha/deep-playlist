Pull me from the toaster
Straight into the roaster
Fill my head with the stuff
Brightest dreams are made of

Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again
Bringing me down again, duh

Promising the big guns
Reward when the light comes
Screaming from the damage done
Screaming from the damage done

Bringing me down again
...
