Livin' on free food tickets
Water in your milk from a hole in the roof
Where the rain come through
What can you do, uh-huh

Tears from your little sister
Cryin' because she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party tonight
But she knows she'll get by 'cause she's

Livin' with the love of the common people
Smile from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, as she can
...
