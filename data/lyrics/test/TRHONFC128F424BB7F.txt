She's all that, she's all that
She's all that it takes to convict you
She's all that, she's all that
She's all that it takes to convince you

You might make most of them believe you
But not me; I, I got your number
I'm on you like a shadow. I follow your every lie
It ain't me that's catching your disease

Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
Your eyes are saying something
Your mouth is saying another thing
You think you're going to cut me down to size?
Uh-uh, uh-uh
'Cos I'm in the middle of your little enterprise

She's all that, she's all that
Sheâ€™s all that it takes to convict you
She's all that, she's all that
