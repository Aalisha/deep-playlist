He grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his face
And always urged his men on

But on the eve of a great battle with the infantry in dream
The Old General tossed in his sleep and wrestled with its meaning
He awoke from the night to tell what he had seen
And walked slowly out of his tent

All the men held tall with their chests in the air
With the courage in their blood and a fire in their stare
and it was a gray morning and they all wondered how they would fare
Till the old general told them to go home
