You think you're denying me of something
Well I've got plenty
You're the one who's missing out
But you won't notice
'till after five years
If you'll live that long
You'll wake up
All loveless

I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms

I'm so bored with cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle
