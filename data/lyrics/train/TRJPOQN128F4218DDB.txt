I met a new one and she looks just like you
She gives me everything that you didn't want to 
And maybe I don't need saving after all
She sticks in my ribs almost better than you did 
And maybe I'm tired or maybe she glows

I wonder if you're still defending
I wonder if you're still defending

I can fall alone if all 
if I can fall away
You've been so wrong for so long now
I can fall alone if all 
if I can fall away

Met someone with your eyes and your skin
I can convince her of anything
And baby, it's so delicious you should 
Come here and see for yourself
"I'm gone", you said, "if this is all there is...
You'll never shine alone
...
