Outreaching the coldest left side
The city sleeps beneath me
Unrested, the longest night drives
The city sleeps tonight

Help, help me out some
Help, help me get this going

A thousand miles by night, straight as the crow flies
Could be a losing fight but never realized
Chasing right and wrong, countless miles from home
Without an end in sight, this is a battle song

Outreaching the coldest left side
...
