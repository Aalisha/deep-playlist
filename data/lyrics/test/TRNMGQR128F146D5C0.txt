Tra la la la la la la la la
Happy birthday, sweet sixteen
Tra la la la la la la la la
Happy birthday, sweet sixteen

Tonight's the night I've waited for
Because you're not a baby anymore
You've turned into the prettiest girl, I've ever seen
Happy birthday, sweet sixteen

What happened to that funny face
My little tomboy now wears satins and lace
I can't believe my eyes, you're just a teenage dream
