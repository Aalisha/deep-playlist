Here's a man whose voice speaks for everyone
And his actions touch the lives of us all
He rose with energy and style, touch my hand, kiss my child
Sway us all with your smile, he readily accepts acclaim
But soon forgets that he came from the back streets like them
We pray to the east, we pray to the west
And we see the gods of the new church
As they undertake their vow, tell me who can save us now?
Save us from the lords of the new church, don't say no
Here's a man some believe is a visionary
Here's a man who is driven by greed
He made a fortune overnight in a deal that he knew
Was too good to be true, now as he bends the rules of play
Becomes obsessed with the game, has to go all the way
We pray to the east, we pray to the west
