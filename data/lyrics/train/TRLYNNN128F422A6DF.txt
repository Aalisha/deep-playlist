There is a crying in the nightfall
There is a howling in the wind
And when the urge is getting stronger
We hit the streets, the city calls
The night is free-for-all
We rule the dark
and we do as we please
And nothing can stop us
no time to catch som z's
[chourus]
Howlin' With The 'Pac
Fighting for the right to be
Howlin' With The 'Pac
Templars of the first degree
