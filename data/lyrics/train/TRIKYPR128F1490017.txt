You live your life as if you really didn't care
You're on a train heading straight for despair
You hate your past, the future's a joke
The only thing you want is another line of coke


Doing drugs, you feel the need to get high
One more drink did you ever wonder why
You say you're lonely, you wanna die
Become fed up with living a lie


But Jesus said, "I do care"
Jesus said "I'll be there"
