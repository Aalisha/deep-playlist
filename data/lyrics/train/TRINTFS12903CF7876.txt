Feel I'm on the verge of some greath truth
Where I'm finally in my place
But I'm fumbling still for proof
And it's cluttering my space
Casting shadows on my face
I know I have the strength to move a hill
But I can hardly leave my room
So I'll sit here perfecty still
And I'll listen for a tune
When the mind is on the moon

And if I stumble
And if I stall
And if I slip now
And if I should fall
And if I cant be all that I could be
Will you, will you wait for me
