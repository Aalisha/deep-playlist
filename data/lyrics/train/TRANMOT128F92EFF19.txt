Friends I could count on, I could count on one hand
with a left over finger or two...
I took 'em for granted, let 'em all slip away...
now where they are, I wish I knew...

They roll by just like water, and I guess we never learn.
we go through life, parched and empty,
standin' knee deep in a river, and dying of thirst...

Sometimes I remember sweethearts I've known...
...
