Bring your head against the wall
So I can see where I will fall
Bring your mind into my head
Find your playing den

All in all it's just a start
All we had was more than that
All in all I can't go back
To where we started out

So bring my head up to Mont Blanc
So you will see what you would find
Bring my head against the wall
So you can see where I will go

All in all it's just your fault
