I got a brand new skillet
I got a brand new lead,
All i need is a little woman, just to burn my bread
I'm tellin' you baby, i sure ain't gonna deny,
Let me put my banana in your fruit basket, then i'll be satisfied
Now, i got the washboard, my baby got the tub,
We gonna put 'em together, gonna rub, rub, rub
And i'm tellin' you baby, i sure ain't gonna deny,
Let me put my banana in your fruit basket, then i'll be satisfied
Mmmmm, gonna let my banana spoil now,
