Father john and his keep
preachin' to the women on the easy street for free
roll over again
(give me drum)
through the years
plyin' his trade
lookin' for heaven on a silver plate
roll over again
if only he knew it didn't have to be that way
ohh, the promised land
is just another slice of the cake
(chorus)
round and round,
it's always round and round we go
(round and round we go)
yeah, where it leads us
...
