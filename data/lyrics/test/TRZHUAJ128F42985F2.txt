He wasn't a loony with a sawn-off gun
A dangerous terrorist on the run
He'd never been mugging or molested a nun
He was really quite a regular guy
Six pints sober in the club one night
He started to argue with the law outside -
Gets arrested and his hands are tied
Liddley-die...

Lie lie lie diddley lie
Die die die Liddley die
