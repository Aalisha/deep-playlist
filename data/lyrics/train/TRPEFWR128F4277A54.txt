Shining Star for you to see, what your life can truly be.

Yeah, hey

When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far
When you wish upon a dream, yeah
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah
Once you see your light so dear, hey
In the sky so very clear

You're a shining star,
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you can truly be
...
