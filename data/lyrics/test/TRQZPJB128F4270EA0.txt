This is not a phase, this won't be outgrown
we've got things to say, i am not alone

You call me a freak, you tell me i am weird
i am not the one who's life is filled with fear
i will face the world and i will take your shit
but all you do is hide and i'm fucking sick of it
I think i've had enough of everything you do
think i've had enough, i've had enough of you
i think i've had enough of everything you do
think i've had enough, i've had enough of you
Who the fuck are you to tell me who i am?
you don't believe in anything, at least i take a stand.
