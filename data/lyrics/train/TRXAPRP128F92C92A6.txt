Every time I look into your lovely eyes
I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it, baby
Every time I hold you, I begin to understand

Everything about you tells me I'm your man
And I live my life to be with you
