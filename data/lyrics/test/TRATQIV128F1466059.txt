What if I were you and you were me?
Still can't see the forestfire beyond the trees
Now I'm standing in a field of green
The colors burning far as I can see
What do you see?

On my tongue, the galaxies so small
Here, I'll drink it down and watch the world dissolve
Now I'm pouring through the universe
And slipping through the endless stream of time
What would you find?

And I'm flying, floating on the wind again
Hoping it will drag me in
Can't you see I'm laughing
Laughing at the consequence
Laughing at this circumstance
