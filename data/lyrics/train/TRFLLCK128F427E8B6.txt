Something's gonna come to get the best of me
Leaving blackened circles round my eyes.
Something's gotta change before I set you free
Patience is a virtue well disguised

Rural streets and city lights
Heavy days with quiet nights
Leaving questions in my mind:
Did I ever see the signs?
Can I read between the lines?


Where's the reason,
For your lies?
Who'll be crying?
