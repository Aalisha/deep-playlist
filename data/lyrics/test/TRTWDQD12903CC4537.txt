Twelve-hundred miles, it's length and breadth
That four-square city stands
It's gem-set walls of jasper shine
They're not made by human hands

One-hundred miles, it's gates are wide
Abundant entrance there
With fifty miles of elbow room
On either side to spare

When the gates swing wide on the other side
Just beyond the sunset sea
There'll be room to spare as we enter there
...
