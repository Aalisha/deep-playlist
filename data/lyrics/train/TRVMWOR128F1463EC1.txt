"Theme From The Black Hole"
A toast to the booty
Feel that, do that
For how else can you capture a boogie
If you don't attack from the back
To the rear, march!

My name is the one
Some people call me the funk
Here's a toast to the boogie!
Said my name is the one
Some people call me the funk, oh!
I'll toast to that!
And when I find a vacant booty
I move right in on the rump, ooh!
I'm like a camel
Humpin' to please
I'm up to my hump in funk, yeah
Here's a toast to the boogie!

I've got jam in my knee
And I'm ready to spread
All around the world for the funk
I'll toast to that!
We don't cut in
We just butt in
...
