Ten to midnight, signed, sealed, delivered
Ten to midnight, your place or mine 2x

Our eyes may fall when you came through the door
I knew right there and then
It was not a question whether or not
But simply a matter of when

And then you smiled for a while
I thought I loose my head
For while your lips said hello, your eyes said let's go
Get wild instead

At ten to midnight, it better be signed, sealed, delivered
...
