[Altus/Sanguinetti/White]

Echoed voices silently 
Whisper to me in my sleep 
Though the words, they are not clear 
They say the things I want to hear 
Lightning strikes and don't you know 
What to say and where to go
In time you'll find your way 
In my sleep the voices say

Over the mountains and across the sea
I've searched for the land where I could be free 
Freedom is something that I never had
I gotta set myself free or I'm gonna go mad
