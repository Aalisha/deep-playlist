Come on, baby, take it home
People are starting to stare
And they're turning on all of the lights
We've been putting on a show all night
Boys will be boys

Take it home, take it home
'Cause I can't take anymore
It's your touch, it's your taste
It's your dress on the floor

Take it home, take it home
'Cause I've been waiting all night for you
And this is what I'm gonna do

Ice, ice, melt your heart
Baby girl, let down your guard
Rush, rush for that touch
Just one taste can't get enough

Ice, ice, melt your heart
Baby girl, let down your guard
Rush, rush for that touch
Just one taste can't get enough

Take it, take it home
Take it home

Baby, put your key in the door
'Cause this party's getting way too loud
