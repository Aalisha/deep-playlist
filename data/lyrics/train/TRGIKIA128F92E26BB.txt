Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine

Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go, round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do
I hear your name and I'm a flame
