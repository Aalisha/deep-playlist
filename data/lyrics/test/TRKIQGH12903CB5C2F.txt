It's been days now
And you change your mind again
It feels like years
And I can tell how time can bend your ideas

And the boys go on and on and on and on
And the boys go on and on and on and on
And there's gold falling from the ceiling of this world
Falling from the heartbeat of this girl
Falling from the things we should have learned
Falling from the things we could have heard

Well it's been days now
And you change your mind again
All the cracks in the walls reminds you of things we said
And I could tell you that I won't hurt you this time
But it's just safer to keep you in this heart of mine
