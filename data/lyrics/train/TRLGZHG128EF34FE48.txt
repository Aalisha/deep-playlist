Oh, you need timin'
A tick, a tick, a tick, good timin'
A tock, a tock, a tock, a tock

If little, little David hadn't grabbed that stone

Big Goliath might've stomped on him
Instead of the other way 'round
But he had timin'
A tick, a tick, a tick, good timin'
A tock, a tock, a tock, a tock
A timin' is the thing
