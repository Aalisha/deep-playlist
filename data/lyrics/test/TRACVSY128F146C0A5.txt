You wonder why
Life looks so much easier
Every time that she's close by
Is it her smile that makes you want to hold her
better watch out that you don't build
your hopes up too high

Look before you leap
or soon you will be off
in a Wild Love Affair
Think of what you'll reap
and what will be lost
if you do set your mind
on a Wild Love Affair

You tell yourself
you can't control your feelings
You lose your head
...
