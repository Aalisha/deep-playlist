I need a Route 66
I need a highway fix
One more time
I gotta get out on the highway
Want to listen to my own wheels whine
Well there's no use sittin' lonely
Like a picture in a frame
Gotta go shake a few screws
Loose in my brain
Route 66, highway fix
Feelin' no pain
I don't want to talk about your momma, babe
Don't want to talk about the people that you never seen
Spend your life following Dale Carnegie
I'd rather follow James Dean
I never stay one place long enough
To wear out my welcome mat
