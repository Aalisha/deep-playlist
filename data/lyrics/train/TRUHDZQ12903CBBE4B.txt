This planet keeps on spinnin'
Around and around
Sometimes I get confused
It's easy to feel busy
So I keep my eyes on You

You are the way
That shines through the dark
You are the truth
That brings hope to the heart

You are the one
That keeps me alive
I believe You are
The way, the truth and the life

And when I fear the darkness
I cry out to You
You shine like the morning sun
You give me peace in my heart
You are the only one

You are the way
That shines through the dark
You are the truth
That brings hope to the heart
