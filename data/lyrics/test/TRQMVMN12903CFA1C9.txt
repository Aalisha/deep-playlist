Here at lunch hour at Municipal High
We'll see something over the edge
This school is about to see more things crash
Then when you first failed Drivers Ed

Everybody that's inside will be caught in the fight

First somebody screams
Then food begins to fly
Milk cartons raised forward toward the sky

The room quickly erupts
It cannot be controlled
The brawl suddenly begins to explode
