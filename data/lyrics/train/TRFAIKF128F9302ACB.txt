What's that you see?
There's all these satellites, satellites, satellites
Orbiting you and me
Just one glimpse can change your life, change your life, change your life
And you can see
Through all these satellites, satellites, satellites
Orbiting you and me
One glimpse change your life, change your life, change your life, change it

I get so haunted, I fall in your dreams tonight
I get so haunted, that I'm misunderstood tonight
