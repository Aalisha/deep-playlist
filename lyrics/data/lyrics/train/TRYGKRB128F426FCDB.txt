When all you want to do is rock,
But you don't want to bear the shock no more.
When it's just swell that fills your eyes,
Belated feelings that you have denied.

When every wolf is at your door,
Just like a hundred times before,
But you don't want to leave the end

You were amazing,
And we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it,
