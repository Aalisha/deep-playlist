Who made up all the rules
We follow them like fools
Believe them to be true
Don't care to think them through

And I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
It's like this
I'm sorry
So sorry
I'm sorry
We do this

And it's ironic too
'Cause what we tend to do
Is act on what they say
And then it is that way

And I'm sorry
So sorry
