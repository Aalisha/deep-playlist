Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
You don't see a damn thing
'Cause you can't relate to me

Your blinded by our differences
My life makes no sense to you
I'm the persecuted one
You're the red, white and blue

Each day you wake in tranquility
No fears to cross your eyes
Each day I wake in gratitude
Thanking God He let me rise

You worry 'bout your education
And the bills you have to pay
I worry 'bout my vulnerable life
And if I'll survive another day

Your biggest fear is getting a ticket
As you cruise your Cadillac
My fear is that the tank that has just left
Will turn around and come back

Yet do you know the truth of where your money goes?
Do you let your media deceive your mind?
Is this the truth that nobody, nobody, nobody knows?
Has our world gone all blind
Yet do you know the truth of where your money goes?
Do you let your media deceive your mind?
Is this the truth that nobody, nobody, nobody knows?
