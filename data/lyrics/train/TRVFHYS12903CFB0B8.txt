I found the cure and no one cares
It's just another thing to sell
I found a church, and no one's there
It's just another thing that failed

(I'll bring you down) I got inside my pickup truck to take a ride
(I'll bring you down) Forgot what I was looking for and they arrived
(I'll bring you down) I'm lucky I'm not a slave that's going down
(I'll bring you down)

Down from the sky (falling)
Down from the sky (falling)
Down from the sky (falling)
