Go to the beach
And realize that you got a scanline across your tanline
And find microchips in your hands
Fluid in your grands
As a result of somebody else's plan
That nobody really understands
Even though it spans across lands
African soils, Arabian sands
It's airborne yet it seeps through dams
A new disease that you caught at Mickey D's
In your Quarter Pounder with cheese
Ordered with ease
Super size please!
Can you believe
People ain't even survive through the drive through
And they thought they were live too
Pulling off, pumping Rob Base, stuffing fries in their face
Over a billion served
What they never deserved
So as they drove away they swerved into the curb
With their heads on the steering wheel
Kids blacked out in the back with a fucking Happy Meal
What a crappy deal
But it was only $4.99
So there's more people in line
Yeah, the plan's running fine
The parking lot is now a burial plot
Where you can park and rot if you can find a spot
Government agents came swooping in
Removing men, women and children from the automobile
What a steal
Now the car's repossessed and sold at an auction
