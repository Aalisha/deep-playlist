Where are all the friendly faces now?
We´re the same… we´re all the same
Close the circle, join the game
Close the circle, join the game

At the Devil's Inn
There´s a room for you
and there's a table's set
And they want you too
Then the keeper smiles
And I believe in Hell
This is where you stand
This is where you end

At the Devil's Inn
