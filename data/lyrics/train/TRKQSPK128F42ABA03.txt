I've got a delicate mind
I've got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides
With your furniture

I've got a delicate mind
I've got a dangerous nature
And my fist collides
With your furniture

I'm an electric wire
And I'm stuck inside your head

I'm a hungry Mohican
I've got a razor blade smile
So don't come near me
I've got a singular style

Fifteen senses
Are on my plate
All the things
That you love to hate

I'm an electric wire
...
