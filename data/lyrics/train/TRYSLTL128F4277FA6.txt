Wilson

Baby baby you put the hurt on me
'Cause I was blind and just couldn't see
But all these rumours that are floating around
Make this big city a very small town

I found out you've got somebody else
But I love you baby and I just can't help myself
I can't let you got it's plain as day to see
I'm gonna have to let you two time me
