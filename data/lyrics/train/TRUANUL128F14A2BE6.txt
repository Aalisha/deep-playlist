Still can't believe some of 
The things I never told 
I hardly touch the phone 
I don't know who to call 
You're my relief and you're 
The one who makes me cry 
I'm trying to figure out 
Some way 
To get on by 

Cause I can change I'm not the same 
Not forever 
What can I say I'm not OK 
I wish I was 
I want you back I want a time 
I can remember 
It's as simple as I say 
...
