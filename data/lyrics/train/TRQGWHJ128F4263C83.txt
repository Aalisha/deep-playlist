It was late one Friday evenin', it began to rain and snow
Letter from my baby, say, she ain't comin' home no mo'
I gotta call up Joe Friday and put him on my baby's trail
I'm 'on' get all hold of it if I have to break loose from jail

She left here flyin' in a '38 Cadillac
Had a funny, funny feeling, the lil' girl ain't comin' back
I gotta call up Joe Friday and put him on my baby's trail
