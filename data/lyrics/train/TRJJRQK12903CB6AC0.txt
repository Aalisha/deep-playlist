Showing no emotion, my feelings locked inside
I made myself an island, trying to take my heart and hide
I built a wall around me, afraid of letting go
But suddenly an open door I never saw before

In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see the light leading me home again
It's heaven in your arms, my love
My heart is in your hands
(Heaven in your arms)
In your eyes (Your eyes)
Seems so right
I see forever in your smile
This woman is a child again
(In your eyes)

Love's been building bridges between your heart and mine
