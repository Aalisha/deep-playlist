Invitation to libation
Sucking all the lees to let it blow
Pushing veins like cannonade
Pulling strings in another puppet show

Think what you want that's what you'll get (that's what you'll get)
Just play the game without regrets
Strings round your wrists won't let you go, temptations of the show

Walls closing in with intense spin
One more round, oh don't lie low
Lewd minded organ grinder
Bent so out of shame with the face you know
...
