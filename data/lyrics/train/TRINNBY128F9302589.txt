Everywhere is somewhere baby,
So can't you see we're in the middle,
Somewhere.

Nowhere just means knowing nothing,
of where you've been or where you're going,
feels farther.

You're a sight to see this early morning,
getting lost in my own,
neighborhood.

The same freedom you feel,
Is what's been blowing in my sail,
Since I arrived here.
