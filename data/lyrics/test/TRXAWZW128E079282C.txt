Yo, raise the level, bass bottom to treble
Forever keep it ghetto
Funk and heavy metal
F*ck the devil
Unify the rebel
Whistle like a kettle
With a fly acapello
Smooth and mellow
Locked load and settle
Shine through times with rhymes bright like yellow
Taste and swallow, lead and never follow
Break it like a bottle
Inspire like a role model

Say, "I am" (I am) "Somebody" (Somebody)

Yo, my soul, bounce rock and roll
Tumble with the rhythm
Heat the mic when it's cold
I was told "Be Bold"
Whether platinum or gold
Keep it solid
Do the knowledge
Til' I reach my goal
My hunger-pain thunder
Lumberjack the fifth wonder
I never slumber cuz I keep it on the under
My post beat for people in the street
Ghetto M-U-S-I-C (We bring the heat)
That African soul
Clap black power impact
Who said ghetto rap was all about a dope sack?
A pimp slap or a big black gatt
Fuck around and get jacked
For your rhymes where I live at
Uh, I'm not a gangsta but I boogie wit beats
No gang affiliation in my lyrics or speech
But still I keep it straight hood-hop techniques
South Central Fundamentals J5 emcees
