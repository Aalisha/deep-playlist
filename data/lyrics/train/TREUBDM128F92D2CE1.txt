Every night I'm there
I'm always there
She knows I'm there and heaven knows
I hope she goes (Eloise)
I find it hard to realise
That love was in her eyes
It's dying now
She knows I'm crying now

And every night I'm there
I break my heart to please
Eloise
Eloise

You know I'm on my knees yeah
I said please
You're all I want so hear my prayer
My prayer

My Eloise is like the stars that please the night
The sun that makes the day
That lights the way (Eloise)
