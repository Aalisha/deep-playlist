I ain't told nobody 'bout the trouble I've got on me
Keep my tears to myself so no one in the world can see
No, I ain't let on the truth to a living soul
So how's the radio know?

How's the radio know she left?
How's the radio know I did her wrong?
Every record that DJ spins

Is a good love gone bad song
How's the radio know I miss her?
And I'd die to tell her so, ohh, how's the radio know?
