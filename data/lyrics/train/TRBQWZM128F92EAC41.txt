Lie!
I'm a fish out of water
(I'm a fish out of water)
Kill me and choke on the bones
(Kill me and choke on the bones)
Nothing seems to matter anymore
Gotta get back to the reason
Gotta get back to the hole

Someone throw me an anchor
I've gotta drown this disease
(I've gotta drown this disease)
No one seems to matter anymore
Gotta get back to the meaning
Gotta get back the score

Buy my soul so you can sell me!
I don't need this
I don't need you

Trust your lies!
Then you betray me!
I don't want this
I don't want you

Up the creek with no paddle
(Up the creek with no paddle)
...
