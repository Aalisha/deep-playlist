I said I love you baby
I said I care
So when I tell you that, I love you darling
Won't you understand it means
That I'm always gonna be there, you see
I'm not gonna leave you
I ain't goin' nowhere
When I tell you I love you baby
Cross my heart I will be there

Baby come to me
I will chase your tears away
Put your trust in me
Girl I swear, I'll never change
Darling, you will see
That my love is here to stay
And I promise you, I will be true
From here and now, forever girl I

I said I love you
I said I care
When I tell you I love you
