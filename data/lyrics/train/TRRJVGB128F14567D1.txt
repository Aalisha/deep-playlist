Thought I saw a familiar face, it stopped me in my tracks
It made me think of a far of place, come on let's go back
Come on let's go back (You know you can't go back), come on let's go back
It made me think of a far of place, come on let's go back
I remember by the church in the village
I remember by the school house on the ridge
I remember by the lake, by the river
I remember by the [?] thousand [?] iron bridge
Come on let's go back (You know you can't go back), come on let's go back
