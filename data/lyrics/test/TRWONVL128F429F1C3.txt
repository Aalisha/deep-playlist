Thousand lonely women
Gathering on my lawn
And the cops
Wanna know the meaning of this song

We had to get away fast
When we did we travelled slow
All I ever use
Is the main roads

Christ was driving drunk
Pulled over by the cops
They ask him for a reply
Christ says the essence is rising to the top

Stained glass all around us
