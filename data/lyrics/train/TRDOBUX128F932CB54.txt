Aung San Suu Kyi on house arrest
Another Bhutto assassination
Could've stopped Sarajevo we must confess
But we were planning our next invasion

Where are the leaders of the atomic age?
Is it just another working day?
Said he was coming, he was on his way
But he fell down the hole in the ocean

Ay

The levies are full
But the river runs dry
And the desert grows into the grassland
And the space that separates us grows ever wide
As the profiteer stokes the division

Something's not right, something is wrong
With the news at eleven that no one has told them
If we don't come together it won't be long
...
