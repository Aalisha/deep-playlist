Main:
Sit on a train, reading a book
Same damn planet every time I look
Try to relax and slow my heartbeat
Only works when I'm dead asleep
Been thinking and drinking all over the town
Must be gearing up for some kind of meltdown

Chorus:
All I am is, a body floating downwind (x2)

-What's wrong?
-Nothing
