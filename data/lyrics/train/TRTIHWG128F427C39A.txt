[Verse 1:]
Lord why would I leave You
There's no other place for me but here
Your Love is so great and sure
Your faithfulness, and mercy, will live on, eternally

[Chorus:]
Forever I'll lift my voice
Forever, Lord I'll rejoice
Forever I'll sing my heart out to You
I offer all I have
And I want more to give
Forever my life is Yours to use
