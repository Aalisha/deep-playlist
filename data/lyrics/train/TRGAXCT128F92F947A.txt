Hunger for what's not there, eyeless congregation
Blessed be unto for their hearts are true
Submitting to the stimuli, a pure psychic secretion
For their souls are empty
Bleeding out the will of humanity

Can you hear the tolling of the bell?
The masses salivate

Neurons fire with desire to quench intangible needs
Supplant the seed, learn the machine
When two entities commonly occur close together
The appearance of one shall forever bring to mind the other
