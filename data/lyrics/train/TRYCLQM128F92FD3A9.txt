BOTH:
Never in my wildest days did I think I'd find someone like you
I like your style, you're swift, you're agile,
Everything about ya stays true

JILL:
You stood before the sun
Almost struck me blind,
You're so damn fine...

ERIC:
Thank you baby
And I know that you are meant to be with me
Part o' my design

JILL:
One time

ERIC:
You be the salt, I'll be your peppa
Give you flava foreva
Leave ya never
Don't you know, girl, I'm down for whateva

JILL:
You'll be my lemon, I'll be your tea,
Pure and naturally,
You'll be my leaf, I'll be your tree,
Your very definition of real.

BOTH:
Since you been goin' my way
Things have been goin' my way
Saturday Sunday Monday to Friday
I'm so happy you just make me wanna say to ya baby

Never in my wildest days did I think I'd find someone like you
I like your style, you're swift, you're agile
