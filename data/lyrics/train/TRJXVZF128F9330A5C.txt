There was a time when i could believe the future was bright and unjaded
Now things have changed and im not the same
everything clear slowly fading

God forbid, you should have to see things my way
God forbid, you should feel the same
God forbid, you should never walk in my shoes
God forbid, you should never know my name
You will never know, you could never know the pain
