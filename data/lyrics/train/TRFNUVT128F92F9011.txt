This town is coming like a ghost town
(Town)
All the clubs have been closed down
This place is coming like a ghost town
(Town)
Bands won't play no more
Too much fighting on the dance floor
Do you remember the good old days before the ghost town?
We danced and sang as the music played in any boomtown
