Your love keeps comin' stronger and stronger everyday
Like a river that's runnin', turnin' into a tidal wave
Your love's so strong, I can't fight it
Can't resist your siren's wail
I won't run
I won't fight it
I could look you any day

Now more than ever
 (Now more than ever I need you)
Now more than ever
 (Now more than ever I want you)

I've seen your love keeps comin' like tomorrow, like Judgment Day
