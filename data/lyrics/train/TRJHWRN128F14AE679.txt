I am the resurrection and the Life
He that believeth in me
Though he were dead
Yet shall he live

A certain man had died
In the town of Bethany
And Lazarus was his name
The Bible says he was
A man that Jesus loved
And his sisters thought
It was a shame
Mary and Martha longed
For Jesus healing touch
To come and raise their brother
Cause they loved that boy so much
But Jesus had a plan not known to any man
That would soon take away their pain
They was waiting for Jesus
To come and say

Chorus:
Lazarus, Lazarus, Lazarus Come Forth

When he died he went to where
The saints of God did stay
In the holding place
They lived beyond the tomb
And there he saw Elijah, Moses, Samuel, even Ruth
And all the others jammed up in a room
He turned around and saw
Ol' Gideon standin' by the door
He walked up and said hey brother
What's this group here for
Well Giddie said
Well alright this is testimony night
Have a seat man cause
The meeting is starting soon
While Mary and Martha
Just wanted to see
