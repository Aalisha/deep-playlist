I never knew what it meant to me
'Til someone just took the best of me
If it's some kind of conspiracy
Then no one gets to the rest of me
I'm turning over leaves, I'm holding up my head
I'm healing over hurt and learning to forget
I said, "Don't look back, let it fade and let it go
Don't look back, let it fade and let it go", oooh
