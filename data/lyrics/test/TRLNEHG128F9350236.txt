she puts those lips like a leech up to the sex on the beach
sandy, sticky, baby mickey did the miss you
she's got the action, you've got the issues
yeah she left the ATM and she headed straight into the DEA

and all these chesterfield chicks, they hate the camel lights girls
with their filthy mouths and their long strings of pearls
you've got the action, she's got the issues
...
