The look in her eyes
makes me cold and brings me in despair
I'm paralysed and my soul is lost in the air

She leaves me the fright
and things that I never have seen
so Queen of the night
won't you please take me out of my dreams

She's living the night
but at dawn she flies away
she's living inside
disappears when night turns to day

She leaves me the fright
...
