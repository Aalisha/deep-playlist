Ah the drink and the fun
The singer, the song
Sing almighty how long

Throwin' shapes in the sun
What strange men we become
Sing almighty how long

Then you waste in the pale afternoon
And it's not gonna stop sometime soon
But back at the hotel
You're not feeling too well
Sing almighty how long
Who can tell?
