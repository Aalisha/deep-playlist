Rising from the tide, a Kraken cloaked in wisdom, propagates his lies,
For love of living death...

As faith in leaders falter and dole-queues stretch for snake-like miles
Untruths in unwritten law annihilate imagination
Hope becomes a process, the intravenous feed
That's bound in tune with "progress" - in dialectic comedy

Problems rise in culture, where contradiction's known to breed
And puppeteers unquestioned string up the masses in their sleep
...
