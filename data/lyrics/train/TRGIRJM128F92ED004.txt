The image on the board
Selling things we can't afford
But we're still buying up in a frenzy
Cause our hearts just yearn for more
Is this sin, all he want?
Is offerings we got?
But soon you'll be overrating eyes
Oh people they can't be good
When what comes next on the market should
But we go on because its understood

But you can only hope, when they say that they want you
Yeah, they'll say that they want you, when they don't

It's like a chandelier
It's like a fountain head
The strings are all there
...
