(Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
It's a Friday kind of Monday
Everything is fine, yeah-eah
It's a Friday kind of Monday
Look at the sunshine... yeah-eah
Look at the sunshine...
Used to be a drag on Monday

I met a little girl on Sunday-ay
But I don't know where we've got to
For the love she turned me onto
Has put me in a brand new cla-ass
