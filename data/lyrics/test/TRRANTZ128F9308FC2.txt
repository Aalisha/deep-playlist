Oh, somewhere up in your loft
MTV with the sound off
We lay down at the edge of town, oh
On and on, I'm drifting
Our eyes opened and twisted
We lay down at the edge of town, oh
But have you noticed?

Summer comes and disappears
From a mirror like a tear we appear
The last out of something here I wonder
Where are you now, where are you now?

Because it's going and it's going and it's going
And it's going and it's going and it's going
...
