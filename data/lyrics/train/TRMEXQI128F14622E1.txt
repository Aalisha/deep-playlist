I feel like I'm old
I feel like an invalid
I feel like I'm sick
In a casket so close the lid

I feel like I'm done
I feel like it's over now
I feel but I'm numb
Curtain falls while I take a bow and now

Substance races through my veins
Angels try to soothe my pain

High sensitivity
Wake up with my head still aching
High sensitivity
I'm drugged from all the pills I'm taking
