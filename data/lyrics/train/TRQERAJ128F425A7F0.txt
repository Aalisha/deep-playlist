I've never seen the sky so angry
Starchild
You've got to do somthing about these
Mind crimes
The shuffling feet and sad expressions
They don't go, they don't go
I thought you came down from heaven
To save souls
These angry men are into making
Bad seeds
The only thing we had they're taking
Now love needs
Needs a little, needs a little
Five thousand million people
To spread joy, spread a little joy
I thought you came down from heaven to save us
I thought you came but you just don't take us

(Chorus:)
Somewhere in the world tonight
There's a fire blazing bright
