Rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain
Oh rain

I've got a date with the rain
Gotta go walking in the rain
The clouds that gather in the skies
Gather in my eyes every time it rains

On just such a day you let me go
And as the raindrops began to flow
I'll go walking in the rain no no
Hiding my tears in the rain

I grabbed my coat and leather shoes
