There are two rules to remember if you wanna have a good time… Rule number one: Never run out of Colt45… Rule number two: You never know when friends might show up… I don’t claim you can have a better time with Colt45 than without it… never forget… Colt45…

It was a Friday night, everybody was drinking
The ladies were upset ‘cause the breath was stinking
And it won’t be long ‘til we start to funk
‘Cause Double’s gonna get drunk, buddy
Thes One’s gonna get drunk, buddy
Everybody get drunk, buddy… and, and, and… sha na na!

Yeah, crack the 40, who’s down to get plastered?
I get the party started with the Colt45
Buzzing like a beehive, feeling so pissy, and
I roll up on your scene like Lando Calrissian
Refunding mission, get-a-get your ten cents
Fresh out my freezer, let the swill commence
I gets the rare stuff: on twelve ounce bottles, on end labels
But when I’m rockin’ parties and behind the turntables
Can’t be running back and forth through the dance floor, trippin’
So I grab a cold Colt45 and start sippin’
Big bottle, big mouth, big party, good times
Bought a barrel, enzymes enhance the rhymes
Like a “hip hip hippy”, you don’t stop the rock
I get busy… I feel like Malt Disney
‘Bout to crack another 40-ounce right here
You like that Red Bull and vodka? Well, we like BEER!
Colt, boy… understand?
