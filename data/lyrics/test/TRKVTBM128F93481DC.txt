The war still remains
No Kingdom on earth
There's only pure evil, infidderence to birth

In the tombs of the dead
One man breeds alone
The unearthly warfare shadows the throne

Three temptations written down
The Lust of flesh, lust of the eye
Finally the pride of life

The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds
