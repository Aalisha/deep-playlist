Time stands still in my heart
I don't know where you are
Longing for what I denied
Can we just turn it around tonight

Without you I just go crazy
That all I think about
Is where you are
That only you can save me baby
From going through this life
All alone
And do you know

When will missing you stop
Seems we lost before the start
Holding back what was inside
Can we just let it all out tonight
Without you I just go crazy
That all I think about
...
