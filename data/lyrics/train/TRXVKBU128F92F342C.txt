I said, "Hey now baby
Ain't you the girl next door"
Reet petite you must not eat
Bet you know the score
Friday night don't sit at home
Lets track up the bend
Maybe if I'm lucky I'll steal a kiss
Maybe even hold your hand, yeah

Something about you sweetheart
Well I just can't explain
You're not like all those city girls
I don't think so anyway, hey
And I can't sleep a wink at night
Hoping dreams come true
You're gonna be a brand new kind of girl
When I get through with you

In the sticks is where I lay
Hey girl, I got love
