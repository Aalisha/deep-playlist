(J-Ro)
Mary Jane, Mary Jane, Mary Jane
You're always in my brain and you help me ease the pain
Cos when you're not around I just don't feel the same
I can't be your one and only but I know you're not to blame
I never hold ya, can't hold ya, won't hold ya down
Cos you got that kind of love that needs to be spread around
Some people don't approve of me being with ya kiddo
They say you're bad for me, and my momma says ditto
When I walk up wit ya, my buddies wanna hit ya
I know you been with others but you know I'll never quit ya
And even though sometimes you got my mind stressed out
Five minutes with you baby and you got my body stretched out

Mary Mary Mary Jane
(So put that in your pipe and smoke it)
Mary Jane Mary Jane
(So put that in your pipe and smoke it)
Check it out

(J-Ro)
Early in the morning, you gave me a buzz
I picked up the phone and didn't know who the fuck it was
I feel like Johnny Gill I wanna wrap your body tight
Lick you from head to toe and watch you glow like a Lite-Brite
I met you at the park around three
When I got there you was loungin' in a car with my homie
He said he needed a dub so I slipped him one
And said "c'mon Mary Jane and let's have a little fun"
I got you in the sack, I got you in the sack
And like Helen tellin Jack, there's no turnin back
