Morning has just begun
And I gaze into the rising sun
Like every day to day you're on my mind
And even though I am far I know where you are

And I know it won't be very long
I'll be on my way, coming home

I smell your perfume on the breeze
As a hint of jasmine's calling me
While the trees are whispering your name
And all the things that they do remind me of you

And I know it won't be very long
I'll be on my way coming home
Going home, sweet home
 (Home, home)
Very soon I will be coming home

Home, baby, home
 (Home, home)
To my lady home
 (Home)
