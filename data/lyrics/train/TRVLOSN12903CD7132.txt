(Oh, no, I just can't stop)
I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no)

I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no)
I just can't stop dancin'

There's a place I eat lunch every day
Soon as I get there, the jukebox starts to play
I can't even eat my lunch in peace
'Cause music makes me get out of my seat

I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, I don't wanna stop)
I just can't stop dancin'
(No, no, no)
