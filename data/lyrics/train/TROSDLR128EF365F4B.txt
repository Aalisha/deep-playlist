It's no shot in the dark
And no trick of the lights
You tease me, adore me
Talking dirty, sitting pretty
Lay me down and annoint my wounds
Dust up, bust up, let's get down to the nitty-gritty

You call on favours promised and sworn
Changing names and changing places
The blade digs deep
And the cut begins to sting
There's more to this than reason
Or the old familiar rhythm and rhyme
Take me shake me lead me
To the floor and hey let's swing
