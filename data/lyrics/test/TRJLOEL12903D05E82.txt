(B-Real)
Yo light one, ignite one, draw me like the buddha
You say I'm the joint, but you can call me hooda
Computer, wizard, the butcher of scissors
Cut me up and spark and roll me up, like a blizzard
Dwellin your cells up, lungs start to swell up
Your pipe's gettin crowded, yo just forget about it
Me, is potent, so bring an opponent
You could suck on it, shit I know you wanted to

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
(Sen) B-Real, light another

(B-Real)
I'm smoked out, not on a menthol cigarette
How could you figure, or even, consider that
I'm, a weak seed, no, I'm the humble weed
?, hash spliff this tweed
actin type of stylin, how do you spell it
Take a hit from outta New York into Phillie
Hit some Visine, so the smoke can let out
Now do you really think you can take the red out and

Feel the effects of the high
I know you feel the effects of the high
Wanna feel the effects of the high, brother?
(Sen) B-Real, light another
