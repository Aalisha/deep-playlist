La la la la...

I can't hold you enough
I can't hug you enough
I can't love you enough
To suit me

I can't squeeze you enough
I can't tease you enough
I can't please you enough
No, siree

I can't say it enough
I can't pray it enough
Well, everyone can see

I love you with all my heart
Why can't you love me
I love you with all my heart
Why can't you love me

If I had forever
...
