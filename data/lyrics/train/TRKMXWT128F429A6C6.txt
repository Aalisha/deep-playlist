Well There's so much to be happy about
In this life what a wonderful chance
We have to work hard, play hard
And maybe even find yourself a little girl
And make some romance
So don't you think It'd be so lame
To get all crazy drunk
And start a fight?
We'd much rather dance with some hoochies
So if you want to fight
Get the heck outta here you stupid fool!

I'll kill you!
AAAHH!
Uh huh
Oh yeah
don't hit me
hit it T bone!
Yeah!
