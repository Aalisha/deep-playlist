They laugh at us when we
Walk down the streets
Ten of them with weapons
Man we're gonna get beat because

[Chorus:]
Orphans don't run from no one
That's what we say
Orphans don't run from no one
We ain't going away

When you come into our parts
You better watch your step
We just hang out & get drunk
