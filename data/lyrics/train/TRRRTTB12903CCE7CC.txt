Argent

I'm on a highwire, moving far above the ground
I'm on a highwire baby, watch me death-defying
It's getting dangerous, mm I'm feeling the juices start to rise
I'm on a highwire and I'm alive.

I'm on a wheel of fire, spilling my breath into the ground
I'm on a bareback cannonball, chasing the speed of sound
It's getting dangerous, I'm feeling the crowd begin to rise
On a cannonball, cannonball and I'm alive
...
