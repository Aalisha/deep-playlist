All on top of the world, while you sit and dream
You won't find a cure, for what you received
It's such a game, so many ways to lose
You hold a piece, but you don't aim to please
C'mon dealer, and push it to me

No beach in reach out here,
No resort to ski out here,
The sand is all paved, 
The hills are all leveled
Free base the city smog for kicks
And it makes you sick, yeah sick of it

Another day tomorrow, maybe
...
