Here we go at it three years later
Will you help me to dream it all up again
Tired of the same song everyone’s singin'
I'd rather be lost with you instead

Don’t you come around here, come around here anymore
Draggin' my fears, draggin' my fears
Out the door
All I have, all I have, all I have
Well, you know it’s yours
Every breath, every step, every moment
I’m looking for
All I have, all I have, all I have
Is yours
And you watch my heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more
My heart break a little bit more
