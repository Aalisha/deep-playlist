Here in your bedroom,
I can turn my head off
The less that I feel
Is the less that I'm on top

I wonder what you think
As we lay here in bed
I don't know what I'm thinking,
But that's better for my head

When I wake up tomorrow
Will you still feel the same?
When I wake up tomorrow
Will you have changed?

(Chorus)

'cuz I still feel the same
'cuz I still feel the same
I, 'cuz I still feel the same
...
