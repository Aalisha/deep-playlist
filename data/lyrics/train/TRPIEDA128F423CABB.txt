The girls, they don't love us anymore now
Because we wear black shirts and took a new vow
You can have the whole world right in your home
To redefine and eliminate alone

Our TVs do the jobs of a thousand violent cops
Keep us inside while misinformation supplements our thoughts
Our kids know just what they need, more monitors and screens, and you tell them you can't take it anymore
But you stay inside and order your food from the grocery store
