Turn it up Pump it up
Turn it up
Just a little bit

Turn it up
Pump it up
Turn it up
Just a little bit

All the kids gonna bounce to this
All the kids gonna jump to this
All the kids gonna snap to this

Yeah, rock it rhyme

Little Aaron

How many people understand me that this is why
ya growin' up to go to school, and that's a fact
Getting a job from the school, loan n pay 'em back
Then you get a car to make it to the job and back
Can you tell me why things gotta be this way

I'd rather be at the pool catchin' sunrays
Guys in the deep end
Girls in the shallow
Kids in the middle shout "MARCO POLO!"
When a get a little older Imma change things

Makin' life go easy like ice cream
Become president and play on the dream team
Bring home the gold medal for the ladies
But I guess right now Imma sit back
While I watch Scooby-Doo eat a Scooby snack
Grab a pen and some paper from my knapsack
And do a little homework for my math class
