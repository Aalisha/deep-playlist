I was only looking for a shortcut home
But it's complicated
So complicated

Somewhere in this city is a road I know
Where we could make it
But maybe there's no making it now

Too long we've been denying
Now we're both tired of trying
We hit a wall and we can't get over it

Nothing to relive, it's
Water under the bridge
You said it, I get it, I guess it is what it is
