I'm tired of just driving around
Let's go some place
Alright, like where are we going?
Anywhere, just as long as we stay out good and late
Let go, and swing it to the street beat
Put the road under your wheels and burn, baby
Tune into the high life, take it on a wild, wild ride
Let go, and take it to the speedway
Get into the action and kiss it all goodbye, bye baby
