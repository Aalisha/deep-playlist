She always said the world was overrated
And she couldn't take the drama it created
It's a wonder that she didn't wind up jaded
From all the times she's been let down

Well, Mum and Dad split up when she was four years old
And left the world as she knew it spinning out of control
And she grew up feeling a hole in her soul
'cause they were never around

She said, "why's everybody always leaving?
I just want someone to believe in
And someone to believe in me"

When you can't find a friend in the world
A friend in the world
Love is reaching down
When you can't find a friend in the world
