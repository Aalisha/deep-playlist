I'd be lying through my teeth if I told you
That I'm ok
July came, I thought I had it all together
Until you said
"I need some space"
Truth be told
It's so hard to wait

One eye on the clock
And one on the phone
It's 5: 19...
I'm feeling alone
If I could talk to you
I'd want you to know
I'm holding loose
But ain't letting go.
