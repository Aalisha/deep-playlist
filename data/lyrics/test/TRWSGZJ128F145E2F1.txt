Don't sing a tune to yourself
You might believe this one
Try not to sew it yourself
The threading won't stretch none
Don't give me none of that line
Why not?
Got to sing something
Love's song there's nothing to find
Why not?
Dead before playing

Don't sing a tune to yourself
You might believe this one
Try not to sew it yourself
The threading won't stretch none
Who says the things that go in
The song is only saying
