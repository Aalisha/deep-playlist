(Intro)
There are No Words that I can say
Its la-de-de-la-de-la-de-de-de. Oooo
There are No Words that I can say
Its la-de-de-la-de-la-de-de-de. Oooo

(Verse 1)
Lately I, don't know why
every time I think about you I just wanna cry
It's not the cry that makes my heart ache
It's the one that brings me to my knees and gives thanks
That finally, I have a chance to breathe
And thank God for all the goodness that he sent me
So it took a while but it was worth the wait
It's a different kind of love when we love make

(Chorus)
