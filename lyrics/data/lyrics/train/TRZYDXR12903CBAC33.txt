How does it feel?
To welcome the new day
Not worth saving

To fall down on own imprudent acts
The wind answers quietly
Clears the black smoke far thick to see
unfolds the true nature of man

And this fire it burns,
consuming us all
Withered garden for posterity
Inheritance in flames

When the mankind moves
rest of the life shakes
...
