I've been loving you too long to stop now
There were time and you want to be free
My love is growing stronger, as you become a haven to me
Oh I've been loving you a little too long
I dont wanna stop now, oh
With you my life
Has been so wonderful
I can't stop now

There were times and your love is growing cold
My love is growing stronger as our affair grows old
