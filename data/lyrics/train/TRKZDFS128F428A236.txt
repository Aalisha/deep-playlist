If it ain't love then
Let's don't even let it start
Lets leave it alone
If it ain't love then
Let's don't temp our foolish hearts
Lets leave it alone

Happiness is free just like a rollin' stone
And only love can make it stay at home
Feeling's have a way of mixin' right with wrong
If it ain't love let's leave it alone
