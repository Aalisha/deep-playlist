(Leon Sylvers III)

[Spoken intro]
You don't get mad, you just get even
There's something I didn't mean to do
You just go on different directions
It happens
It happens to be true

But don't be sad
Don't even get angry
I still believe that we can see it through
Just don't forget
Everything you give you get
And in a while, it all comes back to you

You wanna rock my world
'Cuz I'm rockin' yours
I would pay those odds every time
You got to know how to dance
Before you come to the floor
Now that's the botom line

But baby, don't let that guy
Start making you jealous
He knows by now while I'm not free
And baby, I'll bet my heart
When you go out with the fellas
That you would do the same for me

You wanna rock my world
