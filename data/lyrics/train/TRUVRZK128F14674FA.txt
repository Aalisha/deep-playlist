Well, there's two sides, to every situation
Yes, there's two sides, two interpretations
A laugh is a cry, hello means goodbye
You're sayin' something baby, I don't wanna buy

Well, there's two sides to every creation
You and me babe, we're no revelation
Well, there's darkness in our light, and there's wrong in our right
There's sorry babe, I'm workin' late tonight

Well, there's two sides, there's another side of me
There's the one you think you live with, the one you never see
