She stands by the lights
After put on the audience
Smile on her face, just taken into everybody

She loves the way they love her
(The love her)
She loves the way they love her
And she smiles
She loves every sweet talking line
OhÂâ ¦

Then the smooth talking baby
Blessed man from the management
Trips on the wire
As he's paying her a compliment

She loves the way he loves her
(He loves her)
