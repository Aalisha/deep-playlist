Smoke one with your folk
Drink one with ya boy
I know it's been a little while
Since we had a little fun

Smoke one with your folk
Drink one with ya boy
I know it's been a little while
Since we had a little fun

Fancy running into you again
At this place
At this time
All the memories are rushing back again
My old friend
How you been doing?
Somebody told me that you lived down here
Somebody told me you bought a crib down here
Maybe I could check it out
