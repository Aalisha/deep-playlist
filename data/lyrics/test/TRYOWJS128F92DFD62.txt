Was he with you at the railway?
Did he cradle all your pain?
Did he show to you the best way
To make it all right again?

Now there was reason in your madness
You weighed your loss against my gain
If he was with you at the railway
Would you do it all again?

Mea culpa
I can't stay here no longer
Oh mea, mea culpa
My time here is up
So goodbye, goodbye and good luck
