This is a long road we travel
Is it as bad as it seems
Does it captivate your every thought
Oh, reaching for your dream
Well nobody comes to your door

Nobody gives it away
When you think you've found it
It slips through your fingers
Like sand it drifts away

So the moral goes
This is the way the story reads
Keep trying we believe

If this is the road we take to our dream
Do we walk in vain
