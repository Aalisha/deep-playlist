Give me one more kiss
For happiness I'll miss
For when I turn and walk away
We'll never kiss again.
Let me gaze upon you tenderly
The way you used to look at me
When we were happy and I thought
Our love would never end.

Everything is different now
The flame of love went out some how
I have a funny feelin' down inside
That the happiness I'm searchin' for
Is waiting on some foriegn shore
So darling, give me one more kiss
Before we say goodbye.
