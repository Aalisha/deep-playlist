Now, just because you're pretty and you think you're mighty wise
You tell me that you love me, then you roll those big brown eyes
When I saw you last week your eyes were turnin' black
Go find the guy who beat you up, ask him to take you back
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can see you've been out on a spree
Well it's plain that you're lyin'
When you tell me you been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
...
