She was heavy with child and he had a hungry look
They were out on the road just waitin' to be took
And I wasn't much better, all I owned in a sack
But I had enough street smarts to watch my back

And he asked me if I knew a place they could go
To keep from the wind, away from the rain and the drivin' snow
He said I'm good with my hands, I can work my way
But I don't know a soul hear, there's not much I can pay

I just shook my head and all I could say was
Don't be surprised if they turn you away

I said your child will be born to a heartless place
If he tries to do good, they'll just spit in his face
He might heal the sick, make a lame man walk
Draw big crowds of people to hear his talk
