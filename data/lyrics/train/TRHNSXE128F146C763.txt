Sometimes you walk like an angel
Sometimes you walk like a man
Sometimes you crawl like a baby
Makes me forget who I am.
Have you ever been held before
like honey to the bee?
I've never been held before
Like you hold me.

Chorus-
You make me feel like a river
Like a water overflow
Wanna shout it out from the mountain
wanna sing it on the radio
