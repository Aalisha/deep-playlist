The sun came up with no conclusions
Flowers sleeping in their beds.
The city's cemetery's humming
I'm wide awake it's morning.
I have my drugs, I have my woman
They keep away my loneliness
My parents they have their religion
but sleep in separate houses.

I read the body count out of the paper
and now it's written all over my face.
No one ever plans to sleep out in the gutter,
sometimes that's just the most comfortable place.
