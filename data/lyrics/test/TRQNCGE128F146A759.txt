Well, I'm flying down desert streets
Wrapped in mother's wine and sheets
Asbestos boots on flaming feet
Dreaming of forbidden treats
When uniforms on night time beats ask me
Where I'm going and what I eat
I answer them with a voice so sweet

I can't come down till it's plain to see
I can't come down, I've been set free
Who you are and what you don't
Make no difference to me
