Listen
I walk into your joint with a hoodie on
Don't need a short skirt to get it on
Here it goes

Aaah!

Here she comes
Sunday school girl wanting some
She's wearing that?
Better expect that boy's attack

Truce, I want some of that happy juice
What kind of sorta?
People in hell would die for John Walker
Wait a sec, everybody down
Hit the deck

People say you're going out your mind
To think you're hot stuff
Gotta think you're hot stuff
Watcha gonna do to talk about it anyhow
