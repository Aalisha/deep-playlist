Look at all the lonely hearts
Shivering out in the dark
Hiding from the truth
Cover up the proof

Demons that I? ve tried to hide
Imprison me in my own lies
And all that I can do is cover up the proof
Don? t be afraid to

(Stand up)
Stand up if you? re broken
(Stand up)
Stand up if you feel ashamed
You are not alone when you hurt this way

(Stand up)
Stand up if you need love
(Stand up)
This is not Judgment Day
You don? t have to hide, there? s no need to run
Everything will be okay
