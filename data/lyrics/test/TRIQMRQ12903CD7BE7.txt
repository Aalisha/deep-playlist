Memories
Pressed between the pages of my mind
Memories
Sweetened through the ages just like wine
Quiet thoughts come floating down and settle softly to the ground
Like golden autumn leaves around my feet
I touch them and they burst apart with sweet memories
Faded photographs
Covered now with lines and creases
Tickets torn in half
Memories in bits and pieces
Traces of love
...
