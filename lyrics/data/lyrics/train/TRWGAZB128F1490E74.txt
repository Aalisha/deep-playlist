I saw a man break down on New Year's Eve
Drop to his knees and cry hysterically
Screaming nonsense you would not believe
On the sidewalk right in front of me

And I asked him Mr. what's the matter
Calm down are you alright
Looks like you could use a doctor
And how much have you had to drink tonight

Remember this is just a temporary trip
If you stay down too long you can sometimes lose your grip
