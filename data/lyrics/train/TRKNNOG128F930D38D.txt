We've drudged many decades to live free from care
The war began it was enough to drive us to despair
A time when bread was more worth than pure gold
We missed the warmness saved us from the wintry cold

No trade with death
No trade with arms
Dispense the war
Learn from the past

Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt
Ausgebombt

Slogans to hold out till end dreams ramble to the sky
Evacuated far away we left everything behind
Fifty hundredweight bombs dashed us to the ground
