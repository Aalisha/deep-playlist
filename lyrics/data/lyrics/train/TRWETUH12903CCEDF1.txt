Ohhh... Girl I love you
Ohhh... Aaaaaa... ohhh
It's it's it's serani
Its its its melanie
Just in case you never know oh oh

Love you girl
Do you feel the same
I doh wanna play... gaaaames
No gaaaaames... ohhh
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby just play it straight straaaaight
No games... ohhh

Weve been together 6 months now (The most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows (Baby changed my ways)
I gave my life over to you
And you turned around
After all that weve been through
I was your rebound

Girl I want you (all time)
I'll forever love you (you're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad... (cause you)
