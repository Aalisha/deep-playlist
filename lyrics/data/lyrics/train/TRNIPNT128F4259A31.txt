I believe that sinfulness
Can burn your soul away
There's no release from nothingness
When love has gone away

Starkest ice age, you will rust
Time will turn your bones to dust
Alchemist turn lead to gold
Keep your dreams, don't sell your soul
Be careful

I believe in forgiveness
Hate will eat you whole
Bad blood, a lifelong curse
...
