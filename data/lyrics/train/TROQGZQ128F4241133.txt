Don't choke on that, homeboy, blow it out
Don't sip on that drink, pour a little out
Let your life reflect what comes outta your mouth
And never pull out your piece unless you dumpin' out

Never fear no man but know when to run
Leave no man standin' till the battle is won
And when it's gettin' real good, better pull it out
When niggas front, don't give up, my brother, sweat it out

And don't smoke what you don't roll up
And act right if you know you can't fight
Take a test if you're unsure if it's yours
There's a one percent chance that it might be another man's

And we know the life we been livin', that one day we might fall
And the only choices we give is got our backs against the wall
And I know we're all God's children, He's got love for us all
Still we're livin' these thug, these thug commandments

Stop cuffin' that young girl, let her breathe
...
