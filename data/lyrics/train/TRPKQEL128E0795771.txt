Wait in line
'Till your time

Ticking clock
Everyone stop

Everyone's saying different things to me

Different things to me
Everyone's saying different things to me
Different things to me
Do you believe

In what you see
There doesn't seem to be anybody else who

agrees with me
Do you believe

In what you see

Motionless wheel
Nothing is real
Wasting my time
