She's holding a secret that she'll never tell,
She's holding a secret that she'll never tell,
Because the myth is not supposed to retire
We'd rather it lit itself on fire,
Or overdosed in a 4-star hotel.

She's holding a truth that she'll never reveal,
She's holding a truth that she'll never reveal,
Because truth this time is an ugly child,
And mother and daughter may reconcile but their faces will never heal.
