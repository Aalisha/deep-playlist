I've been down so low people look at me and they know
They can tell something is wrong
Like I don't belong
Well, staring through a window, 
standing outside they're just too happy to care
Tonight I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again
I tripped on my way in, got kicked outside, everybody saw

And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well but I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

Sometimes I feel so full of love, it just comes spilling out
