This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you
This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you

I'm writing from the bedroom
I'm ennui and in my cups
All the kids are kissing in the bathroom
Licking bags to get their ups
I've gotten 3 proposals since I left home
And none have left me impressed
It's getting much harder to say no
And even harder to say yes

This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you
This is a jetsetter music letter from me to you

You met a naf annihilator
Oh whose treasure was her trap
