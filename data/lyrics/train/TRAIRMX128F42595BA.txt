And you say, "Change your ways"
And I just might
If you can get the pyrotechnics right
But I expect no more than a sentimental feeling and/or
A new T-shirt for my closet
Otherwise, give my deposit back

Since when did you look less than stunning?
Since when did this seem less than moving?
Since when am I too calm and collected
Too uptight to be effected?
And padded pews confuse and lose appeal
The more I feel accused by you
...
