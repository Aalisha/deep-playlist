(She'll come back x2)

She's looking out the window, in a moving motor train
She's finally free now, nothing to lose and everything to gain
She's gotta start all over again, she didn't really swim in love
But it's a history repeating it self, she's only out to take a walk

She'll come running through the rain
She'll forgive and forget the pain

She'll come back like a yo-yo
She defies all gravity
She'll come back like a bird - flying half around the world
She'll come back like the summer, like the winter, spring and fall
She'll come back, she'll come running through the rain
She'll forgive and forget the pain
