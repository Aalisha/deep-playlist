Ah dreamy lips, set in motion, flashing
Ah breathless hush, poundin' soft, lasting
Oh glossy mouth, a taste untamed, moving
Carousel, up and down
Just like you

Oh baby
Just one more time to touch you
Just one more time to tell you
You're on my mind
Baby, why can't I have you?
You're breakin' my heart in two
You know what I'm goin' through
Oh baby, why can't I have you?

Oh candy smile, all the while, glinting
...
