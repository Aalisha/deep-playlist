I don't know what went wrong
If I did wouldn't matter 'cause
It just wasn't enough

You know when the moment comes
To be strong, your resistance
And that's what we're led to believe

When the big world falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here (I will be here)

You don't mind if life's not that pretty
It will soon disappear
It will be miles away
...
