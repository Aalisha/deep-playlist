I'm amazed in a way that we got this far
At the pace we're going you think we're gone
Amazed in a way that we're all still here
Just look at our last 50 years
Our tests in the west in the years to come
Does the dollar really matter when the whole world's gone?
Worry about yourself while the world still turns
But wait until we watchin it burn
Ah yeah
Stuck in the revolving door
Caught in our race for sure
Just look into your eyes
Now do we have the strength to survive?
Stuck in the revolving door
Caught in our race for sure
Just look into your eyes
