Pressing on about our business
Comfort is getting too expensive
Hot-shots for the pigeons with a death sentence
You're something like a pistol
That's been polished bright
But if it never leaves the holster
It can never save your life

I need a meaning I can get behind
A better message to subscribe to

Set sun I'm an hour older
