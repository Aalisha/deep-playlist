Rise to your feet little soldier
Times are changing, yeah
See in order to get it
You got to go out there and get it
You got to know your mark
Yo left yo left yo left right left
Yo left yo left yo left right left
Yo left yo left yo left right left
Yo left yo left yo left right left
I’ve got my mind made up
I’m in my fatigues and I’m ready for war
Hear the drummer drumming
This situation's my occupation
A buffalo soldier that's just what we are
And when you're digging your trenches, soldiers make sure you dig them deep
Cuz the only way to survive this place this time little homie is to never sleep
You see this war ain't in Iraq it’s right here on the neighborhood streets
Well mother fuckers they're just living to die, welcome to the belly of the beast
You got a little bit of dro in yo pocket spark up and put your mind at ease
Cuz you think they give a fuck about you for a second, ooh
