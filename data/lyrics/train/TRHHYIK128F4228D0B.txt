Can't believe you're touching me like the way you're touching me
I can feel past your skin into your energy
Feeling like the moon is under the sheets with us now
We're glowing so bright and baby I just don't know how...

So this is making love...
I can't believe it... Ohhh oh oh oh oh oh
So this is making love...
I just couldn't see it

Can't believe the way your lips, your lips are kissing mine...
