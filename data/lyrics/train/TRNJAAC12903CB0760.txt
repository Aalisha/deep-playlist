The boards, they bounce up and down in an abandoned house
Amps exploding and our ears bleed red but we yell out every note
In the kitchen you tell me about the evils of the world
Swallow hard on every truth that's been fermenting in your throat

Know that it's my luck I'm leaving, I met you once when I was dreaming
I'm waiting for a spark to reignite
Lie to me, I love believing, take the mundane, look for meaning
In everything, you're everything tonight

On the lawn outside, Gabe shoots bottlerockets through the night
