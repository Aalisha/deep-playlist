Have you ever stopped to think
About these moments in between
Concerned not with life
While existence stands at the edge of a knife
We eat the lies, then drink and dance to the insect song
No promise of a better day as empty words get washed away

Can't stop the bleeding in my head
Can't stop the pain
Can't stop this world that we've deranged
Can't stop the burning from within
