So if you want my number, my sexual guarantee
And if you need my lovin', my sexual guarantee
Like, if you like my glamor of sexual guarantee
I wanna see that heartache of sexual guarantee

Tonight when we go dancin', there's magic in the air
The club is always jumpin' and everybody's there
A mood of expectations, we dance under the stars
The bells that strike at midnight of Alcazar

So if you want my number, my sexual guarantee
And if you need my lovin', my sexual guarantee
Like, if you like my glamor of sexual guarantee
I wanna see that heartache of sexual guarantee

Alcazar, Alcazar, Alcazar, Alcazar
