Tell all my friends I'm dead,
I'm leaving you, this time it's for good.
Tell all my friends that I'm dead,
It won't be long before you forget... my name

Can you tell that I'm losing myself?
I think I'm trying too hard to
Let it show, to let you know
Don't trace your footsteps back to me

Cause I've been gone for a long time
Waiting on the sidelines
Hoping for a chance to play
Well I thought I would never
Leave anything behind
I also never thought I'd say...
