I bet this road will take me out of here
Take me far away from Amarillo
I bet this car will go real fast
The wheels might even drive me past
The places that you said I'd never go, oh

Texas sky is the biggest one I've seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad
And all the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So I'll fill her up with hope and worn out dreams

And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
...
