Here comes the little ghost
Here comes the little ghost
Here comes the little ghost

Oh what a bad mood he's in in the morning
Acting like that is the best thing that's going
Seems like he was always dancing around you
And I remember him spinning all over
I've been here but not for much longer
Go out and get me a hand full of powder
Red eyes and red lips that come up and kiss you
Sun coming up on a big broken picture
