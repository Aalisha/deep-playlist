Check your connections here's a solid
Four on the floor
Close to perfection you just wanna
Come back for more / have more and more

Hey now Hey now
(We're) Moving on up now
Hey now Hey now
We're raising the bar
Come on Come on (now)
Get on the ship to a place among the stars

We keep on rockin'
Baby don't stop
