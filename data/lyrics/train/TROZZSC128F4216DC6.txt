Check it out, give me my 'spect
Check it out, give me my 'spect
Check it out, give me my 'spect
Check it out, give me my 'spect
Hit the lights and I appear beyond the stratosphere of Meccable function
And if you're pretty let your lady sleep in Carmel City
Begin and end the day on Lennon hunts for beach fronts
To lit blunts, now all agreed we're sippin' OJ with the Dom P
Bounce and bring it like it counts to be Luccified
CL is sextified and women spell me nationwide
You say you want my lips where and I can grab your what?
I love your hips legs breasts faces with the firm butt
Now feel the muscle when I hustle in the bedsheets
'Cause my manly treats can hit the fridge for more sweet
Splash, and let me do my thing 'til it's hot and sweaty
Reload the CamCorder, I guess by then you'll be ready
'Cause all my children got one life to live
But knockin' wifey out the box is clearly a negative
I'm in rugged wears with fancy facial wears
And all the real shit come in pairs, and bounce 'em in the house y'all
Pete Rock, is in the house, CL, is in the house
Pete Rock, is in the house, CL, is in the house
Pete Rock, is in the house, CL, is in the house
Pete Rock, is in the house, CL, is in the house
Back again, I'm here to win, to bust rhymes on beats again
Copycats and rug rats, sit back and watch a champion
It's time to wreck shop and show the world I'm true to hip-hop
So check the style and peace to niggaz in the penile
Now umm, it's the original funky chicken tactic
