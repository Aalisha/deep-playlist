Hello my friend it's good to see you once again.
Alright let's make believe that everything's okay I guess.
Could melt to everything I didn't do,
So what, your conscience on vacation too?
No three day weekend's gonna relax you,
But one day when I get my sweet revenge.

It's the last time I believe that you're my friend.
Well I won't ever believe your lies again.
If I could somehow make you cry,
I'd do it 50 million times.
Even then you wouldn't understand.

I could not let your cooperation let me hate my life.
