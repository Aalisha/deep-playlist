Death is her boyfriend
She spits on summers and smiles to the night
I can't help my love for graveyard girl

Death is her boyfriend
She spits on summers and smiles to the night
She collects crowns made of black roses
But her heart is made of bubble gum

Graveyard girl
Graveyard girl

Dark rags and red stars
She's the dirty witch of her high school
She worships Satan like a father
