Can't pretend that your nothing special
You've got to look at all of your options
You cant decide what to go for
When its all about trust
It´s all about trust
You see yourself on the TV
You read your magazines
You can´t explain how its come to be this
Stop and think
When its all about trust
It´s all about trust
Go!

This coverage
Youre centre spread
Your centre spread
Your neon light daydream
Will shatter and break

Will shatter and break
And if you think I'm thinking of your value
Thinking of your value here
...
