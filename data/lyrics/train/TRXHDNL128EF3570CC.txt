There's a plane flyin' outta here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says, "that's right where I need to be."

Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leavin' her alone is killin' me
And holdin' her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be

Where when I hear her I can see her
