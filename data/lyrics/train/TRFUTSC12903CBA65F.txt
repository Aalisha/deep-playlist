You let me in but won’t let me out
You hold the key to what it’s all about
I hear your machine just coming round the block
Just ready to go to rock around the clock

He’s an angel but no one can tell
He might be from heaven might be from hell

You’re not alone in the rock zone
You got it down down to the bone
You’re not alone in the rock zone
...
