Does anybody hear?
I'm sorry that I'm late
I hate to keep you waiting

I try to get it right
But all I get is wrong
My memories are fading long

I'm wakin' up
I'm wakin' up
I wanna live myself to the bitter top
I'm wakin' up
I'm wakin' up
I wanna spin my wheels till I make it stop

I'm wakin' up
I'm wakin' up
I wanna build my ship till I've had enough
I'm wakin' up
I'm wakin' up
I wanna dive myself into this water

I'm sorry that I'm late
It happens all the time and if you walked away
You know you'd do better
