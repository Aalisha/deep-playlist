Livin' in the meadow
The mighty, mighty meadow
With too many people
Suckin' all the water
And my daddy was a farmer
He was a racecar driver
He is a four leaf clover
He is the next messiah

Now he's living in the woods
The dark and dank woods
With a cocktail waitress
Who thinks she's an artist
Take it down to the river
Split it right up the middle
Now it's gonna be trouble
For a pregnant lamb and a con man

Now he's sick in the clink
With his head in the sink
And the tumor gonna make a
Man outta him
Now, my daddy was a chancer
He was a bad-check bouncer
But he beat that cancer
...
