Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah
Hmm

Sexy, everything about you so sexy
You don't even know what you got
You're really hitting my spot
Oh yeah, yeah

And you're so innocent
Please don't take this wrong 'cause it's a compliment
I just wanna get with your flow
You've gotta learn to let go

Oh baby, won't you

Work it a little, get hot just a little
Meet me in the middle
Let go, just a little bit more
Gimme just a little bit more
Just a little, just a little

Let me, I'll do anything if you just let me
Find a way to make you respond
I know you wanna break down those walls
