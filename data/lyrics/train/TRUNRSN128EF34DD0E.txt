(Gary Zekley - Mitch Bottler)
All of the lonely nights
Waiting for you to come, longing to hold you tight
I need you so desperately
Waiting for you to come bringing your love to me (but)
I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles, cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill, just to have you near me
As love is reality
