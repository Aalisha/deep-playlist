When you left me all alone
You left me cryin' on my own
Tell me, tell me, what you gonna do
Tell me pretty baby
Cause I'm still in love with you

Come back (baby)
Come back-won't you come back to me
Come back (baby)
Come back-won't you come back to me

Here I'm standin' such a fool
It's not like you babe
...
