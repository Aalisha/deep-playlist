Will you tell me when the lights are fading
Cos I can't see, I can't see no more
Will you tell me when the song stops playing
Cos I can't hear, I can't hear no more

She said I don't know what you're living for
She said I don't know what you're living for at all
He said I don't know what you're living for
He said I don't know what you're living for at all

But I will run until my feet no longer run no more
And I will kiss until my lips no longer feel no more
...
