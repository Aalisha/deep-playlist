May I bang with this?

I'm like this... and you're like this
I'm like this... and you're like this 
I'm like this... and you're like this

We tigers We tigers 
Woop! Woop! Woop!

Hey kids let's pick up sticks
let's make out the sounds of our own,
All dogs invited if everything feels wrong then we need a little bangin' goin on.
1-2-3 arms for the trees
self seekers vomiting doubts,
I changed all your words but my poltergeist concurs that words aren't even necessary right now.

But I'm a noisy singer, singing out at a dinner: dinners are much stranger now.
