You can choke on easy ways
While we stay up every night and every day
Doesn't matter what you say
'Cause your ways are so fucking lame

Yeah, we're all coming over while you
Watch you take your pills, watch you fall asleep
Yeah, we're all gonna dig
The sound on the new beat

There's no way that
Your gonna make it out of here in time
Only lovers
Only lovers gonna be left alive

There's no way that
Your gonna make it out of here in time
Only lovers
