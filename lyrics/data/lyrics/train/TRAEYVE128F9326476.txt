So you think I've come alive, got my head out on the outside.
Yeah, I've worn you like a brick, yeah, now I'm sick.
I move in time, I hear your face, it's all over the place.
And everything I sing and do, f**k you.

I hear you've got a brand new beau, I hear he's lovely, white as snow.
He moves in time, he moves real nice,
I swear to God that's my advice,
it really makes the world unstick, yeah.
