In your head monsters call
In the air you find no one
Is there at all

But you keep them alive
Paralyzed you cannot run
You only crawl

So find a new way to live
Before you die in the cold
And though the sky's caving in
The fear must not gain control

And do not worry my friend
Or make this call by your sole
And find a new way to live
Before your fate's set in stone
