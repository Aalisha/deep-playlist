Remember how you used to ummm,
You used to phone up and (oohhh)
You just say hey you.You know, I
See you on my blank sheet before I
Write or form oracle this situation yo,
My memories choke me and stain my
Pillow as my voice become hollow as
I trace tear lines around this space
That won't fill yo I feel nothing but
This way and the emptiness stays
And its cluttered witha silence that
Teases me it leads me on like it's
Gonna say, like it's gonna say...

(Chorus:)
Hey you, I'm Sorry that I have to leave
I'll try to come back oohhh.
Hey you I'm sorry that I have to leave
I'll try to come back one day.
