I love You, Lord, I worship You
I love You, Lord, always
So thankful Lord, You saved my life
You saved my life today

Let me be a shining light for You
Let me be a joy to You always
Let me be a shining light for You
Let me be a joy to You always, yeah, yeah

No Superman, I'm no hero
I'm just a man in Your eyes
But through Your son I've overcome
The Father of all lies

Let me be a shining light for You
