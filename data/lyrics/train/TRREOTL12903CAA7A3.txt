Do it

come on start a fire
in my electric chair
baby cross my wires
light up my hair
overload my circuits
let me feel the juice
make me an offer
that i can't refuse

blow my fuse
(hey hey)you got nothing to lose
blow my fuse
i need a good shot
i can't give it to you
on electric cruise(?)
blow my fuse
you light my light i'll light you

baby shake my tower
get it while it's hot
...
