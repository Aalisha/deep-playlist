INTRO:

Wake up in the mornin' feelin' all right 'till I recall
You're gone from my life and I stare like a dummy against the wall
Since you've been away, oh, yes, I am uptight
It's a fact of my life I guess I'll try to fight

CHORUS:
You are always on my mind
Have I gotta go through this old life
day after day and find
You there on my mind
