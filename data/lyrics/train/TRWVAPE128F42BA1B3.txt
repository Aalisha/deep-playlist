Mama, they try and break me.

the window burns to light the way back home

a light that warms no matter where they've gone.

they're off to find the hero of the day

still the window burns, time so slowly turns

someone there is sighing
keepers of the flames

do you feel your names?

do you hear your babies crying?

mama they try and break me
