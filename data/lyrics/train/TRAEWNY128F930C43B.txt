when I look around now what do I see
the faces around they won't answer me
the bit I know is just a part of entirety
show me a place from where I can see all
take me to places above, take me away

when I look around I stop making a move
people as far as my eyes can see
I feel the world is passing me by
take me to somewhere out in the sky
where I can see all
take me to places above, take me away
