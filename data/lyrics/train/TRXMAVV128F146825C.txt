You come and get me when I'm all alone
On the corner just skin and bones
Fever in and fever out
You're the swinger who brings me doubt

Loverbo, where you comin' from?
Down there, out back always on the run
Cool, cool, deep blues
You're the shine on my shoes

Is it in the damp heat inside of me
Or is it in the fire that we collide?
I feed you mood swing
But you're never satisfied

Is it in the damp heat inside of me
...
