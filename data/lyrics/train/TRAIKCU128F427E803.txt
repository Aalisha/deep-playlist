Oh no, this couldn't be more unexpected
And I can tell that I've been moving in so slow
Don't let it throw you off too far
'Cause I'll be running right behind you

Breaking me down like this
You're the only one I would take a shot on
Keep me hanging on
So contagiously

Oh, when I'm around you I'm predictable
'Cause I believe in loving you at first sight
