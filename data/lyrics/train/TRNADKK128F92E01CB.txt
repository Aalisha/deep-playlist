You cool your bed-warm hands down
On the broken radiator
And when you lay them freezing on me
I mumble, "Can you wake me later?"
But I don't really want you to stop
And you know it so it doesn't stop you
And run your hands from my neck to my chest
Crack the shutters open wide

I wanna bathe you in the light of day
Tangle up around your face and body
I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
...
