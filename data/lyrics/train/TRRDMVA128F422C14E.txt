Wake up you're a drama queen
Carry on like your supposed to be
Get away, hurry up, come on, get away

How long have you been in your bedroom?
It's been three days straight with your sheets and your pillow
The clock on the wall is a reminder
Of my father, and all his integrity

I know that I shouldn't let it get to me
But it does and who am I kidding?
A dead end job and a lack of family
This town really gets to me

Wake up you're a drama queen
Carry on like your supposed to be
Get away, hurry up, come on
Get away, gotta get up and go
Break out from the drama scene
Stick around, it'll bury me
Get away, hurry up, come on
This is becoming a catastrophe
