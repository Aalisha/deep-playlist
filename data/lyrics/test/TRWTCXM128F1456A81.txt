One of these days the gig is up
Shouldn't we take the time now
To show our love

One of these days the gig is up
Shouldn't we take the time now
To show our love

Yeah, I got the blues again
My mistake
Tell me did you see the end comin'
Now I'm searchin' for a sign
But looking back there're only good times

Now I'm on the road again
My soul aches
It's clear that match won't work for me
And now though things don't seem so hot
I know I gave him all the love I got

Bye, bye roses
I got me a hand that's bitter sweet
But I don't care
I've known the garden
But I don't care
I've known the garden
I've known the garden

Bye bye roses
...
