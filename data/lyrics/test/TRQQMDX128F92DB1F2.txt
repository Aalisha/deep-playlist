Love is a lie and
Love is a mess
Telling the secrets of loneliness
Our love survive
How does love survive?
Letters are written
Words are spoken
Some hearts are better left unbroken
How will love survive
How will love survive
Little by little, step by step
We were called the dirty pets
Heart to heart and side by side
