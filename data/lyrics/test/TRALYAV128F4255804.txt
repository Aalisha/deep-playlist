Pretty if the sun won't shine
I'll be coming out to meet you
I'll be there to make you mine

You're pretty if the rain will pour
I'll be knocking at your window
I'll be begging you for more

It is as if you've come along too soon
and I'm trying to fit you in
but I can't seem to follow

You're a cutie if it all falls through
We can piece it back together
...
