'Cause you must know you are my true love, Mary
Yes you are, Mary Magdalene's on my mind

'Cause you must know you are my true love, Mary
Yes you are, Mary Magdalene's on my mind

While the world laughed, you stood by me
Others ran, you chose not to flee
You got hell on earth for lovin' me
Nothin' scared you away, by my side you stayed
To my father above you prayed and prayed
To switch places with me when I was slayed
