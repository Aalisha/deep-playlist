At Lunarville 7, down at Airlock 3
There lives the old magician called Infinity
Sweet father of illusion, child of the stone
The Astral Wizard Master in a cosmic home

The Dragon Lord of Jupiter and Spaceblock One
The crimson void inertia and the seventh sun
Rider of the starchild unicorn, he saves
Children of eternity in astral graves

At Lunarville 7, down at Airlock 3
There dwells the evil spacewitch called Eternity
The Equinox of Saturn, Queen of Fire and Ice
Princess nocturnal demon, mistress of the night
