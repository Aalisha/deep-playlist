I rewrite my life, beneath moonlight
Please hold me now, till my breath runs out
There are many things, that I am not
But there's one thing that, I can't deny

A double bluff, you fed me lines
The shortest cut, you're searching for
A mesh of tones, surround your eyes
I wish I knew, how it came to this

I always said you could rely on me
Now it seems that I was wrong
I want you to stay
I want you to stay with me

‘Cause nothing works ‘round here
Where cranes collect the sky
I long for the neon signs of night
‘Cause nothing works ‘round here
...
