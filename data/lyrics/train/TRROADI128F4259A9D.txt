Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
doo, doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
doo, doot dooo

I'm afraid of the dark
'specially when I'm in a park
And there's no-one else around

Ooh, I get the shivers
I don't want to see a ghost
It's a sight that I fear most
I'd rather have a piece of toast
And watch the evening news
