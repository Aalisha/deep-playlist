Seventeen and seeing the world through the bottom of a bottle
A suicidal drop out rehab advice I'll never follow
How could you do this, how could you do this to me, I'm so sorry
I'll never be the perfect son you always dreamt I'd be

So you turned your back on me
At a time when I was most in need
I'm so scared
And I guess I've learnt that life isn't always that fair
