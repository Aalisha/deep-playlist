Ya know David, I'm tellin you man, it ain't getting any easier
Come think of it, it never was easy bein me

I know a little â€˜bout a lot
I need a lot more of what I haven't got
I learn everything the hard way, nothin ever came for free
I never paid attention but I always paid the price
I never learned a lesson till I learned it twice
