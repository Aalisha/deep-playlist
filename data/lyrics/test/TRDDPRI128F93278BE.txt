one hour on a Sunday
that's all we have
in the patience of Monday
it never goes so fast
and I wish, it was easy
I wish you only knew
I wish I could explain things
instead of hurting you

it's never enough
it's never enough
it's only the broken edge of love
it's never the tide
a place in your mind
that's all
I don't want to leave you nothing
