I need to get away, everyday
All you got to do is play the jukebox player
Come on little girl
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Well, if you don't mind, anytime
Shakin' up the crowd to the rhythm and rock
I said, come on come on
I'll teach you how to rock and roll

Listen to what I mean
Won't you listen to me
'Cause it feels so good
Oh get back on your feet
Break out on the floor
