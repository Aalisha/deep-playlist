[Xain]
It's so cold I wanna go back to sleep
Or set to snooze, at least for a week
Findin' it hard, to get motivated
It could be the draw but I don't think it's related
Phoned in sick for the third time in a week
Changed my voice to sound ill when I speak
With the glass half empty, nothing is easy
Can't even get a good picture on the TV

Yeah, yeah, yeah, apathy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's takin' over me

[Eggs]
I got a problem I can't fix
Cause I've been hittin' it hard on the mix
Where's the purpose, what's the reason?
When I could stay indoors until mushroom season
