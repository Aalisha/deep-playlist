Heartbroken, I watched the rain beat on the sidewalk
Complete with gray skies and headlights
And puddles on the sidewalk
Everyone's ruined like me

It's weird now and then I look back
Each day spent careful, is still consumed over time
I think it's worse to be aware
And know this change, than to go on every day, unknowing

I'm having trouble with realizations
Why does it have to be a regretful mess?
If I could have one day back now
I swear I'd use it well

Ohh, 13, where did you go?
