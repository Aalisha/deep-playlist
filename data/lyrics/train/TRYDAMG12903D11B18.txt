If you had a choice of color
Which one would you choose, my brothers?
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right?

How long have you hated your white teacher?
Who told you, you love your black preacher?
Do you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks not of kin?

People must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
