Bet you remember how I used to put it down
When you used to be my baby
We used to hang out at the crib or g-get around town
Till you switched the game up on me

You never realized what you had
Now that I'm gone, no, I won't be back
And I can smile 'cause it's over me
That's what get for trying to do me shady

And I heard about the chick you had in my car
Shoulda known the day would come when you would get caught
Never thought that I would ever take it this far
But you know what, you should've step your game up, game up

And you can't be mad now 'cause I'm on my G
I'm a play him the same way he tried to play me
Tell me how it feels now you sitting lonely
Thinking about me

You know that I'm good, shorty we ain't gotta talk about it
And you should, get other guys man, I wish you would
Go and do that to somebody else
Don't try to run that bullsh** on me
...
