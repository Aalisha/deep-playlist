Everything looks different
A man smiles at me
I apologize and leave
You go on and I'll stay behind
Now in a younger time
When nothing's left desired
And all our fears caught closets
On the way down

Changes come like bullets
Shock but no pain
Dear me I see I'm alone again
Changes come like bullets
Shock but no pain
Dear me I see I'm alone again
...
