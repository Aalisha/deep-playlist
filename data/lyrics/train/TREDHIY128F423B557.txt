Verse 1
First of all you should know that
I am over you its okay
but then again I never thought
I would make it to this day
After everything weâ€™ve been through
I finally know the truth
(Chorus)
What goes around, comes around
and will come back to you
And how you treat your brother man
will pay you back in full
and for every seed you will sow
I just thought that you should know
Hmmm hmmm heyyeah
