[Chuck verse 1]
We dont control sht
No education
Enforcement
Economics
Depending on governments
Forever in a plantation state
Damn this is why i hate hate
Wanna do something for the people
Make us equal
Instead of creatures
Who got human features
Let the whole world reach you
Things classrooms cant teach you
Now can you dig it?
Sing the song till we all get along
Feed the poor
Damn the law
