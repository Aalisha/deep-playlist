Rally up my friends,
Come and stand by my bedside.
If I die tonight
Put my head inside a masons jar.
Put it in the ocean
And send it out to sea,
I'm wading because-

And when I hit some shore,
And when my seal is broke,
I'll split my eyes and lips asking,
"Is this a judgement or a joke?"

This is a chance to make it up.
This is a chance to dissect it.
This is a chance to break it up.
