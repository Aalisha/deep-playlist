[Chorus]
The almighty Tanya Morgan, you know it (We, We Be) x4

I’m goin’ hard for Tanya, and I -
Can’t stand most of the stanzas - that I -
I hear litter in the air waves, hear the play the better way, let it play-you’re ears will say; D***, that N***** made my day!

I Hate the way super-n**** says that n***** get it twisted, they figure with persistence ‘til you tempted to get one of this- And They don’t know the difference as a witness givin’ this was written
- if it ain’t hittin’ no dissin’ I keep it real wit ‘em.
feel the?
are you based to realism or fiction - we lend - rhythmadiction - let you pay it back with interest
used to get the feds up here, you like the last line of defense, the future of the game dog, you sound a little wheezy Come on-

[Chorus]
