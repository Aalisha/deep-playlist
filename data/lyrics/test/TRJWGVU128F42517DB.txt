You would think that keeping up would be easier
Living large and living strange
Bend yourself
Summer time it always seems to come creeping up
Keep in mind I want it to

You're cold and you're tired
You're hurt and you're sad
For all that you've given
For all that you've had

It's not what you think it is
It's not what you think it is
It's not what you think it is

You would think that living large and living well would wear you down and wear you thin
And where you're gone don't you know I'm grumpy when the time is right and time is on my side
Baby you could fix me up I could do the same to you and maybe sometime soon
