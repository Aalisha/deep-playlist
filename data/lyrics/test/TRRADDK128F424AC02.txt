They read you Cinderella
You hoped it would come true
And one day a Prince Charming
Would come rescue you
You like romantic movies
And you never will forget
The way it felt
When Romeo kissed Juliette
And all this time that you've been waiting
You don't have to wait no more
I can love you like that
I would make you my world
Move Heaven and earth
If you were my girl
I would give you my heart
Be all that you need
Show you you're everything that's precious to me
If you give me a chance
I can love you like that
I can love you like that
I never make a promise
I don't intend to keep
So when I say forever
Forever's what I mean
Well, I am no Casanova
