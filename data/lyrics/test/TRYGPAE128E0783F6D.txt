If you're there and you care
And you listen very careful, darling
You'll hear my prayer

And if you hear, loud and clear
You would get a million kisses from me
Somewhere, somehow

And if the night's a lonely time for you
Just listen to the words I gave to you
Let the song of ours play one more time
Somewhere, somehow
I'll be there
