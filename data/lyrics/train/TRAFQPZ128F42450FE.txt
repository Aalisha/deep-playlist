It's just coincidence
Well you can talk that way, but i have to say,
I don't beleive in it
It was the chill of chance, i decided to dance the days away
And i wasn't worried at all
Sneaking through the back door
No, I wasn't worried at all
Dreams are what you live for

Waiting for the light to turn green
Carry me home
To the kindest eyes that i've ever seen
Carry me home
Well can you tell me how will it be now
how will it be
Can you tell me how will it be now
How will it be?

well we were younger then
And the days were long and slow
But were we wiser then?
