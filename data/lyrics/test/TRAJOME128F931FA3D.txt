The city shells on the land
I'll buy a boatand I'll sail away
I'll leave it all in the sand
I'll buy about & I'll sail on

Noone will know where I've gone
The waves will wash all the signs away
A dreamers journey begun
The waves will wash all the signs away

Glass dolphins leap in the sun
Glass dolphins leap in the sun
