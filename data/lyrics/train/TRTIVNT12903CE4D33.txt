Just like I said before,
Give me two weeks, when I come home, I'll come and say hello,
With hugs and kisses for you Mrs. how I miss you so,
Been gone forever, nothing better than to see you though
And tell me how you been (been),
Don't you act surprised this is how I am (am),
I'm feeling good and that's real (real),
You and me should kick it more than ev, more than ever, more than ev.

Remember me and you,
Remember me and you,
Remember me and you,
...
