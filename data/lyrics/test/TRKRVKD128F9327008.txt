You better get up out the way,
Tomorrow we'll rise so let's fight today.

You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say,
'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway.
You better get up out the way,
Tomorrow we'll rise so let's fight today.
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say,

'Cause we're gonna rock this whole place anyway.

Look up and see,

That motherfucking writing on the wall.
When you see J3T,
Thirty deep, he's down to brawl.
Fuck all haters I see,

'Cause I hate that you breathe.
I see you duck you little punk,
You little fucking disease.
I got HU tattooed,
On the front of my arms.
The boulevard brass knuckles,
In the back of the car.

'Cause we drunk-drive Cadillacs,
We never go far.
But when you see us motherfuckers,
Better know who we are.

I got one thing to say,

To punk-asses who hate.
Motherfuckers don't know,
But you better watch what you say.
From these industry fucks,
To these faggot ass punks.

You don't know what it takes,
To get this motherfucker drunk.
I'm all ready,
Run baby, it's a little too late.

Johnny's taking heads,
Off of all faggots who hate.
'Cause I'm a God,
Motherfucker, there's a price to pay.

Yeah I'm a God,
Motherfucker and it's Judgment Day!
