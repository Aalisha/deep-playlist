who... yah yah yah uh huh
who saw you stumble baby,
who let you fall,
who gave you something out of nothin' at all?
who's the one for you to turn to,
when you're feeling low?
who's always been there for you,
darlin' you know

who's gonna turn your back on,
all that we had had?
who had the good times,
should out-weigh the bad
who took the vow that they'll be there
til death do us part?
