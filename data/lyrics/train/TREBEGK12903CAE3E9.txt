All up in the cookie jar, the cookie jar
She got that SOS for score
Pushing from a distance, distance

Said she need a little love
Wanna show me all her secrets
I know she need a place
So now she's all up in the candy shop

Hand up in the cookie jar
Lips are on the lollipop
Chocolate covered cherry strum

Berries in the whip cream
Dripping on the bed sheets
Eat it up like ice cream

I got a body saying, I got my hands up
All up in the cookie jar, the cookie jar
Treat it like a rock star, the cookie jar

All up in the cookie jar
Treat it like a rock star
All up in the cookie jar

And now I gotta ride a breath
