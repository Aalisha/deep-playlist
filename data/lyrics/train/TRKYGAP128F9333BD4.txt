Gather 'round now everyone
Put your glass in the air
Sing along now everyone
We've got a reason to cheer

Take it in, breathe it in
We are about to begin
Make the choice to use your voice
But don't get lost in the noise

Skip classes, take chances, have fun
'Cause when it's over it is done
Skip classes, take chances, have fun
