Listen to me, im talking to you

be your own friend, and fight for yourself
no one has your back, youre helpless

who is willing to stand up for what they believe in? nobody
they fold and crumble under fear, and anything else that challenges them,

Rise, and change my friend
this isnt what it seems
reality already passed me by
