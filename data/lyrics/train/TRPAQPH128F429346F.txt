(Shawn Camp - Randy Scruggs)

Used to think that love would be so simple
Just happy ever after one another
Sometimes it's hot to trot
And sometimes it's the old cold shoulder
Oh, you can't have one without the other brother
No, you can't have one without the other.

Sometimes you'll think she's sent from heaven
A best friend, confidante and lover
Oh, there are times that little angel
She ain't nothin' but a devil woman
