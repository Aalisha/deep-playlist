Here comes that boy I like,
He never looks at me,
He's with that stupid girl,
With the stupid clothes and the stupid hair,
If I could talk to him I'd say I love him so,
If I could make him see me, in the place I go.

I'm gonna make him mine, gonna tell him why
He's the only boy for me.
I'm gonna make him mine, gonna tell him why
He'd be better off with me.
I'll take him to a place that I know,
A place that I love to go;
I'll take him to botanic gardens,
To botanic gardens.
