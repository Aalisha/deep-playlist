I am the message boy, moving down the street,
Moving in and out of traffic,
A businessman step in line to meet,
I might bring you good news - a message boy does that,
I might bring you bad news - a message boy does that.
Oh, the words they might be beautiful, then again they might annoy,
All I ask is remember I am... I'm only the message boy.

Only the message boy, only the message boy,
Only the message boy, only the message boy.
