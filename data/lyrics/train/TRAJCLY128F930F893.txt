This is for all my Low Life thug niggas yeah, 
livin' they life as a Ghetto Star, you know (worldwide)

[Verse 1:]

You know those days when you hear the lord calling you
But you don't respond 'cuz you ballin' and your all in two
Your Ghetto Star lifestyles, big houses and cars
Million dollar phone calls to bad bitches and all
A nigga don't make five bucks to spend before he come up
Sippin' out this half a pint bout to light up this blunt
Just reminicin' bout past years, deaths and tears
So many fallin' peers I'd never though I'd see these years
Swallowin' my tank of beer hope the rain hide the tears
Pray to God I aint scared, if they bust, hide and hit
And if they come fightin' shit I won't believe it cuz I'm low
I'm a child of God and keep mashin' for whats good to me
You should recognize game when it's all in your face
Would you choose to lie and die mamed so you fall on your face
But I refuse to lose so I ball in my space

[Hook:]

Live my life straight ballin'
I hear the penitentary callin'
Live my life straight ballin'
I hear lord Jesus callin'
