Don't listen
Don't even hear a sound they make, it breaks you
Unspoken
Words that taunt you when you listen
Forgotten
Words that haunt you while you're sleeping

You seem afraid, don't be alarmed
It's only the face of things to come

Servant to the sun, we are beings, we become as one
Lighting every cell, every shape we will never form
And is it relevant?
Our fears, our faults
As foolish as it sounds
