The worst time, to hit you with my first line, no
Everything seemed fine, when I hold you like you're one-of-a-kind
You said you were a sure sign, it's feeling like the last time
Play it back, it's going over and over
Give it up and pull me through, all of this to tell you...

I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far
Can't stop feeling, doesn't matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye
You could stay, I'll be alright
I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far
