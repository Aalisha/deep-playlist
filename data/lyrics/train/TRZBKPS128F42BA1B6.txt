Yeah
I feel you too
Feel
Those things you do

In your eyes I see a fire that burns
To free the you that's running through
Deep inside you know
Seeds I plant will grow

One day you will see
And dare to come down to me
Yeah, come on, come on now take the chance
That's right, let's dance

Snake
I am the snake
