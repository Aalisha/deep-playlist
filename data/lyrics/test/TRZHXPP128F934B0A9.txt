Cowards, with your empty hearts
And narrow minds... So bitter
our confusion is overwhelming
So aimless and misguided
Your search for a higher power
Something better than yourselves
In a perfect world, your perfect god
Is a coward just like you
Watch them gather, they flock together
For in numbers they feel strength
...
