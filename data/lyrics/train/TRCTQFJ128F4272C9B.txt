You are so much cool one, I don't worry about a thing
You are pushin' full of lovin' that makes my heart sing
I know that you want me & you prove it every day
You're the kind of girl I can find giving my birds and I say

Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
Said I wasn't gonna tell a soul
Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
But I, oh I, oh I, I couldn't keep it to myself
