You can see 'em, the things that you want
But you don't have the means to buy
I've been eying what you've got in stock
And I'll tell you what's on my mind

We could meet in a room with a lock
If the world can't reach us for the love that we've got

You like moving all over town
Where the music gets down in your heart

I've been watching the things that you shake
And they're driving me out of my mind

Can't you see that I'm here to decide?
And the heat from your eyes, just burns my insides
...
