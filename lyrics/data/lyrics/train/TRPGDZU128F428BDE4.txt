Y'all want to see tits and ass,
Street grit and sass
As beatniks smoking grass on holiday
-You know what we want-
You're looking for a grievance to mask, preferably with a fetus in the trash
While you eat quiche and laugh on the Champs-Elysee
-You know what we want-
I'm not down with that B-list staff,
As they yell out Jesus at mass
I'll be laughing while I knead this mish-mash of pottery clay
-You know what we want-
An appropriated grease-slick slab, posted up as a meat stick add
But I make the average moviegoer too seasick and sad
-You know what we want-
And I'm too caustic to run, for office or be expunged
For my agnostic plunge
-You know what we want-
So what I've accomplish and done, is viewed as an off-setted pun
By the posh and young tastemakers
-You know what we want-
An overdone tame premise,
I jump from the plane wreckage
Unscathed yet sunbathed in the rigors of a bass pluck
-You know what we want-
...
