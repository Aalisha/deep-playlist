Boom!
Bang!
Boom!
Bang!

What's that on the pavement in front of me?
I don't remember letting someone in for tea

Cardiovascular!
Muscles to muscular!
The great smell of Brut
Coming on after you!

Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...
Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...

We!
Removes stains without powder
Free!
It just zooms all around you
Cardiovascular
Born in a power cut
Freedom in a bed
...
