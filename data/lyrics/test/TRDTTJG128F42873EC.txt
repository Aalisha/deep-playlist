Don't lie don't lie to me now 
Now I'm erasing you 
Throwing those memories out 
Out to start something new 
I'm throwing those memories

Darling 
Don't lie to me 
Darling 
Don't lie to me
Darling 
Don't lie to me

Darling don't

Breathe in slowly now 
Darling don't lie to me 
Breathe in slowly now 
...
