Breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Roller coaster, favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time

Leave me standing here
Act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear
Can I please go home now?

I had that dream
About you again
Where I wait outside
Until you let me in
And there I stayed
...
