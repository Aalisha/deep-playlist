First time I went to California
I couldn't believe my eyes
Skirts were so short
Nights so long
I thought that I would probably die
Fresh our of Luckenbach Texas
I didn't expect that pair
Both of them had one thing on their mind
And both of them were willing to share

I never had two women before
But I'm an open minded person
So baby lock that door

Love
We're lovin' in stereo
And it's love!
