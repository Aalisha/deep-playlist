I got the talk when I was younger
And understood as I recall,
They hadn't mentioned this at all.
My heart was racing like a sprinter
That tripped and fell
In love with a girl just for tonight and that's all.

I've got big, big plans
And they've got to mean something more
Than just once
I just don't know what I want.

I'm gonna tear your ass up like we just got married
And you're all mine now
Tonight is the night we've been waiting for all our lives
Or maybe for just tonight

I got the call when I was older
Yeah and I understood
If it happens then it happens and that's all
My arms the hose and you're the fire
...
