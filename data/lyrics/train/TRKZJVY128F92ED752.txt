I feel alive beside you
And all at once, I am whole again
We fall into each other
Your atmosphere is all I'm breathing in
And in this rush, we are crushed

Carry me down, rolling in your arms
Cause I can't remember ever falling this hard
Tell me tonight, all that we have been
Was it nothing more, then noise inside my head
Crashing down, crashing down
In your avalanche
In your avalanche

These scars we wear remind us
...
