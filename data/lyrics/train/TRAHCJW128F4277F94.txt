Na Na Not Not Nah {*3X*}
It's Street Life {*3X*}

S to the A, man
Lets get into this shit nigga!

I don't drive a g5 truck but I'm live as a fuck
Had to go to prison for years for me to wisen up
Used to run around and formaldehyde it up
And if we ever bumped heads you pretty much knew you was out of luck
Remember I shot crack-head Reg(gie) in the leg for running off with a mac
even after he gave it back
Nigga this is deeper than rap
Though a lot of niggas say that

Everything that I speak is a fact
Shit, then I shot crackhead Debbie
Talk about domestic abuse this bitch got hit with the desi
Now after Debbie and Reggie I'm ready
for any and everybody that want to test me
Bless me, you're a thug
Kid I shot in the Camelot, your shit was sweet
(?) Until his mans got hit with the heat
Why ain't I just give you shit to critique
Everything you hear me spit to the beat
Shit I did in the street

[Hook: repeat 2X]
You don't want drama
