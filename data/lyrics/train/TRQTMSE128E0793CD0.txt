I get this feeling as you walk away
A million hearts will break in two
But they don't know the games that you can play
So they will always follow you

Every time you move, everybody grooves
I can't help thinking it's alright, alright
You just gotta walk, see the people talk
I like to watch you party

'Cause everybody wants ya
When everybody sees ya
The world is full of dreamers
But I'm a great believer
And I'm no fool, 'cause I got you
