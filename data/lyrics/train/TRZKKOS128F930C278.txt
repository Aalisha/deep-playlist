(Lead vocal - Clare Torry)

Some are born to lose their heads
And some are born to use them
And some will never know their ends
And some are born to choose them

Don't let your fantasies be blinded by the light
You don't have to save your wildest dreams for the night

Dont hold back, don't hold back, don't hold back, reach out
Touch the sky with your mind's eye, don't be afraid to reach out
