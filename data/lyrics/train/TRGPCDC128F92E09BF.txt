Yeah, whoa yeah…
He's got me so gone,
Cause I can't stop won't stop,
Bouncin' off these walls.
I'm so crazy in love,
Might friend well just lock me in and shut the door.
Cause I ain't gon' try to escape his sweet prison.
So what makes you think that I might need rescuing?

Is this how it feels?
Am I losing my mind?
Cause everyone keeps tryin' to save me.
I'm head over heels,
I can't get enough.
And I know people might call it crazy,
But I call it love (love, love, love)
I call it Love, oh oh…

Ain't nothin' wrong.
I'm just out here on the edge riskin' the fall.
