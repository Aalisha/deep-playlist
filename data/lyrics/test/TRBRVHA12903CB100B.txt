Trace the shape of my heart
'Til it becomes more familiar to your eyes
I've been lost without you, cold without your love
It's taken days and nights to make me realize

CHORUS
Rescue me from hanging on this line
I won't give up on giving you a chance to blow my mind
Let the eleventh hour quickly pass me by
I'll find you when I think I'm out of time
...
