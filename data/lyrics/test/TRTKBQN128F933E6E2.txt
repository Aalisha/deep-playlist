I sat alone and watched TV
What a feeling can't be changed
As they say a smile won't catch your eye
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to loving

Let us be loving, let us be loving
Let us be, let us be, lets us be
Let us be, let us be, lets us be

And the grass out there on the riverside
It don't have to grow
Out into this forest wide
...
