You ran cryin to the bedroom
I ran off to the bar
Another piece of heaven gone to hell
The words we spoke in anger
Just tore my world apart
And I sat there feelin sorry for myself
Then an old man sat down beside me
And looked me in the eye
He said, "Son, I know what you're goin through
You ought to get down on your knees
And thank your lucky stars
That you've got someone to go home to.
