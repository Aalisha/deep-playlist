There you were last night, sitting close to her by candlelight
I couldn't let you see my crying eyes but I wanted so bad to run to you
How could you find someone in just so little time

We said we'd be friends maybe one day, give us one more try
I can't understand, it happened so fast, six months have passed
Now suddenly you've gotten over me

It hurts when I thought I had gotten over you
It hurts when together forever won't come true
It hurts when one broken heart is how it ends
'Cause it hurts to know that you are in love again
