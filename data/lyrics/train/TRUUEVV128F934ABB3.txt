(Lyrics-Ron)

Forbidden fruits are the sweetest
Your true messiah
Is frightened by shadows
As he tries to unwind
Whispering ruins
Irresistable illusions

A coin in the well is a wish
Serve and suffer, scorn for scorn
Things could be a lot worse
When you think your down regressions
Take a look around
Razorblade maze
Shelter from your pain
