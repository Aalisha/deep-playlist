In a whirlwind caught away,
Broken lips have carried you to a place,
Where you don't know just how you
Ever got this far away. from here,
Thinking somehow you could cross the point of no return,
But my love will never end...

Whatever reason, you've been running,
I just don't care anymore!
Already forgotten, whatever happened with what went wrong,
I just want you to, come home.
