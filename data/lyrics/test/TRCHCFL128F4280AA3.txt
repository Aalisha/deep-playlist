Intro: sometimes even when you feel like giving up, you just got a live on
Verse I
It all started at the age of 18
Just a young kid out chasing a dream
Streets was the hang out, every day kicked out
Caught by security telling us to get out
New route to the mall or my mom's house
Girls would call just to talk or to hang out
Good food, BBQ, playing halo 2
I'm living proof of a dream come true
I remember taking pics of the city life, seen a guy get his lights knocked out and out of sight, it all happened so fast we heard cops sound, this is a story of a kid from the down town.
I grew up on the north side east side,
No gang signs yo we only through high 5's
Skateboarder faith in Jehovah
Stayed sober skate straight ye little soldier
The takeover GO trains to great culture
Range rovers ride down to California
I'm rolling with my God to a different lifestyle, chic, chic blow
Who would a thought I'd be down
Looking at my life now it's all good understood
