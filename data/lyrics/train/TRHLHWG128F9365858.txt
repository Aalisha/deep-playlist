Back in the Ronald Reagan days
When we put satellites in space
When boys wore skinny leather ties, oo-oh-oh
Like Don Johnson from Miami Vice

When Eminem was just a snack
And Michael Jackson’s skin was black
Back when the coolest thing in store, oo-oh-oh
Was a Commodore 64

(Yeah yeah yeah)

Back to the 80's
Back to Soap
Back to Rocky and Cherry Coke, yeah
Those were the days
And we go

Back to the 80's
Say ‘Hey there, Mister T.’
To Twisted Sisters on MTV, yeah
Those were the days
Ah, come back!

To Iron Maiden and 7Up (Oo-oh yeah)
Bananarama and Breakfast Club
Come back (Yeah)
Come back (Yeah)
Ah, come back!

When Huey Lewis was the news
When we went flying with Tom Cruise
