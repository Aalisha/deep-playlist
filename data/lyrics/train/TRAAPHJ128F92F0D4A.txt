See me in me heels and ting,
Dem check sey we hip and ting,
True them no know and ting,
We have them going and ting,
Nah pop no style, a strictly roots,
Nah pop no style, a strictly roots,

See me pon the road I hear you call out to me,
True you see mi inna pants and ting,
See mi in a 'alter back,
Sey mi gi' you heart attack,
Gimme likkle bass, make me wine up me waist,
Uptown Top Ranking,

See mi in mi Benz and ting,
Drivin' through Constant Spring,
Them check sey me come from cosmo spring,
But a true dem no know and ting,
Dem no know sey we top ranking,
...
