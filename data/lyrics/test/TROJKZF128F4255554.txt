Now everybody's talkin' about all the brand new dances
But I've got 3 that I'm gonna do for you, lord have mercy

I'm gonna start with a dance now, baby, called the boogaloo
You know that one, don't you?
Everybody's groovin', baby; it's gonna move you too
Lord have mercy, get it! Get it, get it, get it, get it, ow!
