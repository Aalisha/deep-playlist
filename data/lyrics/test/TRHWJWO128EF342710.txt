Pa pa pa la pa

It was a still hot day
I was sitting doing nothing
When I saw him cruising by
He looked kinda mean
On his devil machine
As he turned and he winked his eye

He's got tact
And he knows how to use it
I fell for him
When I first saw him cruising
I couldn't help it
It was none of my choosing
But I'm so glad
And I don't wanna lose him
He's got tact
And he knows how to use it
I fell for him
