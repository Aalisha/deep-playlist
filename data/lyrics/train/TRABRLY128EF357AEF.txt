You want her don't you?
All those past mistakes you've rued
Well, look who lost the gold
And rather you than me, cus the view I can see is heaven, heaven to hold

Hey you, give up the ghost cus I'm the one that she loves the most
And although you've tried she's forever tied to me
And hey man give up your band cus I hold your pen in my silver hand
And your never close so, give up the ghost
