A call from the grave, fortress of hell
Forsaken land where evils dwell
Killing with violence, reach for your gun
You cannot stop them it's time to run
No life is found, grisly remains
Zombified humans eating your brains
Writhing in torment, screaming in pain
Unspeakable horrors will drive you insane

Time standing still
They close in for the kill
