One can have a dream, baby
Two can make a dream so real
One can talk about living love
Two can see how it really feels
One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true, yeah
And one can stand alone in the dark
Two can make the light shine through
It takes two baby
It takes two baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
One can have a broken heart
Living in misery
Two can really ease the pain
Like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar
