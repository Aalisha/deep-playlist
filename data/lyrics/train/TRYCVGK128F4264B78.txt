Rain keeps falling, keeps falling down
Like it's never going to quit
Trouble stalks this one horse town
Like it can smell the fear inside of it

Through the night the fires rage
Mixing juices 'til they disengage
Mouths get hungry and the hands reach out
Is there something we should talk about

We've got to head for higher ground
Good people there's hard choices going down now
We've got to head for higher ground
Head for higher ground, higher ground
...
