Can't get you out of my mind 

I can't get you out of my mind 
Your love is like a drug
And I've been so drugged by your love
That I don't even know the time

And all that I can do
Is think of loving you. 
Yes it's all that I can do
It's all that I can do
'Cause I can't get you out of my mind

I tried so hard to stop
Thinking about you baby
