I'm not surprised that you still call
I'm not surprised
I'm more surprised that i don't answer
Pick up the phone to call you back
Pick up the phone to call you back
Ain't it funny how things work out like that

'Cause the time that it takes to open my eyes
Is the time that it took me to realize

Madly, madly, madly
Well tell me that you need me
Show me I'm the only and that's all I need to know.

Madly, madly, madly
Well if you really love me,
When you see me leavin' baby, just let me go

Well I've been good, no I've been great
You say you're in a better place
