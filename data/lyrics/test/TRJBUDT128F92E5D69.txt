I'm so happy since the day
I fell in love in a great big way
And the big, big, big surprise is someone loves me too.
Guess it's hard for you to see
Just what anyone can see in me,
But it simply goes to prove what love can do.

I've missed the chances of life's game
But my luck change when I ain't ok
and it pick on me for its affinity

He's not like most mother and guys 
wasting all his time on sporty pause
now he's got a whole time job
and loving me

My baby don't care for shows
