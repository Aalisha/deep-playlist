Father set me free at this altar of death
dead fingers cold as ice touches my flesh
as it passed through my soul and body
the fear I thought was gone grows
tears of regret and confusion
this is not what I wanted to know

I have embraced the truth
beyond lies where honesty reigns
I thought I gave my life
but back I was only given pain
...
