Let this dagger bury deep
Cause I'm not afraid to bleed
Through all the spaces in between
Never meant anything
Cause i gave everything i had
To build a promise land
A place where proudly i could stand
This castle made of sand
Is slipping through my hands

The dream is over now
Our hearts have been misguided
Lost somehow
The dream is over now
Our fate has been decided
It's all been lost somehow
It's over now

Is this a blessing or a curse
A message well rehearsed
...
