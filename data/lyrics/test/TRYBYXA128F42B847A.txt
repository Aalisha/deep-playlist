All that I need is love

You're crying night and day
You wonder how you ever lost your way
Nothing matters, you must survive
Your heart is slowly dying and so you cry

All that I need is love
From the moment I wake, let me feel your embrace
All that I need is love
Hold me closer each day, every step of the way
