I had dreams but an illusion was everything
All the nights I passed crying for you
My life this being as one has filmed of terror
your pretty eyes gave to the nessessarie comfort
your words to me was as one gifts of god
But everything this had a bad end

I wanted that I was as a romantic film
Where I had a happy end
And was to your side
I wanted that I was as a film
I wanted that I was as a film
