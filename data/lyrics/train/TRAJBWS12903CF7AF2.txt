In the distance light years from tomorrow
Far beyond yesterday
She is watching, heart aching with sorrow
She is broken is broken as she waits
Hoping when all is said and done
We learn to love and be as one

Oh Starlight, don't you cry
We gonna make it right before tomorrow
Oh Starlight, don't you cry
We're gonna find a place where we belong
Where we belong
And so you know, you'll never shine alone
