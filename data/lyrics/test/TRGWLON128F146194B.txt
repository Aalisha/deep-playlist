turn around go back down
back the way you came
cant you see that flash of fire
10 times brighter then the day
and behold a mighty city
broken in the dust again

OH GOD, PRIDE OF MAN
broken in the dust again

turn around go back down
back the way you came
babylon is laid to waste
Egypts buried in her shame

their mighty men are all beaten down
their kings are all fallin in the ways

OH GOD, pride of man
broken in the dust again
