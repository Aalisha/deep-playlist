Fellas I wonder would you mind if I talked to ya for a minute
You know, sometimes we have a tendencies, or should I say we forget
What a woman needs every now and then
That is, if you wanna keep your thing together
Listen to me now

Do the things that keeps the smile on her face
Say the things that make her feel better every day
Then you got to stay on your P's and Q's
If you don't, the woman you can easily lose

Oh I, oh I had a love and I lost her
And no one can help me share the pain that she caused me
...
