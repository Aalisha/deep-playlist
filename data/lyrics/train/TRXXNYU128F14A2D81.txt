What's your story send it over to me
I'll take a look and see what there is to see
At least jot a few things down
Anything to let me know I'm in your head
And not on the ground
With the cigarette butts
From the mouths of all those little sluts that want me
I'm lying here with the negative thoughts running my brain
Over again look where I've been, feel me try, feel the sky
Feel that you're able
To do what it is you need to when

This city life is draggin
This city life is draggin us down
