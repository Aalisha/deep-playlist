There is something on your mind
By the way you look at me
Something on your mind, oh, honey
By the way you look at me
Can what you're thinking
Bring happiness or will it bring misery?

No, no, please don't try to tell me
I think I'll understand
Girl, girl, you don't have to tell me, pretty baby
I think I'll understand
You want me to try and forget you
But I'll do the best I can

You know it's so hard to be in love
And then someone you love don't love you
Until it gets a heavy burden on your heart
To know that somebody's rocking your cradle
