Hey, baby
What you feel like doin'
Just me, just you
Just us two

(Just us two)
Oh, baby
(Just us)
Ooh-wee-, ooh-wee, ooh-wee, ooh, ooh, baby
(Just us two)
(Just us)

I saw your face and love struck me just like a lightning bolt
Just like 20, 000 volts
You seemed so shy I guess I'll shoot a rocket to the moon
Can't afford to lose this groove

I've got to let you know
On my knees, I prayed for you to love me
Tender love, warm my heart
'Cause you've got to court me to spark

(Just us two)
Always and forever
(Just us)
'Cause no one else could love you better
(Just us two)
Just me, just you
(Just us)
Just us two

I haven't kissed you yet, I don't think I can handle it
Just a hopeless romantic
I hear your body talkin', ooh, sweet words of love sublime
Tell me, can you read my mind?

There's not a spoken word I can say
'Cause I prayed for you night and day
Tender lover, warm my heart
'Cause you got to court me to spark
