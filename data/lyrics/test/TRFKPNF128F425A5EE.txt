Just for you

Written by - Mike Pickering, Paul Heard, Heather Small

I will climb the highest mountain
just for you.
Bring gold and silver to your door
just for you.
I will raise my glass up to the sky
just for you.
I will be your strength and be your pride
be with you.

I'll make sweet soul music all night long
just for you.
Make you feel that you belong
just for you.
We'll take a ride in the tunnel of love
just us two.
I will scream aloud at the altar of God
I love you.

[Chorus]
Just for you I'll wash you down,
cleanse your soul and be around,
...
