If lady luck is on my side
She will be with me tonight,
I barely made this month's rent,
Save a lucky hand of cards
I'll think of something next month.
Four flights down to the street
To a place we agree to meet
And she is there waiting so very patiently

Tonight just celebrate luck,
Tonight for sure.
So I try to live every second of it,
So as not to forget
...
