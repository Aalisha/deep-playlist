They drew first blood NOT FUCKING ME
The institutions that try to decide how I should live my life
With their traditions they expect me to fall in line, but their will, their way is not for me
Anyone thinking with an open mind is often ostracized
So my decision just to stay within my own kind is justified
They drew first blood it wasn't me
I didn't ask for all these things to be part of this world OR PART OF ME
