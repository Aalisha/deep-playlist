You maidens now pity this sorrowful moan I make
I am a young maiden in grief for my darling sake
My true lovers absence in sorrow I grieve full sore
And each day I lament for my Jimmy mó mhíle stór

Now these twelve months and better my darling has left these shores
And he'll never return till he travels the wide world o'er
...
