Quit school when she was seventeen
Senator on TV calls her welfare queen
Used to be daddy's little girl
Now she needs help in this mean ol' world

Buys cassette tapes in the bargain bin
Loves Carlene Carter and Loretta Lynn
Tries to have fun on a Saturday night
Sunday morning don't shine too bright

It's welfare music
Watch the baby dance
To the welfare music
Well she ever stand a chance?

Takes two to make three but one ain't here
...
