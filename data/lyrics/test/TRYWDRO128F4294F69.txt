Lo-fi tennessee mountain angel come back to me
Met you in a bar when I was drinking
You stood next to me
You say you wanna play country
But you're in a punk rock band
You say you wanna play country
But you're in a punk rock bank

I didn't know you then
I didn't know you then
I didn't know you then
I didn't know you then
