I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not blown away
Just irritated and quite hated
self control breaks down
Why's everything so tame
I like my life insane
I'm barricating and debating who
I'm gonna kick around

Right now
Can't find a way
to get across the hate
When I see you

Right Now
I'm feeling strange inside
I want to slash and beat you

Right Now
I rip apart the things inside
that excite you

Right Now
I can't control myself
I fucking hate you

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt just fucked away
I'm devasted and frustrated
God I feel so bound
