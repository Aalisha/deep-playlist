[Hook x4: Talib Kweli sample]
"Livin' my life, expressin' my liberty
It gotta be done properly" "done properly"

[Verse 1:]
My patterns is unmatched
I leave MC's hunchbacked with one rap
Guaranteed no comeback
I run laps around 'em, roll like Dunlap tires
Made a lot of niggas retire, I be ya highness
Sucka MC's might as well call me a sire
Just shootin' the breeze
Fuck a plane, I take you higher
This is rap for my niggas that pack, push packs
To the citizens, fakin' no jax and we militant
Straight up out the trenches
Young black and gifted
