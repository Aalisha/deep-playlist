Always thought You wouldn't love me just the way I am
So I tried to satisfy You, I didn't understand
How misguided I was in my search to know Your love

I was working hard in all the wrong ways
Living life chaotically never sitting at Your feet
'Til You taught me the true meaning of grace

Be still, there is peace in Your arms I am free
My heart is all You want from me
So I will be still, hey, yeah, hey, hey
