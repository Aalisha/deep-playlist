I am not a beauty queen
Drivin' in a limousine
I‘m a girl but don‘t call me baby

Who the f**k gets VIP?
Live a life in luxury
I don‘t care so just call me crazy
Can you give it out?

Don‘t stop just take it to the limit
Watch me boy it‘s spinning around this time
Hush, hush, running to the night, feel alive

I just can‘t get enough when I‘m with you
‘Cause your fever makes me feel so good
Turn it up boy you make your move
See I‘m burning but it feels so good

Can‘t get enough when I‘m with you
You got fever but it feels so good
Turn it up baby make your move
Keep me burning ‘cause it feels so good
