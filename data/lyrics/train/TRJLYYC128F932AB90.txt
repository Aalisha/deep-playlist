Away down yonder in the state of Arkansas
where my great-grandpa met my great-grandma
they drink apple cider and they get on a jag
and they dance all night to the Salty Dog Rag

They play an old fiddle like you never heard before
They play the only tune that they ever did know
It's a ragtime ditty and the rhythm don't drag
now here's the way you dance to the Salty Dog Rag
...
