what i got to do to satisfy anybody
if my chain hang down to my dick
then let me wear it proud
you would love to see me nailed to the cross
rather then see me blow b label at ya boss
fuck you till's that download my shit
and fuck you tills that wont let me live
an open mic in the phsyc wont get me cribs
and a freestyle battle wont get me shit.
yall pussys, im a soldier so we dont mix
you all mushy on the inside im stone cold brick
yall want pleasure so ill give you pain
give you beach rhymes unlike the other shit is lame
ima blow right past by you when im switchin lanes
on the highway to heaven hydroplane through rain
