i've got a thing about destruction
i've got an appetite for pain
i wanna watch it all just burn down
cause well this town's so lame
wanna see it all just float away now
wanna watch it all go up in smoke
we've gotta feed our new affliction
cause well this town's a joke

i gotta see you, when everything's gone

watch it fall
you watch it fall now
you watch it burn down
watch it burn
gonna take this city to the ground 
watch it fall
you watch it fall now
