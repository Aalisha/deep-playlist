You can tell me how to run my life
You can tell me the drugs you're using
You're talking loud and saying nothing
Walking proud and going nowhere fast
You know

If you could tell me how to find belief
If you told me, I'd believe you
Speak no evil, hear no evil, see no evil
I'll close my eyes, you know love grows

4 ever 2 gether, 4 years 2 come
4 love 2 strong, 4 us 2 part
4 ever 2 gether, 4 years 2 come
4 love 2 strong, 4 us 2 part

I stuck a marriage proposal in the waste disposal
If that's the trash aesthetic, I'd suggest that we forget it
Your 12 disciples might kiss and tell
But you can tell me much more than they can
