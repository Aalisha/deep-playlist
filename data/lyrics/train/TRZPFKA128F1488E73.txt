Time stands still for no one
I know this is true
I've been stuck here waiting
Then along came you
And you gave me back
The love that I had
The faith that I'd lost
The life I knew.

Chorus:
I wanna thank you for the love you give me
And the sun that you put in my sky
You don't know how much you've lifted me up
But I feel so alive
That I could fly
I could fly, oh.

There's now way that I could've made it this far
Without you
You came to me just when I needed someone to believe
That I could make it through
And you gave me back
The love that I had
