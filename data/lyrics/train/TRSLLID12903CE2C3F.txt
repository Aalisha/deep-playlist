I think you're cute, you're a pretty girl
That's why we're living in sin
You always ask where I'm going
Or find out where I've been

Have lots of fun, makin' love, girl
But now you're making me sad
No kisses or any sympathy
Can make up for the past

You're a pain in the neck
Pain in the neck
You're a pain in the neck

I'm sick and tired of all your questions
