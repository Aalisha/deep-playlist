"O come all ye faithful, ye lovers come sing
A cry from the mountains, a call to come worship your coming King
Come praise Him with music, and honor Him with dance
Behold He comes quickly and He carries His reward in His hands

Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah, let every creature sing hallelujah
Hallelujah

And build Him a highway on the music of praise
For the Light of the True Morning
