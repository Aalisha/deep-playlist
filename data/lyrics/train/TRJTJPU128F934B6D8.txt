A vision of unselfishness, a union of black and white
One nation of all races, it's clear within my sight
I see it clear, no hate, no fear, no soldiers sent to die
A state that's free and thrives on peace, no greed, no threat to life

We won't build the weapons of war which looms over your heads
We'll not feed the war machines that lead our youth to death
We won't close our eyes to the atrocities which abound

We won't stand and watch until we're six feet underground
...
