You say that I hang out all night, that's okay
'Cause you drink all muthafuckin' day
You come home hit mom, smack mom, beat mom
Raise another brew to your face with you, swollen palm
Then you come in my room talkin' crazy shit
Sayin' I'm high, I'm on dope and I better quit
Muthafucka, if I was high you would die
Hit my mom once more and it's bye-bye
Who are you tryin' to judge me?
Get the fuck out my face
Who put you so above me?
Clear the fuck out my space
