Wish I had of known
Baby you felt this way
Now I don't know what to do
coz I'm still in love with you

And after all I have done
can you tell me what's goin on
I can't understand why you wanna treat me so cold

**
Guess I was a fool for loving you
Guess I was a fool for thinking
that you were loving me too
should've knew
You were breaking my heart in two
**

Feel like I'm losing my mind
