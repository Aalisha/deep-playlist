Believe it,
When I said the things I say aren't true,
When I knock on the door with ten roses
Out of the blue then
You have a right to be confused

Fingers
Crunched beneath my feet
Tied a thread to the old door then slammed it shut
And you lost your baby teeth

My resolutions,
Fail when they're new
Light a match in the dark and it'll be burning
and I'll find my way back to you

But till then,
I'll be smothering the flames
Waitin up, against the rain
smothering the flames
Waiting up against the rain
...
