Desperation keeps the quest alive
storm winds soon whip as the calmness dies
Breath filled with the grit of sand
Torrents of fury rape the land
From the phantom fear I step out
I rip from your soul all that's been
And all you know
Dreams of your promised land
Burning as the wind descends
From the phantom fear I step out
I rip from your soul all that's been
And all you know

Torrents of fury!

Falling down you reach for me
I'll no longer relax
Raining down the furies within the grasp of life
...
