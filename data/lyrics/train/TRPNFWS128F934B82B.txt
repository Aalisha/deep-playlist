Carnal perversity, faith of a morbid
Molested body decorated in wounds
Rotten cadaver, sadistic butcher
A macabre operation in flesh

Consumed in blind rage, gorge on the flesh
In pools of entrails, a smile on the face
All skin ripped off, butchered alive
A mouthful of flesh, a cannibal's feast

Ravage torso, rancid intestines
