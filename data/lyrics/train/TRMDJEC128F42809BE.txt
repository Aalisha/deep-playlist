Niggas In ParisShystie

SHYSTIE

So you know I had to kill it
Heard a lot of motherfcukers spitting on the instrumental who up under me
But I never heard a woman on the riddim that be absolutely killing it and fuck it up with no apologies
So, I heard all the covers everybody jumping on and I'ma make em run for cover let me bun dem
Reign on em, summertime flow lemme son dem
I'll bodybag any motherfucker I'm from London

Ball so hard that shit cray, na hold up that shit mad
I want one Porsche in all grey, na hold up all white goes hard
I took this man out on dates, he ain't use to lobster and warm plates
He talking 'bout he want PERi-naise, na this ain't Nando's nigga better know I'm paid

Listen to the riddim how I'm flowing on it
Gotta make history, be iconic
They don't really wanna be about when I'm on it
