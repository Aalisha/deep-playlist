footprints in the window
from someone who's my friend
that will be my doorway
when i'm back again
nothing here to fear
nothing here to be scared of
i promise i'm your shelter
when it's back
breathe breathe breathe
i'll help you through
it wont be long
do you hear me
it'll be over soon
i'm your shelter
i'm your shelter
you can trust in me
