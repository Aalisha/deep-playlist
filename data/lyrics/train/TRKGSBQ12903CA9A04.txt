We were born to be alive
We were born to be alive

Born, born to be alive
(Born to be alive)
Yes we were born
Born
Born

(Born to be alive)

People ask me why
I never find a place to stop
And settle down
Down
Down
But I never wanted all those things

People need to justify
Their lives

Lives
Lives
Yes we were born, born
Born to be alive
...
