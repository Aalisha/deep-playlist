Through the pouring rain
I still feel the same, all about you
It's true, many folks agree
The answer can be all about you

Circles get broken
From the destiny's arrows
Lives set in motion
Is that how it's got to be?

All I've got to say
Please don't slip away, when life abounds you
And you know (it) hurts a lot, the pain
