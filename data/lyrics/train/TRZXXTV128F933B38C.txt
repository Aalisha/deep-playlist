Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
(You wanna be startin somethin', just funkin')
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
(Spell it D-Z-L is)
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
(Oh, pop in peace, clap and tease)
Straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
(You know what it is, do you?)
I don't know, man, I mean
Every time I hear these weak niggas get to rappin, I just like
Dog, [Incomprehensible]
It, it's a fun, it's a funny feeling
Like motherfuckers think we all about the trash
I'm like, nigger, y'all got hot garbage out on the curb too
(Let's go, let's go)
Don't be tryin' to clown [Incomprehensible]
Yeah, I'm Sir DzL, the title mean regal
You better, ah, smell my funk from the Big Yea Area
And it ain't no punk, dig?
(Donkey Kong part 2)
Yo, straight from the big bad west coast, let's go
DzL, you guest host deadly like asbestos
Destro wrestlin', check 'em with a death hold
Pretzel, Gracie School of Jujitstu twist you
There's a small issue
Somebody said we were fish food
'Cause the spotlight ain't hittin', dudes
You kiddin', fool
Nigga, a spotlight? I got light
Showin' you the way like a lighthouse
It ain't my fault you too dumb to try it out
For fear of lookin' like you lesser
Worryin' about other people and they weak suggestions
Like, "Don't do that, that shit is cornball"
They say the same shit to me
While I'm on tour and far out they reach
How's the streets? I often wonder
'Cause they sittin' on that same milk crate
I understand why they feel hate
It hurts when you set straight
