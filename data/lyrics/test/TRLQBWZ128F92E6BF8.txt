Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar
Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar

Would you sing that tune for me
And make me sail towards your knee
To lose my boat amid the sea
With all my hope and disbelief

Would you rescue me
With the pills you have in mind
Would you rescue me
Like an architect of life

'Cause I'm on to you
Like you're on to the world
