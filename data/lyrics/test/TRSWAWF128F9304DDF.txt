deep within my heart
I've been searching my way through
as the river is spreading the hue
from green to blue

carry on the flame
try to rule the lion's den
storm the fortress of standstill again
and again

the powers that be
shall try to break free
don't ever try them to deny
they all could have wings
and then become kings
holding the one the emerald eye
...
