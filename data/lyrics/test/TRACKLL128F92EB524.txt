I've been waiting for so long
You don't even know how long I have been waiting
for this day, hey
I've been thinking about all the reasons I had
to get even and to cause you pain, ohhhh

(Bridge)
And I bet they all would say that good is just to fight
But all Im gonna do is turn and walk away tonight
Tonight, night, night

(Chorus)
No I dont want to, And I dont need to
You're taking the fight unladylike, Im not gonna stop
No I don't want to, And I dont need to
But no matter how hard it gets My mama always said
To keep your head up, your head up, your head up
Your head up, up, up, no matter what
...
