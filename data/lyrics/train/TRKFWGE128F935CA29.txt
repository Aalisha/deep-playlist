Someday at Christmas
Men won't be boys
Playing with bombs
Like kids play with toys
One warm December
Our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas
There'll be no wars
When we have learned
What Christmas is for
When we have found
What life's really worth
There'll be peace on Earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world, where men are free
...
