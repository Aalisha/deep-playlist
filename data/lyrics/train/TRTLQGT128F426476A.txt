Coming hard core looking like a gangster bitch,
Trying to front like you ain't rolling filthy rich
Laguna Hills you were born and raised.
But you're claiming South Central is where you spent your days.
Coming out hard talking crazy shit,
Knowing in your mind that you really don't fit.
Standing up straight with a gangster lean,
Talking gangster slang about what you seen.

Take a chance kid,
Take a chance.
Take a chance kid,
Don't fall down hard again.
Take a chance kid,
Take a chance.
Take a chance kid,
Don't fall down hard again.

You better think twice before you come at me
Right through your fucking dome I can clearly see
Hey little dog, you gonna bark all day?
Cause toe to toe, in the ring, is where I play.
So you better step back and check yourself,
Stop fronting and just be yourself
Cause no one cares what set your claiming,
Till someone grabs their gun and starts their aiming at you!
