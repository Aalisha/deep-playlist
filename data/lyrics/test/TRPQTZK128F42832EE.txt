In a back-street club in town he goes to taste desire
Waiting for the meat, the lust burns in him like fire
Flames flicker in those empty eyes
Lips twisted with a sensual smile
Promising you a real good time if you'll join him for a while.

Condemned by innocence
Wipe away those tears, he'll chase you forever (2x)
If you dare escape

Thrill... Thrill... Thrill Killer An agonizing way to be
Thrill... Thrill... Thrill Killer Enter in and you will see
