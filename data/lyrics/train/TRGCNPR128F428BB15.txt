Well it ain't easy being rational
It can be hazardous, even laughable
And people die from what they're asking for
Cause what they're asking for, ain't never heard

Mother works so she could feed the youth
But does she feed the youth what they really need?
And everyone has got a point of view
But who is right or wrong remains to be seen

And go your way, and I go mine
We'll meet at the same place
But different times
We'll leave all the hardship and baggage behind
...
