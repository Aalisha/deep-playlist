You had better hold on
Hold on to what you got
You had better hold on
Hold on to what you got

'Cause if you think nobody wants it
Just throw it away and you will see
Someone will have it
Before you can count
1, 2, 3, yes they will, yes they will

Spoken:

Listen fellas, you know, it's not all the time
That a man can have a good woman.
