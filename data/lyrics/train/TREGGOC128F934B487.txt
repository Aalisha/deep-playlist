I breathe the absence of life,
in a part of every breath i take
inhaling afterthoughts of ruin... and regret
So no hope remains as i take another glass of pain
and i swallow knowing things will stay the same
when i see
that everything has gone so wrong for me
and i wait and see if i can welcome back the light
i'm following the suffering
and the ones who never heal
they're a part of me i can't leave behind
So i cry these acid tears,
...
