I don't think of you every day and night
I got things to do, yeah I'm doing alright
So, I can't explain why in times like these
I nearly go insane when you're not here with me
Oh I know it's really over and you're never coming back
And there's no way that I can make it right
Still I wonder, oh I wonder, oh baby I can't but wonder
Who's kissing you tonight?
