I know you are, another planet miles apart
Is it a question of things you really
Should have cared about?

You took a drive, countries called
More than your friends did, they watched you fall
And now you've pulled the wires right from the wall

Flags, don't ask me how I'm doing
I'm doing fine

Set it straight, so there is no road left, only water
...
