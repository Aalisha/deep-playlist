Moved in from the south
To the one you love.
Said I'm not made of glass tonight.
And look at what you bring
Have these words not meant a thing?
Said I'm not made of glass tonight.
And who's been living here?
'Cause there's two of everything.
Said I'm not breaking down tonight.

And hold me face so
Paris is known
