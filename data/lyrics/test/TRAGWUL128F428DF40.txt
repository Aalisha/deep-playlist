I grew from babylon soil,
born to consume and destroy
i know that cash is king
i breath cocaine, bleed oil
made to rise above all, success' my ultimate goal
i do what it takes and bring you down if i fall
handle my business with war, attack the poor, while praising the lord
raised to be raw, but act polite - for the show
let the cameras roll, i got no doubt or regrets
life off thousands of deaths, keep no promises - only threats
You politicians preaching your vision of the truth
never cared about us and our point of view
cus your campaigns only promote the killing fields
children cry but you do't hear,
people die but you can't see
cus war is big biz the big guys get rich
livin' off the poor and gain money on sick kids
it's a show for those who can afford the price
but turn that shit off i won't let you gamble with my life
We don't need a weather man to know wich way the wind blows
- cold wind blowing
we don't need your politicians to know which way to go
- we don't need you'all
we don't need your teachers, leave the kids alone
- hey leave them alone
and we don't need the poisonous fruits of babylon
Babylon
