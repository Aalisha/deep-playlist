The first thing in the morning, the last thing at night
I just wanna hold you, babe, and make you feel alright
When the sun is shining or the sky is filled with rain
Wherever we may be, I'm gonna make love with you again

Now I don't need a crystal ball to tell me it's true
'Cause I've crossed too many rivers on my way to finding you
Your smile, like a summer sun, can brighten my day
And when I'm feeling down, you chase the dark clouds away

There ain't no doubt about it, baby
I'm gonna shout about it

Take a look at yourself
Can't you see why I want you and nobody else
'Cause the first thing in the morning, the last thing at night
I just wanna hold you, babe, and make you feel alright, yeah

Sometimes I feel it in my bones, when the cold northwinds blow
...
