He's gone away to prepare
A place for me
A place, I can't hardly wait till the day to meet
Meet Him in that place
I'm gonna pray each and everyday without cease
Till I reach that place
I must take the straight and narrow way
If I wanna see Jesus in that holy place
(I can't hardly wait)
To see Him in that place
(They'll be singing and shouting all day)
