[Part One â€“ From hand to mouth]

From day to day
From hand to mouth
We're turning around
Vicious ritual

Getting used to it all
Falling down again
We're waiting for
The decrees of providence

I don't want to waste
Any more of my life
Live from day to day
Live from hand to mouth

Facing the light
I brush aside your plans
