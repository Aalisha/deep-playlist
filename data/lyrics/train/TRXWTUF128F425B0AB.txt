I see it in your face
I know your workin' hard
Kids screamin', phone ringin'
25 hours a day
Doing what you do

You drive the kids to school
Try to go to work
Cars stop, gridlocked
Here you go again
Hey it's all about you

So hold on baby I'm coming home
I've got a little something to turn you on
I'll turn the lights down low, set a little table for 2
Tonight it's all about you

You make our house a home
