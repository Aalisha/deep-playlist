On final approach my brother and I, we were so sure
Knew exactly the plans we'de made and what we were here for
Didn? have a care in the world, got by day by day
Struggled with the plans we'de made who was I anyway

Workin? on both night and day, in a famous rock and roll cafe
Never thought I'd meet a girl for me
Never thought I'd meet a girl called Cerilene

Cerilene, the road of life is dark without you and I, I just can't see
Cerilene, share my life with me
We'll go together hand in hand and we'll fulfill our dreams
