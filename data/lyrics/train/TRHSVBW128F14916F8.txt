I can remember all the things that you once said
My love was so satisfyin'
But now your love is slowly, slowly dyin'
I know what I've put you through
And I wanna make it up to you

Please forgive me, baby
Don't let it end this way
I swear I'll never lie
Just give it one more try

Take me, I'm yours
(Forever)
Take me, I'm yours
 (Forever)
I was a fool to ever let you go
 (Silly of me to ever let you go)

Please forgive me, baby
Don't let it end this way
Girl, give me one more chance
Please take me back again

I tried to deny all the love I have inside
By runnin' away from the truth
Knowin' my love belongs to you, to you
Now here I stand alone with my heart without a home

Please forgive me, baby
 (Please, baby)
Don't leave and walk away
 (Don't leave)
Girl, give me one more chance
 (Give me one more chance)
To win your love again
 (To win your love again)

Take me, I'm yours
 (Take me, take me, open up your heart)
Take me, I'm yours
 (You see I'll do whatever it takes to make it up to you)
I was a fool to ever let you go
 (Silly of me to think that I could live without you, baby)
