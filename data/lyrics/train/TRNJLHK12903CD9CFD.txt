Put your hands in the air all the people over there
Put your hands in the air
All sing come on
Put your hands in the air all the people over there
put your hands in the air
I wanna be your toy
I wanna be your toy

Alright Come on
Put Your Hands in the air
all the people over there
Put Your Hands in the air
Uh-uh I can't hear you
Put your hands in the air
all the people over there
Put your hands in the air
Now sing

Na-na-na-na-na Boom Boom
Na-na-na-na-na Boom
Na-na-na-na-na Boom Boom
Na-na-na-na-na Boom
Na-na-na-na-na Boom Boom
Na-na-na-na-na Boom
Na-na-na-na-na Boom Boom
Na-na-na-na-na Boom

Come on now jump
Jump with your body
Come on now
Don't wanna be your lady
I wanna be your toy
You can take me where you want me
You can use me for your chores
Don't wanna be your lady
I wanna be your toy
You can take me where you want me
You can use me for your chores
