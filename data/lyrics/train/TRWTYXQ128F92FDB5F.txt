Look behind you
Avoid the shadows
Watch your back now
Make your breathing shallow
Keep your room locked
And leave the blinds closed
I'm right there staring at your window
And all I need is you, all I need is you

I'm in the background on the radio
I'm in your car, in your house, waiting at your door
