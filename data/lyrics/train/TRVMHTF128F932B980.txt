Sitting on the back porch, sipping lemonade
I got some satisfaction, I really got it made
The radio is humming, all my favorite tunes
You know I'm feeling fine, a little red, red wine
So I just stop to croon

It's alright if you wanna (yeah, yeah)
It's alright if you're gonna (yeah, yeah)
It's alright if you need to (yeah, yeah)
It's alright, you can be you (yeah, yeah)
You gotta shake it out
You know you gotta shake it out

(Oo, oo)
Me and my own lady
Went out the other night
We met some friends for dinner
Then danced away the night
Went on for a nightcap
