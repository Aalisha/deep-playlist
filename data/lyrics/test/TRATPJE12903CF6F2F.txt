Oh, our dance was slow
And you fumbled with my hands
Whispered, "Time to sleep"
You have dreams awaiting your quiet mind

Does your heart get weaker
When you see how far we've to go?
Forget all the promises
You're tired and you're drifting and you're low

And if you can't steer
Then it would be safer to drop the anchor
