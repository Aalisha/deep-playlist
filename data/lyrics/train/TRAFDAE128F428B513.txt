There was a time
I was walking on a cloud
Diamonds and pearls
And a gentleman always around
Now I'm alone
Each and every other night
Climbing the walls
While my man is dancing out his life

Blame it on disco
With the fascinating lights
Blame it on disco
Unpredictable nights
Blame it on disco
With the fascinating sounds
Blame it on disco
That's the talk of the town
