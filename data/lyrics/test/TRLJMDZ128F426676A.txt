You Know I Don't know what it is
but something about you is so irresistible

Dont you try and tell me that he's not my type
To Hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire
I Know that im supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase but I cant
stop fanning the fire, I Know I meant
to say No

But he's irresistible
up close and personal
now inescapable
I can hardly breathe, more than just
physical deeper than spritual
his ways are powerful
and irresistible to me (yeah yeah, I can hardly breathe)
