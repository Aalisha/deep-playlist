i know so
ah ha a ha
you could be young or adult,
nocence fighting for cult
na killing one another in abodance
love insult
since them know death is the result
fit stop them burst, na difficult a could
a hang
many youth gonna jail through you
babilon, burn your grasses
burn food,
call i criminal
you must run...
.…...…...
(Corus)
Rastafarai liveth
the peace a them burn,
and there is no regret
they never give thanks for life glory ahhh
fit bloody ...
them a hype about them intelet,
they dub all the weapon na internet
them now fit watch nasty blue cassette,
or they guan on some one subject,

from the book of life
give them ar fire page
it doesn't matter fire stain na fire them
nastylis a guan, let the fire rain,
burn off the fire base,
lagal dirtify children now make you bring them down,
nuff say i wayne,
everything is gone
can't stop the moon star and sun
i call say ya all turn up on lava ground,

(corus)
Rastafarai liveth,
the peace ar them burn and there is no regret,
...
