We'll have a good time baby
Well it's a Planet of the Apes and a Third Eye kinda thing
Well, let's all lay down and dig through the ground
To find the holy ride that'll make your thing go ding
What Mother Earth gives back to man
Is running through my bones
But now's the time for the beautiful exchange honey
And you ain't gonna do it all alone
When the sun blocks the moon and the stars go down
I'll be floating
