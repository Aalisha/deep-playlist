SPOKEN:
Hey, come here for a second
I don't like the way he treats you
He doesn't deserve you
He really don't

What kind of man
Would leave you standing in the cold
Must've been a silly one
To sacrifice a pot of gold
You're the kind of woman
That needs a man that's always there
It's not that you require a lot
Just need some tender love and care
