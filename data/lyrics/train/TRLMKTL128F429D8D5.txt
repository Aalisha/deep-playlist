You know I smoked a lot of grass
Oh lord I popped a lot of pills
But I never touched nothin
that my spirit could kill
You know I've seen a lot of people
walking around with tombstone in their eyes
But the pusher don't care, ah
if you live or if you die
God damn hmm the pusher
god damn hey I say the pusher
I say god damn god damn the pusherman
