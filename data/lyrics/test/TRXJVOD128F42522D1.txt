Conversation is going 'round
People talkin' 'bout the girl
Who's come to town
Lovely lady, pretty as can be
No one knows her name
She's just a mystery
I have seen her, maybe once or twice
One thing I can say is
Ooh, she's very nice
She's a lady, one I really want to know
Somehow I've got to let my feelings show
(She's fresh)
Exciting, she's so exciting to me
(She's fresh)
Exciting, she's so inviting to me, yeah
I've been thinkin' 'bout the way you walk
Baby, uh, I like the way you talk
Tell you somethin' I really can't hide
Heaven must have sent you to be by my side
Fresh and lovely, like a dream come true
