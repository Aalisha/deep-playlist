Tune in, wouldn't it be something
Rumors spreading into panic
I've seen movements in the clearing
Someone sent you something satanic

I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed

Oh don't forget me I'm so stranded

I wouldn't fool you but I've, I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
