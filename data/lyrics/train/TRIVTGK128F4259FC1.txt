Was it me? Was it you?
Was it all the little things that I didn't do?
Trying to move on, but I can't
No, I can't imagine being someone else's man

Girl, I've tried and tried a million times
To get you off my mind
It's not that easy, no, not that easy

Don't you know how hard it is for me
To smile and say goodbye
It's not that easy, no, it's not that easy

It's not over, not for me
Used to have so much faith and I still believe
You're my weakness, you're my strength
...
