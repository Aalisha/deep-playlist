Oh Father... did you speak to God?
Oh Father... did he speak to you?
In the Church of Saint Anne
Oh Father... your eyes could heal the sick
Yeah, heal the sick
Oh Father... no one could ever forget
Oh Father... the night your eyes went black
In the Church of Saint Anne
Oh Father... God left you for dead
...
