Well I Just Got To, Got To, Got To, Got To Get In Touch

Write me a letter, drop me a line
You know I'd love to hear from you anytime. Anywhere
Oh yeah
Well you know that I'll be seeing you before too long
I'll give you good lovin' when I get back home I swear
Ooh yeah

I miss you every night and day
And I can't get enough

I've just got to get in touch with you
And when we're lyin' skin to skin
