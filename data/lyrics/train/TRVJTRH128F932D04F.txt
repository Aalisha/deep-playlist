Sweetheart, baby, we can't let the whole thing fall apart now
I've been working all the time and I know it's not what you signed up for
Somehow, darling, gotta hold on for better times
I'm done with sleepless nights

Oh, the memories of summer on the mission streets
With carefree hearts, no expectations at all
Now we're older, babe, the world just couldn't stay the same
I'm still sure you're the girl that I adore
