You watch and know
Unspoken, not forgotten
As one we've grown

And sometimes soft
So soft could penetrate a rock
You know we

Got to make it
See to it, straight through it
Got to find it, we see in you
The word on the street is not the same as it used to be

Will you still know me when I'm gone?
The word on the street is strong and it surrounds me
