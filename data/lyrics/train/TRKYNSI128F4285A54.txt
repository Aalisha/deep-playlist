One night in heaven, one night in heaven
One night in heaven, one night in heaven
One night in heaven, one night in heaven
One night in heaven, one night in heaven

Sometimes I get to thinking while you are far away
Just how much I miss you and how time it ticks away
So sad when we are fighting, too much tension too much hate
Sometimes I need reminding before it gets too late

Just one moment in my day, yeah
Take me up to a place
So far away in your heavenly space

One night, mm, one night in heaven when you touch me
You take me up high with the clouds in the sky
