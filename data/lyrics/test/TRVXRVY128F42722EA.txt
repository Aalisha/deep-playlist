I love music, any kind of music
I love music, just as long as it's groovin'

Makes me laugh, makes me smile
All the while
Whenever I'm with you girl
While we dance, make romance
I'm enchanted by the things that you do

I love music
sweet, sweet music
Long as it's swinging
All the joy that it's bringin'

I'm so happy to be in complete harmony,
I love you, girl
