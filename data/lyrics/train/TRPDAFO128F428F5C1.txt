Rushing, way too fast,
Why do I always do it?
Thinking this might last,
How could I be so stupid?
But this time,
I'm not OK, no,
I need to breathe again,
'Cause I don't want to

I don't want to make
Another mistake like you
And I don't want to hate
But love doesn't get me through
'Cause I can't be alone again
No I don't want to make
Another mistake like you

Stone cold and hurt inside,
Not what I wanted to be
...
