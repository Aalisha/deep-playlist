Funny how love feels
Funny how love can be
Funny how love feels
Feels

I didn't know till today
I could get hurt so easily
But now I realize
It's time that you say goodbye

And I almost cried
Why must you go can't you stay
I wish you could be here everyday
Holdin' me close to you
We both know it don't feel right
To say goodbye

Ain't it funny how love can bring you down
'Cause you know somethings wrong, yeah
Then you turn around suddenly you found
That your love keeps you strong
So you can hold on

Funny how love can be
So wrong, so wrong
Funny how love can be
Can be so right

I didn't think about it much
I didn't know the meaning of
Giving my heart away
