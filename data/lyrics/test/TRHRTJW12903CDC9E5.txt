Why should I care? What should I do? 
Change who I am, cuz you don't like my point of view.
Judgement comes from all sides, there is no middle ground.
Double standards can't measure my worth, I am who I am.
I don't dress to please.
And I don't care, I don't care who sees.
You'll never be satisfied by me.
