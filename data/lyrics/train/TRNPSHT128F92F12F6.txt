In '43 they Set to sea
13 men and Kennedy
Aboard the PT 109
To fight the Brazen enemy
On the isle of ol lusana
In the strait beyond nehru
A Jap deatroyer in the night
Cut the '109 in two.

CHORUS:
Smokin fire upon the sea
Everywhere they looked was the enemy
The heathen gods of old Japan
Yeah, the thought they had the best of a mighty good man

On the coast, commanderos, lookin through this periscope
Australian niven saw the battle
For the crew had little hope
Two were dead, some were wounded, all were clinging to the bow
Fightin fire, fightin water, trying to save their lives somehow.
