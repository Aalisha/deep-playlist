When you're all alone do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you all the time
How long do you think about me?
Do you think about me? Baby

Baby, baby, do you have a minute or 2 to spare?
'Cause I, I'm not the same when I'm by myself
Your face always seem to appear in my mind
All I wanna know is

When you're all alone do you think about me?
Do you think about me?
'Cause I think about you all the time
How long do you think about me?
Do you think about me? Baby

Do you get my message?
