In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refuse to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in trying
Now my girl you're so young and pretty

And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due
I know

Watch my daddy in bed and tired
Watch his hair been turning gray
He's been working and slaving his life away
Oh yes, I know it

He's been working so hard
I've been working too babe
Every night and day
...
