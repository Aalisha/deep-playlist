We gonna dedicated this one to fellas,
Why'all know how we like it,
Put your mouth to work,

[CHORUS]
Wassup baby? you scared?
Put my hands on the back of your head
And keep it there, don't stop
Lick it up til the very last drop
And go down, (downnnnn)
Don't you want to taste of this georgia peach?
Go down, (downnn)
Don't you want to taste of this georgia peach?

[VERSE 1]
First thangs first, I sheeda
Fuck around with no man who wount eat her
I don't need em, ain't tryin to see em
Yo mommy, daddy, them, ain't tryin to meet em
Halmark cards, ain't tryin to read em
Yea I can cook, but I ain't tryin to feed him
Nothing but this vagina, steven
Ya dick little, need ya tongue to make it even
Slow down, stop speeding
You 20 something, suppose to been stop teethin
