I just feel like talking to someone
I don't care who it is
I just wanna have a laugh
You know how it is, yeah yeah
All of the day in the same old room
Well, I'm going out of my mind
I can't throw this out of the window
It's mine all mine
You better believe it
Hell, you know I mean it
I've been on my own too long
In desperation I learned many things
But mostly it's each to their own

Intimate strangers
Well it's only sex talking on the phone
Love without a face

I just need a pat on the back
Tell me that I'm still alive
Like spider man
I'm climbing the walls
I want my prize, yeah yeah
