So this is dreamtime and all is quiet
So this is dreamtime and all is night
You've never been held by the hand of God
Who's rocking the cradle if he is not

He turned the oil into his blood
Panzer divisions burning in the mud
The stain of freedom, he's washed it out
Who's rocking the cradle, I have no doubt

Sleeping eyes awake, to see his hooded gaze
...
