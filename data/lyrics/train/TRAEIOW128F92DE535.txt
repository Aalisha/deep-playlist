Michelle Williams
The Greatest

Thought I was standing tall
I thought I'd seen it all
But baby I was wrong
Cause you're the greatest
I walked a thousand miles
But nothing's what I found
Until you came around
Cause you're the greatest

Searched high and low for love just
To find out, that it was here all
Along and, I know it, what I wanted it
I should have been chasing you

And I was reaching for the stars
But I didn't have to look so far
Cause love is where you are
But I didn't have a clue
...
