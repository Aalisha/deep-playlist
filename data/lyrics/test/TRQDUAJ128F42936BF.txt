Sort Sol
Flow My Firetear
Carry Me Into The Sun
In the streets I look around
to see the pretty faces of the town
Everywhere I'm so amazed, baby
never seen such grace now baby

I want something and I want it right now
I have to get to someone somehow
Everywhere I'm looking my baby
just to find a little loving my baby
