Into the night on heels I stumble
Like a star about to shoot
Catch me down the avenue like
A dandylion parachute

Release the hounds, chase my tail and
Treat me like renegade
I'm as patient as a chain-reaction
But I am not afraid

We're gonna leave all the troubles behind by the turnpike
Going away, you know what it feels like
I'll never let you go, Joe Dallesandro
