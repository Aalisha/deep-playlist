See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
Its been so long
And Ive been putting out fire
With gasoline
See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
Its been so long
Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
But it wouldnt believe what Ive been thru
Youve been so long
Well its been so long
And Ive been putting out the fire with gasoline
