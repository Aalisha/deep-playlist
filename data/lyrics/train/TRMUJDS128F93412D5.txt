She woke up this morning and she knew
They were through
And she was leavin'
She packed up her love and her memories
Now she sees
Her heart was breakin' even
Now she's headed down that highway
She's never coming back again

She'll go one more time
Down that lonesome road
Till she finds that turn off
That leads back home
Then she'll dust her dreams off
And dry her eyes
...
