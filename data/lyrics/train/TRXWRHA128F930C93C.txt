You can go to the East
To find your, your inner hemisphere
You say we're under the same sky
Babe, you're bound to realize
Honey it's not that clear
I'm not your promised land at all, oh no
I'm not your promised one
I'm not the land of Canaan, oh, sweetheart
Waiting for you under the sun

I'm lonely tonight, I'm missing you now
Wanting your love and you're giving it out
I'm lonely tonight
I'm lonely tonight
I'm lonely tonight (oooh... yeah)

Well, the meaning's changed
For what it's worth, it's just a senseless game, ah
Well I should think of a love
