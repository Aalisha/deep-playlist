You ought to know, it gets so lonely,
I need you, girl.

Star of the show, my one and only
I want you, girl

I want to stay every moment
beside you, what do I've got to do?
I need to know, what you're feeling
Inside you, what do I've got to do?

Darlin', I think about you,
when we are not together
(Anytime we're not together)
Darlin', I think about you,
you're in my heart forever
(And that's where you stay girl)

Darlin', I think about you,
when we are not together
(Anytime we're not together)
Darlin', I think about you,
you're in my heart forever
(And that's where you stay girl)
