I can see it in your eyes

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes, it feels so nice
I can tell, my love is strong
Touch me now, you are the one

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes, it feels so nice
I can tell, I love you over and over
And over and over again

I can see, see it in your eyes
I can feel, yes, it feels so nice
I can tell, my love is strong
Touch me now, you are the one

I can see, see it in your eyes
