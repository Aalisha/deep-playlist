You always think you're right
But when you realize you're wrong
You turn you head and pass above

You're neither here nor there
You're never playing fair
They wonder why
You're always found alone

You're always saying
Things and exaggerating
It's hard to know
Just who you are

You keep on praying
But things just stay the same
You fail to look and see
That everybody's been waiting

When you cry at night
Alone, I don't know why
There's no one left
And I'll be walking on

When you burn in hell
Remember what I said
You had the chance
I've had enough
