I
I'm staring at your picture dad
Pulling up the past
Trying to learn about this father that I never had
So young, so wrong, and ye gone
It's only, me, mom Virginia & God
Were all alone, and are leader is not home
The crossroads took you or these demons below
I'm feeling the cold, you were not here, not there
When I had my first fight I was so scared
When I had my first kiss I could not share
I was lost and the school they did not care
Why'd you leave me, hanging from the ceiling?
Angels stopped singing and mom's not sleeping
I'm not bitter or mad, I'm just missing a dad
Sitting here thinking, praying wishing you back
These feeling are wack, almost too much to bare
I know your souls alive I just want to know where

Are you
Why did you leave me
Where are you
