Baby went to Amsterdam
She put a little money into travelling
Now it's so slow, so slow

Baby went to Amsterdam
4-5 days by the big canal
Now it's so slow, so slow

And I was heading up north to a place that I know
Eating well, sleeping well
But still I was way, way out of line
Amsterdam was stuck in my mind

Oh, it's some kind of stupid rule
That you can't ignore
Oh, it's some kind of natural fact
Sometimes you're just left to be alone
