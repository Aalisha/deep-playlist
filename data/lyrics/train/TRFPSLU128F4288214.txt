lost am I in my memories of my forefathers' legacy
I am one of you you are one of me
why don't we set the people free
how I grieve to see fulfillment of prophecy
naive of me to think things could change
while man remain the same so war will be for me everyday
no peace no peace for the children of Israel
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes
will there be no peace for the children of Palestine

shalom salaam shalom salaam
