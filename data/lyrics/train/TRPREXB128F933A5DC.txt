Where are you Pablo? I've looked everywhere for you
Where are you Pablo? Why don't you answer the phone?
Where are you Pablo? Why don't you open the door?
Did you go to your brother in Stockholm? Did you go to London again?
What's going on Pablo? Tell me what the fuck's going on
Where are you Pablo?

And everything went upside down in a second and I couldn't go back to sleep
And I cannot breathe as long as I got this one hell of a bad disease
And the nightmares came over me again
And my intention was not to hurt you but I guess that's what I did
And all the times I've tried to explain to you what's going on inside my head
And the nightmares came over me again
