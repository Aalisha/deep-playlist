Found my resolve
Found my resolve
To stick to my ground
To stick to my ground
To stand up and shout
To stand up and shout
But I just can't make a sound
But I just can't make a sound


Caught by the man
Caught by the man
You tripped out of line
You tripped out of line
You spoke out of turn
You spoke out of turn
But you could not find the words
But you could not find the words


Like a rat in a trap
Like a rat in a trap
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting for you
Taking punches for kicks
