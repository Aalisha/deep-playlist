You're graceful, your grace falls
down around me in my eyes.
You're lovely, your love leaves
So easily in my eyes.

Another day left waiting
alone in my room with no calls from you.
So I call you up, but you let me down
falling down around everyone EXCEPT yourself.

I thought that this would never end
things were so clear but they fell through.
High hopes of problems never failed
