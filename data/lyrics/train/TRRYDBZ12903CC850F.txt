I always wondered how i'd live without you
if you ever said goodbye
would i just live in dreams about you
with tears in my eyes
would i fall to pieces
when you go
i always wondered how i'd live without you
now i know

i'm doing alright
i'm strong enough to make it on my own
i'm not afraid of the night
i'm learning how to face it alone
i've been good at holding on
now i'm learning to let go
i always wondered how i'd live without you
now i know
