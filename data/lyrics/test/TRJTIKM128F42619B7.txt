[Chorus]
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (I'm not tryin to be no big thing)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice (I can't tell you how to live your life blud)
I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (no role models up in here, what?)
I'm not tryin to give you, no advice

[Verse 1]
Blud I'm not sayin that I'm anything, who am I to give man advice?
It's not that I know best, when trust blud I don't
All I know is if your comin from this manor I'm from
You'll find nuff man'll test ya don't think they won't
Everybody is on their own little hustle just to find a way to try get thru
When your raised in this fuckry
And if your makin some papes on these estates man'll try and get you
So you run and grab your bucky
You count your blessins everyday but still accept you'll have to take your loses
It's money that your makin
Especially if your comin up in the ranks
Against the big crime bosses that are all sittin hatin
The jealous ones'll always envy so you dare say it now who wants it
Let them fuckers spite ya
They're out to get you so you get them first
And look now uve done it cause your arrived in a lifer
Stop

I'm not tryin to be, no big thing (man ain't tryin to be nothing big blud)
