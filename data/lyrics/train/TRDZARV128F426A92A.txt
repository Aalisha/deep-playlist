Drop those flowers - back away slowly
You jumped in thinking this was holy water
Well surprise surprise
This is not a test
Welcome to the party
I've been on my
best behaviour but I think it's time
You saw the other side
CHORUS


I'm a tough tough game that no one can master
I'm a tall tall tale no one believes
I'm a long dark night with no morning after
...
