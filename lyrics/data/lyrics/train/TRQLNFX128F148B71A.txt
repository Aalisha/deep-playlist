(Andy Goldmark/Steven Kipner)

What's going on down on the planet
What's going on inside your pretty head
What's life without a Mercedes
And the need to feel adrenaline rush

Is it better than moonlight on water
Is it better than sex on the beach
Think about us riding wild horses
Think about us it's not out of reach

I'm here for you
No matter where you go no matter what you do
I'm here for you
When there's a lonely night who can you hold on to
I'm here for you
Want you in my arms uncomplicated
I am for you I am
