Welcome to the cruel world
Hope you find your way
Welcome to the cruel world
Hope you find your way
It's a cruel world
Try to enjoy your stay

Yes it is a cruel world
When you're tryin' to get by
It's a cruel world
When you've seen the look in their eye
Makes life hard living
But I'm so scared to die

Welcome to the cruel world
