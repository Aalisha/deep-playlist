I like the way that you lick your teeth
Oh it's a dirty better make your confessional
I like the way that you look at me
I bet your body moves like a professional
I love the way you dress in leather and lace
I love the way you blow the smoke on my face
I like the way that you challenge me
Keepin' me to daze then amaze with your pretty little face!

(Look out!)Ain't you such badass baby
You walk the wire and you play with fire
(Look out!)Yeah you sexy badass baby
The stakes are higher when you play with fire
Ready to fight light up the night! (Badass!)

You got the thighs and you got appeal
And everybody finds it so unconventional
You got the eyes and I can't believe
That anybody could deny the sensational

I love the way you blow the others away
