The truth is inconvenient to our funny little lifestyles
Mother earth on the brink what you think could happen then is now
So I make my pen my pal I make amends with style
I reach a mile a minute through the frequencies of underground lieutenants
I make myself accountable every atom in my make up
So every day that I wake up that I try to raise the stakes up
In the last days we take up space and fumigate with carbon dioxide
Harbor hate then it's off to mobbin'
Saddle back in your black cadillac suv you fly
Butterfly effect, who am I to check throwin' trash at the sky?
I'm a little bug and the can of Raid is pointed in my eyes
Bein' a man means not givin' a fuck to live or die
And till summer spans longer the ocean kisses the horizon line
Day after tomorrows coming true that we can finalize
On a man standing on the deck and know his heart can be sinking fast
Thinkin' if we all just did our part then we could make it black
Turn off the light don't turn up the heat
Recycle that can don't pull up the streets
My cousin rides in his ______ and Mercedes Benz
