Oh oh, Let me be now
Hmm hmm, let me because
I want to be free now
Oh oh, free to see, yeah well
Want to walk away, oh oh
Let me feel my feet
Let me be, free

Time and time and time we see these
Acts against humanity, well,
Each for each and each will be then
Shed blood for what they each believe, well
On and on and on we go well,
Some will you see and, some won't be
True for you and truth will lead you
To a sense of, well now, peace
