You're in my life and I'm so satisfied
Your love and mine, two hearts that are en-twined
So many times I thought
I'd never find what I'm searching for
I wanna say tonight
You were the one to restore my love

Baby tonight, all I want is you and I
You are the one I will love until the end of time
Baby tonight, let me take your hands in mine
For you are the one I will love until the end of time
