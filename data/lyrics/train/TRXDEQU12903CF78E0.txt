Who's the girl inside of the blue-screen light
The sun is just pouring out
And everything is out of sight

Turn around the room is just black and white
She's whispering
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

And it's not true
And it's not fair
And it's not you
And it's not California here

Later on you're breaking the boxes down
There's nobody out tonight
Nobody's hanging 'round
...
