I've got to find a way to trick myself and think everything's OK.
Until then, I will fool you all.
The simple things, I'll never let you see.
Impossible to get away from me.
Way up close, I can see them all.

If a lie could save my sanity,
Every thing I tell myself
Is for the sake of saving me.
Like a child, I must pretend.
'Cause in a world of make-believe,
This bullshit life comes to an end.
