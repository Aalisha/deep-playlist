Open my eyes, give me vision to see You
Take off the blinders and let me know You
For I long to see You as You are
Give me vision to see You

I look for You in the wind
I look for You when the earth is shaking
You speak to me in the whisper
You let me see beyond my world

Open my eyes, give me vision to see You
Take off the blinders and let me know You
For I long to see You as You are
Give me vision to see You

Open my ears and let me hear You
Open my heart and show me You Father
For I long to see You as You are
Give me vision to see You

I look to You in the fire
