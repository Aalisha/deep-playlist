I've got a thing
For the way you never know
But you always steal the show
'Cause you're having so much fun
I've got a thing
For the way you're always late
Never stop to hesitate
'Cause you're always on the run
If I was to show you
I'd need a gun
As far as I see it
I'm already done for
'Cause I've got a thing
For your absent attitude
I think about you in the nude
And how I'd love to have your sons
...
