City nights, summer breezes makes you feel all right
Neon lights, shinin' brightly make your brain ignite
See the girls with the dresses so tight
Give you love, if the price is right
Black or white, In the streets there's no wrong and no right, no

Outta site, buy your kicks from the man in the white
Feels all right, powder pleasure in your nose tonight
See the men paint their faces and cry
...
