Ain't it fun when you're always on the run
Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become
Ain't it fun when you get so high
Well... that you just can't come
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young

It's such fun

Ain't it fun when you taking care of number one
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun
