Forget your hexagram you'll soon feel fine
stop looking at the stars
you don't live under the signs
don't mess with gypsies
or have your fortune read
keep your table on the floor
and don't you listen to the dead

you can't hitchhike your way to heaven
the devil's closed the roads
you live once and you die once with no
re-incarnate episodes
you can't hitchhike to heaven
...
