I know that things are going down for me.
I never really had a chance.
I know that things are going down
the drain the rapid lane.
And I could need a helping hand.

In my mind, all the time,
endless iteration.
In my mind, all the time,
endless irritation,
endless aggravation.
Something is making me so lonely.
And I got to know
got to know
got to know... what it is.
