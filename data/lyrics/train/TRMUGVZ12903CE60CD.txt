Wash it down the drain, down the drain
Wash your smile down
YEAH!
Wash it down the drain
PLEASE!
Like it or not this is what fuel our obsessions (or insurgents?)
I'm always dreaming(?), never stray far from the path.

Everything was taught to me(?)
But what am I supposed to say?
What am I supposed to say?
I'm sorry I guess I forgot
You think you can kill me again?
Guess I don't remember
