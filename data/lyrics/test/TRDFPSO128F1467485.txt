Give it a whirl, give it a try
Why don't you sleep out, start living high?
You're on your own, you make your bed
No time for wasting, just look ahead

Your poppa don't mind what you do or say
You can't surprise him anymore
He's got a reputation that he don't look back
Your poppa don't mind at all

He's getting old, it's getting late
It's soon tomorrow, so celebrate
...
