We're different colors
And different creeds
And different people
Have different needs
It's obvious you hate me
Though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you
What could I have done

La la la la la la, la la la la la la

People are people, so why should it be
You and I shouldn't get along
People are people, so why should it be
You should hate me
People are people, so why should it be
You and I shouldn't get along
People are people, so why should it be
You should hate me
