I dream of the day when we find, we find ourselves
And we are both together, we are both together
Speaking your truth, you have lost me, lost me
In a place that is so tender, it is so tender

Your hand is back where it belongs
On my hip, on my hip
Your voice is sweet and it's singing me a song
Your hand is back where it belongs
On my hip, on my hip
Your voice is sweet and it's singing me a song

Your touch makes me blind, now, I don't want to see
Not now, no, no, not ever, oh no, no, not ever
