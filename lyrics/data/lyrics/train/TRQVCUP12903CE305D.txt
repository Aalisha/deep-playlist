She tucks her Paul Mitchell hair under her John Deere cap
Hides Victoria's Secret under those jeans
She's honest as heaven, she's got a body to match
When they talk about perfect, she's what they mean

She's my kind of woman
She shines like the moment the sun hits the rain
When she smile, yeah it's somethin'
Loves bigger than life
Shes my kind of woman

She's a slice of the country, she's Fifth Avenue
She loves Jesus and sinners like me
