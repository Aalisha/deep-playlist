Courting is a pleasure
Between my love and I;
And it's down in yon green valley
I'll meet her by and by.

It was down in yon green valley
She is my heart's delight:
"Molly, lovely Molly,
I will stay till broad daylight."

Going to church last Sunday,
My true love she passed me by.
I knew her mind was altered
By the roving of her eye.

Well I knew her mind was altered
...
