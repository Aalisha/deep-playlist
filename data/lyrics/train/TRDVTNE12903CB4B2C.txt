I only meant to love you
Didn't you know it babe
Didn't you know it
Why couldn't you be content
With the love i gave oh yeah
I gave you my heart
But you wanted my mind, oh yeah
Your love scared me to death, girl
Oh it's the chokin kind
That's all it is

You can kill a man
With a bottle of poison or a knife
