You never get tired of telling me
How I don't understand you
And the problem is
You know I think I do
I was just tryin' to name that face
So familiar, yet so out of place
Was it once with you
Oh god it's like I said
Still give up damn, if you think I can be what you want
It's Just a little late to stop

Chorus
Now I know what you look for
It's too late for me
And I know what you look for
And he doesn't look a thing like me
I guess what I'm good for
Is laughing at,
Stop laughing at me

The last three minutes of an era
Are passing by without a sound
