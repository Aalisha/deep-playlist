Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing

I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing, I wouldn't be
I wouldn't be nothing at all
I wouldn't be nothing

I might forget what city I'm in
Might have a mistress and a girlfriend
Girlfriend would find out and let me go
Then I'd be lost and end up alone

I'm just a wayward son of a preacher
You are a queen that's how I should treat you
Lessons in love, you are my teacher
My teacher you are

And I do it for love and I do it for good
'Cause you gave me your heart like I knew that you would
And you bring out the best and I hope that you know
So I gotta confess, listen

Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
Without you I'd be nothing
...
