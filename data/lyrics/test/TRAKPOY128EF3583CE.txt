You're a nobody 'til somebody loves you
You're nobody 'til somebody cares
You may be king, you may
Possess the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness
When you're growin' old

The world still is the same, you'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
Find yourself somebody to love

You're a nobody 'til somebody loves you
