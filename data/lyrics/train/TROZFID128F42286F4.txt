You know that you can't hide yourself,
Behind the mask that you've made.
You phoney I've found out so go.
And tell someone who really cares.
You betrayed our friendship.
The life long bond was split at the seems
We were one in the same.
Now watch my smile turn into a stare.
You betrayed yourself, you betrayed us all.
There'snothing left, ruins are all that's left after the fall.
