(Verse I)
After the hoping and the praying and the wishing,
Girl your right here in my face.
I never been the one to bite my tongue, no, no...
I have not one word to say.
I'm mesmerized by your sexy eyes and,
Your soft and lovely skin.
I want this fiasco to end,
So baby we can start all over again.

(Listen)
(I wanna be able...) I wanna be able to love you, oh I...
(I wanna be able...) And let me be the one to please you, oh I...
As sure as the sun shines all over the earth,
You're one of god's most precious works.
See, I'm a man and we make mistakes,
but please don't take your love away, oh I...

(Chorus)
Don't take your love away. (Don't take...)
Baby, don't take your love away from me, I need you, girl. (I need you girl.)
Don't take your love away. (Oh.)
Don't take your love away
Don't take your love away (Don't take...)
