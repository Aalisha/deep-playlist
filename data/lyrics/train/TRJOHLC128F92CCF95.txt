Baby, I'm so glad you're here
Baby, I've got something to say, my dear
Baby, yeah, I'm just so glad you're mine

Whoa ho, baby, why did it take so long?
Whoa baby, only made my love grow strong
Baby, yeah, yeah, I'm so glad you're mine

Hey, hey, hey, hey
When darkness gather 'round me
And friends forsaken me
I know you'll never let me down
I know you'll never let me down
