Verbal defender, the brain infiltrator
Break and fracture a sucka emcee's "structal" delegator
The pen and the pad and the microphone get blessed

Brothers are getting busy grabbing Teks while I apex
Verbal backshots coming without the latex
Watch the caption spin as the wax begin
How I'm rapping in to hit the backspin
