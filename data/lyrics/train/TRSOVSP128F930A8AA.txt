A destiny's child
Aeons away from the sun
Island of life
Out of the dust she has come

Be aware of the dream we live in
Realize that the chance is given
My life, my love
In the hand of destiny

Mother Earth, voice of universe
Mother Earth, oasis of life
Mother Earth, the flame of universe
Mother Earth, your tears of pain rain down on the world
