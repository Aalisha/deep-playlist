Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesars Palace, morning glory, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer change to winter, yours is no disgrace

Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
Lost in summer, morning winter, travel very far
Lost in musing circumstances, that's just where you are
