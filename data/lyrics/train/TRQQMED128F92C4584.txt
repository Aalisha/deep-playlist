Paper bags and plastic hearts
Our belongings in shopping carts
It's goodbye but we got one more night
Let's get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Throw it away, forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
We won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn, let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side
