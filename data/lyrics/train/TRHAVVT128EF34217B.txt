Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I was listening to a radiostation last night
A shrink, Dr. Luis, was giving counsel on the line

I dialed 305 594 1185
(three o' five, five ninety-four eleven eighty-five)
Hey doc, I'm calling about a latin girl I met on a web site

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
y tiene la llave de mi coraz√≥n

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

I'm from Louisiana, she's from San Pedro de Macoris,
you know the land of baseball players,
where Sammy Sosa lives

She likes to drink papaya juice and paint caribbean trees
Oh, we don't have too much in common
but love is blind as you can see

She tastes to me like a honeycomb
sweet to my heart, medicine for my soul

Girl I want to feel your heart
and hope you love me too

You know I can't stop loving you, babe
I said mambo

Love me, yeah
Love me, yeah
