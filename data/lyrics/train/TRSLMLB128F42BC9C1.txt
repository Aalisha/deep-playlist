You know sometimes you get in situations
And when you make that move
You gotta be committed
She know what I mean

We were better off friends
But the magic of the night had us holding each other tight
We should've kept it right there
But the movie got boring and you wore those jeans I like

I glanced at your pretty feet
Your sexy hands rubbing on my chest
Should I kiss you? I heard a voice say yes
Next, we were undressing not realizing
We shouldn't be doing this, no

What are we doing
What have we done, what have we ruined?
How did this happen
Were we just blacked out, what are we doing?

What are we doing
What have we done? Baby, I'm tripping
'Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone
Girl, what did we do?

They say some things are better off as just a fantasy
What came over me?
I did not lose control, it must've been those jeans
It was the way she fit in those jeans

I can't even remember if it was good or not
