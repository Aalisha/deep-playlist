While you were fucking off
I went and found something new
Packed up all my shit
Stole back all my tapes
Left your spare key under the mat
This is not a joke
You'd better learn to take a hint
Cause I'm not coming back
Maybe you'll understand when you're waking up alone
In a cold and empty bed

If you're reading this, I'm gone
Happy birthday
