This air of silence,
Breathes through the sullen mist.
Transparent winds,
Ease these age-old wounds.

As stale thoughts disappear,
Through Morpheus pathways.
I am in wake but dreaming.

This warmth annuls,
As time drew slowly upon this wretch of life.

Weary sighs of condolence never did urge with zest,
The fire within hands made to rest.
