Running with my rain face on
Today I woke up feeling sad
I know that you said
That one day I would be glad

Hold the choirs of winter
Birds are calling to me and
All the leaves I came to love are falling

Ribbons on evergreen
Owls that pull them apart
I can hear you singing 'My funny valentine'
Oh you know that breaks my heart
