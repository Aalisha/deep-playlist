I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside (go outside) in the rain

Now I, I think I'm gonna cry
And I, I don't want you to see me cry

I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside in the rain

Once the rain starts fallin'
On my face (on my face)
You won't see (you won't see, ah)
A single trace (a single trace)
