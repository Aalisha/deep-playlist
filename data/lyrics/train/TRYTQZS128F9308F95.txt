Verse 1:
In a world full of bottled up pain, hurt and sorrow
Six people out of ten won't want to wake up tomorrow
When thirty thousand children won't live through tomorrow
Malnutritioned and starved, stomachs empty and hollow
While the rest of us take every meal, breath and step for granted
Forgettin' life was a gift in us a seed was planted
We've lost ourselves to this world, with it became enchanted
Our hearts were fertile soil but now they're rock harder than granite
On this populated planet one man will kill another man
To prove what he calls manhood but really it's insanity
Can it be that all this pain, hurt and calamity
Is the derivative of sin committed by Adam and Eve
It gets worse, year after year statistics prove
That over 900, 000 kids suffer abuse
And that's just in America, land of the free
Home of the brave where 34 percent of children can say
They have to face life without their biological father
