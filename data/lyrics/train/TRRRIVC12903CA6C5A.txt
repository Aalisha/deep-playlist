Even now
When there's someone else who cares
When there's someone home who's waiting just for me
Even now
I think about you as I'm climbin' up the stairs and I wonder what to do so she won't see...
That even now...
When I know it wasn't right and I found a better life than what we had
Even now
I wake up cryin' in the middle of the night and I can't believe it still could hurt so bad...
Even now
When I have come so far I wonder where you are
...
