Night has drawn the curtain
Covered up their eyes
The angels will not hear you
Your spirit starts to rise
There's music from the bar
Drunken laughter down the hall
Is it pain or is it pleasure
You are hearing through the wall?

"Cruising for a bruising"
Tattooed above the heart
It'd take the strength of Mary
To hold the boys apart
They flicker in their footsteps
A voltage overload
Dazzling the dancers like they're
Fixing to explode
You find 'em later lying in be road

Granite years
Harbour lights, city nights and bitter tears
Say that I was foolish
...
