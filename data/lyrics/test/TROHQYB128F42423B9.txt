Despite all that they say about our selfish state
We still believe only in ourselves
Staring at the sky
From the ocean floor
The thoughts built in my mind
Keep me from feeling small

Just like water flows to the ocean

And I never thought I would fall,
I am the master of unconscious thoughts,
dreams are what I live for.
