My good friend tells me to be wise,
I say why bother, you know.
I cannot find what's wrong or right.
To me they're all in disguise.
And their disguises look so good,
I cannot find what's true or false.
That makes no difference to my friend,
He will stand by me, and this he tells me:

This life is just for living, I can't tell you what it'll bring.
There are good times, there are hard times
There are reasons why we cling to what we want to be
What we want to see
...
