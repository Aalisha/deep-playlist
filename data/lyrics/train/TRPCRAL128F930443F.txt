I'm looking for a Miracle Man
That tells me no lies,
I'm looking for a Miracle Man
Who's not in disguise

I don't know where he'll come from
And I don't know where he's been,
But it's not our jimmy sinner
Because he's so obscene

Miracle Man got busted,
Miracle Man got busted

Today I saw a Miracle Man,
On TV cryin'
...
