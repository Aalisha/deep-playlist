Security, y'all might as well
Throw me out a this bitch right now
Get ignit, get ignit

Look, my garage is not a mirage
I got a car collage for my entourage
We like Dolomite when we stop at the light
'Cause the rims keep spinnin' and the bitches keep grinnin'
And these niggas keep winnin', so they must be sinnin'
'Cause all they do is party with a whole lot a women now

My grand-mamma even call me a dummy
An ignit little bastard, how I'm spendin' my money, I tell her
That's why your not as fly as your grandson
Handsome with a pocket full of ransom
It ain't trickin' if you got, pull it out'cha pocket
Baby drop it like a hydraulic, shake it like your super-sonic
Make me psychotic when that booty look bionic
So if you see the crowd movin'
Nigga don't get scared, it's just us payers, come on

Just like you figured, I'm with my niggas
And we all wit it, get ignit
To all the booty shakers, to all the money makers
Fuck the undertakers, get ignit
Shake it all about, turn the party out
Pour Bacardi out, get ignit
If you full grown, and you tryin' to bone
Fuck goin' home, get ignit

I keeps it way mean for the green, more muscle than a hawk
And whether it's soft or hard, I sells it all in bulk
And it ain't no secret, we puts it all down in front of you
