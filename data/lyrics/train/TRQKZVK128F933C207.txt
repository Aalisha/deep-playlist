There was a time when I would lie and say I needed you
'Cause I didn't have nowhere else to go
Yeah, you go your way, I'll go mine
We'll get together, have ourselves a good time
There ain't no use, tryin' to squeeze blood from a stone

Oh, I will go on without you
This ain't the first time I've been high and dry
If I should hold on I'll try to
I'm gonna have to fight but I will get by
