Envision a city in transition,
revere the recognition of everything your life's been missing.
Listen, our spacious proposition,
the perfect place to live in, with polished chrome and open kitchen.
Join me to dwell in the genuine smell of the shops and the clubs at the cities heart.
Copies of Vice and a latte on ice oh the bagels are nice they just fall apart.
a multi-story for the car, they do magners on ice at the bar,
there's a guy in the shop with a Fred Perry top and a purple electric guitar.
