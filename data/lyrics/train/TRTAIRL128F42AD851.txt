Yo sit back, relax
Get your car jacked

(Verse 1:)
I was at the mall
Getting fresh for the weekend
When I caught a glance of some heavy tweekin
Seen her straight from the back
Couldn't wait for this girl to turn around
Eyes was brown
Had the skin perfect match that
She round in the back you know I likes that
Tryin to floss like a movie
Anything so she don't lose me

(Chorus:)
See I
Feelin so high since I met you
Been on cloud nine since I met you
Lovin my life since I met you
I'm so high don't wanna come down
I'm high, high, high...
So high...
I don't wanna come down
...
