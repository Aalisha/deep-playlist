Robo who, Robo gone, Robo what, Robo one
Robo where, Robo never, Robo why, Robo clever
Robo hi, Robo ho in the sky, Robo no

Robo who, Robo gone, Robo what, Robo one
Robo where, Robo never, Robo why, Robo clever
Robo hi, Robo ho in the sky, Robo no

Waiting for the Robo
I'm a universal hobo
I'm a skinny little creature
Will he turn into a feature
Only visiting the planet
That I'm pushing to a circle
Only Robo makes me rub it all (?)
The walls where it begun (?)
