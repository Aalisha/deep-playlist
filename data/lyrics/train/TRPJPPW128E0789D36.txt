You're in control
Is there anywhere you want to go?
You're in control
Is there anything you want to know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're traveling

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
