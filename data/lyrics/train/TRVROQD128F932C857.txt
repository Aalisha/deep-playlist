*Note at end

Yes, yas

Got to bottle it up an go
Got to bottle it up an go
Now, 'em high-power women

Ninety year
She ain't too old
For the shift them gears

'Got to do what, tell me 'gain?'
'Got to bottle it up and go'
Now, them high power women
Yeah!

Now, I told my girl
Week 'fore last
The gate she jus' came in
Just a little too fast

She had to bottle it up an go'd
An them high-power women

Now, the nigger and the white man
Playin', set 'em up
Nigger beat the white man
