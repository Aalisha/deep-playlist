There is no reason to be far apart
We should be two sides of one beating heart
So don't be scared to let me love you
We're standing on the edge of something else
Just count to ten and let go of yourself
Somehow we'll get by, we're sky high
So baby won't you...

Jump
Take that leap of faith
Take that leap with me
We can make it if you just believe
Girl you'll never feel more alive than
When you and I are skydiving

We know that life was never meant to last
So who cares if we're going way too fast
Let's make the best of what life brings us
