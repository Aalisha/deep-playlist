Five o'clock screams a broken warning
The comforts of carrion have come to rest
And faced with faces that don't remember
Old ghosts that come to collect their debts
Back behind the worst recollections
And swollen eyes rise to face the day
At the worst it will never matter
At the best it will never stay

Five o'clock
Five o'clock
Five o'clock
Five o'clock
