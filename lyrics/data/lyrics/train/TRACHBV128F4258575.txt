For seven long years
She helped me spend my dough
Now I take her out
But she don't wanna know
That woman's got me drinking
Look at the state I'm in
Give me one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten bottles of gin

That woman's got me drinking
We used to have some fun
Now shrinks and astrologers
Have got me on the run
