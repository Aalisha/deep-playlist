My angel, clipped wings I know
Wonders in darkness on grimy ground
In a forest unclean, unsound
Everything, everything's gone wild

Make land for the cows to graze
Leaflets scattered around
To advertise, sell out

A swamp in it, hands stretched out
To catch a passing dime
Donations to the rich widened
...
