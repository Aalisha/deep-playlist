And I don't care about that new angle you used. 
It's not that clever or new, 
but relying on suspicions not suspicious at all if its true. 
And I don't care about that last message I sent. 
Now keep it for evidence. 
Now baby what is it to you?

Detective, detective 
well I hope you found what you're looking for. 
I'm kind of confused what the benefit 
of your doubt is worth to me anymore.

And did you ever think I was leaving this trail 
for you to follow at my will? 
Well my guess is if you knew you would be moving much slower.
