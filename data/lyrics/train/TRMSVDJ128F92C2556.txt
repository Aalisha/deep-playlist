A sad refrain as tears depart
a word remains that I can start
To map the borders of my heart
and change the channels that I chart

I’m not complete but feel the heat
as pavement seals me to the street
Immobilized I realized
misjudged the situation’s size

Though seasons change and seeds may start
the beauty of a broken heart
...
