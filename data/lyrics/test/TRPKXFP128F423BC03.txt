If I had a perfect day
I would have it start this way
Open up the fridge
And have a tall boy, yeah
Then I'd meet up with my friends
Head out to the game again
We don't even really care who wins
Hey, wins, hey, one, two, three
Now, excitement seems to grow
When we're hangin' with the bro's
When we're chillin'
And we pound a case of Stroh's
Now the game is cool to see
You can 'High 5' on TV
Count the riot on the one, two, three
Operation is in sight
And the field is open wide
When you break it
Then you know you're still alive
If the cops don't make you pay
And you make your getaway
Then you know that it's a one fine day
