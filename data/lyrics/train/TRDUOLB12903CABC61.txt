Uououo uououo
oooh ooh uooh

To everyone in the world, who's left out on their own
To all the boys and girls with disconnected souls
See the dream awakening before your very eyes

We've got to run not hide, from the former lives
We gotta take it, make it, never gonna fake it
This time we're breaking free, and making history


They say the dreams that we're chasing are just a dead-end road
