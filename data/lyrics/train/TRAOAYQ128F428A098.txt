Come next Monday, I'm goin' to bed early
I won't talk dirty for a week or two
Goin' on a diet, just like sugar, honey
Come next Monday, I'm gonna give up on you
(Givin' it up, givin' it up)

X-rays show some excess baggage
Too much work for a little, hard to do
Self denial is never easy baggage
But come next Monday, I'm gonna give up on you

Ain't gonna call you
After a day or two
Ain't gonna miss you, honey
An even if I do

I'll never tell you
You'll never ever know
How hard it is
To let you go

Come next Monday, I hope I'm a little bit stronger
Some of the Mondays that I've been through
...
