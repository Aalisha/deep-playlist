Was I the subject of your blackest dreams?
A slave to your desire?
Just the victim of your darkest schemes?
Fuel my sacrificial pyre.

Your facade has crumbled, you look different now
Hindsight is a cruel and wicked gift
Your mask has slipped, that your expression one so proud
Now this creature in my midst

My fantasies that first shocked but then delighted me
Your first against the wall
No sympathy, free of guilt and culpability
upon my sword I had to fall

Now the flash and thunder magnifies my pain
Clearly this world loves you
Paramount are the people who forward your self gain
...
