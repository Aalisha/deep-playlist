I'm a stranger, just blowed in your town
So I want my train fare home, so I have no worries on my babe
I'm a stranger here, just blowed in your town
Oh yes, I am, I'm a stranger here, just blowed in your town

Well, I wonder why some people treat the strangers so
Oh yes, I do, I wonder why some people treat the strangers so
Well, he may be your best friend that you will never know
