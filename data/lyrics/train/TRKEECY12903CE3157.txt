I drove half way to town last night
And I turned around
In a field of fireflies makin' such a lonely sound
As my headlights flashed on a mailbox by the road
I realized that I was livin' in a new zip code

CHORUS
Well I'm livin' in Lonesome USA
Population one since yesterday
Livin' and dyin' in the hell I made
Since you been gone
Right now my mind's in another state
Ain't enough heart here left to break
I'm livin' in Lonesome, Lonesome USA
