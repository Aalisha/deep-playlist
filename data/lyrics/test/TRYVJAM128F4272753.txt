Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Show me love

I feel the heat of mystic
You and I can be in a magical treat
So this is really true looking to my brown eyes
I wanna be your sexy spice

I walk alone empty streets
Everywhere I search I can find you and me
So baby just give me one more sign from your heart
And I'll be your fantasy

Round and round never put me down
So many secrets for us to be found
Long I am travel someway
Forget about yesterday

Come on and show me love
I just can't get enough
I wanna be with you
No matter what you do
I can't forget your eyes
Your endless supersmile
