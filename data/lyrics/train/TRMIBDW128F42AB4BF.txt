Cos I've been sitting back, no chance of rolling, hoping that nothing ever blows (no no)
Boy, did you ever think that loving would be nothing more than walking me home? (no no)
Cos I've been sitting back, no chance of rolling, hoping that nothing ever blows (yeah yeah)
Boy, did you ever think that loving would be nothing more than walking me home? (no no)

Did you tell him? No, no, no
Give him kisses? No, no, no
Whisper honey? No, no, no
You're delicious? Hell no!
Were you dancing? No, no, no
Sweet as toffee? No, no, no
Get his number? No, no, no
Get him out for coffee? Hell yeah!

Did you tell him? No, no, no
Give him kisses? No, no, no
Whisper honey? No, no, no
You're delicious? Hell no!
Were you dancing? No, no, no
Sweet as toffee? No, no, no
Get his number? No, no, no
