(Come on and see me, baby)
(Come on and see me, baby)
(Come on and see me, baby)

If you need a lover truer than any other
Come on and see me
If you need a heart that will never tear apart
Come on and see me
'Cause I've got a true love just for you, love
And it can be yours eternally
If you want it, you better come and get it
