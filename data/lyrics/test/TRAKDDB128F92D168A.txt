Someone's just outside, knockin's at my door,
A stranger, somebody unknown.
Someone's in my dreams Can't get off my mind, I'm tired of being alone.
Someone's trying to find an easy way inside,
Come on, I'm right here at home, right at home.

Is it you? (4x)

Who's that deep inside me, sneakin' 'round my heart?
Are you somebody in love?
