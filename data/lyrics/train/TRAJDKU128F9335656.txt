Little by little you show to me
One more side of your personality
I always knew that somewhere in your heart
You're hoping we were torn apart
But of late I've been hearing something new
And baby try as I may, my mind won't accept
What is true

It's all in you. Only you could do the
Things you do.
It's all in you to break my heart in two.
It's all in you, baby, it's all in you.

Over and over within my mind
The reasons for my troubles I try to find
I've always dreamed of loving a girl like you
Someone to give my loving to.
But ever since you been loving someone new
There's been no smile on my face
