Awa awa (sort of)?

What it? s about a code oh?

A mum number? s soul let the my guy duel
Said the eye guy
In your mile the corals and I tumble down no more
Ah away
Sending my bed to no lumpy
Ya za tah

Oh, oh oh oh

Now my money may not go dear yeah
Ever call a belly salamander brute eater

Sending my bed to no lumpy
And the coil may sink deep

Oh, oh oh oh

Oh, mommy number wheezy

Oh, mommy now you? re gone home
Awa awa
