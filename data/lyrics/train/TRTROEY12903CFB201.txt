Why do we loan ourselves to the things by which
We will never be repaid
And feel consoled by tomorrow
When today has been profaned

Confused by choices or blind to cause-and-effect
And a future gravestone

Today's a draft of your epitaph
Keep changing it 'til you meet the grave
Update your draft of your epitaph
Till you crash and break like a wave

I'll hope to file away my account today
And see it in some value
And appreciate all that I've had
Before I quit this venue
