Up from the thirty six chambers
It's the ghost
Killah
Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang killa beez, we on a swarm
Wu-Tang killa beez, we on a swarm
Wu-Tang killa beez, we on a swarm
Wu-Tang killa beez, we on a swarm

The Rza, the Gza, Ol Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck, U God
Ghostface Killah, The Method Man, Raekwon the Chef, The Masta killa
Raw Desire, Levon, Power Cipher
Twelve o'clock, Sixtysecond Assassin, The Fourth Disciple
The Brand White, K.D. the Down Low Wrecka
Shyheim AKA the Rugged Child
Due Due Lilz, Mista Hezakiah better known as the Yin and the Yang
The True Master, Ason, DJ Skane, the True Robocop comin' through
Scientific Shabazz, my motherfuckin' man Wise the Civilized
The Shaolin soldiers, Daddy O and Poppa Ron
Comin' down from the motherfuckin' South end of things
Killa beez all over your fuckin' planet
Thirty six chambers of death
Three hundred and sixty degrees of perfected styles
Choppin' off your motherfuckin' dome
Peace and every fuckin' borough
Crooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island
The motherfuckin' Bronx, killa beez
The sword, c'mon, give him the sword

Clan in da front, let your feet stomp
Niggaz on the left, brag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, c'mon and attract to

The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
