I like it, I like it
I like the way you run your fingers through my hair
and I love the way you tickle my chin
and I like the way you let me come in when your mommy's not there

I like it, I like it
I like the things you say and all the things you do
and I like the way you straighten my tie
and I like the way you're winking your eye
and I know I like you
and I know I like you
