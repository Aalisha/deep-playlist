Our house, in the dull gray suburbs
Where the buildings are comin' down
We live in the Polish Catholic Irish part of the town
I'll be waiting for you, you'll be makin' a scene
I'll be happy to find you at the end of the night
Help you find your way out, then we'll get you clean
I'll be happy to find you at the end of the night
Find you at the end of the night

He likes Old Style, the cervesa fria
At the tavern down by the park
He'll be OK, but unless you're local
