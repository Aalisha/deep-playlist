Maybe youve taken on a different name
Tired of playing everybody else´s game
Maybe you´re living in a jealous town
Oh so tired of rumours going round
What we do, under the influence of love

Maybe you´ll try out a new set of clothes
Begin to like the things that you hated the most
There ain´t no rule, there ain´t no circumstance, 
To save you baby now, when you´re in a trance
What we do, under the influence of love

Hush now baby, don´t cry
To make it right, we have to see both sides
And the day is never done...
