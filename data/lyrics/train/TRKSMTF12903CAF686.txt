Oh my God, I'm such a terrible mess
I'm turned on by the tabloids
You would never have guessed

That I'm a sucker for their gossip
Man, I take it too far
I bottle up my Hollywood

And watch 'em name their kids after cars
I'm finding me out

I'm having my doubts
I'm losing the best of me
We're all part of the same
Sick Little Games

And I need to get away, get away
I'm wasting my days
I throw them away
Losing it all on these Sick Little Games
I fell in love
