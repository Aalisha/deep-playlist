Met an old friend last night, had a cup of coffee
We talked about all the things that had been going on
We talked about the old days, we talked about the new days
We talked just about anything but what was really going on

The tension in the air I could cut it with a knife
Staring out the window and gazing at the menu
Suddenly he called my name and he looked me in the eye

He said, "I don't know where I'm going and I don't know where I've been.
And there's one long road that I traveled just to see you again.
I said I don't know where I'm going, I don't know where I've been.
