Things the land forgot
The way the summer starts and stops
No better
Streets are melting off
Does the burning throng satisfy the sun
Like pleasure

Cause you’re stone
That’s what you are
Cause you’re stone
Stone, that’s what you are
Stone, stone, that’s what you are
You are you are you are
Cause youre stone
