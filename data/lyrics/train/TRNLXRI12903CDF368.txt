Stare at my reflection,
a face to me shown unknown.
Cleanse with perfection,
no man shall stop the seeds I've sown.

You see me crawl, but that's not true.
I'm just a step away from you.

I feel my energy rising.
Shatter me who shatter dares...

Don't trust your eyesight,
it will deceive your every glance at me.
I feel no sorrow, kill...
like there's no tomorrow.

You see me crawl, but that's not true.
