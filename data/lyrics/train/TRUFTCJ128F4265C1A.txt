In this world there's much confusion
And I've taste the city life and it's not for me
Now I do dream of distant places
Where I don't know now but it's destiny

If it's the rich life I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things

I want destiny
(Destiny)
It's the place for me
Yeah, yeah

Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be me
C'mon let me feel free

Now I'm a man that's for all seasons
And what the city offers me ain't naturally
...
