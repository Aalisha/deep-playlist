The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love, a new purchase
A market of the senses

Dream of the perfect life

Sell out, maintain the interest

Remember Lot's wife
Renounce all sin and vice
Dream of the perfect life
This heaven gives me migraine

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
