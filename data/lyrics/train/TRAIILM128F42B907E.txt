Sun didn't rise this morning
Not a sign come noon
Heard the noise of a thousand voices
But no one else was in my room
Reached for my holy bible
But it seems as though i've lost my ways
Don't want no superstition to carry me down
Got the devil grinning in my face

Make me a pallet on your floor
Mama tell me what to do
Won't serve it to me right
