Haven't you heard?
I'm stuck on a face
I'm stuck on a boy who feels me with joy
I knew I was wrong to
Jump straight on into the picture so pretty
But he is so pretty to me

And he doesn't know just how far I would go
Just to kiss him
He doesn't doesn't know I pine

So I make whirlpools
And watch him sparkle
...
