Oh wild one I'm-a gonna tame you down (tame you down)
Ah, wild one I'll get you yet (yeah yeah) you bet (yeah yeah)
You little doll all you do is play, you've got a new baby ev'ry day
But some day it's gonna be me, me and only me.

Oh oh oh oh wild one I'll make you settle down (settle down)
Ah wild one I'll clippa your wings (yeah yeah) and them things (yeah yeah)
You got the lips that I'm mad about
I got the lips that'll knock you out
C'mon wild one be wild about me.
