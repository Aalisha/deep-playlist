In the evening, I lie awake alone
And watch my thoughts go by
I hear the beating of a heavy heart
No words of wisdom can inspire
Out the window, nothing much changes
A street full of strangers and you're not there

You're waiting in my dreams, oh-oh
When I close my eyes you're all I see
Waiting in my dreams, oh-oh
The only time you're next to me
Waiting in my dreams, oh-oh
You're waiting in my dreams

In the morning, a woman cries
And through her tears, she speaks to me
I feel the turning of a rusty key
Unlock a world where we are free
