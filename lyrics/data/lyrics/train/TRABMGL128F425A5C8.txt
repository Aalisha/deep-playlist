I'm looking for peace
I'm hoping to find
Something to slow down
The hands of time
It's all slipping away... slipping away
Moving so fast
It's out of my reach
And out of my grasp
I'm searching for Truth
I know it must be
Somewhere just around the corner from me
I've been feeling a need... feeling a need
For something inside
A need for a change 
A change in my life

And it's You
...Only You and You alone
Jesus
You found me so deep in the dark
And You called out my name
Yes, You
...
