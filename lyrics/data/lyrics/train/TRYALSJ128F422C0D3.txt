They'll be hiding in the shadows
They'll be hiding in the dark of the night
They'll be hiding 'til tomorrow
They'll be hiding 'til the timing is right

It's an answer for the future
It's a question that we left in the past
It's a message for the masses
It's a problem but it ain't gonna last

Ooh, you will give to me
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow, today
