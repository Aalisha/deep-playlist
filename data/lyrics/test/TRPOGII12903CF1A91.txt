Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Break the evil, break the evil

In the sweat of my bed
I woke up in the darkening sun
To see the moon to see the dark
And I leave my home with a smile

When the sun turns into the night
I look up to the sky and see the sign

As I walked along my street
I checked out the echo of my feet
A voice like a shadow of reflections
I'm wondering about my reactions

I just needed someone to talk to
And that can only be you
Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say

Time to run for the fight
Because they run for their right
Its evil has yet to be told
Before our souls get cold
