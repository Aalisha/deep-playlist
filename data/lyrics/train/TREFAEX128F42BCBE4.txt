Hey, ya know, Rob.
The word, Mike, what's up? Man
I got something to tell you.
Oh, tell me my brother.
While you were gone, your woman.
My woman what?
Your woman steppin' out on you.
I gotta talk with this girl, right now.

Girl, rumor has it that you're leaving.
Girl, tell me that it isn't so.
Woh.
Never been one to show my feelings.
