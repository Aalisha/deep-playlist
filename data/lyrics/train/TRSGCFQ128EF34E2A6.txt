(Chorus:)

I'm feeling really unappreciated.
You takin' my love for granted, babe.
I don't know how much more,
I can take from you.
You don't do the things you use to do.
You don't even say I love you too.
and lately I've been feeling,
Feeling unappreciated.

(Verse 1:)

Woke up this morning and saw your face
And you didn't look the same as yesterday.
I got the feeling that you can't seem to see,
What you want to be.
And lately it ain't been the same at all.
When you're here its like I'm invisable
I still can't seem to see where I went wrong.
Cuz I'm feeling

(Chorus:)

I'm feeling really unappreciated.
You takin' my love for granted, babe.
I don't know how much more,
I can take from you.
