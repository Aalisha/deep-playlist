"You know you've done enough when every bone is sore
You know you've prayed enough when you don't ask anymore
You know you're coming to some kind of understanding
When every dream you've dreamed has passed and you're still standing
Mama says God tends to every little skinny sheep
So count your ribs and say your prayers and get to sleep
Nothing is louder to god's ears than a poor man's sorrow
Daddy is poor today, and he will be poor tomorrow

Hey, that's the poor man's house
Everybody get a look at the poor man's house
Everywhere they went before must have turned them out
And now they're living in a poor man's house
