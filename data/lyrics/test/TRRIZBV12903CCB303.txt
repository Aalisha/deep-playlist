We're startin' up now we're on our way
Leaving all our yesterdays behind
Something special that we wanna say
Happiness is just a state of mind

Flashback
To the days when the nights were young
Flashback
When we could do no wrong

Flashback
We used to dance to the light of dawn
Flashback
When our hearts were so strong
Yeah

Flashback
To the days when the nights were young
Flashback
(Ah, ah, ah)
When we could do no wrong

Flashback
We used to dance to the light of dawn
Flashback
(Ah, ah, ah)
To when our hearts were so strong

Living in the shadow of our yesterday
Memories of children in the sun
Everybody's looking back but that don't pay
Can't you see you've only just begun

Flashback
