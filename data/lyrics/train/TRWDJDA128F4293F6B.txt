Meow, meow, meow-meow, meow-meow

Meow, meow
Meow, meow

Little bag of bones been out all night
Little bag of bones been out all night
Can you hear him scratchin' at the screen door?
Can you hear him scratchin' at the screen door?
Little bag of bones been out all night

He needs some pettin' and lovin' on his head
He needs some pettin' and lovin' on his rain-soaked hide
He's circlin' around my ankle
He's circlin' around my ankle
He needs some pettin' and lovin' on his hide
Kitty, won't you come inside?

Kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
A kitty at my foot and I wanna touch it
