Bein' with you, we ooh
Has made me sure
That I can get through any door
And over any obstacle
(Over any obstacle)

Bein' with you, we ooh
Has been so rewarding
You give me good loving every night
And first thing in the morning
(First thing in the morning)

You're my passport to pleasure
(Pleasure)
You're worth more than the rarest of treasurer
(Treasure)
You're my ticket to the land of dreams
My highness of kindness, my every thing

Bein' with you, we ooh
Has taught me a lesson
I can get a lot of things myself
Getting you was a blessing and I

(Sure do love you, baby)
Sure do love you, baby
(Sure do love you, girl)
Sure do love you. baby
You make my world

You're my passport to pleasure
...
