Like a child who dreams of flying
And aches for something more
We hold the dim remembrance
Of an ancient golden shore
Ah, but now our faith is frozen
We lost it by default
I tell you if we linger
We will all be turned to salt

CHORUS:

Come where the Big Wind blows
Out on the wild frontier
Follow where it goes
Out on the wild frontier
...
