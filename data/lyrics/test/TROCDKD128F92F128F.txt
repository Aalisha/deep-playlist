when your heart is flying away to my heart
i will catch with all my love
like a ship that sailing on the sea
is it you where i rest all my heart??

i'm sitting on the parkbench of downtown
i'm laughing remember all that you've done
there's a bird is singing on the tree
and you are running around in my head

it is long time since i first met you
