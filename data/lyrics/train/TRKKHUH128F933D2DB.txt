I go full speed don't look back
Do what I feel and live how I want to
Hide in your big warm house, lock the door and dream of more
They say the meek will inherit the earth but who's gonna pay the tax?
Begging, scraping, sucking my welfare check
Bitching about big brother while big sister scratches my back
hit and miss lifestyle. Down on whatâ€™s it's up to be.
