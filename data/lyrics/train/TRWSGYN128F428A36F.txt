Lock up your husbands
Lock up your sons
Lock up your whiskey cabinets
Girls lock up your guns
Lock up the beauty shop
No tellin' if they've heard the news
Call the boys downtown at Neiman Marcus
Tell 'em lock up them high heel shoes

When God-fearin' women get the blues
There ain't no slap-dab-a-tellin'
What they're gonna do
...
