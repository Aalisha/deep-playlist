I soak up every little bit to sharpen my bones.
All grown up still trying to find my way home.
I never been cleaned or cloned.
My heart's never been owned.
I'm lonely, but everyone is lonely so at least I'm not alone.
This road is filled with pot holes,
but I don't need to tell you something you already know.
We're both sinking in the same boat.
I wanted you to stay afloat
I did what I could,
But you had to learn to swim on your own.
You lost your glow in the glitter and the gold.
I couldn't stay alive inside your choke hold.
Hold, hold on, because I really gotta go.
