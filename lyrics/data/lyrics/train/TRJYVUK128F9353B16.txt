Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
May your every New Year dream come true

Sweet December song
The melody that saved me
On those less than silent nights

When snow would fall upon my bed
White sugar from Jesus
And take me to the day

She could always smile
The Virgin Child would always show, you see
Just to save me
(Just to save me)

There was always Christmas time
