The trophy that I made for us
In fur and gold
Got into the wrong pair of hands
In truth was sold
They bought it for oh so much less
Than it was worth
And every man that touched it
Found a heaven on earth
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms

The queens and the court jesters
Clapped, adored
Their hearts swelled to
Overdrive and mercy soared
Mercy this and mercy that
Let justice prevail
...
