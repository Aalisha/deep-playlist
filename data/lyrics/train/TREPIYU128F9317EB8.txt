MadChild:
i'm the extreme case of fire and anger
i'm the extreme case of fire and anger
i'm the extreme case of fire and anger
the misguided angel with ice in his veins
my thought pattern is scattered playing russian roulette
cause i'm a rotweiler, excaliber, rock like metallica
gone i'm the sergant, charging with my beloved corps
don't interrupt me, i'll errupt to fuck the
heavy metal makeover mad child warns the
hard to get a four by four pick up truck to kick up dust while it's down there
vanity knows no boundaries
you can't fuck with this commando, rambo rap while in the jungle
kung fu kicks that crack helmets
love is over-rated fuck freaks for fulfillment
