Every evening, eight o'clock, the curtain's up, the band begins to play
The mayor's there, his lovely wife's been squeezed into the fashions of the day
You make your entrance on time
Decadent, thrilling, divine
You're hypnotic, so exotic, the audience just sighs and melts away

Encore, show us more
Sweet Gipsy Rose-a
Encore, they shout more
Se magnifica
Such a pretty face, than of you bolding into space
So give them more, encore
Tre magnifica
