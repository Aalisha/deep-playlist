On a plane
Somewhere over the sea
Above the rain
The bottle sets me free
I turn to stone
Fall back in my seat
The cuts are gone
But somehow I'm still bleeding

You know it's true
There's nothing I can do
You know it's true
There's nothing I can do
You know it's true
There's nothing I can do about you

Move to France
La Rochelle or Nice
And get a house
Pretend to live in peace
Paint the walls
A black out of your face
Stalk the halls
And move into the basement
