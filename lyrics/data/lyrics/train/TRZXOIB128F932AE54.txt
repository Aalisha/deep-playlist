Well, you thought I'd be waitin' up
When you came home last night
You'd been out with all the boys
And you ended up half tight.

But liquor and love that just don't mix
Leave a bottle or me behind
And don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind.

No, don't come home a drinkin'
With lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town
And see what you can find.
