Well it's comfy musical ting called
Groove Armada, featuring Stush and Red Rat, of course

Dip and galang, dip and stand up
Body basic, it won't dance more though
Dip, galang, stand up
While every man in the world light up

So they just dip, get down, get down
Galang, feel, get down
Stand up, get down, get down
While every man in the world light up

Girls all stand up and watch me
They want their sushi
Movement do I look bushy
And I miss you, they just cut me

Me have big booty
They sweet like tutti frutti
Licks you dance like cherry
Angels and that's why I'm screeching

What I wait among the pressure
Jump and sing for [incomprehensible]
Body freeze and I pitch you up
Then boy, easy flick her off

'Cause of this some girls get envy
Even then try mess up your party
Love, but be warned if you beat me
There is no need to compete

So they just dip, get down, get down
Galang, feel, get down
Stand up, get down, get down
Every man in the world light up

So they just dip, get down, get down
Galang, feel, get down
Stand up, get down, get down
