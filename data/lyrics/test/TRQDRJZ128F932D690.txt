I wait confined within the walls of anger
waiting to explode bottled up i soon implode.
Suppressing rage eats away
dissolving my mind and its more,
more than i can take.
And soon my (rage) ignites
soon i will explode (anger)
the cause i do not know (my pain)
it knows no other wrath (unleashed)
stay out of my damage path.
Rising, boiling, boiling,
boiling up inside i feel no pity for them
