I still get the same old feeling
Tearing up this heart of mine
Telling me that maybe
I'm not really over you

I still get the same old yearning
Turning my heart inside out
Look there can't be any doubt
I'm still not over you

The oak tree where you carved my name
A year ago now
Somehow it doesn't look the same
I think it knows now
The places we would go
Still play the songs we used to know

I still get the same old feeling
...
