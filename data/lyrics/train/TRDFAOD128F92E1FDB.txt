Whooo!

I'm on the verge of a break down
I'm on the brink of an epic meltdown
I'm on the way to a flat-line

(oh oh yea)

No, I don't really want to leave you behind
But apparently you can't stay all mine
So I'll try to let you go

You're not mine to own

(Chorus 2x)
If I let it go
If I let this go
If I let you go
Would the scars continue to show
...
