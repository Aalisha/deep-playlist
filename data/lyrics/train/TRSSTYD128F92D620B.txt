Time on my hands since you've been away boy
I ain't got no plans
no, no, no, no.
And the sound of the rain, against my windowpain.
Is slowly, slowly driving me insane.

Boy, I'm going down
I'm going down
'Cause you aint around, baby.
My whole world's turning upside down

Sleep don't come easy.
Boy, please believe me.
Since you've been gone, everything's going wrong.
Why'd you have to say goodbye?
Look what you've done to me
