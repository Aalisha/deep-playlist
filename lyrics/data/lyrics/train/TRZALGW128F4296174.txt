Would someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart
That you're deserting for better company

I can't accept that it's over
And I will block the door
Like a goalie tending the net
In the third quarter
Of a tied game rivalry

So just say how to make it right
And I swear I'll do my best to comply

Tell me am I right to think that there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride and slowly growing old together
...
