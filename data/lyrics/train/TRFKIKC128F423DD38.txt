Night train, silver moon
You ask me why, I'm flyin'
To float on ashen wings
To choke on dust and feather
I learned you are a liar
It's right we should pretend
And lie with one another
It's right we should be twins
For I have loved no other

Look for me baby
Well I'm draggin' lonliness
And it's ten miles long
I thought I heard you scream baby
In the wheels of a train that crawls
When I don't wanna go
