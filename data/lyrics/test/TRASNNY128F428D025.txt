Made a wrong turn
Once or twice
Dug my way out
Blood and fire

Bad decisions
That's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated
Misplaced, missunderstood
Miss know it, it's all good
It didn't slow me down

Mistaken
Always second guessing
Underestimated
Look I'm still around

Pretty pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're less than fucking perfect

Pretty pretty please
If you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing
You're fucking perfect to me

You're so mean
When you talk
About yourself
You're wrong
