We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street, gonna be a big man some day
Got mud on your face, big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Fighting in the street, gonna take on the world some day
Blood on your face, big disgrace
...
