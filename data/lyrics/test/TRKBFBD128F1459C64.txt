I been walkin' through life with a bullet proof vest
Shielding emotions, acting like I couldn't care less
I kept love at a distance my defenses were locked & alert
Then you say hello and the next thing I know
I'm ready to risk being hurt

Chorus: No more protecting my heart now darlin'
My soul is out of the dark now yes it is
I'm settin' my sails, tail winds prevail & I'm on my way
You've got me lettin' my guard down baby
I wanna see what love has to offer me
