Its so simple
And complicated the way you can crush me
No matter how much this hurts
This is through
I get as far as your door before I get caught
I make up excuses just to touch you and I can't stop,
I can't stop

So are we playing for keeps
These days begin and they don't end for weeks
Leave me left out of anything to do with you
Excuse me while I fall apart
Don't flatter yourself sweetheart
Let me take the wheel and I'll crash this car
Do you have to make this
So hard
