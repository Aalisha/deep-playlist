A blizzard, a mallard, a stillborn Chinese baby speaking backwards
My peephole in the cabin, keep an eye on loggers preparing for battle
And textbooks glow like they know where we're going
But it's just a guess they planted in the pages
And flags unfurl like they know why we're sewing
A certain kind of stars into the fabric

Can't keep topping my count's bestsellers, pieced together in damp dark cellars
Flipped out fury, it's a wigged out wish
So creep creep crawl your way into the heartland
