Uh, Dark Child, wha
Ohh, Mary J. Blige
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Said I couldn't do it again but I did

Can't get you off my mind
Thinkin' about you all the time
Can't get you off my mind
Thinkin' about you all the time

The day we met was the last day
That I said I would look anyone else's way
Now you know that I'm with you
And I'll always be true
There's nothing in this world
That I won't do for you

Can't get you off my mind
Thinkin' about you all the time
Can't get you off my mind
Thinkin' about you all the time

The day you left, it was so sad
Now I'm standin' here holdin' on to the past
Keep going on, gotta live your life
If we grow up in time
Maybe real love we will find
...
