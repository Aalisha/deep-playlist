You are not an enemy anymore
there's a ray of light upon your face now
I can look into your eyes
and I never thought it could be so simple

you can hear the music with no sounds
you can heal my heart without me knowing
I can cry in front of you
'cause you're not afraid to face my weakness

when we'll wake up some morning rain will wash away our pain
when we'll wake up some morning rain will wash away our pain

'cause it never began for us
...
