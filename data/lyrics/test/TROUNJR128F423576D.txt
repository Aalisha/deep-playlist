You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
Youre thinking nothings wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs,
They're part of the tender trap

Youre hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon theres music in the breeze
Youre acting kind of smart,
And then your heart just goes wap!
