"You broke his heart and made him cry
And he's been blue since then
Now he's found somebody new
And you want him back again"

Foolish little girl, fickle little girl
You didn't want him when he wanted you
He's found another love, it's her he's dreaming of
And there's not a single thing that you can do

"But I love him"
"No you don't it's just your pride that's hurt"
