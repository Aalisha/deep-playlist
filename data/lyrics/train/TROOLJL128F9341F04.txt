I think that somewhere along the line
(And it's said, all things return to you in time)
I must have finally opened up to your love
Though I was building a wall at heaven's gate
(Everything comes to those who wait)
You must have found a secret path into my soul
And now you're part of my life
I can't believe that this is mine
Every light has its time to shine

I want to understand this change in me

Is it the Power Of Love
Is it the Power Of Love
Is this the Tao of Love
I feel the Power Of Love

Caught up in the famous paper chase
(In your eyes, I saw how I never fell from grace)
I must have finally opened up to your love
