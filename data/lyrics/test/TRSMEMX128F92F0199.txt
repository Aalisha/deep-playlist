I'm an ever rollin' wheel, without a destination real. 
I'm an ever spinning top, whirling around till I drop. 
Oh but what am I to do, my mind is in a whirlpool. 
Give me a little hope, one small thing to cling to. 
You got me going in circles(oh round and round I go) 
You got me going in circles 
...
