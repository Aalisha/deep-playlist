I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the one-man army, Ason
I've never been tooken out, I keep MCs lookin' out
I drop science like girls be droppin' babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy

And energy buildin', takin' all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than Ason
I keep planets in orbit
While I be comin' with teeth, bitin' more shit
Enough to make you break and shake yo' ass
'Cause I create rhymes good as a tasty cake mix

This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catchin' headaches, what, what? You need Aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burnin'? Well, fuck it, now you're learnin'

How, I don't even like your motherfuckin' profile
Give me my fuckin' shit, ch-ch bloaw!
Not seen and heard, no one knows
You forget, niggas be quiet as kept
...
