I can't see me in this empty place
Just another lonely face
I can't see me here in outer space
It's so hard to leave a trace

And I try and I try and I try
But it never comes out right
Yes, I try and I try and I try
But I never get it right

It's a minor earth major sky
Minor earth major sky

I can't see me in this lonely town
Not a friendly face around
...
