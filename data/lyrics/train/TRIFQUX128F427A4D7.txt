Sun's commin' up on a Sunday morning
I'm looking out the window at a beautiful view
Turn on the TV and somebody's talkin'
About the wrong, the right and the ulitmate truth
I listen for a minute, but my heart is somewhere else
'Cause I've got my own convictions
But I keep them to myself

Chorus: When I feel the world around me
How can I not believe
If I'm high up on a mountain
Or down on my knees
It's just between God and me
...
