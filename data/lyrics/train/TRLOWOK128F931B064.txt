Hello friend, how are you? How you do?
Nice to think most of the pain is through
But you never know about these things
You never know

Hard for me to really understand
And hard for me to see the sleight of hand
'Cause the times have changed and we're getting old
We're getting old

Pick a number and begin to count
You know I didn't mean to bring you down
This is the end of an age
