EVERYTHING

Tell me why do you search for happiness
In material things
When they are only temporary
Tell me why do put your trust in man
Time and time again
When they will always let you down

If you just open your eyes
You'll see that i am standing here for you
And I only offer all the very best for you

I've got everything that you could need and more
I've got what your looking for
Oh...
