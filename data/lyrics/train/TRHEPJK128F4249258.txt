She said I'm naked
In the jungle
There I see you block'n
my path
Watch what you do
It don't come easy
No deja vu here
Not a chance
And you better know
If you try to hang me out
to dry
Baby don't come any closer
How will I know
If I give in to you
You will

Love me
Like a ritual
Fill me with your spirit
Spread you magic dust
Love me
Like a ritual
Tell me where you're hurtin'
baby
I will be your medicine man
