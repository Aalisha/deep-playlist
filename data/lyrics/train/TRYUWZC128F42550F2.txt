When I was five
We'd get up at four
And drive on down to the Cornwall shore
Our holidays had come at last
They came real slow and went by fast
Just one week, that's all we had
Then back to work went mom and dad
Happy to be swimmin' in the sea

The seagulls yell
You're getting near
We'd waited patiently all year
And we hadn't slept a wink all night
White faces in the morning light
I see the sea my sister cried
The seaside we'd soon be beside
Happy to be swimmin' in the sea
