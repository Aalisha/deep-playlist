Back home, we got this great big old factory sittin' right in the middle of town
And almost everybody in town works there
Yeah, it's almost about like every other factory around there, I guess
The white folks do the easier work and wear the white uniforms
The colored folks do the hard labor and wear the blue uniforms
This is the story about an old boy waiting outside the factory for his girl to get off work
And the boy speaks...:

Man, this sidewalk is hot; almost five o'clock
Wait 'til that whistle blows and that door opens
And out she'll come and fall in my arms
Man when them folks see that
They'll want to ride us out of town on a rail
Well, I guess they just don't understand
About my brown girl, my brown girl
Brown girl, brown girl
...
