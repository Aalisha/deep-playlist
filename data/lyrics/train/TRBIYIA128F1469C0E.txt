Moving on our way
Moving on our way

I will always remember
Our first days together
It felt like we had known each other forever
We were dreamers
And we were believers
To give up everything
To follow this dream
But one thing that we have learnt
Is to stand, together as one
And nothing will overcome
And nothing's gonna stop us now
