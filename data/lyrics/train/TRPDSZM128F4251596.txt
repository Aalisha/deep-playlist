ee na moi na moi na moi na moi na moi na moi

The wise man builds his house on the rock
The foolish man builds his house on the sand
And when the rain came tumbling down
The foolish man house it washed away

How could the wise man build his house on the sand
How can the wise man build his house where there is no foundation,
on the sand woadi woi on the sand

Noah built his ark by the will of God
But see the wicked people ignores him
So he take all, all with himself
