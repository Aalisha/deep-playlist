Children in the playground, laughing and dancing in the street
All the colors of the rainbow, wrapped in childlike harmony
Me, I'm not laughing, I see things only as they were
When I first needed you, yeah, when I first needed you

Cars passing by, representing my life
I ain't old but I ain't young enough to cry like a baby
Oh, and I'm so scared but I won't tell you, for fear you'll hate me more
Tough on the outside, tough on the outside, yeah, tough all over

Clouds go rollin' by as I lay floatin' in a stream
Of semi-consciousness, I'll follow it 'til the end
Or at least 'til I drown in my separate reality
...
