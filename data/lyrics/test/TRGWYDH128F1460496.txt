Jamie's on the bathroom floor she don't know why
She's shaking underneath the sink can't feel a thing
She'd love to live a life she's too afraid of failure
With all the voices in her head
Now what was that I thought I heard you scream

I know you can feel it
You're already there
Asleep underwater
Just screaming for air
I know you can feel it
You're alreadyâ€¦
Don't you know we're freaks and creatures
Wake up I can almost see the light

I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone left wondering why
I think we're alone here you and I
I think we're alone in the Universe tonight
