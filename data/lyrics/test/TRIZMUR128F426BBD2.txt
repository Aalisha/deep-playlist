You danced with me in the moonlight and I found my theme
Like roses bloom, you inspired me
And the break of day fell upon me and the light outshine
And you broke the spell that had kept me from loving you

I came to you for answers
I left confused

You play charades and the stars bow down
And I saw your face, I lose myself on a Saturday
It had been so long, so I question, I question everything
And it's no surprise, the time was right and you saw it in my eyes
