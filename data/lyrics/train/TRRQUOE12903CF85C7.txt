I hear you calling me
Haunting me
There's nothing I can do
Without you, without you... 

I stand here paralyzed
I've realised
There's nothing
Without you, without you... 
 
If I could talk to you
Embrace you
Whisper in your ear
I would tell you

That, you are
The only, 
The only thing I need
 
The only only only... 
...
