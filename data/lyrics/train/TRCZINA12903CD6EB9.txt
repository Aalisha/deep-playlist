Detroit couldn't rock itself out of a paper bag
Gene Simmons looks kinda cool
But Paul Stanley kinda looks like a jag
Ace Frehley can play guitar
But he ain't no fucking Kerry King
So get your ass out of the way
Here comes a rock revolution
Listen up cause I'm about to sing
The creatures of the night
Can't hold a candle to this
We'll be kickin' ass we'll be takin' names
...
