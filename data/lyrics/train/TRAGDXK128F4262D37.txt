Yeah

You walked in just like smoke
With a little come on, come on, come on
In your walk come on
I've been waitin', are you waitin?
For my move, well I'm makin' it

So tell me baby, can you shake it?
If I can move it with you will you let me take it?
I'll be down on my knees screamin' take me, take me
Take me, take me I'm yours

I've never felt so out of control
You don't even know what you're doin' to me
Come on and do it to me
Don't you stop

Come on, come on
