It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

I went across the river and I lay down to sleep
Went across the river and I lay down to sleep
Went across the river and I lay down to sleep
When I woke up, put the shackles on my feet

It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long
