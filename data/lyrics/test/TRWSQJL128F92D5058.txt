Said I, I, I
I never meant to hurt you
But you didn't even try
To take away my pain
Or dry my weeping eyes
Cause you can't
Can you baby?
Keep doing me wrong
And I won't accept it no more

You had me so caught up baby
Had me so blind
Everything was about you
I put all my needs aside
So go back to her
Stop wasting my time
Cause I'm gonna, I'm gonna
I'm gonna stand up

(Stand up)
