Must've been in late September
When last I climbed Reunion Hill
I fell asleep on Indian Boulder
And dreamed a dream I will not tell

I came home as the sun went down
One eye trained upon the ground
Even now I find their things
Glasses, coins, and golden rings

It's ten years since that ragged army
Limped across these fields of mine
