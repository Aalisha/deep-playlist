Hold the light up to me
Get underneath my skin
I feel a little undefined
But I want to let you in
And I listen to the messages
The endless train of thought
But now it feels like i'm returning
Most everything I've bought

Some say... it's all coming to an end
Some fool themselves with thoughts of new beginnings
It makes me wonder what they believe
'Cause we're in between
Sometimes it's just better to get on with it
Sometimes, lord knows, you gotta get off
There's no use holding on to what I mean
...
