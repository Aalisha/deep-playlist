You think it's right when you see my reaction
Some say a small sacrifice
But the consequence of you're actions hold a much higher price
Cos what is going on
Is just a slower wrong
Joe's re-blinded by a smile ona different face
And what is going on
Will lead to greater wrong
Coz you're just more of the same
