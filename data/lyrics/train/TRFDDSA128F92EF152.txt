Walk away, I walk the wire
And my fields are burning in the flames
Feel my way, blind in the mire
Struggling from your thoughts inside my head
But now everything's trying to drag me down
But I'll rip the sky from the ground
Tell me now, who's my saving one
Jesus or a gun
Stripped away my last desire
Nothing comes and nothing's sent away
...
