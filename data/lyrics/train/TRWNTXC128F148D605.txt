Yeah, yeah
This could have been about a lot of things
But it's not so don't stop and try to look for the message
The world moves and it don't ask why
Your kids will burn red hot like the fourth of July
I could have told about what's in-between of the head and the hand
But you wouldn't even understand
I could have told about the rise and the fall
But this time I swear it's not about anything at all!
This ain't a song about nuthin'
This ain't a song about nuthin' at all
This ain't a song about nuthin'
This ain't a song about anyone or anything
