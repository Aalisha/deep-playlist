I don't wanna move
I'll just sit here in my living room and
See what's on the tube
While I'm hanging out with you

People knock on my door, ringing my phone, telling me the things I gotta get done today
To satisfy them, but what about me?
Lately I've been wishing I was brain dead, no responsibilities in my head today
Baby, let's see what's on TV

Doing nothing, having fun
Off to bed to get things done
I'm not lazy
I'm in love
