nothing's gonna break me down
i'll find a way to bury you within the past
you don't want to see me drown
my eyes are burning
every tear a memory
your perfume in my skin
takes a few weeks to wash it off
been so hard
cutting you out of my veins

dying love is all we have
there's no control and no regrets
i gave it all
i gave it up for a reason
