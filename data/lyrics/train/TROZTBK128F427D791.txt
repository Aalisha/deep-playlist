A storm it was blowin' in
Twister was about to spin my way
Her kitchen door was swingin' wide
As if to say come on inside to stay

Come to Mama, babe
Come to Mama, she say
Come to Mama, baby

Get yourself into a cellar
Gals, go grab yourself a feller 'fore it's too late
Friend, you'd better run for cover
Don't be caught alone out on lover's lane

Come to Mama, babe
Come to Mama, she say
Come to Mama, baby

It's best to make the most of this
