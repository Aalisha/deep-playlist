So you leave tomorrow
Just sleep the night
I promise I will, make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow
Just let me try

Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave tomorrow

Stay here and lay here
Right in my arms
