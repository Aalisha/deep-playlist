Mountainous pictures of coloured scenes appear upon my face
And the joss stick smoke of sense dissolves, forever in its place
The shadowy friends that line the walls all dream while laying down
While the window tapping silhouette in rain begins to drown

In the room of percussion
The discussion slides as you enter through the door
And the one armed bandit
Laughs aloud and disappears once more

Foolish thoughts of ecstasy are dead but without too much concern
In the heart, my hopes by millions lay twisted as they burn
