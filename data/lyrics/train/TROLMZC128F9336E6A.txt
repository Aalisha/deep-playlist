Saw the face of a girl outta place
Sellin books at the check out line
By the black tattoo on her back
She was lookin like the dancin kind

Her secret lies beneath the smoke and the neon lights
She works that stage every night

[Chorus]
She's a poster princess and a dancin queen
She knows (she likes her life in the center of attention) her
secret's safe with me
Now i'm fallin for her and the night's not over
I know (she likes her life in the center of attention) she's comin
home with me
