I've been driving all night, my hands are wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head that drives my heel
And my baby calls, says she needs me here
And it's a half past four and I'm shifting gears

When she gets lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
We don't need to talk at all

WE've got a thing that's called Radar Love
Ww got a wave in the air
Radar Love

Radio's playing som forgotten song
Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
