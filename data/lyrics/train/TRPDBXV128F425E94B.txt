With you out of my life skies are blue and love is real and true.
You fugly brat! ('fraidy cat!)
Who ever thought shit could shine like that?
So glad you stabbed my back.
(The blade when I turned my back)

Go away!
I'm through with you and all the games you put me through.
You're old and slow. I'm fast and new.
