I broke into your house last night
I crept in through your window
I was too quiet for you to hear me
As you finished up your dreams you
rose to me beside your throne
The choice was yours to make, this
was a night you won't forget

So look at me, tell me what you see

I know that the world is beautiful
And the distance will be killer on
the nights that we're alone
So just know, if you fold
This hand will not be dealt until you see the damage done
