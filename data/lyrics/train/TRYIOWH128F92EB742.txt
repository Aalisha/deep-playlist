Lord above
Why don't you tell me
why I'm here in agony?
I've been serving, I've been praying
now I'm caught in misery.

I've been praised by friar Jakob,
I misused his confidence.
Cheated by this work of evil
feigning Anna's innocence.

Oh what have I done?
So many ways lead to the fallen one,
Lucifer, fallen light...
Oh what have I done?
What is going on?

We should bring salvation,
Not give in to his temptation - no!
Read and preach the holy world
And no forbidden lies that hurt.
