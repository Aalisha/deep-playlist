I can feel your pain 
Ohhh ohh yeah (x2)
mmm

Lady I can feel your pain
Even If your thousands miles away
Oh Oh (x2)
Girl i Can remember those days
When Lonliness was right infron your face
Oh Oh (x2)
I can erase those pains away
No more Lonliness staring in ya face
Oh Oh (x2)

Let me make Love to you
Let me talk to you
Let me treat to you
Let me show you 
the way your man should treat a lady
Thats the way you should be treated
Girl
Relax your mind, no more night to fight
I'm gonna treat you right
