Listen
Listen
Listen
Listen

Cold by day, cold by night
I wonder where the summer's gone
Make no mistake, no mistake
I've got to find you

Well, you can tell all your friends
That you've found a way
Go, tell them all that you've come to stay

Just to listen, just to listen
Just to listen to your heart
Just to listen, just to listen
Just to listen to your heart
