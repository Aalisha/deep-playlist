(Dougie D)

What you know about the boys in Texas, we sipping and swang
And knocking and gripping the grain, and floss and let the screens rain
And tip-toe crawling down slow, and we sliding the city
Candy dripping off of the Lac, or the Benz or the Bentley
Creased up pieced up, smelling like Gucci or Versace
Bitches they love me and bop me, niggaz they love me deny me
Trunk cracked with the top back, we ride
I keep my glock coked, up on 84's my car bitch we glide
And you ain't know we keep it crunk, sitting low Excursion that bump
Four do's pop and lock up, you feel me throw the deuce up
Maabing and mashing the gas, soldiers united for cash
Fucking with deadly can mash, it's Guerilla Maab we ain't had
How a playa does it I is, I put that up on my kids
Z-Ro and Trae in the mix, with G.I.N. balling and shit
We hitting hoes with the dick, fifth wheel recline with the kit
Smoking light green it's bliss, watch how do it like this like this

(Hook: Dougie D and Trae) (2x)

You ain't never seen a nigga crawling down so thoed
C-note, four do', swanging glass 84's
