I was just a young man working steady in a good time band
Pickin' every single little lick I could just to please the man
Harlan sang the lead for half and we split up the rest
Hangin' on through the heavy times and hopin' for the best

And I can't recall the names of all, them places that we played in
All them squirrelly party girls and pills we used to pop
Hardly ever sleepin' in those cheap motels we stayed in
Hopin' we could take it 'til we'd make it t the top
