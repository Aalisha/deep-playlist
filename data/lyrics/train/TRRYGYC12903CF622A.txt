What made you
Think I would be fooled?
I now see through you
And you're the fool, tell me
How do you
Feel when you see me
And I disregard you
There's someone new
And they're true

I can't believe
I was so blind I didn't see
That you couldn't be
The type of man to meet my needs
Strangest thing
Is everyone tried to tell me
But I did what they
Told me not to

You nearly had my everything
By running your game on me
You told me all I had to hear
I thought love was finally here
But then one day, the truth I'd see
Your game was incomplete
Coz when I realised the truth
I see your plan, you're not my man
So get from under my roof
I don't want you!

What made you - made you
Think I would be fooled? - be fooled
I now see through you - yes, I do
And you're the fool, tell me
How do you
Feel when you see me - when you see me
And I disregard you - disregard you
