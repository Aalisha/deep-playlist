I would have given you all of my heart
But there's someone who's torn it apart
And she's takin' almost all that I've got
But if you want, I'll try to love again
Baby I'll try to love again but I know

The first cut is the deepest, baby I know
The first cut is the deepest
'Cause when it comes to bein' lucky, she's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, she's worse
But when it comes to bein' loved, she's first
That's how I know
