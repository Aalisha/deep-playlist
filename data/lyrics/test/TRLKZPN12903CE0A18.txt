She said: Lay down and take the load off
Then gently her hands caressed my temples.
How 'bout another shot of wine and the scent of slow burning candles for the ambiance... to set the mood.

She said: The woman... the lady that I am in the street... well I left her right outside... right outside your door but if it's cool... I can stay the night.

Chorus:
And I'll be your heaven... your heavenly garden of loveooveoooveooooove
looooveoooooveoooove loooove

The angelic nastiness she possessed
made me lose my cool
had me so so so subdued.
Love so good... eh
you can hear a pin drop
you can hear the springs pop
...
