[Verse 1:]
I feel too weak, when you come around
No good for me, gonna bring me down
You fill me up with desire
this fantasy is messin´ with my head
You look my way my heart goes
boom boom boom boom boom
Givin´ into your temptation
Baby I should leave

[Chorus 1:]
Cause once you break through my defences
And when I feel you take control
Once you let it in love never let´s you go
(won´t let you go)
