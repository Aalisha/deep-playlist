Give me a - piece of mind, a nickel, a nine
Somethin' to chip a nigga from ankle to spine
We mobbin' niggaz, if they try to bring up the past
Unless they talkin' 'bout '95 Kurupt and Daz
Unless they talk about '92, 3, or 4
We shatterin' motherfuckers like car windows
Did you know we was back?... back in the 'Llac
Tossin' sacks back and forth like a quarterback jackin'
Bitches eat dicks like pickles
If I'ma go out, I'm goin' out like Brian Nickels
I'm sick of the games, nigga I'm sick and deranged
Poppin' that bullshit will get you hit with them thangs
I'm sick with them thangs, I ain't got no patience left
Without a pistol, light niggaz like crystal meth
You thought niggaz was a joke 'cause of the liqour and smoke?
Quicker to knock niggaz, sicker than leukemia, loc

Push back, ride to the fullest
Dogg Pound tossin' bullets, ride to the fullest
Kurupt and Dat Nigga D-A to the motherfuckin' Z
D.P. motherfuckin' G.C.
I'm just too much, Snoop too much, Soopafly too much
Grip the heater, dump, bust
Bigg Nate too much, what you talkin' 'bout?
Nothin' but them riders with automatics, we shut 'em down
Dogg Pound

Who want it like never before?
You know the bullshit stop when we walk through the door
Malicious and viscous, I'm dishin' out the slugs that be spittin'
You know me and my nigga Young Gotti, yeah we back on a mission
We ridin' with somethin' fully automatic, lettin' them niggaz have it
