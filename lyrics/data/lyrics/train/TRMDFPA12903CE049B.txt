Doesn't matter who gets the best of who
Or who can hurt who the most, no.
It never was meant for it to be that way,
Never should be that way at all.

Chorus:
The way it is, the way that it goes
Happenin' day after day, yeah.
That's the way it is, the way that it goes,
Workin' in the strangest ways.

Even though we could never seem to work things out,
I still love you just the same.
I miss your smile and that sparkle in your eye.
You're so beautiful, never change.

Chorus:
The way it is, the way that it goes
