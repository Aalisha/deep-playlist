Remember when we met The way you made me laugh
How could I forget I found my better half
But lately I've been feeling strong And you've been falling behind

Don't push me away There's nothing to hide

I love you babe I'm on your side

Remember how we kissed The first time in the dark
Your lips were on my lips Your heart was on my heart
But last night when you went to sleep
