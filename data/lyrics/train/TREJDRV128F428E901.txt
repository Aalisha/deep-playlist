Sit there with a blank expression
Say you can't go on anymore
It's not like me to come out and help you
Maybe I've been down this road before

Been living in the shadows
Now you come out slow
Now you're in the saddle
Got to ride a long
Now you're dream was shattered
These days are through
Maybe something mattered
It's not just for you

Some are gonna go for broke
Some are gonna lay down
...
