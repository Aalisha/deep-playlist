There is a storm in my heart that tears my inside apart.
It's not so smart standing in a corner when it's time for us to,
Start up this engine that took us this far,
Not reaching for the stars, you know how we are,
And we will keep it that way, just make the feeling stay,
And when we're down, we must say that this can brighten up our day.

This is the sunlight that brightens up my day.
Stepping up on stage when everything feels dull and gray.
And we can't keep this inside, how we're feeling this time.
You're half of it so we cannot quit,
keep building it up with brick after brick.
