Don't haunt this heart,
Don't haunt this place,
Your heart beating slow as it beats out a pace,
West side apartment grows lonely and dark,
West side apartment is two more empty hearts.

I see your keys hanging in the same place,
They haven't moved for a month or even a day,
This was hard it was fun,
We should do it again,
Give ourselves some time,
Ten years for the day.

I need you now,
I need you then,
I never want to feel this again,
Separate the room with painful divides,
Until there's nothing left to remind.

Never want to see you again,
I never want to feel this again,
Turn off the locks,
...
