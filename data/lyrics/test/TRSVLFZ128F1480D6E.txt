(t. bryn) 

girls lie to boys and boys lie to girls 
he says, "i've been at the office, papers up to here" 
but he smells like beer 
she says, "its okay" 
he thinks she doesn't know - women always know 

chorus 

but i'm gonna be the one to break all those rules 
i think those people are fools 
scandal's nothing new 
...
