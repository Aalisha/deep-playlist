Perkele!

He died on that cross
Yes he paid for his crime
His name will be lost
In the annals of time
You know that the nation
Has got to go on
The nation shall live when
These followers are gone

Chainsaw Blast
We are Ripping your soul apart
Chainsaw Blast
We are taking you to the ground

I've waded through the answers
I've found the one that's true
Awakened! By the cracking of my spine
I'm screaming my throat raw,
No relief do I find before I am dead
...
