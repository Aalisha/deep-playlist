Light the gasoline
I've got the remedy
To burn your memories
I don't know if it can

Never be afraid
To live with the lies and pain
You're never gonna be the same
I don't know if you can

I wanna take it too far
Come on, don't be shy
I wanna make you go down, down

I can make you scream
How I live my life
When I have no choice
I see it in your eyes, you're crazy

Just scream
How it feels inside
Let me hear your voice
And make it loud this time
It opens up my mind

Tell me what you see
...
