I sat at home and watched
The world go by on a screen
I never questioned
Never doubted that I could dream
I was a loner the phone would never ring
At least not for me
And now I look back and I can see that when we first met
You've changed my life
I've no regrets

So many times I've been left
Saying why didn't I make a move
I could see it in our eyes
Girl its not a lie
But your look just soothes
This time I'm not gonna run away
To save my foolish pride
No false pretences no walls
No fences I'm not gonna hide

Now you know that I'm madly in love
Hey girl I'm still so madly
Does it show that I'm madly in love
Listen all that I wanna do
Is be madly in love with you
