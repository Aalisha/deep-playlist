This time I'll try to love again
I'll never lose you my friend
I'll be there till the end
Forever
This time I'll take the happy pill
Chew off more than I can spill
Play until you stay forever

But nobody said it would be easy now
We live in a lucky town
But the foundations are shaking
The bridges are breaking in two
But nobody said it would be easy now
I don't want to let you down
But my heart is alight, it's alright
'Cause it's burning for you
And it burns right through

This time I'll try to make believe
Wear my heart upon my sleeve
