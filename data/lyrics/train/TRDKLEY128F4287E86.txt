He doesn't want your love
But he can't say goodbye
He's beggin' you to stay
But he can't tell you why

You finally made your move
Your hand is on the door
You know the rest is hard
You've been this far before

Don't look back now, he's gonna see you cryin'
You'll turn around, it happens every time
That look will always break you down
