I hate you and you hate me,
What's your darkest fantasy?

Maybe you don't want the truth? (truth)
I tried, I tried, I tried,
But I can't live without you!
It's making me blue!
I tried, I tried, I tried, 
I tried, I tried, tried!
I give my love to you!
Everything I have to give
I give it to you!
You! and ONLY YOU!
Take it, don't you fake it
'cause I'll break you! (break you, break you...)

Garden of Eden, take a bite.
Do me evil all damn night.
Sinful thoughts run trough your brain.
And I'll ask, you'll decide, drives you insane.
