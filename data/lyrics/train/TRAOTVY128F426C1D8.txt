Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The battle will soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep

Jimmy sent a letter to his bride back home
for three long years now he's been gone
He left her cryin' on her wedding day
And went to fight the battle of the Blue and Gray

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me
The war's gonna soon be over
Oh Mary don't you weep
...
