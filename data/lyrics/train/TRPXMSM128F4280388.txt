Poison like the air we breath in
This complicated world we weave
Spins around, pulls us down
This life we lead is overrated
like some mucked up
Calculation
That's the way
So they say

And all we ever need
Is a chance to be
Freedom lies beneath reality
Find a way
Maybe today

And all the fairytales and fantasies
...
