The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me? I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go

So won't you, please?
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby
(My one and only baby)
Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now
(My one and only baby)
Whoa oh oh oh

I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see
