If I told you I loved you would you walk away?
I'm not trying to fool you, there's no playing games
You're tired of being alone though I feel the same
Ooh, maybe falling in love will take away your pain

So I have to say
(I have to say)
That I really love you
(I really love you)

Don't be afraid
(Don't be afraid)
I just wanna know
(Just wanna know)
If you're staying with me

Oh, I can take you away to places out of this world
All I need is the time of day to make your dreams for real
Take a chance on love, I'm gonna do the same
Ooh, we're two hearts of a kind, we're gonna have it made

So I have to say
(I have to say)
That I really love you
