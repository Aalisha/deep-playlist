All over you, all over you
You've got me all over you
What you gonna do 'bout it?

It was the way you walked by
You know that look in your eye
Was that would make me loose my cool

Now I had to have you my way
I don't care what people might say
Somebody's got to play the fool

You know I can't deny
The toxic lullaby
You used to whisper in my ear

You know your sweet temptation
Waits you in fascination
And now I've got to have you here
(What you gonna do?)

You've got me all over you
You'll know
You've got me all over you
