There's a love about you, baby
That brings a grown man to his knees
A love that tastes as sweet as honey
Let me have some, won't you please?

Say the word and I'll come runnin'
On the straight and true
Are you ready for my lovin'
Like I'm ready for you?

If by chance we stay together
You and I can have it all
...
