Bodies dismembered, corpses desecrated
Carcasses liquidized and minced with hatred
Brains are splattered, strewn limbs and heads
Blood has been spurted as the arteries were shredded

Eyes have been impaled, flayed skin in strips
Intestines and guts from the body have been ripped
Stench of sweet blood, bones have been crunched
Festering gore is eaten for lunch
