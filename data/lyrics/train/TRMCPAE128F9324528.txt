(Jackson Browne)

In my early years I hid my tears
And passed my days alone
Adrift on an ocean of loneliness
My dreams like nets were thrown

To catch the love that I'd heard of
In books and films and songs
There's a world of illusion and fantasy
In the place where the real world belongs

Now I look for the beauty in songs
To fill my head and lead me on
Though my dreams have come up torn and empty
As many times as love has come and gone

To those gentle ones my memory runs
...
