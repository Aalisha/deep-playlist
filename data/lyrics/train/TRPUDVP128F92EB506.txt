Ooh, Ooh

Yeah, Yeah

I'm in the mood for dancing, romancing
Ooh I'm giving it all tonight
I'm in the mood for chancing
I feel like dancing
Ooh so come on and hold me tight

Dancing, (dancing) I'm in the mood, babe
So let the music play
Ooh I'm dancing, (dancing) I'm in the groove, babe
So get on up and let your body sway (body sway)

I'm in the mood for dancing, romancing
You know I shan't ever stop tonight
