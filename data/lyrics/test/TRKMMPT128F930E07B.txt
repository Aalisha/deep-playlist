The heat is on, on the street
Inside your head, on every beat
And the beat's so loud, deep inside
The pressure's high, just to stay alive
'Cause the heat is on

Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Caught up in the action I've been looking out for you
Oh woo oh ho, oh woo oh ho
Tell me can you feel it? Tell me can you feel it?
Tell me can you feel it?

The heat is on, the heat is on
The heat is on, it's on the street
