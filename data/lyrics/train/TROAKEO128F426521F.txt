Hello stranger, don't say a word
'Cause we haven't got much time
So for now just hold me

I'm wishing on a star, baby, to follow where you are
And to shine like you shined when your love was mine
Before we were, now what we are

Baby, there's a silence that's golden in my eyes
And if you'd just listen, my lips will tell you why

That when I say that I'm a lonely girl
I'm feeling like I'm naked to the world
And if you leave with my defenses down
I'll never hear another sound but my heart

Hush don't explain
'Cause we've got to make the most
Out of every moment
