Been thinking about
All those lies you heard me say
I can't make them go away
Been thinking about
All those mistakes you've seen me make

When I can barely hold on
You promise me you won't let me go
And I want you to know

I don't live a perfect life
But God knows I'm trying the best I can
And I have wasted so much time
Pretending I'm alright about who I am
But now I'm living the best I can

Been thinking about
It's hard to see what you see in me
