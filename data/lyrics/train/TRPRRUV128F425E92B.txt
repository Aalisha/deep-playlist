Today I sat and smoked myself to cancer
Thinking about the dancer at the bar
Well how was I to know
That a crush could just implode
â€˜Til it became a grudge eclipsing every star

And yes I know my addictions run the gamut
The drugs, the smokes, the booze, the 24
But you can't make the turkey colder
Or skew me less bipolar
Let me list those things about you I abhor

Horrible, you're
So easy, talk sleazy
You led me off the plank and left me queasy
And that is why
You can't rock my world

You swore that you were taken when I met you
But yes, you did undress me from afar
