He's on his way
He's moving to Hollywood
He's bussing into Hollywood
Show him the way
He's moving to Hollywood
He's hopping into Hollywood

He's waited at bus stops, all his life
He's been in and out of lost places
Seen eyes that spoke to him
From sad and empty place

He's on his way
He's moving to Hollywood
He's bussing into Hollywood
Show him the way
