You ought to know by now
Love is the look in my eye
Lovin' the way you smile
When I say
"I wish you would stay"
You bring out all the youth in me
I laugh and cry out all the truth in me out of love
You should know by now

Haven't you felt by now
Just what it's like to be loved
Knowing that certain touch when you're sure
Time won't give you more
...
