"Monday, July 16, 1945, 5: 30 A.M."

Fuel this hate
And you'll never be the same again
Now I'm feeling again and again
Fuel this hate
And you're living on the edge again
Just like we felt back then
Fuel this hate
And you'll never be the same again
When you just don't give a damn
Fuel this hate
And you're living on the edge again
I don't give a damn...

Thrashing
Raging
Fighting
Screamin
Thrashing
Raging
Fighting
Fuel the hate

Fuel this hate
And you'll never be the same again
Now I'm feeling again and again and again
Fuel this hate
...
