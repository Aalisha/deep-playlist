Is this what's left of me

I sense a kiss
it's coming on
I sense the rift between us
my fault
I pray for something
a quick demise
something to substitute a restless mind
call the doctors
call the gods
you can't call anyone
to save me now
weak is the one who crawls
lives life behind a wall
the only question here is
Why can't I ever feel

Why can't I ever feel
Why can't I ever feel
Why can't I ever feel
Why can't I ever feel

Why can't I ever feel
Why can't I ever feel

Is this what's left of me
debilitated life
look back and see
nothing but my self wasted
...
