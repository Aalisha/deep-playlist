Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell

When I was just a little boy only six years old
I asked my daddy what big things my future hold
He said, Son, when you grow up to be a man,
The facts of life you will start to understand
Nobody knows just what tomorrow may bring
So I want to tell you now, and listen while I sing

Father said,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell

Now I'm a lonely man trying to make life on my own
Ever since the day I was born, I never have a happy home
...
