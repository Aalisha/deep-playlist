I reflect the light,
i'm that goddamn noose so warm and tight
i'm buried in a gallery of failures
i'm the fluid in your eye
i'm the black star in your blood red sky
and i'm stricken with a mouthful of poison
I am one with misery
is someone out there?
'cause this life is killing me
So as i try to see the light
with my demons begging me to die
