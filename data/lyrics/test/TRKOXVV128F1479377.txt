I keep the one
I love in the freezer
If you wish I'll let
You look a little teaser
Oh the cold
It keeps him well preserved
It's the treatment
He always did deserve
I'm aware that this ain't right
But I'm convinced by the sight
Of the one that I love
Fresh and young, fresh and young
Some people
They may react
But surely, they too
...
