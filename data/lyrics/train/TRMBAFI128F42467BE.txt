Behind the gate lies another man
one more step and he would be free
he's face so cold and it's turning into stone
is this another dream

I dream of the lives
that hides in this valley of sacrifise
they are hidden somewhere beneath the
surface
and i can hear them breathing

Now turn away
don't look ever back
I can see the flames
I can feel my strength
and now the one have returned
...
