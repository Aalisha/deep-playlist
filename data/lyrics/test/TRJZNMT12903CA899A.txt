She says, I would like you to leave
Between the cigarettes and dirty sheets
I’d hate to make you watch me bleed
She’s out of control lying on the floor
You can’t hold it all together with bruised fists and dresser drawers

Wake up! The cold is here, it’s finally coming
Wake up! The cold is here, you can’t keep running
Wake up! The cold is here, you won’t see morning
You’ve got to let go

Wake up! The cold is here, it’s finally coming
Wake up! The cold is here, you can’t keep running
Wake up! The cold is here, you won’t see morning
You’ve got to let go

She dreams I’ll never be free
