[Intro:]
Alright. We gonna build a foundation from here*
They told me I had to return with some heat. Step up
It's time to step it up. Supastition
[Chorus:]
Now step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it
Now step up, step, step, step up
Step up, now step up and get with it
Now step up and get with it [x5]
A one, two, a one, two
[Verse One]
Now let me introduce myself
I'm Mr. Bad Luck, yep I paid dues
Been here forever, y'all just slept on my debut
I've been kept on labels and learned when you get dealt a hand
Full of bullshit you play with it like Elton Brand
Just when you thought urban music was dead
I resurface with the purpose of provin' I'm never losin' my edge
This Carolina cat flows infinite
My brain's like Korean food, nobody knows what's it in
Bringin' the drama to my team is like sparkin' a gas fire
Cause I run with a regime the size of a mass choir
I'm the champion, I march around town victorious
Leavin' you nervous like you blew lights on Crown Victorias
My crew, we make rappers kiss the ground before us
The underground notorious, put your crown in storages
These cats ain't movin' toward us
I make niggas fans by the second bar
Turn 'em to groupies before the chorus
