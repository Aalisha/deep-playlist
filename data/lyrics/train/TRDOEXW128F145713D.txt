Born into darkness in Saturn's sight
Riding the night like the wind
Ripping the heart form a world that is right
Treading the borders of sin.

By the pain that you bring
Send you higher

Slashing destruction, your right hand sword ringing
To the ends of the earth you will fly
Conquering masses in wanton deception
