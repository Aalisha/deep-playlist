I hear what you're not saying
It's driving me crazy
It's like we stopped breathing in this room
We're both the last to be leaving
I know what you're thinking
I wish you'd make you move

It's much too quiet in here
I wanna disappear
I'm hearing myself thinking too clear
It's too quiet in here
Make it all go away
Why can't we break this silence
Finally

It's like you know where I'm going
