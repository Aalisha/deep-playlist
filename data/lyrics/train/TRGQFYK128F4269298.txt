A Priest caught in lust
Is roaming the Red Light
Pays to indulge in his sins
Body cry
Each Day he awakes
And prays for forgiveness
"Our Father" he cries to his god
"Set me free"

Once we may ask for forgiveness
Someday we could see paradise
His words echo to his disciples
Yet again he'll give into his vice

Caught and bound by temptation
So ashamed of running free
Sweet embrace, captivation
...
