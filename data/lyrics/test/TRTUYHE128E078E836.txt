(Allison Moorer/Doyle Primm)

You've finally gone and done it
Broke it right in two
There's no way you can fix it
So pocket your excuse

Don't tell me that you're sorry
That'll only make it worse
I'm tired of your story
I know it word for word

I make no bones about it
Stupid is as stupid does
I had to learn the hard way
You're a man that I can't trust
