THERE'S A PARTY GOIN' ON
(J. Barry - D. Covay)
WANDA JACKSON (CAPITOL ST-1511, 1961)

Beefsteak Charly is a-throwing a feast
Right around the corner down the Road East
And there's a party goin' on
Ooh, there's a party goin' on
We're gonna swing it, shake it, make it
Shimmy till the break of dawn

Now everybody grab your Sunday best
...
