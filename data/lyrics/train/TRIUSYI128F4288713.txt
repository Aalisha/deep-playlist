Well, who to believed this season's
Connoisseur lady killer like me
Would get hurt by a girl like you
And they got names for dirty little girls like you, honey
It ain't nice, though, but they call you everybody's girl

And they say, "Here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes"
And they say, "Here she comes, here she comes
Here she comes, here she comes"

There goes
Everybody's girl, everybody's girl
Everybody's girl, everybody's girl

You might say I was blind for a while
