Hey girl, do you have time?
Can we sneak off somewhere and have a talk?
'Cause I've got things I've got to get off my chest
Something's you may not have heard yet, oh baby

You would be the only love that I need
And you would be the last breath that I breathe
You would be the words I read that say to me we're meant to be
So how could he possibly not see, how beautiful u r

Girl, how does he miss the things so special to me
Girl, he'll never be the thing that I am naturally
Girl, how could he touch your face and never really see
Girl, how beautiful u r

I know you've got someone
But he don't understand what your heart needs
