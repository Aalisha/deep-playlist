Oh yeah

My favorite addiction
You're no good to me
But all this attraction
Makes it hard to see
The line between what's right
And what I wanna do
So I've got to tell you

I'm gonna pack my bags
Leave a lipstick letter
Take the first plane out of town
I can't lie, I won't cry
I won't tell you goodbye
And I won't turn around
You're gonna be a sweet memory
But you'll never be Mr. Right
I'm gonna leave you baby
