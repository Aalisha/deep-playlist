Rise
And speak the truth
You will bleed dry before you die
Broken oath
Worship the loathe
Betrayer! Betrayer of life

You wear the crest of the shamed
In blood you are blamed
You're going down, down
Down underground
Blood on your hands
In blood we are bound

A slaughter is at hand
In this godforsaken land
Swear to your masters command
Swear to blood and join the death-clan
...
