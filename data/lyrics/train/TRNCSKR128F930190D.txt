So many times I've tried to
Get away from you!
Never thinking or realizing
What you put me through!
When will I get over
This nightmare
I've tried to hide these tears
While you point and stare

Shut up, get out, run away, I'm no PARIAH!
Shut up, get out, run away, I'm no PARIAH!

Tell me why
You cannot accept me
For what I am inside
(It's hard to hide the pain)
When that's all you left in me
I'm no pariah!
