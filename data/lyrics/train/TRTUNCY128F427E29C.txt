It don't mean nothing
When you say it's gonna be alright
'Cause you'll tell me anything I wanna hear

And it don't mean nothing
When you laugh at my jokes
'Cause it's all or nothing when I fall apart

Fade, fade
Fade into you

You're under my skin now
I could shut out the world that we know
I'll try to be everything you want me to be
