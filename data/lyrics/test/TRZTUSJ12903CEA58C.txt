I thought you should know, I don't wanna let go
Since you're all I've ever dreamed of
What will you do to make me want to

Just don't ever try to find out why
I always keep you waiting
Some things are better left unknown

When I fall, if I fall
Darling, hold me
'Cause when I fall, if I fall
I will take you with me

When I fall, if I fall
Darling, hold me
