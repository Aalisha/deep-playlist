That's a frosty way to speak,
To tell me how to live next to your potpourri
All this talking pulls my teeth
I believed in you, so you believed in

Me, I cried out "God"
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
So now I hide in piles of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me how it'd always feel

Once I had an name to call you
It scraped along the walls like an orthodox saint
I wish for the same old things that turn me inside out
