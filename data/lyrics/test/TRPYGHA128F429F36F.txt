(Chorus) - 2X
We can both be... diamonds in the rough
Handcuffed together, I'll love you forever
For better, for worse -
It's me and you against the world girl
Against the world

(Defari)
I met you at the City Walk
You so fine lil' 7-1-4
Come here and hear this L.A. city talk
My name's Dwayne.
(My name's Veronica, I stay in Santa Ana)
Oh, I stay in Santa Monica
You like a glamour girl, you like my favorite world
My love at first sight, damn you so tight girl
