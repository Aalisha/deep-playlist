I would love to
Sing a song for you
That no one's heard,
I would do my best
Pour out my heart
Hope you love every word

[bridge 1]
But simple words
And simple chords
Simply- fall short,
Maybe we got it all wrong
We got it all wrong

[chorus]
Maybe Worship is more
About reaching out
Than reaching up
And loving you,
Is why we do it, we show others love
Maybe we've been missing, the point all along
Worship comes from
The singer not the song
...
