Freedom's all around
Dancing as we paint the town
Friends they do surround
We are single yeah

It's so great to be
Answering to nobody
Freedom's got the sound
We are single yeah

Freedom's all around
People jumping up and down
Boys and girls get down
We are single yeah
It's so great to be in the crazy company
What more can I be
We are single yeah

Da de da de da de
The single life is for me
Da de da de da de
With the fun company
Da de da de da de
The single life is for me
Da de da de da de
With the fun company
(Da de da de da de)
(Da de da de da de)
(Da de da de da de)

Forget about the boy, girl he dont do you right
Forget about the way that he hugged you tonight
