So come and get it, come and get it, take it from me
If you want it bad enough you'll try and find away
So if you need it gotta take it take it from me
I got it all, I got the cure for your disease
So just forget it, just forget what they say
It doesn't matter, no it doesn't matter anyway
It's just another, just another fucked up day
Look in the mirror see the product of society
One chance, one time to admit it
You can't resist because your so goddamn addicted
The light's not so bright unless you abuse it
