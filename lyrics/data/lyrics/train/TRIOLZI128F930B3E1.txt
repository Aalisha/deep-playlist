Father you left me - you`ve always been with me
Bringing the sunlight into the day
"Listen to reason and make a decision"
A powerful engine but a few steps away from the edge
How could you leave me so alone?

Always confusion - too many opinions
The world that I cling to is wasting away
Looking for wisdom in moments of sadness
Is anyone out there to get me away from the pain
You never made me play the game

Killing the state of imagination
I have to walk alone
Where is the sense that I should follow?
