I walk the line of the disappointed
I celebrate when I'm in pain
My heart and mind can be disjointed
I built a bed in this hole I made
I recognize that I'm damaged
I sympathize that you are too
But I wanna breathe without feeling so self-conscious
But it's hard when the world's staring at you

Another piece of the puzzle
It doesn't fit
You throw your arms up
You're so damn sick of it
What are you working for
What are you searching for
Love

You won't be thinking of cars when
You're on your death bed and dying
You'll only be thinking
Of what you are paying for
What you are praying for
Love
