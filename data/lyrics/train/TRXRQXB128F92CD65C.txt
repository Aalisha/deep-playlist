All alone in a cafe
I watch the world rushin by
They're all dreamin bout dollars and thinkin bout
Mountains that they have to climb
A woman checks her reflection
A man straightens his tie
They wear troubled expressions and meanwhile
I just sit here and smile

*Chorus*
You can chase all the silver
If you need riches to hold
You can run after rainbows
