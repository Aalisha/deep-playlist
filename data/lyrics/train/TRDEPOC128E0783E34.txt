Stand up straight
Do your trick
Turn on the stars
Jupiter shines so bright
When you're around to tell us slow down,
We're too young you need to grow
The speed's the key
And they don't know who we are

And who's to say that we're not good enough?
And who's to say that this is not our love?

Mother don't tell me friends are the ones that I lose
'Cause they'd bleed before you
...
