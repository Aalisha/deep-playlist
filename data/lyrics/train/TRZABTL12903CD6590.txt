We're drown in pure suffering
Collapsing into decay
All things now turn to ashes and dust
We 're falling down

We desappear now, our existence will end, so vain
This is the last second we share, we 're burning... fast

Our tears are solidified
In the breath of vanity
We've lost all chance to exit,
We have no place to hide

We desappear now, our existence will end, so vain
...
