Out To Find You

I know it´s up to me what I am gonna do
Never listened to anyone some people say I´m a fool
Ask me a question and I´ll let you know
I just won´t tell you about my goals

Gone wrong too many times I know it´s not okay
I´m here to show you all what´s on my mind today
Another question? You don´t wanna know
