(Grace, grace)
Reaching out, looking for some way to escape the crowd
You whispered words that I've been searching for
Somehow you answered my call
Reaching out I feel I'm rising up

You give me (grace)
In a world that doesn't sleep at all
You give me (grace)
It's a place I've never been before
You give me (grace)
And in all of the confusion you're the peace in my soul
That's why I will never really be alone

Suddenly, I'm up on the surface now where I can see
And picture the person who I need to be
And I know, yes I know I can make it
