Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run but it stays right by my side.
So tear me open, pour me out!
There's things inside that scream and shout.
And the pain still hates me.
So hold me until it sleeps.
Just like the curse, just like the stray.
You feel it once and now it stays.
Now it stays.
So tear me open but beware.
There's things inside without a care.
And the dirt still stains me.
So wash me until I'm clean.
