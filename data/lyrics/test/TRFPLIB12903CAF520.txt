Yeah, I gotta admit
It really doesn't seem like it's been this long
But it turned out better than we thought
And they say us proved them wrong
'Cause we have held the promises that we made
The sun - it shines on us
Though people try to throw in shade
But with a son and two daughters later
Seven years deep like Will and Jada
Givin' our praise to the creator
Because I know he's greater than anything
That we could ever do
Ain't none of it would be possible without you

Through love and peace and pain
Yes, we held each other through the pouring rain
We laughed, and we cried; we flied together
