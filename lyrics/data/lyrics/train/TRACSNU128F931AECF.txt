Deatholution
Deatholution
Deatholution

Return to primeval mud
When the S turns to C
We're suffering in blood
And loose all humanity
Stumble over the screens
People without sanity
Speak with primordial screams
New act on discovery

The Deatholution begins
Spreading out like a virus
Released from all our sins
Destroy us.

Deatholution (death)
Deatholution (death)
