Here again, don't give yourself away again
Surrendering some things are better left unsaid
Gone again, I'd settle down, I'd settle for content
To stay, just finding what's been left behind

Give it all just to get it
You're missing pieces everywhere
Waiting for something better
When nothing ever seems to change

Give it all just to get it
You're missing pieces everywhere
