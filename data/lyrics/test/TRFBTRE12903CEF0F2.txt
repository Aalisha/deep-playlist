I'm just a stupid kid and I get my kicks
But she left me and it hit me like a ton of bricks
I'm crying, yeah, I'm dying, yeah
And I'm never ever smiling again
See I didn't need the girl and I seemed tough
She left me and I'm taking it a little rough
I'm shattered, yeah, and I'm crackked up, yeah
And I'm never ever smiling again
