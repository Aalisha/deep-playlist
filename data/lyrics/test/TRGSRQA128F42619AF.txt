[Skinnyman]
So now the Little Man's caught by the feds
He's in a cell in he the parrow state
Straight from the judge's courtrooms to the prison gates
Sittin' in a sweatbox thinkin', he has to ride an eight
Sittin' in a jail cell just eatin' food and pushin' weights
Gettin' straight, hopin' his parole board can set a date
Everyday he's made to just sit a wait makes him full of hate
It makes the Screws with fuck me attitudes
