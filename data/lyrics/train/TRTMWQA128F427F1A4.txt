Some people live their lives
In such a lofty flight
Wishing the distant stars daydreaming
What a lovely world
You make it paradise
I'm a lucky girl
Everything feels so nice

Don't you know that we share a blessed love, ooh ooh
Don't you know that we have it all
Don't you know that we share compassion love, ooh ooh
Don't you know that we share a sacred kind of love
