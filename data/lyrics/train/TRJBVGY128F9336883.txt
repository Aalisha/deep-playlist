Take my arm I'll be your guide and we will build this kingdom to the sky
And if we don't start now, we'll never leave this town
Dreams they come and dreams they go
If it's the dream you want than make it so
And it's the chance you take
And it's your chance to break
Let it be today

Everybody everybody jump back we believe you know that we should give it one last try
We can say there's nothing on the outside waste away from inside
Watch the moment pass on by
