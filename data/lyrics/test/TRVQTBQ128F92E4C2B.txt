While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
But she'll never change her ways

Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart feels so still
As I try to find the will to forget her somehow
Oh I think I've forgotten her now

Her love is a rose pale and dying
Dropping her petals in pain unknown
All full of wine the world before her
...
