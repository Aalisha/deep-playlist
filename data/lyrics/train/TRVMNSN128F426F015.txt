Well I pass him by on the street each day
Brother, don't you walk away
He's about my size and about my age
Brother, don't you walk away
Down a different road, might've been my friend
Brother, don't you walk away
But you never know how the road will bend...

Brother, don't you walk, Brother, don't you walk away
Brother, don't you walk away
Tell me why it so hard to say
Brother, don't you walk away

When you sleep all night on a pillow of stone
Brother, don't you walk away
Do you dream of finding your way back home
Brother, don't you walk away
Well some might say these are better days
Brother, don't you walk away
But a cardboard box is your home these days...
