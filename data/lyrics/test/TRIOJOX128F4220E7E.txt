Mama, if you could see me now
I m not the boy you knew in Macon town
They found a uniform about my size
It s a little big I guess, but that s alright
Mama, if you could see me know

Mama, they re treating me right well
The men all say I brought this good luck spell
I am the mascot of the Third Brigade
They will not march unless I lead the way
Mama, they re treating me right well
