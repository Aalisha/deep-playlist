I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you

Green are my eyes
They've seen so much compassion
I couldn't have changed but too much suffering inside
So now I'm said and done

I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to
And now I spend most of my time playing computer games
And wishing I was loving like most of my friends
Oh I am so ashamed
 (I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you 'cause I have to)
