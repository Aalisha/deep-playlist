AGITATED!
deny temptation
BOATS ARE SINKING UNTILL STANDING DEFENCES ARE slowly fading I WONT GIVE IN TO YOUR COMPROMIZING NEVER CRUMBLE no not this time

I AM SICK OF LYING TO MY SELF IT WONT ALWAYS BE OK THE HOLE GETS DEEPER EVERYDAY (EVERYDAY) MY NAILS ARE WORN AND FINGERS BLEEDING STILL I REBURY MY SELF LOOKING BACK THERES ANOTHER WAY A BETTER WAY THERES NO WAY THERE IS NO WAY
