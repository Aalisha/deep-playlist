Say
sugar honey
you gotta act like me
You can take a passion lovin' panther
Make him weak at the knees.
You can shake him like a rattle
And roll him like a dice.
But honey you know I'm too big to be nice
I gave away my independence to all them evil guys
And when I got too hot they put my lips on ice.
Now I don't hold out with wise guys

I see through their diguise

'Cause honey
I'm to big to be fooled twice.
Well
I don't know all the answers
But I guess I know my share
And I've taken all the chances
