I don't care
And I don't mind
If you gonna find somebody else
Boy, that's all right
I wish you well
I hope your life
In some way will find the satisfaction
That I've found
And I don't need to buy excuses
Anymore then you got uses in my life
In my life
I won't hear you calling
This time I'm walking away
Boy there's no in between
Now you made your choice
I guess it's over boy
I'm really gone to stay
I'm born again
Got a second chance
Now I can hold my head up high
And spread my broken wings
...
