She's gettin' ghetto up in here
She's gettin' ghetto up in here
Whoa, whoa, whoa

She be like, one Mississippi, two Mississippi, stop!
Backed up, [Incomprehensible] roll then you drop
Like I said before, he's my man
What part of that conversation don't you understand?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
 (She's gonna get ghetto up in here)

Boots don't come off, grease up my face, put you in your place
 (She's gonna get ghetto up in here)
I didn't wanna scrap, poppin' all that when ya gotta fall back now
 (She's gonna get ghetto up in here)

Tryin' to be a lady but you keep pushin' me, it's gonna get pretty
 (She's gonna get ghetto up in here)
Leave me alone and go on by the way 'stop blowing up his cellphone'

When you had him, you mistreated him
Now I found him and I'm feedin' him
And he's happy, there's no drama
So you can save those high notes for the opera

'Cause I ain't givin' him up, I'm lovin' him up
Me and him every night, drinkin' from the same cup
They say you don't know a good thing 'til it's gone
And now he landed in my arms

She be like, one Mississippi two Mississippi stop
