The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is!
The good book says "go seek and ye shall find"
Well, I have sought and my what a climb it is!
My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;
In emotion, like the ocean it's either sink or swim
