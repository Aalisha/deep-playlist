You would give it all up in an instant
I bet you'd torch your house with your own hands
You'd let me break your back so you could lie in it
And never get up, never get up from it

You're back into that smack do you know you act
Just like a whore beggin' for crack or a sack
You think you revolutionize with every breath you take
You bring me down

Does anybody know, who the fuck you are?
Does anybody care, how the fuck you are?

You're wasted now and you're gettin' on down with the disco
You're wasted now and you think you want to leave but you don't go
You're wasted now and your pants have been soiled but you disco
