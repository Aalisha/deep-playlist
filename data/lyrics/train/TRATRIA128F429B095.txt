Choking on lies,
Making the best of a bad conversation
Your eyes dried as I tried sleeping in your bed
To fake another smile and take with me what was mine
While racing to you forever

We're waking up and It's 6: 00 o' clock
Did you ever think things could be the same
If we happened to wake up late

[Chorus x2]
