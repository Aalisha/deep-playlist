unks:
'Moving out to you, now'
'Ah, I don't hear it'
'Hold it right there'
'I'm holding'

Spoken:

Say, man!
Don't walk ahead of that woman
Like she don't belong to you
Just 'cause her got them little skinny legs
You know that ain't no way to do.

You didn't act like that when ya had it home
behind closed do's!
Alright

Now, you act like you ashamed of the woman
Don't even want nobody to know she's yo's
But that's, alright
You just walk on, baby!
(hup, hup)
H'uh!
And don't you worry about a doggone thing, a'tol
(hup, hup)
Because there's some man, somewhere
who'll take you
Baby, skinny legs and all

'I swear!'
Keep on walkin', baby
(Hup, hup)
Show ya what I'm talkin' about

Listen to this:

Now, who'll take the woman with the skinny legs?
(Try, Leroy)
