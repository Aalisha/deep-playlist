Old Mule by Arthur Smith (Spoken)

Old mule, you're the son of a donkey 
And I'm in the image of God 
Yet, here we work, hitched together
Toilin' and tillin' the sod
I wonder if you work for me 
Or I work for you, old mule 
At times I think it's a partnership 
Between a mule and a doggone fool.

When plowin', we go the same distance
But I work harder than you
You skim the ground on four good legs
And I hobble along on two
So, mule, mathematically speakin'
You're four legs 'gainst my two
I do twice the work per leg
I do twice as much as you.
