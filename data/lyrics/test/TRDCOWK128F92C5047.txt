So wild, standing there, with her hands in her hair
I can't help remember just where she touched me
There's still no face here in her place
So cool, she was like jazz on a summer's day
Music, high and sweet, then she just flew away
Now she can't be that warm with the wind in her arms

Valerie, call on me
Call on me, Valerie
Come and see me
I'm the same boy I used to be
