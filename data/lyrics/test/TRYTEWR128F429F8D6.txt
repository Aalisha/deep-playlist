1, 2, 3, 4

Look at you man, look at the band
Look at the day, don't throw it away
I need a pill and a coffe re-fill
And everything is gonna be alright
I swear

Look at your cat and your eighty square flat
Look at your view over Stockholm's Zoo
Maybe I'm wrong but maybe I'm right
'Cause I guess I'm born black and white

You know you could be a rock n' roll star
No matter who you are
It's all the same 'cause you're a real dead end

That's what you are
Believe I'm gonna have myself a ball
And I don't care if you don't like
How I act when I'm on top of your wife
