I know that my love for you is real
It's somethin' true
That we do
Just somethin' natural
That I feel
When you walk in the room
When you're near
I feel my heart skip a beat
The whole world disappears
And there's just you and me
Falling head over feet
Let's take a chance, together
()
I know, I know, I know, I know
we gonna make it
'Cause no one else can
make me feel the way that you do
I promise you
I know, I know, I know, I know
we gonna get there
Today, tomorrow
And forever we will stay true
...
