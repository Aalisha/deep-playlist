Now you know I know, head in a hole
By saying nothin’ you take control.
Passive aggressive, a daily routine,
now you pollute, even my dreams

You’ve got some nerve (you’ve got some nerve)
to stand and say (to stand and say)
oh, it’s all (all) just (just) fine.
you’ve got some nerve (you’ve got some nerve)
to stand and say (to stand and say)
why you havin’ (havin) a good (a good) time?

I don’t wanna be yours no more
Not yours no more
Don’t wanna be this where I just exist
Can I have a little bit
I don’t wanna be yours no more
Not yours no more
Don’t wanna be this where I just exist
Can I have a little bit more

Well you know I know who stole my soul,
