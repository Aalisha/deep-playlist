Bang bang
You shot me to the ground
Bang bang
At the speed of sound
I'm dead for poison in my ears
My head can't stand your frequency
Only you can bring me back
You can save me with your sound

I'm reborn as a discotheque
When you spin the record round and round
I'm reborn as a discotheque
Because you saved me with a sound
You bring me back to life

Bang bang
