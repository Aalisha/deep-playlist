I'll find peace within my life 
Without the need to judge my friends 
Before you start your critical preaching 
Remember every carnivore's a potential vegan
True friends are hard enough to find
Without adding to the constraints what's in their diet
And you try to steal away
Their inherent right to choose

If all you do is divide and conquer
Curl up and die, the scene doesn't want you
I will live my life my own way
Whilst you crawl away, stagnate
...
