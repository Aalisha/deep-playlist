I heard the sound of voices in the night,
Spell bound there was someone calling,
I looked around no one was in sight
Pulled down and I kept on falling
I've seen this place before
And you were standing by my side
I've seen your face before tonight
Maybe I just see what I wanted to be
I know it's a mystery
Do you remember me
On a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams

There you stood a distant memory
So good like we never parted
Said to myself I knew you'd set me free
And here we are right back where we started
Something's come over me
...
