I won't dance, don't ask me!
I won't dance, don't ask me!
I won't dance, monsieur, with you...
My heart won't let me feet do things that they should do

You know what, you're handsome!
You know what, too handsome!
Oh but what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

When you dance, you're charming and you're gentle
...
