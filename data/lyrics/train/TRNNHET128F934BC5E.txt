Amidst a swirling din of smoke and
Screaming on the battlefield
Born reared on the teat of my dead mother war
Hardened to stone through abuse mocked beaten and scorned
A bayonet severed umbilical cord

The wind sings its sweet lullaby through
A blackened and hollowed ribcage
I'm to die in battle divine with the flames as my grave

This realm of inhuman carnage
Where the blood eternally rains
To my brothers who've fallen before me
I will walk with you again
...
