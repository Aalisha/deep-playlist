Your only try at love was through before it began
So now you're frightened of the thought of losing again
Would I be true to you girl? If there's any doubt
Just ask me anything your mind is wondering about

Could I chase the bitter taste
Left in your heart by someone who said goodbye?
Could I love? Give me love
I'm down on my knees, beggin' you please, could I?
