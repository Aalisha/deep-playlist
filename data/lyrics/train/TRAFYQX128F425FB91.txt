She comes strolling down the street
Every time she passes by
My head spins when our eyes meet
Every time she passes by

Her perfume fills my head
Every time she passes by
I hang on every word she says
Every time she passes by

This ain't infatuation, mere idle fascination
My love gets stronger
Every time every time she passes by
...
