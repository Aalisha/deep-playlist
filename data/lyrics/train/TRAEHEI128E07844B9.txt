'Never love anyone else'
Is promise you made me yourself.
There's a box with his ring on the shelf,
And it's tarnished.
The burden of liars and thieves
Is the baggage that you brought overseas.
No matter if you beg and you plead
This is over.

Whoa
That's just the way it would go.
No matter how the dice didn't roll,
You'll never be alone.

A promise, a vow, a commitment.
The bottle won't help you forget this,
And I'm swearing with God as my witness,
This is sorry.
