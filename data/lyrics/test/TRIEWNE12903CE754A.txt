I've been disowned, yes i was alone
But i tell you now baby that's cool
I have reached the point, where there is do or don't
And I know you have been there too
Get ready, get ready, get ready to go
I have learned a million times
That a race ain't run until the racing been done
I'm victourious you better face down
Mine, mine, mine, mine
I have learned a million times
That a race ain't run until the racing been done
I'm victourious you better face down
Mine, mine, mine
The victory is mine
There ain't nobody, there ain't nobody,
There ain't nobody like me
