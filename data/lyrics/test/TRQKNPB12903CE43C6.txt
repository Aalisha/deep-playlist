The sun rose on the understay
With a click of a switch
The sub canopy roared when the
Business sign read open in neon lights

Climbing vines up desk, stools, pygmies and bats
Timecards and paychecks
The apes howl when you push the buttons in their stomachs

Hands play cymbals after a wind of a gear
The beetles and the birds
Are all pollinating flowers
Grown in the gardens of mansions

I am the primate that swings
From the man made apparatus
I am the vines that grow underneath
Florescent lights from carpeted floors

I am the primate that swings
From the man made apparatus
I am the vines that grow underneath
Florescent lights from carpeted floors

Let me climb these painted walls
