I could talk to you for days
You make me laugh one thousand ways
And I realize, you fill me up
Like hot water in my teacup

I'm enchanted by your smile
I must admit it took a while
For me to see that this was somethin'
More than he's my friend, its nothin'

I hope to God you feel the way I feel
'Cause this could be amazing
Something so super real

There's something about you
And you don't even know it
I'm telling you now
That you got me good

There's something about you
And I can't help but show it
Damn right
You got me good

Now I'm not alone
With you I'm whole
I gotta let you know
You got me good
