Don't go away.
And leave me here alone.
I wish there was something I could say.
To make you turn around.
And come back home.
Why can't you stay, why can't you.
I can't stay awake.
Cause you know I'm thinking.
Always thinking of you.
I can't fall asleep.
Cause you know I'm dreaming.
Always dreaming of you.
Give me one more day.
So you don't ruin my year.
