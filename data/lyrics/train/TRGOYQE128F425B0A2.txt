(Donnie Van Zant/Johnny Van Zant/Tony Mullins/Craig Wiseman)

Set it up, tear it down
Another show to go, another time
Another place, another face
Another crowd of people, tank of diesel

Flying J truck stop
35 guys, a rolling jukebox
Gotta rock, can't stop
Gonna keep on pushin' through the Rockies
Nothing's gonna stop me

Feelin' like a train
Pullin' at the strain
Always got an uphill track
With the world on my back
Pourin' on the coal
Feel a little old
Gotta suck it up
Gotta be strong
Gotta be tough
