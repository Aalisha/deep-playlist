Sherry was a waitress at the only joint in town
She had a reputation as a girl who'd been around
Down Main Street after midnight, a brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hangin' from her lips, a beer between her legs

The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

Sonny was a loner older than the rest
He was going in the navy but he couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town--He sold a little pot
The law caught wind of Sonny and one day he got caught
But he was back in business when they set him free again
The road goes on forever and the party never ends.

Sonny's playin' eight-ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunken out-a-towner put his hand up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue--Laid the drunk out on the floor
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar and walked on out the door
She's runnin' right behind him, reachin' for his hand
