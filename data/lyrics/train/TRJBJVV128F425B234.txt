I swear I tried again
You're never visible on the weekdays
When I need you to
Do what you can't afford to do
You better watch your tone
You're not invincible
You know I'll do what I have to do
To stop the sound coming from you
Cause the truth is
You're probably not as bad
As I make you out to be
To the boys and the girls
That will listen closely know
I'm the one that is sorry
You can write the coolest songs
