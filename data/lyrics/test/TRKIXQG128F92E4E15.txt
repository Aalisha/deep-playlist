Father watch me fall
Witness my mistakes
I have lost it all
I'm about to break

Before the sound of dawn
I turned my back on you
The life in me was gone
My consciousness withdrew

Fear... Tormenting me
Guilt... Won't let me be

I chose a different way
But there's nowhere I could hide
From one end of the world
To the other side
