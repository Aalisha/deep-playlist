I'll take you where you want to go
under the city beneath it's tow
how much d'you think you're gonna see
start to believe in. trusting is free

don't get lost in the rain no more
treading your imprint close to the door

it's only lonely when you don't know how far
making it different asking for more

no place for where it used to be
looking for comfort in all the wrong places

and this wall is slowly coming down
...
