One!
Two!
One, Two, Three, Four!

Woman come home
Please, please, woman come home.

Got something for you
Gonna make you jump and shout
I got something for you here
Tell you what it's all about.

Woman get home
Come on woman, get home to me
Woman get home, woman get home
Woman get home with me right now.

Get you a ticket
The bus, the train, the airplane, the boat
Gotta row across the water
Just woman get home.

Ah woman get home to me
