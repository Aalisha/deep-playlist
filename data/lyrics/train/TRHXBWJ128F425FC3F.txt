Leant down in a daze
Pictures in my face
Reflections deep inside me
Send shivers down my spine, to guide me

A woman, not alone
Blushingly stripped to the bone
Now I see, I never knew
She always looked askew

All this seems to be delusion
It must have been an odd illusion
All this feeds my inner urge to go

I know, it's growing deep inside me
This show, the mindless thrall
I know, your grinning might misguide me
...
