I am a manatee
I live in the sea
I sneak up at night
Pretty baby, just to love you right

You're friend's gonna put me down
'Cause I'm fat, slimy, and brown
They'll never know how you sigh
When you feel my flipper movin' up your thigh

I am a manatee
M-A-N-A-T-E-E
I am a manatee
M-A-N-A-T-E-E
Stand by your manatee

Don't you act like a stranger
Even though I am endangered
Your lady's gonna flip
With a kiss from my prehensile lip
...
