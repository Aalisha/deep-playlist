You haven't read my story book
It's about our better days
Photographs and quotes from you
A beautiful portrait
Telephone don't make a sound
Did you forget my number?
It's days like this I need you most
But it's over now
It's over now
Though everybody knows
But that's the way things go
It's over now
It's over now
