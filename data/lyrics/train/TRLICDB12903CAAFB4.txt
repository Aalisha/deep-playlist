And in a state of deep decay
Your flesh it rots away
But I still can't accept that you have died
I know that I should bury you
Can't bear to let you go
'Cause I haven't got the strength to say "Goodbye"

As I lay beside you, your body oh so still
Believe me love, I could never do you ill
I just want to hold you, put your hands upon my flesh
Your fingers so cold, the uncertain feel of death

Only you and I know what goes on behind closed doors
And now I can do things to you I never could before
Be still my love, as in your arms I lie
...
