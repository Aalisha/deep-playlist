Why does the sun go oin shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't know it's the end of the world
'cos you don't love me anymore?

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was.
