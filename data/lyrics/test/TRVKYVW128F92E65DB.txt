OK, I can see you held it down and learnt patience,
Cause some reasons are without their explanations, 
This is my song so let me explain the situation, 
But wont air your business out girl, cause that’s a bait ting, 
I seen you at the station like its work your going, 
Money have fe mek so just keep doing what you’re doing, 
It’s crazy cause together we could have made g’s,
Cause I did and truthfully you bright like me,
The only real difference is you slyer than me, 
Your need for attention makes you attract the beef, 
Ironically I use to say you were a bad cow, 
You a funny little girl with a funny little style,
I know you heard the truth I know you read between the lines,
I might circle the truth but I will not tell a lie, 
I remember the time I came your yard with a knife,
I don’t wanna tek life but I would of tek life, 
But im bigger than that now I can walk from a row, 
My days on road has shown me life is like gold,
And plus this world is big enough for us both, 
I know you was down I also know that you coped,
I hope that mean you learnt to slow your roll, 
And keep your mouth closed,
A proper attitude is better than fancy close,
