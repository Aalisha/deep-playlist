Summer's coming too fast,
Winter's been here too long
If we keep wasting our days,
Pretty soon they'll be gone

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been out here all night,
I've been out here all day
With my eyes open wide
Hoping that you will say
Everything is all right
We can be happy too
If you look out for me
The way I looked out for you

People take what they need
