Don't give me an inch
Cuz I'll take it all now
Another style for you to hate
I sat up today, my style in the straight
And if you care to relate

No, you can't copy me
Cuz I been changed
Stay in your lane
Remain with the straight
Don't you cross that line
You goin' out of your mind
I got that grind so don't you hate

[1] - You can judge me wrong
Don't leave home without my game face on
Got it goin' on
