Yeh! [London] 
Its me, Eski-Boy 
Bow E3, all day long, hol tight Maniac 
You know we do this 
Oh my days, certain man tryna say like... 
I dont rep E3, I'm not E3 
Are you crazy, I've been doing this 
I went to Bow boys, I've been doing this for so long 
Like... Its amazing how you can say that. 
Listen... 
My names Wiley, I come from 'Bow E3' 
07961897033, I'm so E3 
The whole of E3's got so much talent, I hope you see 
I know E3 so well, If you ask me Wiley speaks for the whole of E3 
You cant say that, Scorcher wont make nobody bow to his foot, I aint Wolf Pack 
Boy Better Know E3, wont just let another donut MC disrespect E3 
I'm always tryna rep ends but certain friends on end they dont know E3 
'Coz when its reppin' time, I show E3 
We made the genre everybody's on but, its all come from Bow E3 
Its Wiley aka Eski-Boy I'm from Bow E3 
*Wiley talking* 
You get me... Thats why, 
and certain man are tryna say like Eski dont represet E3, 
I've been doing this for so long...
