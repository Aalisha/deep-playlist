CHORUS:
I gave you fair warning, beware... beware... beware... (2x)
--Mobb Deep sample--

Yo... what you thought punk, shit was sweet, now you can't sleep
Gotta keep ya eyes open wide and hide ya face from the streets
I'm like the beast with a warrant, far from alarmin'
Gave you fair warnin' now you on the stairs swallin'
I'm callin' out any rapper that I doubt, smack 'em in the mouth
Throw 'em in the yoke, BOOM!, then I knock 'em out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files 20-shot auto glock, BLAAOW!
Benny blind Puerto Rock style
Wit' a twist of black in the brow, twist ya cap and I'm out
Sleep wit' the fish-dips for yappin' too loud
What's happenin' now? Niggaz is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Pickin' on the smallest victim gives 'em heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down the hardest regardless
Besides of the largest, we polish the floor
with the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory you niggaz can't do shit to me
Physically lyrically hypothetically realistically
...
