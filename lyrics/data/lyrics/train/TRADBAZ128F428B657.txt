I know you met someone last night
See it in your eyes
You said "we only talked, alright?"
Now that's a big lie

And I know it's all over now
I guess we lost our love somehow
The moment you left through that door
I know you'll never come back here no more

You came and took your things today
Gave me your ring back
I never thought it'd end this way
Fell in your lovetrap
