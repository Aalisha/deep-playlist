Maybe tomorrow I'll leave this day
Behind
And maybe then
I'll sing a new song
For you

And we'll mull over coffee
And the movie we just saw
While you go on about your job
I'll criticize the songs they play 
On the radio

And the rain will fall my way
And I can tell you all about
What I did today
And the wind will have blown my way
...
