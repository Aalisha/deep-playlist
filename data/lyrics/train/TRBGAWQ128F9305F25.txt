And for all You've done and yet to do
With every breath I'm praising You
Desire of nations and every heart
You alone are God, You alone are God

You are the Lord, the famous one, famous one
Great is Your name in all the earth
The heavens declare You're glorious, glorious
Great is Your fame beyond the earth

The morning star is shining through
