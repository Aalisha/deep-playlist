Well how's your view of things today?
Got up young to fade away
The sinners sin but aren't aware
Our fables take us everywhere
I can't keep up with you
I can't keep up

I can't compete with history
We'll film it live but dub our tale
The mystery must stay inside
Look at our homes, look at our lives
In control of the morning
In control of the sea

You are creating all the bubbles at night
I'm chasing round trying to pop them all the time
We don't need to trust a single word they say
...
