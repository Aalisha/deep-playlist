It took 8 years just to realize
No one looks when we say goodbye
Dying just to survive
It feels like the first time
All the things that you set aside
All the friends that you leave behind
Just so the curtain will rise and it feels like the first time
Take this heart it's ticking like a cheap clock

I need you to believe in me until there's nothing left of us
I need you to believe in me
Oh my god
