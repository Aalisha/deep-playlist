{We gonna do something a little different for y'all on this song
Because me and my mama was watching the news
The other day and we saw a lot of thangs that's goin' on in the world
And mama just happen to just come up with some lyrics to a song}

{She said "I want y'all to sing this song for me on this CD
'Cause y'all never sang a song for me before"
And ah, this was written by mama
And this is what mama told me to tell y'all, she said}

We all need that kind of love that special love, love from above
We all need that kind of love that special love, love from above
