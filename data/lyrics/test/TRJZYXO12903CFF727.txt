I'm under fire, blood red sky
Underneath the war machine
Fight for what's right don't ask why
Just make the sacrifice
Please, make the sacrifice

Desensitized but my eyes
Still recognize the pain
Through stark and real fight or die
Retreat has no place in this game

In the dark and under fire
Believing our cause was justified
Caught in the cross hair's condition dire
Trying a case of do or die

In the blink of an eye
I took someone's life
It's no wonder why
...
