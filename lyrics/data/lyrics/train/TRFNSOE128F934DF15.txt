They say that you're a runaround lover
Though you say it isn't so
But if you put me down for another
I'll know, believe me, I'll know

And a thousand eyes can't help but see if you are true to me
So remember when you tell those little white lies
That the night has a thousand eyes

You say that you're at home when you phone me
