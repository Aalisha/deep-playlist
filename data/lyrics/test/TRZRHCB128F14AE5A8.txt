You might see me stumble, you might see me fall
You might see me cornered with my back against the wall
I may be incognito, maybe out to lunch
Maybe caught red-handed or maybe just a hunch

But I'm clean, clean, clean, clean, clean before my Lord
Clean, clean, clean, clean, clean before my Lord
Like a spotless lamb, I'm blameless in His sight
With no trace of wrong, left to right
I'm clean, clean, clean

Kneeling in the closet, begging daily bread
...
