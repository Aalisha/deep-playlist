And if I drown in this sea of devotion
Just a stone left unturned
My need is deep wide endless oceans
Feel it furious the fire burns on

Let there be love, everlasting
And it will live eternally
Will we receive without ever asking?
I'm just curious

Got to find me somebody
But there's nobody to love me
And it's driving me crazy
There's nobody to love me

Somebody tell me
How could there be nobody, nobody to love me
And this life is so empty
There's nobody to love me

Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more
Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more

Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more
Endless tears, forever joy
To feel most every feeling, forever more
