You told me you loved me
So I don't understand
Why promises are snapped in two
And words are made to bend
(The bigger, the better)
Some stolen from Japan
Collected from around the world
They'll catch you if they can

Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah
Lies lies lies yeah

Do I have to catch you out
To know what's on your mind
