Got plans? Not going anywhere for awhile?
Or maybe your just waiting on that one brother who cant get right,
but can bang that back out all night.
And you just wanna let him know what the capital of Thailand is baby,
Bangkok, Bangkok.

(Kutt)
Come on and ride with me one time and get a dose of this breeze,
the top down in this kansas sun, I
know your attracted to my street persona, a dime piece,
but I wouldnt let you meet my mama,
cause you nasty and clashed with classy at the same time,
knew what would happen if I made my approach to meet you,
buckle up (?) home girl can deep throat a diesel. God dwamnnnnn
