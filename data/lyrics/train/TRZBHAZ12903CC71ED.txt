I wouldn't touch you with someone else's dick.
Don't worry bitch, you don't have anything I haven't seen before.
I am the last of a dying breed.
I already told you what your name means, and if you call me "Vince" one more time I'm going to rip your fucking head off.
It's nothing more than a failure to listen, but it's a giant sign of disrespect.
Nothing more than a failure to listen, but a giant sign of disrespect.
If you really want to know something you'll look it up.
