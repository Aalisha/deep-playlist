How long? How long?
How long? How long?
How long? How long?
How long? How long?

Kiss your mother now
I think you should
Kick you while your down
You knew I would
So I'm wearing thin
Same old trip again
Face down, Heroin
Same old trip again

I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
I said how long (How long?)
Until you crack

Drag your sister down
