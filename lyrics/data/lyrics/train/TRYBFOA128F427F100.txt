From way far across the sea
Came an Eritrean maiden she
Had a one track mind and eyes funny
Half blinded in a war

With a pale young Anglican
Who said he'd help her all he can
Showed her Jesus and his little unholy friend
She had no notion to please him
Just say ta ra and leave him behind

A little boy in a stairwell who says
"I hate people like you"
I got match sticks and cable TV
Half of less than fifty p
We all clambered over the balcony
Bangin' on the window waking Steve
Bringing with a true love his unholy friend
Singin',"If you really need it
You just won't leave it behind"

So baby please kill me
