When will you come clean,
Clean and lean and mean.
When will you come clean,
Clean and lean and mean.
When will you come clean,
Clean and lean and mean.
When will you come clean,
Clean and lean and mean.

Come so far I can't go back,
Come so far I can't go back,
Come so far I can't go back,
Come so far.
