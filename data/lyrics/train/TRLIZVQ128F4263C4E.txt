When I was a baby girl, mama put in me
You can be anything that you wanna be
Now, that I'm older and I'm much bolder
A time or two love has walked out on me

I don't know why, guess it was the wrong guy
And he didn't fit into my destiny
But that's alright and that's okay
'Cause I got someone who will love me anyway

Strong man, got me a strong man
Real man, got me a real man
Good man, got me a good man
He's my man, glad that he's my man
So, listen while I talk about it
