Don't look back
the time has come
all the pain turns into love

we're not submissive, we're not aggressive
but they think we can't defend

stand up, join us, modern crusaders alive
we have the power to face the future
cause we are the fighters
just fighting for our rights

they're accusing, like always without knowing
what is just fiction or what is the truth
they have no mission, they have no passion
but they dare to tell us what's bad and what's good!
