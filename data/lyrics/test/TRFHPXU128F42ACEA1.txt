Now everybody from the 313
Put your mothefucking hands and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your mothefucking hands up
Look Look

Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not had his hands up
This free world got you gased up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac, 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
You're pac, he's pac, no pacs, none
