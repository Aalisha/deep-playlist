Oh your body body; Ooh your body body
Oh your body body Yeah Yeah
Ooh your body body; oh your body body
Girl I want you, come on

Come on
I need you bad as old folks needs soft shoes
Come on
I'm drunk off your body like I had to much Absolute, come on
Come on
Girl I make you scream like a scary movie on
Come on
I'm talking to your body cause your mind trying to be strong

Let me reason with your body
Let me talk with your body
Have a meeting with your body
Cause your mind may not understand what your body needs

Let me reason with your body
Let me talk with your body
Have a meeting with your body
