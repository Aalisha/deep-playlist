Greed's all gone now
There's no question
And I can see you push your hair behind your ears
Regain your balance

Doesn't matter where she is tonight
Or with whoever she spends her time
If these arms were meant to hold her
They were never meant to hold her so tight

For the love of that girl

Greed's all gone now
The panic subsides
When I could run, pulling arms to love her
Try to put myself on on the inside

For the love of that girl
...
