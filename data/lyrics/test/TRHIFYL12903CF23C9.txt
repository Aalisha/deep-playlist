(Dolving talks)
"Come a little bit closer.
So I can see what you taste like.
A pale face. A vision of suicide.
Dead ends and a St.Jude figurine.

Bury me in a shallow grave.
So the dogs can dig me out.
If I die tonight, well that suits me fine.
'Cause I'd be better off covered in lye."

(Chorus:)
This one is abysmal.
This is a oneway ticket down.
