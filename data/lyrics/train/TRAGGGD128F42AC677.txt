Yes, I wanna see my baby - rock me on a steady roll
Yes, I wanna see my baby - rock me on a steady roll
Don't you know my baby - he's gonna save my soul

I'm at home with my mama, but my baby's on my mind
I'm at home with my mama, but my baby's on my mind
I don't understand my baby, why he treat's me so unkind
