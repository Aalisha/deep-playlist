(3LW intro)
I'm getting little tired of your broken promises promises
lookin at your pager seeing different numbers(fade out)

(Nas)
Everyday she walk by
See me on the same block
Same crew, like she never seen rocks
Chains, watch, rims blue
Different color boots on, park Yukon
You predicates ex-cons, rip arms, bettin' chips
Puff medicine play my gangsta beats
Tunnel bangers, Flex, Clue tapes bang in the streets
I'm just a fly, thuggish baller shorty anxious to meet
Till I die keep wanting to head mink to the feet
But shorty jail bait, might get me five to life
Maybe in time you can be Nas's wife
Place school, study law
I'mma pay your tuition
Come on campus, buy you books
Do your babysitting
My unusual style make your future unwild
When you get older I'mma bless you with a child
See now you was unaware that this thug had affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection

(3LW)
It's either you will
Either you won't
Sometimes you do
Sometimes you don't
Sometimes it's yes
Other times it's no
But I can't take it no more
Take your wrong and make it right
Just say you can make up your mind
Is it serious or isn't it?
Cause I can't take it no more
