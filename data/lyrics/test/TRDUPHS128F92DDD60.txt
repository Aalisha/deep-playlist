I miss you so much boy
will we be coming on again
don't ever loose your ropes
this man is hanging by the ends
I owe you so much time
yes you might say it isn't like that at all
but now it's coming back to you
these open moments that I blew

rocket brothers crack and burst
if they can't meet upon the verge
of breaking into seperate parts
that was not written in our cards
...
