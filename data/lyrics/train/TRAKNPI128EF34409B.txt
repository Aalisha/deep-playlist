Choose me, baby, don't lose me
Choose me, baby, don't lose me
Choose me, baby, don't lose me
Choose me, baby, don't lose me

This time I can see it through
'Cause my heart is longin' to
If you could take the time to see what you do to me
Not knowin' inside if you really care for me

Now when I'm layin' in the ghetto
Come and rescue me
When I'm down and out
Come and rescue me

When I'm layin' in the ghetto
Come and rescue me
Will you be around?
Come and rescue me

Choose me, baby, don't lose me
Choose me, baby, don't lose me
Choose me, baby, don't lose me
Choose me, baby, don't lose me

There's no doubt in my love
All the things will come in time
Now don't you worry, my dear
There are plenty of fish in the sea
Knockin' at my door, tryin' to set me free
...
