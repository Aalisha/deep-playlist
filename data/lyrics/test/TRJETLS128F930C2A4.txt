The gates of hell are opened wide
Legions of death are rushing through
Those are leaded by satans might
Invincible messengers of black death

SatanÂ´s servents millions of rats
Are invading the land like a storm
They are so fast, they show no mercy
A lesson in total warfare

Rotting fingers ...
...
...
...

Nobody is safe from the sentence of death
No one's defending his life
Cause when the army of death will arise
The final curtain falls!
