Some kids have and some kids don't
And some of us are wondering why
And Mom won't watch the news at night
There's too much stuff thats making her cry

Chorus
We need some help
Down here on Earth
A thousand prayers
A million words
But one voice was heard

A house a yard a neighborhood
Where you can ride your new bike to school
A kinda world where mom and dad
Still believe the golden rule
