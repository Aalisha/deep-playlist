Heart of mine, Sewing Frenzies of steel to the sky
By night, A child in a harvest of virginal mines
Mother say a prayer for your soldier blue
I'm doing it all for you
It's the chill of the night
That threatens me. It makes me wish that I was back with you
And Meanwhile home It strokes it's foster child
We leave our home and run to save our lives

Where you gonna hide at midnight
Are you gonna ask the moonlight
Where you gonna hide at midnight
Living on the edge of my nerves
