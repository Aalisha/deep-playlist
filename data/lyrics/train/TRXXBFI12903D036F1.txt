Paint
Me in your own way
Color my eyes
See what feelings I hide

No-one knows why
No one can forgive
Second thought
Why do I care?

I'll hide from subtleties while
I try to face my kind
And you call this feeling
It's not enough
Come again another day
Now that my world feels at least
I'll follow you home

Wake me with a bottle 'cross the head
I'll sleep 'til it's over and I'm sober again

Safe
