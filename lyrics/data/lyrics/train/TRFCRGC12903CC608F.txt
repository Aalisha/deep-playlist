Been one tough week, dead on my feet
But, I've made plans for tonight
When I'm feeling blue, know just what to do
And how to make it right
Seems like I've needed this forever
Gonna have myself a night to remember

Dim the lights, lock the door, spread your pictures
On the floor, throw the dust off of our past let it
All come floodin' back, cause' it ain't easy being
...
