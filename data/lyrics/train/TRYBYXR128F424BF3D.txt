I kiss her goodbye every morning
and I'm back home at 5 everyday
everybody thinks we're the neighbood example
and you know I wouldn't have it any onther way

I take the kids to church every sunday
I try so hard to teach them what life is about
they think mommy and daddy is something special
and it would brake their lil hearts if they ever found out
if thay ever found out

We'er just one big unhappy family
and we're too proud to let our feelings show
That we'er one big unhappy family
and we can't afford to let any one know
