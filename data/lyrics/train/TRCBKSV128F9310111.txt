[Verse 1]
Yo yo, I hate those filthy fuckin' monkeys
And the features that they share with simians
Disgusting junkies, welfare recipients
They livin' off of someone's money who pays tax and has a life
While these black bitches stomachs stay fat with parasites
And they have to have a pipe to relax on average nights
So their bastard bratty tykes all act like savage types
It's the legacy of black and Spanish guys
Beg when? tea and genoas? complacency of dads who have no wives
Police should beat their fuckin' skulls in with magnum lights
Illegitimate illiterate black should have no rights
Cuz they go from having lives to having life
And I pay to feed their appetites and give them TV's with satellite
Those steven-stealing dirty fuckin' heathens dealing dope need to steal a boat
And sail their monkey asses back to Africa
And seal the coast with giant gates made of steel and bolts
So we can try and save the decent white god-fearing folk

[Chorus]
And I got strangers moving in in my own backyard
Hometown battlefield, times is hard
Crime is risin', on my horizon
And it's getting mighty hard for folks to find a job
A lot of folks say that the times is changing
But the more things change, the more they stay the same
And I don't know where I'm gonna go, I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Don't hand me your ethics, just credit this as rude hard speech
