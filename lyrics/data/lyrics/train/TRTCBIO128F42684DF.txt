In the dawn an angel was dancing
Surrounded by an aura of light
But in the shadows something was watching
and with patience awaiting the night
Angel whispers: "mournful night, attractive night,
your dark beauty obsesses me."
An angel bewitched by the shadows
Seduced by the whispering lies

Chorus:
A spell was cast and the sky turned red
The angel's heart froze to ice
The blackness that falls is coming to stay
Under the snow lies angels so cold

Dusk has passed and a cold morning breeze
is sweeping all over the plain
