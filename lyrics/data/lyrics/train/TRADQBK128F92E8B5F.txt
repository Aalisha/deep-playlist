We've got our feet on the wire, talking 'bout flying
Maybe we're diving in over our heads
Scared of what I'm feeling
Staring at the ceiling here tonight

Come on lay down these arms, all our best defenses
We're taking our chances here on the run
The fear is an anchor, time is a stranger
Love isn't borrowed, we aren't promised tomorrow

We'll never be ready if we keep waiting
For the perfect time to come
Won't be steady, we'll never be ready

Where we don't know, though we can't see
Just walk on down this road with me
...
