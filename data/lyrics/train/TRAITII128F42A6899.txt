Oh, and yet, I've, been cleansed...

And yet I've been cleansed with the water
A purity no mind can grasp
A purity so cool upon my fingertips

The vision that I have seen; this is the action that spawns from the end.
For the longest time, I've been watching (I've been watching) the world breathe again

What lies here
What lies here
...
