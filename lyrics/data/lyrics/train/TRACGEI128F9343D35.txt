Well here's a love song but I don't care
No I don't care 'bout it
Cause I don't fall for it yeah
No I don't fall for it

Well I'm so tired but I don't understand
Cause I slept twelve hours last night
I can't keep my eyes open, yeah
I can't get things right

Well if you want me maybe let me know
Cause I'm so done with feeling low
And If you want me maybe let me go
Cause I can't take this torture no more

la la la la la la la la la la
Forget about it
Don't kid yourself, no
la la la la la la la la la la
Forget about it
la la la la la la lo
