They say we can't make it through
too young; don't know what to do.
This life is much too hard for you and me.
They say we're living in our dreams
black, white, and nothing in between.
This world is never as it seems to be.
But they don't want this
and they don't feel this
but this was never theirs at all!

So here I stand.
I'm ready for anything.
Just a man, but I'm giving everything.
