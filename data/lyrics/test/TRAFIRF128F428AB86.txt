And with the length of her mind she darked the sun
It was not so long ago, maybe just a year or so
When I was lonely and went lookin' for someone
Went down south to New Orleans, still just searchin' for my dreams
That's where I saw her, that's how it all begun

It was there on that night, sad for me I know I'm right
