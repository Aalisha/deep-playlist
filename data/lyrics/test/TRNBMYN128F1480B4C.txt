I've tried to tell you that I love you
So many times before
You never let me be a part of you life
If you only knew

I've tried so hard to be someone that you want
But now I'm through
Did you forget about all the times that we had
Where did they go

Is anyone in there
Does this make any sense
It's so useless
Trying to get your attention

So this is it what else can I do
