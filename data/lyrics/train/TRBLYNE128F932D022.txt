It's been so long since you've gone away
And I know things will never be the same
I break it all down so it will show to me clear
But all the while I'm wishing you were here

In my dreams I can see and feel your face
But next to me sits an empty space
Sometimes this life doesn't make any sense to me
I need some time to heal and some space to breathe

I'm breathing you in and I'm breathing you out
I'm breathing you in and I'm breathing you out
Breathing you in and I'm breathing you out
Breathing you in, yeah
