STOP THIS CAR
Michelle Williams

Uh Huh... Yea

I see the day past me by
When I'm next to you
For the longest time
I prayed that I could ride up in yo Coup
As the wheels, they roll
Time roll so slow
Feels like I disappear
Gotcha eyes on the road
And so many things
It's just like I'm not here

I can here the music playin
Turn it to my favorite station
Wind all on my face
But that's no remedy
When your heart it seem to be breaking
Tell you and you just don't listen
Don't know how much more I can take it
Nothing to say but...

Stop this car
I don't wanna ride no more
Cause it's just too fast
And you wont pump the brakes
Slow down hear what I gotta say
Stop this car
Was our destination too far?
I wanna get out
