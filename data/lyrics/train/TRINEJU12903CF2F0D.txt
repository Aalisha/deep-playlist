Somebody tryin' to take my soul 
Nobody gotta hear my rock n' roll 

Shame, shame, Shame On You babe 
Shame, shame, Shame On You baby 

Lolita, steady as it goes 
Toot sweet, powder in her nose 

Shame, shame, Shame On You babe 
Shame, shame, Shame On You babe 

Hey Smith, old hank pank 
Pulling down your knickers 
Ah, who you gonna spank 

Shame, shame, on you baby 
...
