The book of mankind's brain
Was written for a thousand times
And must be isolated seen
Research can not sleep inside individuality
Or under neuropsychics seals

Now every storm that I breathe
And every curse I pray
Can make me see the night
And stronger every day

Shadow I am, and I ever will, and I ever will be
Shadow I am in a world, in a land of shades
...
