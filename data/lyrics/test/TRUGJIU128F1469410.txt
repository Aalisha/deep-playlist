Yeah, yeah
Where my Shaolin peoples at?
Stapleton, the craziest, y'all know what time it is
Wild wild West
Now born, Killa Hill, poor to the rich man
Jungle Nilz, let's get money y'all

It be the Scotch and Henessee that make me act like this
I'm wild hit 'em up project style never plead the fifth
Regardless, to the charges, chickenheads will be at court
Fightin' and slicin' each other to see who lies at my fort

Who woulda thought, little Shy Big Willie?
Ninety six we rollin' dutches, nine tray it was Phillies
First of the month be like Christmas to dealers
Hundred dollar seals come through the school zone area

Children at play keep the heat on the low
Little kids gettin' hit, projects flooded with po'
Now shorty's rockin', Versace and Donna Karan
Playin' the Miss Mob Queen role knowin' hon the cousin Sharon

I live the glamorous life, girl
And go from limos to Dom Perignon, rich hotels

Wild, the Shaolin Style is all in me
Child, the whole damn isle is callin' me
