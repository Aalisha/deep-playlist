She was brought into this world
Out of a beautiful mistake
When her mom was just a girl
And her daddy didn't stay

She was working at age 9
At the flower shop in town
Working not just to survive
'Cause life was throwing her around

In the rose garden
Where the rain is falling
And the thorns are sharpened
Rose garden, yeah, rose garden
...
