I can turn the grey sky blue
And I can make it rain whenever I want it to
And I can build a castle from a single grain of sand
And I can make a ship sail on dry land
But my life is incomplete and I'm so blue
'Cause I can't get next to you

I can't get next to you, babe
I can't get next to you
I can't get next to you, babe
I can't get next to you

I can fly like a bird in the sky
I can buy anything that money can buy
...
