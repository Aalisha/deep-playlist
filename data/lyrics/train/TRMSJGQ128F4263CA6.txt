Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo...

Just what you need to make you feel better
Just what you need to make you feel
Just what you need to make you feel better
Just what you need to make you feel

At the far end of your tether
And your thoughts won't fit together
So you sleep light or whatever
And the night goes on forever
Then your mind change like the weather
You're in need of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether

Doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo...

Just what you need to make you feel better
Just what you need to make you feel
Just what you need to make you feel better
...
