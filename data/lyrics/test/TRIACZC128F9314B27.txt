Take the finest wine in all the land
Pour it out on burning sand
to raise up the rarest desert rose divine
Teach the golden moon to glow
Brighter still on earth below
they will never match my gypsy valentine

Let pagan gods be given charge
over heaven's shining stars
Have them twinkle till they all fall dim and die
The oasis of her eyes
makes a mirage of the skies
They disappear in my gypsy valentine

Make all the sierens of the shore
