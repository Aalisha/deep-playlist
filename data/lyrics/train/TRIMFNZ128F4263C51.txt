Verse I

I'm Waiting At The Door
With Just A Little More Than
A Birthday Suit And A Smile Just For You.
See I Been Thinking All Day Boy
Of Brand New Ways To Say Boy
This Thing That's On My Mind
So I'll Just Take My Time And Say

Hook

So Sweet To Me Baby
It Feels Good To Me Honey
Heaven Sent My Soulmate For Sure
Love Was Never Like This Before
