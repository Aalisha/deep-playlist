Old rockin' chair's got me, my cane by my side
Fetch me that gin, son, 'fore I tan your hide
Can't get from this cabin, goin' nowhere
Just set me here grabbin' at the flies round this rockin' chair

My dear old aunt Harriet, in Heaven she be
Send me sweet chariot, for the end of the trouble I see
Old rockin' chair gets it, judgment day is here
Chained to my rockin' chair

Old rockin' chair's got me, son
(Rocking chair got you, father)
My cane by my side
(Yes, your cane by your side)
