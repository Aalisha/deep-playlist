I admit that not a lot of time had passed by
But we decided that we would be together
Everybody, they talked and had opinions, they did

And they had doubts about what we would become
But I knew you were and you knew I was the one
Over other people, no, we'd never make a fuss
'Cause it will never be about them, just us

Nobody but us, only me and him
We're the only ones that matter
They know what we've got, only me and him
So we never mind the chatter

What it is that made us feel so good about it?
What it is that made me go half crazy for?
What it is that made him give it all to me?
It's all about us, as long as we know

What it is that made us feel so good about it?
What it is that made me go half crazy for?
What it is that made him give it all to me?
It's all about us, as long as we know what it is

There were moments not always so perfect
But we know that's just the beauty of it
Go through things and then we learn from them, oh
