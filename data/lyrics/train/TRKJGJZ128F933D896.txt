Can you feel it

Can you feel it

Can you feel it

If you look around

The whole world`s coming together now

Every healthy smile

Is hunger and strife to another child

Now tell me!

Can you feel it

Can you feel it

Can you feel it

All the children of the world should be

loving each other wholeheartedly,

yes it`s alright,

take my message to your brother and tell him twice

Now tell me

Can you feel it

Can you feel it

Can you feel it

Can you feel it
