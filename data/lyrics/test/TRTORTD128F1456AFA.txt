You're working day and night just steady struggling
You think that you can make it by yourself
You feel like giving up
You feel like giving in
But you're determined to get out of this hell
You're not the only one who's ever had it hard
Somebody somewhere's feeling all your pain
Think of the lucky ones the ones who started small
They didn't win till they decided to play
Everybody wants to make it
No one wants to try now if you think that you can take it
Let me hear your battle cry
I want it I need it
So give it to me
I want a piece of the American dream
