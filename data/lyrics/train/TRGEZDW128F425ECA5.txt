I was caught up in a fever
In that summer of â€˜69
And my heart was cryin' out for change
And I knew time was comin' when I'd get away.

So I moved down to that city
Where I met a friend of mine
And I must admit he tried to warn me well
With all those bad luck stories he could tell.

He said "Take the money and run,
Take the money and run
Believe it, in this town you can't trust anyone
You're gonna learn that lesson my son".

"Take the money and run,
Buy yourself a place in the sun
Don't be a fool, don't you trust anyone
You gotta take the money and run, take the money and run".

He was broken, he was wasted
He'd been brought down to his knee
And his heart was crying out for truth
You could see the whole world's sadness in his eyes.
