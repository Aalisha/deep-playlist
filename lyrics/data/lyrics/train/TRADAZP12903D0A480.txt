Can't stand it, 
I know you planned it, 
I'ma set it straight, 
This Watergate.

Can't stand rocking when I'm up to here, 
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear.
So, while you sit back and wonder why, 
I got this fucking thorn in my side.
Oh my god, it's a mirage.
I'm telling y'all it's sabotage.

So, so, so, so listen up 'cause you can't say nothing.
