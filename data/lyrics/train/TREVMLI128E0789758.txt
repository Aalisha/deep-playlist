She talks to me
She knows that she looks okay
She needs nothing
But she wants it all tonight

She talks to me
From what I can hear
She's got no personality
She takes gentlemen like me
For a ride
Our conversation twists
Is this all there is to keep me alive?

She's turning it on, yeah
She's turning it on
It's all talk, it's all talk
She's turning it on, yeah
She's turning it on
This is out talkshow
