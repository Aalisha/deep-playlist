I got over it finally got around it
I got over it finally got around it
I got over it it's in my past at last

Well the day that I first met you

But after a while you got so dog gone wild
Lord it was a crying shame

I got over it finally got around it
I got over it finally got around it
I got over it it's in my past at last
