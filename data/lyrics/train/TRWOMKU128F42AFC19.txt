she leaves the world tonight, she greets the father and the son
upheave the world tonight the laters glisten in the sun
they rest in worlds subline, defeated objects on the run
to test the worlds divide, they'll bring illusion from a gun

they leave the world, gone! left them by,
brief encounter requiem for the son
gone left them by, it's enchanted reqiuem

as it grows clearer can i reflect on love for you? on love for you
voices in winter can i deflect my love on you? my love on you
and as we go thinner can i reflect on love for you? on love for you
voices in winter can i neglect my stones throw view? my stones throw view

and will they make the night? behind the fear surroundings lies
