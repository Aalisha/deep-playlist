I can walk on air, I can walk on fire
I'll do anything against you, baby
I give you what you need and what you desire
I make your every waken thought about me, yeah

I can be your superman lover
(Girl, girl, girl)
It's on your Monday morning blue
And two and Friday night and party

I'll take my time with you
You give me time to groove
Everything I want and more
Let's explore and I'm sure that

I can do it with my eyes closed
'Cause I know how to treat a woman
With my hands behind my back
I can keep the good loving coming
