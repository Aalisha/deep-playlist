Lyrics to Twelve Hands High:
I know you never asked for my opinion
But I'd say that horse is crazy
I know what I think doesn't matter any more
But I'd say his mind is gone
And I know you know what I know
Even though you'd rather die than say it
I know you feel the same way
Or you wouldn't be sleeping on the lawn

I heard the hooves crack the window
Saw the body come through
