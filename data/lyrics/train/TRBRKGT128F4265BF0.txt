Heaven knows I love you, girl
I've never felt this way before
Each day I love you more and more and more

People always stare at us
When we're together
'Cause we laugh and joke
And always have a ball
We're friends
And that makes us so much better
We respect each other too
I was lucky the day that I found you

Heaven knows I love you, girl
I've never felt this way before
