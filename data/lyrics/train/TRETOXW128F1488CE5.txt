Sing it for me
I can't erase the stupid things I say
You're better than me
I struggle just to find a better way

So here we are
Fighting and trying to hide the scars
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye
The lonely road
The one that I should try to walk alone
I'll be home tonight
Take a breath and softly say goodbye
