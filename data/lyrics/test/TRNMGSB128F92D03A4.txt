Three and a half when we met for the first time
A thing I can't remember but I know it anyhow
Neighbours brothers, brothers for life
Fell in love with the same girls in our hometown
Nothing could part us, not one thing
When we walked the streets of Norrk√∂ping

You were the first of us to make love 13'th of December '94
Santa Lucia what was it like
To have a girl in your boy room the whole night
I hated you and your first girlfriend
Thought I was alone in the world being a virgin
