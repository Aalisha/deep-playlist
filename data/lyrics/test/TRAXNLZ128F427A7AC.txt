The flesh is weak, the bones are brittle, the blood is thin.
I'm a father, brother, lover to all your sisters of sin.
My soul was never sold, I gave it away for free.

they were wasted anyway.

The stars are my brothers, they're calling me to shine.
Into the deep dark cold, all this emptiness is mine.
