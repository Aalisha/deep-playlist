I tied the devil to the tracks (can you hear the train coming?).
I served him papers with a seal from the governor.
The spoiler throwing voices, the vapors that they built this city on.
But he don't write much for me anymore.

When we keep hell in our hearts, we make no excuse for our genius.
So what's my excuse now that hell has abandoned me?

I enticed the devil out with a bottle, but maybe it was he who lured me out instead.
When we slept in penitent beds, we awoke in the loving arms of attrition.
So what's my excuse now that hell isn't courting me?

Give me the strength to be widowed now that the honeymoon's over.
Grant me the privileges saved for the sailors.
