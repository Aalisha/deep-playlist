Now, are you all ready?
Are you all ready?

Here we go now
Do it with the fever
yeah come on

Ain't no stopping us now
We're on the move
Hey yeah hey yeah
Ain't no stopping us now
We got the groove

Spice Girls-check it out

There are so many things that has held us down
But now it looks like things are finally coming around yeah
I now we got a long long way to go yeah
And were we'll end up, I don't know
But we wont let nothing hold us down
We gonna get ourselves together
We gonna polish up our act yeah
And if you ever have been held down before
I know that you refuse to be held down any more

Yeah yeah

(Don't you let nothing, nothing)
Nothing stand in your way
And all ago
(Watch up and listen yeah)

That's right
To everyone I say, everyone I say about it

Ain't no stopping us now
That's right
We're on the move
You said it
We got the groove

Ain't no stopping us now
