Wake up in the mornin' feeling like P. Diddy (hey, what up girl?)
Grab my glasses, I'm out the door I'm gonna hit this city (let's go)
Before I leave, brush my teeth, with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin' back

I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes, toes
Tryin' on all our clothes, clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones, phones
Drop-toppin', playin' our favorite CDs
Pullin' up to the parties
Tryin' to get a little bit tipsy...

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
Tik tok, on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Oh whoa-oh-oh, oh whoa-oh-oh

Ain't got a care in the world, but got plenty of beer
Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here
And now, the dudes are linin' up 'cause they hear we got swagger
