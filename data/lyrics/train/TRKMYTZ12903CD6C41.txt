In the forest, in the snow
All those many years ago
Pale stones and epitaphs
Mourning bells and half-mast flags
In the cemetery where they fell
All those many years ago
And now it's just a memory
Eroded by the years

Forgotten heroes underground
Wrinkled faces gather round
Pale stones and epitaphs
...
