We're the voices 
This is who we are 
We're the voices 
This is who we are 
We are not a scene but come bearing 
Songs of freedom like Marley to the masses 
We are all diseased and tearing 
We see the people dying daily and it grabs us 
We are not all clean but come wearing 
Fronts and facades that raise the odds of you 
You and I serving other gods 
Which leads to destruction, selah 
We are all obsessed with comparing one another to each other and it scares us 
One at a time we need to find our identity 
Too many times we see the fog in the clarity 
Can you hear me loud and clear 
Chorus: Aw, this is who we are 
We're the voices of the generation 
We make choices that mold a nation 
Puttin' down all frustration 
...
