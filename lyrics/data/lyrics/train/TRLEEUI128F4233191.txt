Baby, I understand da reason why you're leavin'
But dat doesn't make it any easier to bear
I know dat I played dis game a fool wen I was cheatin'
Now I'm cryin'
(Now I'm cryin')

Said I lost it, my intentions was not clear
(Was not clear)
But I was messin' wit' your feelin's, I didn't care
But I love you
(But I love you)
But I love you, yeah
(But I love you)

So I'll cry if you won't take me there
...
