I have spent a lifetime
waiting for the chance
to save you my confession
save the one last dance
the same old superstition
haunt us now and then
i'm begging for ignition
to start it all again
We'll burn away
burn away, burn away my pride
we'll burn away
burn away, burn away my pride
we'll burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight
we'll burn away
burn away, burn away my pride
Breathe for me from now on
...
