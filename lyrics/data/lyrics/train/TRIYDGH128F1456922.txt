Just like a birdie, I just wanna fly free, so high, so high
And own a piece of land
Somewhere, somewhere off in the country
Oh, oh yeah, listen, yeah

Temperature's like a hundred degrees
Like I got chains on me
Blackmail and a family of three
Been right on my destiny

Rake it out fly way
'Cuz it's too much for the man
Shouldn'ta gone down this way
What happened to my master plan

'Cuz I can't figure out
I coulda been a love child
...
