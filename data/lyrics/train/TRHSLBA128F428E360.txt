He was searching for the light
In the silence of the night
Something real, to make him feel alive
Trying hard to find the way
But run out of cards to play
No looking back, he crossed the point of no return

All his life he's been waiting desperately
To wake up in the arms of a new tomorrow
Who has wrote the book of destiny
After all a dream may come alive

Fly eagle fly
On your way back to the sky
Let me be the chosen one
And set me free
Fly eagle fly
N' pretty soon my fears run dry
Take me with you, far away
...
