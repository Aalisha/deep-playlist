I hear the sound of distant thunder, echo all around
I see the tragedy of young ones lyin' on the ground
I see the fathers, sons and daughters, I hear the mothers cryin'
Nothin' left for me to do, but whisper a prayer for the dyin'

Ohh, a prayer for the dyin'

The suffocatin' heat of jungles, and burnin' desert sands
Where everything reminds you, you? re a stranger in a strange land
The soothin' words of politicians, those bodyguards of lies
While Guardian Angels waste their time and every mother cries

Ohh, a prayer for the dyin', dyin', dyin'
Ohh
