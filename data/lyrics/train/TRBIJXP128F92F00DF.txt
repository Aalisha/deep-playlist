Breathing black air all around me
more broken dishes on the floor
Same old cycle same old fuss and fight
Trash revolving cutting deep inside
except for today because I've got to ask

Where I'm wrong
'cause I can't forget at all
Where I'm wrong
because I've just got to know
where I'm wrong
you should know

Father can you see the real me?
Can't you see you're blinded by her lies
