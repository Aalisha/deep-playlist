Hey, hey, little razorblade
Girl, you're so, so dangerous
You say you wanna try and get away
And that's just so obvious
I've got the keys
So let's put it into drive

Hey, hey, little razorblade
Girl, you're so, so serious
You're only pretty when you walk away
And you act oblivious
But I've got the keys
So let's put it into drive

But don't call it a crush
Don't call it a crush, baby
You know I love you too much to be crushed like that
To be crushed like that

Give back my heart tonight
...
