"Weekend Love"

Last night somebody told me that you would be in town
I opened up my eyes and you were staring me down
I often think about the last times we spent together
Ummm hmmmmm

And sometimes
When no one was around and its just me
You serve a special parted memory

[x2:]
It's our dream to see
(oh baby)
You here with me
(I miss you)
After all this time
You're still fine
(Girl let's chill)
For the Weekend
(For the Weekend babe, I'd like to chill for the weekend)
