As you speak once again
I feel the anger in my veins
Thick bloodcluts speeding
Through my blood banes
Pathetic passion
For glamour, living the lie
Dispirit conversations
Turned compassion into rage
Wasted too much time, you fucking clown
Desperately seeking for my loyalty
Indignity your only salvation
It's far too late, I'm breaking this chain
Once you ignite
The fire, the heat will burn relentlessly
