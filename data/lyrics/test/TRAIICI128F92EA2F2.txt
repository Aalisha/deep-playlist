Harlots of Hell, spread your wings
As I penetrate your soul
Feel the fire shoot through your body
As I slip into your throne

Cast aside, do as you will
I care not how you plead

Born from my demon seed

Hot winds of Hell
Burn in my wake
Death is what you pray
Behold, captor of sin

Infernal slaves of manipulation
Captive of my vice
