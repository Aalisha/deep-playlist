When I think of you
(Smile)
You make me smile
(Sometimes U make me smile)
(I can feel you, I? m missing you)

Where is my heaven? Where can it be?
How do I get there? Do I believe?
Where is my sunshine? Where is your light?
I wanna see you, so you can make me smile

Sometimes U make me smile
Sometimes U make me smile
Sometimes U make me smile
I can feel you, I? m missing you
(Missing you)

The most fragile part of me
Nurses our strongest connection
You live in my memory with a philosophy
That now offers me completion

I? m so well and it? s strange to be
I? m torn by misdirection, you? re my ambassador
You personify my admiration, so beautiful
I live for you as you live for me

Sometimes U make me smile
(You make me smile)
Sometimes U make me smile
(You make me smile)
Sometimes U make me smile
I can feel you, I? m missing you
(Missing you)

This is such a happy ever after
You traveled miles and now we? re past the finishing line
We? re starting on time, my music wears your name
If they knew where to look, they? d find it
