Way down in Memphis, Tennessee
There's a guy looking just like me
Wearing the same blue suede shoes
Singing the same old blues

Way down in the U.S. of A.
There's a guy doing things my way
Combing the same greasy hair
Hugging the same teddy bear

He's a copycat
Trying to steal my soul
But he's too fat
To rock'n'roll
