A stab in the back
Is worth waiting for tonight
He's seen enough joy for today
A sudden attack
Would just start the evening right
And maybe a penance to pain

Thunder and lightning, electric machines
These are the devils that shout in his dreams

Double the pain, he's strong he will survive
Double the pain, it will make him come alive
Double the pain
