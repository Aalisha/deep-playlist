Blinded by the fire and the sorrow of the day
...
I come knocking at your door
To dry the tears away
The eventide is calling me to take a look into your eyes

...
Pull me on and make me mesmerized!
...
Riding on the wings of light

...
Dreaming dreams and holding tight:
Leaving all my sorrow far behind
Your eyes are the gate

To the land of the miracle
...
Where our love can make us fly, make us fly
...

In the land of the miracle
...
We can find a reason why and how we can fly.
...

Open up the book up madness read the page of life!
...
