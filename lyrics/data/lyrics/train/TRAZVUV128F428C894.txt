You're once your twice (your twice)
You're crossing my mind once and again, baby

You and I
Is something never left behind
I do believe
You're always on my mind
Feels like we are tight together
And though we have tried
Tried to regloose
But I don't know what to do

You're once (your once) your twice (your twice)
You're crossing my mind once and again, baby
I'm trying to recall that when
I'm once (I'm once) I'm twice (I'm twice)
I'm way out of line
Our love's a million more then once and twice
(You're once you're twice)

Ooooh
