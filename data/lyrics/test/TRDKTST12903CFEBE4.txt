In the days of Armageddon, starved souls, greedy bodies
Ready to punish, ready to kill
Sword by sword they stand
Strike on strike, faith is dead, Gog and Magog on
Nergal's left hand...

See, the rust gnaws on Michael's mystic sword
Frozen's the lightning in Jehovas hand
Angels it rains from the sky
Extinct planets, pale meteors
...
