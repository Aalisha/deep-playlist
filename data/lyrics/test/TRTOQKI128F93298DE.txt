Here it comes, and there it goes
Another day of decomposing light
In a world called catastrophe
My native tongue is blasphemy
So it's the one I'll write

And baby, can you feel it
Don't it make you wanna lay down
And close your eyes
And baby, can you feel it
Don't it make you wanna lay down
And close your eyes

Remember how we started
'Cause since then, I'm a waste
...
