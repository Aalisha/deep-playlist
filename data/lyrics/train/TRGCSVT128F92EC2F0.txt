My plane set down in nashville at a quarter after 2
A little while and I'd be on my way back home to you
While I was waitin' for my flight, got out and looked around
Nashville is a groovy little town

I met some entertainers and they had an extra girl
I told them I was just a tourist out to see the world
From one place to another, yes we really made the rounds
Nashville is a groovy little town

Next day they all took me in just like they did before
I guess I'm trying to tell you I won't be home anymore
