Heaven ain't your place girl, not now anyways
And in this hell yeah yeah, you cant erase
All of the pain, that you've been given
That ain't the reason yeah, that you've been driven

Watch the hand as it's movin', 24 times around
Every second's like a minute, till you're back on the ground

I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
I've felt joy and I've felt pain (girl Im sorry)
But I know I'm gonna see you again

Girl we had our chances, we knew from the start
