Take away all of your suicidal promises
I can't take that blame no more
I'd complain
If you thought something might come out of this
But I let that just split by
I've been down before
I'm no stranger to the canvas
I'll kiss the floor and watch the world turn aroud
So you could say that I amount to nothing anyway
But I have been your big mistake
Shift the blame
