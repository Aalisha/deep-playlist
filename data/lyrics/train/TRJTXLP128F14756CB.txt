I wish I was a fisherman
Tumblin' on the seas
Far away from dry land
And its bitter memories

Casting out my sweet line
With abandonment and love
No ceiling bearin' down on me
Save the starry sky above

With light in my head
You in my arms, woo

I wish I was the brakeman
On a hurtlin' fevered train
Crashing a-headlong into the heartland
...
