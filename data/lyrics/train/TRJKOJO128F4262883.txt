Down in Piedras Negras you gotta watch yourself
There's a whole lotta hungry people lookin to share some wealth
And when the oilfield's busted and the peso takes a dive
Stay off the side streets if you wanna come back alive
Yo no busca nada I'm just standin here
Mindin my own business, gonna get back outta here

Back to the safe side
Back to the safe side

And at the base of the barstool there's a drain in the floor
You better not go in there, if you don't know what that's for
It's no place to take your lady, she'll get the evil eye
Sizin up their prospects, sharpin up their knives
