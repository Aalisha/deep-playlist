(Intro: Murs)
Ready?

(9th Wonder)
Uh-huh

(Murs)
Aight...

After tonight
Don't leave your girl round me, heartbreaker for life
Ask my homeboy 9th

(Chorus 1)
Got all your girlfriends thinkin' that I'm the (Bad Man!)
Never neglected you or disrespected you
? A lot of have sex?, yet you say I'm the (Bad Man!)
Gave you dick, never fronted, pulled your hair when you wanted
Used to flip you on your stomach, said you wanted a (Bad Man!)
Now it's all drama, an unidentified caller
on the phone with my momma talkin' bout I'm a (Bad Man!)
How could somethin' so bad be so damn good?

(Verse 1)
All I wanted was to fuck, from the start I never lied
Now it hurts my heart to have to see you cry
Let you know from the jump, I was that type of guy
Now you all on my voice mail askin' me why
Never kissed you in public and I never held your hand
I never said I loved you so I never was your man
How can we break up?, when we never broke down
