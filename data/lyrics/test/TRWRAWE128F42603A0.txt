Ooh... hoo... oh...

I know you're scared
Cause I don't have the image of a hero
But no matter what comes our way or what we go through
I'll be there for you, oh... mmm...

And I can't say
That I can satisfy your every needs, oh
But you must know this, through your tears and fears
I care and there ain't nothin' we can't share

I'll be there for you {All you do is call}
I'll be there for you (I'll be there, be there when you fall)
When the world is closin' in and there's no one you can turn to
I'll be there for you {Oh...}

You're gonna need
Somebody you can lean on and be sure of
...
