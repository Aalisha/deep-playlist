Baby, what you? re going through
Know that I? m here for you
You don? t ever have to worry? bout it
'Cause everything else, I? ll do without it

I? ll share your struggle
(I? ll place)
No one above ya
(In case)
You didn? t know how strong my love is, baby
Let me show you

My love is true for only you, my dear
(And I wanna show you)
How much I care, I? ll be right there always
 (Yeah yeah)
(I? m gonna be right there)

How good love is, I pray for this to come
 (Let me just show you)
You are the only one
 (Only one)
The only one for me, yeah
 (Only one for me)

Doesn? t matter what they think of me
They? re nowhere in your league
