She said she was leaving
So I went to follow
Blind love and I-55 got me here
Dirty old salt truck
In the smog before me
And dear old Dixie, back in the rear view mirror

Got a third-story walk-up
With a view of the alley
A mail room job that isn't all glamour and fun
The woman I came for
Is gone to another
Now my feet are just too planted to run
...
