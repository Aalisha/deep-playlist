Rosie whatcha doing in this low class joint,
dancing in the dark all day
You used to be the darling of your high school scene
Now you put your love on display
Sweaty hands hand you up a dollar bill.
Hungry eyes never seem to get their fill
I used to watch you walking down the hall.
Rosie do you see me when you hear them call your name.

Rosie, Rosie I wanna take you away.
