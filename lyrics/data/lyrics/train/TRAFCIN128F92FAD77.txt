(Verse 1)
From the womb to the world from the world to the grave from the grave to the heavens and my spirit
From the liquor to the drugs to the police and the thugs to my prayers and hope that he hears it
Little kids in the street Never sleep never eat Carry burdens of their mommas' and the papas' To the
hell on this Earth Gettin' hot gettin' worse Cause were cursed nobody can stop us
Take a look see the sights that I've seen See the lust see the greed jealousy and killin'
Walk the walk that I've walked All alone in the dark overtaken by this feelin' that I'm feelin' Touch
the hand that I've touched In the night what a rush turning blue so could and breathless See the bars
and the chains on your wrist on your brain Feel the pain of a grown man's death wish

(Chorus)
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
Is this all there is cause I don't want it no more
