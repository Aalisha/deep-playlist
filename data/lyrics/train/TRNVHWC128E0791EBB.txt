This is memory lane
Hello
November 11, 1998 (Hello) and i met this guy
Man wassup Im cool...(ooh)
This spirit this soul (ooh)
He had (ooh) this voice and his (ooh) complextion and God those eyebrows
I felt them before i ever touched him
It was so...
Your beautiful u got me singin shades of amazing rain
Plain and simply
You got me lovin everything about u (thing bout u)
First sight and im dazed im goin crazy constantly thinkin
If i should take a chance... should i take a chance and call u

Jus to say hello; How r u; wha u up to;
