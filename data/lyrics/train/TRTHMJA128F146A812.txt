If I was the last person to know
How you cheated me
Did you think I could let go
Of your betrayal easily
Oh no it went deep
I lost a lot of sleep
Thinking I had no one to turn to
Oh i
Oh i
Gotta stop the world misfocusing on me
Gotta stop the world misfocusing on me
How you ever gonna see clearly
Are you ever gonna know the real me
I gotta stop the world I gotta stop the world
Gotta stop the world misfocusing on me
Oh i
Oh i
Oh i
I can't take all the mis quotes and lies
Barbed wire bouquets
But you I never thought
Would stoop so low
I guess that goes to show
What you just don't know
...
