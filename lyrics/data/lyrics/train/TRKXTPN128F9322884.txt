Cruel Guards
I see you in the papers through a foggy lens,
waving with a fist, my team, she always wins
He looks into your eyes like an old friend
tells you there's a difference,
there's us, us, us and them

It's a cheat to make me feel happy when it's on loan,
when you aint ever home, no you aint ever home

There is a bright, bright heat
They are the cruel, cruel gaurds
