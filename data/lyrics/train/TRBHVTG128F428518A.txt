Way down in the state of Georgia
Through the swamps and everglades
There's a hole in Tiger Mountain
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave.

I had a girl in way cross Georgia
But she had unfaithful ways
Made me feel I was unwanted
Like the birds and the bears in Miller's Cave.

(Miller's, Miller's, Miller's, Miller's Cave.)
