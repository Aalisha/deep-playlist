Lay my bones
At the feet of the ministry
I need the guilt and the company
I need the chance to be judged
And then long forgotten

Lately I just can't shake it
I count the days in seconds and minutes
Hours and hours are subtle as shards of glass
In the skin

So lay with me
I could use the company
You could help me ease

These bones
Are like maps and keys
Where they took their hits
And they felt those teeth

There's a story hidden
Underneath
If you dig in deep
Will you find relief?

For these bones
Shudder all night long
The hammer drops
Another scar
For these bones
But I know
They're only my second home.
