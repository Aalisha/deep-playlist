One, two, three, four

Here I come again
I don't really care to turn back
Trying to find out your directions
But I seem to be losin' track

Hey, baby, I believe we ought to make a run for it
Just to see how far we can go
I ain't just around for the fun of it
But until you try it, baby, you'll never know

So say you love me or say goodnight
Say we've made up or on with the fight
'Cause there's no love lying' in the eyes of the night
So say you love me or say goodnight
