Dark walls, black drapery, bloody mural artistry.
Self provoked insomnia.
The Mescaline is wearing off, teeth grinding, lights flashing.
Pseudo-psycho kaleidoscope.
Stiff grin, nervous finger-tricks.
Subconscience overload.
Chained to the floor, ragged filthy doll, savagely beaten, repeatedly raped.
Disorientation strikes, fucked from inside again and again.
His perverted desire, Iris on tongue, lions like a burning fire.
He hides his shame.
She screams higher and higher.
His vision flickers and locks, sinking in a mental mire, saliva drips from his jaw.
Muffled cries devoured by choking, eye licker is a shadow by night.
