Worry 'bout Sherman and danger business
San Jose, original Bandelero man

Hey, gringos empasero
When ya make way for di Bandelero
'Cuz if you don't do that, my friend
Then your number is zero
Dem lyrics snatch up like the sword of Zorro

Shoulda seen me inna Colorado
When I buck up di yout Franco Nero
When they all sit up kick up?
Pon de tell up pon de, caravan stay so zero

No him come lick the pelico
And pelico don't play up in de morrow
Dem want fi jump inna mi chest and feeling bad
Because dem feel overmacho, zero

But I just drink the Tequila
And so mi arms of the sweet chi-chiquita
And tell a boy next time dey say no reach dat
I am de profesora, zero

You should never test the champion, no
My name is Pinchers, I'm the Don Gorgon, yeah, yeah
