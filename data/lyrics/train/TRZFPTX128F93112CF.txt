Just a sec more in my bed
Hope the machine's working right
When it's just precisely tuned
That's how it comes out so nice

Make sure my kid's got a dress
and coat and shoes and hat
Strap a stroller to my back
Bouncing along every crack

What can I do to make it pass?
Sing a song to pass the playground
What can I do as traffic pass?
Guard my girl from muffler's black gas
