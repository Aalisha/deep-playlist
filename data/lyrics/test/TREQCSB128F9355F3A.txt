Yup, yup, can't do it, can't do it

She says she love me then she loves me not
But she don't hate me if I kick her out my spot
'Cause darlin' lately it seems we've been growin' apart
I don't know how much more I can take this

I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
I feel like sayin' buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh bye
But when I look into her eyes, eye, eye, eye, eye, eyes
Just can't do it, do it, do it

Never felt this before, could it be that we lost the flame?
That them true lovers have, how did it all just slip away?
Seems so right at the beginnin', now it seems close to the endin'
Like we just friends, I need to breathe again, ooh yeah

These feelin's I'm feelin' startin' to drive me crazy
Just the thought of another man makin' other plans with my lady
And girl I've tried and tried hard so we can work this out
But I just don't know right now
