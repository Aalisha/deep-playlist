A girl
i got a game to play its called
house hahaha

From the first day that i met ya knew that you was independent always pushin up in yo whip
always payin for all yo own shit (girl)
cuz you know that its all about (you got it goin on)
ever since we been together our whole life's been so much better
and for that i wanna thank ya
lord knows i appreciate you girl
baby you know the truth girl you so beautiful the way i feel each time we kiss if you only knew
lets build a cottage with the white picket fences (baby)
we'll have some children (after) well settle down the two of us
put that on everythang my car my house my name
if theres anything you ever need please dont hesitate

Come with me girl lets play house
you could be the mommy let me be the daddy (yay yay)
i would be the perfect spouse
bout ready to settle down and start a family (yea yea)
come with me girl lets play house
you could be the mommy i could be the daddy (yay yaye)
i would be the perfect spouse
