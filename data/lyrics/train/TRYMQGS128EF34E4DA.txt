Irresponsible child get ahold of yourself
You look so different when you wear your everything
Just where they can see it, you ask me where do I go
Everything falls out of place
When you just don't know where to go

Everyone here knows how important this is
Their faces make them look so serious
It won't make them strong enough...
You'll never be strong enough

My precious boy I know how hard this really must get
