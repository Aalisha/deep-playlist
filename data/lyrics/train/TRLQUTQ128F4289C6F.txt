Well, I tell you a story that's got no end
I forgot my love and I lost my friend
The murder was easy to soft my charm
But this darkness is about to do me some harm

I locked my doors and my windows too
But that ol' wind still whistled through
I used to be so close to you

In the middle of the night
Somethin' just ain't right, midnight
Where's that mornin' light? Midnight
I'm used to makin' it by myself
Oh Lord, but this here is somethin' else

My head feels hot but my hands are so cold
I saw few years and I feel so old
...
