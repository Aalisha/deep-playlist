jenny i think you've lost your mind
jenny the friends you thought you had
have left you far behind
jenny there's truth in unkind words
sometimes
take what you need
and leave the rest
for someone else to find

now you wanna show it to the world
you wanna show them
just what happens
when you hurt a girl
