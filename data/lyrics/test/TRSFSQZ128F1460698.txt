Yeah baby, I hope your thirsty
'Cus this is another one of those
Young Roscoe the sodo LT Hutton concoction, toxins

Roscoe Tabascos the sodo know
With hits like these I will never go broke
17, no longer seldom seen
I'm takin' over every spring every magazine

I go through with a limp limpin', big pimpin'
No simpin', YA
Bumpin', shufflin' through the highway
You rollin' with me, we gone do it my way

Crispy khaki sag down to the mud
Twist a zig zag and smoke with ya boy
'Cus I just love smokin' bud
Take a big drag and smoke with ya boy

Phony cat, blow me back
Scodie mack, he can't hold me back
Ladies strip and make this half an hour
Drive work to trip, I wanna see y'all

Shake, shake, shakedown
Shake, shake, shakedown
Shake, shake, shakedown
Shake, shake, shakedown

Shake, shake, shakedown
...
