This life in a car crash
This life in a car crash
Can we make it out alive

He finds himself
He's lost in
The breath between life and drowning

Cauterize
These open wounds
The burning flesh
The smell
Of these past five years
Paralyzed
With no will to move
The killing grounds
The Stakes
Of these past five years
These past five years

And it's more than just a loss
But it's over
We're not singing mournful thoughts
And it's over
(And I can't wait)
Can't wait
(Until we give it all away)
And we're giving up our lives
...
