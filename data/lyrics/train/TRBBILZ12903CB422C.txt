I value you more than you will ever know!

I know I'm not the only one
concerned about where this has gone.
The feelings that we both once shared,
they still exist, they went nowhere.

And you, you know it's true.
For you I am still here!
I'd hate to see it end this way.
It plagues my conscience every day.
And I want nothing more.
All I need lies in you!
Don't say this is the end.

I know I'm not the only one
who wishes we could get along.
Hanging out from 8 to 3,
and never wanting to fall asleep.

I just hope that you
will work with me
to make this right.
