The city really loves you baby
but the city never really does
the feeling of corruption stays and
then you think about the things you've lost

you've never really felt the fire
and you've never really felt the need
the city never stops you baby
and you remember how it feels to fall apart

you never really planned it baby
but then the planning never really stops and
when you think about the future baby
then you dream about another start

it's the thing about illusions baby
...
