I wanna write ya name on my T-shirt right about now
Hey, hey, hey, yo ya definitely my kinda company
I wanna feel ya next to me right about now
Hey, hey, hey, yo ya definitely my kinda company
I wanna write ya name on my T-shirt right about now
Hey, hey, hey, yo ya definitely my kinda company
I wanna feel ya next to me right about now
Hey, hey, hey, yo ya definitely my kinda company
Anytime you miss this
Walk the wire risk it
Be a real whiz kid
Then take your time for a minute to rest
We so into hippo
You can take my photo
Make the music mellow
So we can take a minute to rest
I wanna write ya name on my T-shirt right about now
Hey, hey, hey, yo ya definitely my kinda company
I wanna feel ya next to me right about now
