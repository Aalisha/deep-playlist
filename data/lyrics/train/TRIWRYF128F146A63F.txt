I can't, can't stand your mother
She's just so much in our business
And I can't really deal with it
I can't, can't stand your mother
Try to have you as a friend
But you've got to understand

(Raphael)
I used to love when
Christmas time came around
But now all I do is frown (frown, frown, frown)
I can't even talk to you on my own
Believe it or not (whispher)
And I can't even use my own damn phone
That why I can't stand your mama babe

I can't, can't stand your mother
She's just so much in our business
And I can't really deal with it
I can't, can't stand your mother
Try to have you as a friend
But you've got to understand

(Dawne)
I didn't really wanna to go there (go there)
But your mama's in my head
In the closet
In the bedroom
Saying things that I can't bear
Telling me how I should live
Tell me how to raise my kid
Always wanna borrow money
Got the nerve to act so funny
