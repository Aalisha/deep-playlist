Out in the country past the city limits sign
Where there's a honky tonk near the County line
The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down

They got whiskey women music and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie

I got a good job I work hard for my money
When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run

I go flyin' down that highway to that hide a way
