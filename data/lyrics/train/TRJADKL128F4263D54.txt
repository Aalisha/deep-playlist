Standing on the Rock
Rock of my salvation
Standing on the rock
rock in a weary land
Standing on the rock
rock of ages
standing on the rock
on Christ the solid rock I stand

A firm foundation
Security
A rock never failing naa
My God is He
Strong and mighty
Mighty in battle
Strength that's enduring
throughout eternity

Standing on the Rock
Rock of my salvation
Standing on the rock
rock in a weary land
Standing on the rock
rock of ages
standing on the rock
on Christ the solid rock I stand

A rock never sinking
enduring forever
as long as I'm on it
we're standing together
That rock is Jesus
no other rock I'll stand
all other grounds are sinking sand

Standing on the Rock
Rock of my salvation
Standing on the rock
rock in a weary land
...
