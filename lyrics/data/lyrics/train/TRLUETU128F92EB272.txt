I've just had the craziest week
Like a party bag of lies
Booze and then deceit
And I don't know why
I want to voice this out loud
It's therapeutic somehow

So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got problems with my sleep
And we're not the same
And I will wear that on my sleeve
So I'm moving to New York
'Cos I've got issues with my sleep
Looks like Christmas came early
