Well I saw her one day
At the corner cafe
Everybody there knew she's a wonder
I sat there all night
Too shy to say
Honey you could keep me from going under

Oh my, my when she walks on by
It's hard not to get lost in the view
How can you know if the feeling's a lie
When love comes out of the blue

North, south, east, west
Up, down, all around and all the rest
I'll go anywhere she wants me to go
Of all the girls I've loved she's the best
...
