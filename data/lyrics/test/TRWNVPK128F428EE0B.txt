God knows what is hiding in that weak and drunken heart 
I guess you kissed the girls and made them cry 
those Hardfaced Queens of misadventure 
God knows what is hiding in those weak and sunken eyes 
a Fiery throng of muted angels 
Giving love and getting nothing back 

People help the people 
And if your homesick, give me your hand and i'll hold it 
People help the people 
And nothing will drag you down 
Oh and if I had a brain, Oh and if I had a brain 
...
