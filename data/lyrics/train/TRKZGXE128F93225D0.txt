Something wrong with me
I'm not getting along with me
My eyes pasted on the ceiling
I can't get my mind to stop working

I knew all the blackest blues
You were all my favorite tunes
This was all I had to lose

Tried out for size
to my surprise
I can't fit in anybody's arms
No more disguise
Cause I realize
I can't fit in anybody's arms
Oh you, oh you left just in time

Should have known to turn
