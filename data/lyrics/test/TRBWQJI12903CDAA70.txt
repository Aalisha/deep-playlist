Ooh, yeah

What you see is what you get
What you get is everything now, honey
What you see is what you get
Nothing more and nothing less

Ooh, I been watching your eyes
Looking for someone
(Time...) time after time
They met mine, the chase is on

You think I'm this
You think I'm that
I wonder why you stop and go

Do you think I'm weak
Do you think I'm strong
I think I ought to let you know
