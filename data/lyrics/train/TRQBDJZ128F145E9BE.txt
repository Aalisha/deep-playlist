Come on and brace your face
Engulfed up in the rat race we hold our futures down
So, just resist the plot and find the answer
Etched eternal as we self destruct

Day by day, one by one
One more example of disrespect
And that you seem to offer no more than complete neglect
A generation with fate all tied
And this ain't a game we don't enjoy this ride

We try to perceive the lie
All caught up in your own high
Opinions of yourself
Should be concerned about your life
There's been enough strife to crash a persons hope

And as the days delay our every other move
We've been consumed by apathy
Thats right, it has become a pain
Inside my brain is screaming
Look what you've done to me

Day by day, one by one
One more example of disrespect
That you seem to offer no more than complete neglect
A generation with fate all tied
...
