Don't know who's to blame
Don't know who was wrong
Love has died too soon
After all had just begun
Something in your eyes
Tells me you still care
Oh baby I swear

Deep inside my heart
Deep inside my soul
Something tells me no, I can't let you go
Saw it in your eyes
Last time when we met
I will never forget

How can I say
