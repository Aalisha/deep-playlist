Miscellaneous
I Know There's Something Going On
I can see that it won't be long
You grow cold when you keep holding on
You know you've changed and your words, they lie
That's something you can't deny

I call, you're not at home
You're home, but you're not alone
If you wanna leave then why don't you say
Your love has gone anyway

I Know there's something going on
I Know there's something going on
I know it won't be long
