If you want a sweet, sweet love tonight
Call me and I'll make you feel alright
When you're out and running around
Playing games all over town
Turn around, come on down, I'll be there
Yeah, yeah

If you want some sweet, sweet love from me
Take a chance with someone new you'll see
I can make your fire burn with the touch of just one kiss
Turn you on, all night long
You'll be gone, gone, gone
...
