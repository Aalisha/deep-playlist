Well I guess if my daddy hadn't brought me up
Down a long dirt road in a pickup truck
I'd feel alright, 'neath the city lights
Couldn't leave the city lights it just ain't right

I was born out west of Cheyenne town
While my ma and pa was ramblin' 'round
I'm a rambler too, but I'm country bound
I'll travel till my country home is found
And I will travel
Yeah, I will travel
