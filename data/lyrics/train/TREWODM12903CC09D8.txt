When I gaze into those pearly blues
The bright abyss that I once knew
Haunts me from the past
It's like a sickness that you can't delude
There's nothing more to hold onto
but the memories fading fast

We'll still dance tonight
God, it feels so right
To sing this song as I
force my mind to sleep
We'll still dance tonight
If the moment's right
I'll sing this song 'till I
force my mind to sleep

In case you didn't notice
It's like this every night
We're both pretending this is something
But we're nothing in the end
Tomorrow is a new day
but everyday's the same
Without our love I'm learning nothing
From our ways
