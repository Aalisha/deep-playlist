Oh yeah
It ain't the way that you look at me
No nor the way you talk
Could be a dark side coming out of me
But I just like that way that you walk
And I know what you've got is a thing for me
And I want that thing awful bad
Don't mess around
This is too intense
I'm getting hot on the spot
Tell me just to laydown
And stay down
For my love
Laydown
And stay down
For my love
Yeah
Laydown
Could be the way that you're smiling
