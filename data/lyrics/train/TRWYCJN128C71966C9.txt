Yesterday's dreams today are sorrow
Just like your love, girl, fading away
Yesterday's love won't last till tomorrow
I know you're leaving, but what can I say?
Oh (oh) wish that I could find a way
To make you stay; I've got to prove to you
That I love you, I need you, oh how I need you
Don't go (don't go) don't go (don't go)
If you go, don't you know
