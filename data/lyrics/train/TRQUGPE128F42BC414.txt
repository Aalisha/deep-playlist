(Kix Brooks)

Well you might say trouble is my middle name
I can't get ahead of the game
Runnin' on empty and I'm runnin' late
Bossman's yelling won't give me a break
I could write a book about getting behind
But there's one kind of trouble that I don't mind

She meets me after work when the sun goes down
She's the kind of trouble that makes the world go 'round
Total strangers, even my best friends, bird-dog my baby when she walks in
