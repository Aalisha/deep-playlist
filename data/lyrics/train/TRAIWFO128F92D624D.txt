[Intro:]
I? m your director
Its getting deep
We don? t need to rent nothing, we? ll make our own movies
I? m your director
Its getting deep
We don? t need a videotape or a camera
To make this ghetto love scene
Whoo
I wanna welcome everybody here tonight (uh)
Its such a beautiful occasion (yes)
I wanna tell you the way I feel (you know)
This is for the ladies
I wanna take you to a place you? ve never been before (take you there)
Sit back and enjoy this ride

[Verse 1:]
Our love exploding in the air
Like the works on the 4th of July
Or like the sun how it sits upon the earth
Shine through clouds in the sky
I might never get as much air time
As a pilot would get
But I? m sure right to do things
That we both haven? t tried yet
Take a trip to the moon
Just me and you
And we? ll shine on the earth
I? ll show the world what you? re worth

[Chorus:]
Did ya like that
