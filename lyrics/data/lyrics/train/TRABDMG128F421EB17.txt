One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot back to counter it

One foot in front of the other
One foot in front of the other
One foot back to counter it
One foot in front of the other
One foot back to counter it

On days like these
You've got to find it in some other way
It's all or nothing, baby

Avalanche, start inside of me
Avalanche, down through the trees
Avalanche, start inside of me
Avalanche, hell down through the trees
