There’s the rockabilly cats with their pomps real high
Wearin’ black drape coats, all real gone guys
Cool skinheads with their rolled-up jeans
Lookin’ real tough and mighty mean

There’s a rumble in brighton tonight
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight
There ain’t a damn thing that the cops can do
There’s a rumble in brighton tonight

They sew fishhooks under their collars
They got razors in their shoes
I said, go cat go, their battle cry
World war iii is startin’ to brew
