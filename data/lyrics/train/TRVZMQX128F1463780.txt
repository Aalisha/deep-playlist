Lost in an adventure I be
Are you the man that I love
Or a man with a gun sitting next to me?

The big bad world had me acting crazy
So I called the lifeboat man
All you need are your fears
And a few thousand tears
It? s a rescue plan

I sneezed another brave idea
I wanna come look for you
And it? ll be wonderful if I ever get there

But if I fall
Would there be another stone in my shoe?
Making it harder to come back to you
Another stone in my shoe?

And if I fly, lift your eyes
As my paper boat sails away
