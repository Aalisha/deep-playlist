The light is long the sun is low
I'm riding fast across this dusty road
But I don't want to be, no I don't want to be

Above the ridge an eagle flies
In lazy circles in the western skies
I want to fly with him I want to walk the spirit trail

I've seen them come I've seen them go
Off to the oilfields and rodeos
To find a better way, they leave their native soil
But I can hear a different song
The drum within my heart is beating strong
I want to follow it, I've got to walk the spirit trail
...
