Listen baby, I won’t leave no trace.
Gonna light out of here for some cleaner place.
I’ll be sitting in the backseat with my hair in my face,
Then gone fast as freedom on good wind.

If I got my hopes too high, this is no easy kind of life.
But I see it in my mind’s eye, touch me real as daytime,
I can’t keep from trying.
