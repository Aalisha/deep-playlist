Oh Gosh, Here We Go Again
A Fella can't get no rest around this joint

Well, she got up this mornin' at 6 a.m.
She was as grumpy as can be
Not a snowballs chance of sleepin' late
'Cuz she started vacuuming
Said: "Get your lazy butt up Cledus
You gotta take me to the mall
Don't forget to bring them credit cards
'Cuz I'm a'gonna use 'em all"

Wives do it all the time
We can't meet all their demands
A bunch of female General Schwarzkopfs
A'barkin' off their commands
They spend all our money it's a mystery
How us menfolk can survive
Oh why do we can't tell if they break a nail
Wives do it all the time
