Poor black
Thinks his freedom lies up a skirt
Liberation a magic elixir
Can stroke away the bonds about his wrists
Poor black
Thinks he can loosen his fists
Caress from his brow
Centuries of scars
He knows heâ€™s bound to pass on to his seed

Watch him dancing
Watch him singing
Watch him shaking his ass on the deck
Watch as his smile is slowly widening.
Watch him dancing
Watch him singing
