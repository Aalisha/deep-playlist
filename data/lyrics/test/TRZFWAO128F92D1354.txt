Love On The Line

When I don't see you
And I don't know where you've been
There gets to be a question in my mind
It hurts to love you
And the knife goes through the heart of me
When you're gone I lost a part of me
That's hard to find
Don't want to fall asleep without you
Don't wanna wake
Don't wanna wake up when you're gone
I don't know what you do that makes me love you
But then love don't mean surrender
And it's time I let it show
You've got someone else in love with you
And I deserve to know
