I can see clearly
from my diamond eyes,
I'm going to the mountain with the Fire Spirit
no-one will accept all of me
so the Fire... will stop

Up through the streets
the gunfire of cars,
going to the mountain with the Fire Spirit
no-one will take all of me
so the Fire... will stop

I will be cheating
the whole ritual,
I'm going to the mountain with the Fire Spirit
no-one will expect all of me
so the Fire.will stop
...
