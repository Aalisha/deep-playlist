My name is legendary on all blocks, spitting fireball rocks
Before they call pops had bodies in walls and crawl spots
Hammers is all cocked
So many Makaveli mini-me's in the game it's a fucking outbreak of small pox/pacs
And beef is when everybody is not breathing
so body me not even
Everybody is holding and probably not squeezing
And last year niggaz albums did more flopping then a Vlade Divac season
Shit I'm warning them flinch and the itching trigger finger is gon start forming a clench
And you come that hot lead storm and you drenched
My flow as fury as the scorn of a bitch
And you hot niggaz ain't keeping shit warm but the bench
I'm a beast in bed, check my dick head for triple sixes
I'll hit a fat ass from the back until it ripples vicious
Give titty nipples stitches
I'm a pimp, pussy fall in my lap like a strip club full of clumsy crippled bitches
