baby, well let me tell you something about love
let me tell you that i've had enough
i've had enough of your playing away
and then i've only got one thing to say...

only your love takes me higher
it's the kind of love that leaves
me burning with desire
if you think of me, if you care,
stop your fooling 'round
because it's going nowhere

baby, well let me tell you the one thing that's true
i've got to try to get through to you
i've had enough of your playing away,
and now i've only got one thing to say...
...
