Me and my friends gonna make a pile of money
Gonna check it out every day
Me and my wife gonna need every penny
'Cos we're throwing it all away
But I'm changing my tune now
And I'm breaking away

Me and my friends we're rugged little rockers
And we're lazing away the day
Hot wax, jacked-up on the televison
And forgetting about the pay
But I'm changing my tune now
...
