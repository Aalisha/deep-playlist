Ah

(Ah)
Sea, sand and stone
Wreath 'round this ground I call my own
White dark, concrete sky
Blacks out the sun with icy night

Even though the ocean roars
And the storm is bold, and the rain is cold
Here I was born

Though winter winds have blown
And bitter seeds been sown
I gave you all I am and all I hope to be
Now I am free
