Oh, you want to talk around them, talk about me
Talk about what this that and everything, every way
I been *** you but you don't have a clue

How well you sit there pointin' fingers at, imagine that
I'm the real vision of the person that you want to be
It's never been you it's always been me, oh

Isn't it funny? Well, not funny money's
What you're trippin' over, leaving a paper trail, oh

When matter of fact I don't regret the things that I have done
And if I do I never dwell upon a fallin' sun
When matter of fact I have respect, I feel for everyone
