If I tried to abuse you. if I did you wrong.
If I ever accused you for stealing my songs.
If I lightly disturbed you with my unfaithful laws.
If it slightly occurred to you that I wasn't yours.

Then excuse me for being this mad,
But it's all in my head
And I get nothing done as the sun moves up and down ... without you.
