I can't live my life with my back to the wall.
Can't walk this road always on the defense.
I think I'll let my heart make the call.
When my faith is being put to the test.
(You can test me all you want - I'm still standing here).
So I'll press on the way I feel I should.
But rest assured that your point's been understood.

I've heard your side and it's all good.
I swear I'd see the world through your eyes if I could.
But I can't my friend, and I never ever will.
So let's agree to disagree take the issue and we'll kill it.
We're supposed to be brothers this fighting's got to stop.
So let's agree to disagree take the issue and we'll drop it.

I know you care and I know you're concerned
