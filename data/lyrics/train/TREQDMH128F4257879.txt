I went talkin' to my woman, I had to tell her where its at
I said you quit draggin' me around girl, I ain't that kind of cat
I said, I expect some respect - so what you think of that!

She said, I don't give a damn - I am what I am
I don't give a damn - I am what I am
No matter what you say, I'm gonna do it anyway
Because I don't give a damn

She said, now you listen to me babe - that's alright for you
You swarming around with that band of yours,
I don't know what you been up to
...
