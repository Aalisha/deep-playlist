This is, another Next presentation
For the streets
The cars, the clubs, especially for the strippers
Ready, set, go

Your body is killin', I'm saying whats up
(What's up?)
We chillin', some drinkin', come grab you a cup
(Grab you a cup)
Can you quit trippin', come show me some love
We're leavin', just listen, go hop in the truck

Your body is killin', I'm saying whats up
We chillin', some drinkin', come grab you a cup
Can you quit trippin', come show me some love
We're leavin', just listen, not trying to what

How could you walk in here
Knowing everyone would, look at you
Tightest fit I've ever saw on
Had no bra on, I want you

To come pop a squat
Have a couple shots
Let me talk to you
Get a little buzz on
Then we can do what grown ups do

Stop the actin'
Feel the attraction
What's happenin'
Let's get this crackin'

I'm nasty
What's up? Miss Jackson
Got some hot candles
And a real cold mattress

Your body is killin', I'm saying whats up
(What's up?)
We chillin', some drinkin', come grab you a cup
(Grab you a cup)
Can you quit trippin', come show me some love
We're leavin', just listen, go hop in the truck

Your body is killin', I'm saying whats up
We chillin', some drinkin', come grab you a cup
Can you quit trippin', come show me some love
