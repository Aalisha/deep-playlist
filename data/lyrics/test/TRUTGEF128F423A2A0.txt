The weakness of times
we'll pay for it.
Distrust of the next
and fear for death.

The poor and the mighty live in the same place that we shared.
The good and the evil
the destroyed
the destroyer

Death is our freedom
makes us equal men,
regardless of our place and birth,
regardless of our plans and deals,
she'll never break her promises.
