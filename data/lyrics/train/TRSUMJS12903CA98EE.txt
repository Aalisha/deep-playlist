I'm a grown up woman but a girl again
It's been like this since I can remember when
You're questioning and answering

You're always talking to me like I can't relate
When all I want to do is to communicate
You were meant to be someone else

I look at the pictures of me and you, we're smiling
Tell me what happened to the times when
We understood each other? Yeah

All I need is a little bit of space to breathe
And a little bit of freedom to be who I want to be
Let me be me

Love means learning to let me go
And spread my wings, you let me grow
And live life you gotta let me be
Let me be me

You try to teach me lessons but you suffocate
Always setting goals that I don't wanna make
...
