I thought we had it sweet
But your mind's played
A trick on me
I thought that I'd be with you
All the time
And I'd be fine
Yeah I'd be fine

I'll swear you have my feelings
Under thought control
I know you've taken
Such a hold on me
I'm thinking more and more
Of what we had before

Before we lost it
At the shouting stage
Before the days we'd sit there
...
