Stormy night under jet black skies
Billy pulls into town.
Thunder rolled and the lightnin bolts
come crashin to the ground
Cold as ice, hard as stone
as he walks into the room, with
another man who was feelin the same way
All hell breakin loose

Bang Bang, shoot'em up
Bang Bang, blow you away

It's a showdown, in a noman's land
for the cowboy of the modern day.
Come on, sundown, don't be hangin 'round
cause the cowboy will blow you away
