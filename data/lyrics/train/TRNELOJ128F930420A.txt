Sittin' in a railway station,
My suitcase in my hand.
Goin' back where I came from,
Had more than I can stand.

Watchin' men destroy my dreams,
Picked my brain 'til it was clean.
When I was up
They knocked me down, hey.
I ain't goin' to hang around

I'm goin' ho-ho-home, hey, hey.
(I'm comin' home)
Yes I am.
(Comin' home)
More than I can stand, now doncha
Tell someone to meet me,
I'm comin' ho-ho-ho-home.
Yeah, hey.

(Tell someone to meet me)
Why doncha?
(Home)
Yesseree. Gotta tell y'all.

Came to this old town
Seeking fortune and some fame.
Never got the chance to prove myself
Though I tried to play their game.

Usin' people just ain't my thing,
I don't dangle from any string.
