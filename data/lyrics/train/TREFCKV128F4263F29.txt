Wade In The Water

Wade in the water.
Wade in the water, children.
Wade in the water.
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?

I stepped in water, and the water was cold.
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?
Said it chilled my body, but not my soul.
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?

Repeat Chorus

Well, I went to the water one day to pray.
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?
And my soul got happy, and I stayed all day.
Don't you know that God's gonna trouble the water?

(Help me Sing!)
Repeat Chorus
