This dark nocturnal secret
Binding us in slumber
We pour deep sleep in the ears of men

Walked through the fire of wicked day
In fear it would score my soul away
But the devil looks after his own

Fly on the wings of this mystery
You've always known
coro
We're alive
We are the Keepers of the night
And we are sin and we're sacrifice
Hold back the light
We are the Keepers of the night
We live your dreams as we ride the skies in disguise

The owls sing enraptured
The worship has begun
The things in dreams we dare set free
