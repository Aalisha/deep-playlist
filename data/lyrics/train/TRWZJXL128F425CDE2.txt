"Duality"
Both of me, reality, tell the truth who do you see
scratch the surface of my mind and you will find, Duality
take a trip to destiny, outta control, you're hooked on me
fate I fearless cruel plays kind, he look behind, Duality
Flash burn touch the sky
trick turn who am I
wild child drink me slow
I'll go to places you can't go
crash churn trash about
quick learn spit me out
wild child I'll take the blow
devil's dance where angels go
