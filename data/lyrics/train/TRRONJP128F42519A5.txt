Mothers see it coming around
They know they got their heads screwed on
I'm standing in the middle of town
I know I might never come home

Just standing where I am with all the people passing by me

I must be sure these are the signs
Cos I've been here a million times before

Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around
I think I see you coming to town,
