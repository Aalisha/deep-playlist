You're so quiet
But it doesn't faze me
You're on time
You move so fast makes me feel lazy
Let's join forces
We've got our guns and horses
I know you've been burned
But every fire is a lesson learned

I left my house
Left my clothes
Door wide open
Heaven knows
You're so worth it

You are
But I wish I could feel it all for you
I wish I could be it all for you
If I could erase the pain
Then maybe you'd feel the same
I'd do it all for you, I would
