This is the sound of a dropping bomb

After years are we still all content
With being pawns in war game chess?
Shuffled by King George and his English Queen
On a board of autocracy

As fundamentalist citing stories and fables
Of whose god is more righteously skilled
In whose gods' honor that we are all killed...

A dead ringer for Armageddon
