Eight forces of change
Hidden knowledge you gain
Time present, time past
Are both here in the future
Problems of life
Through divine channels
The melting of opposites
The purpose remains
Symbolize the shimmering water
The wheel of the law
It's destiny
Rejoice with neither fear nor favor
The inquisitor's artwork is not what it seems
