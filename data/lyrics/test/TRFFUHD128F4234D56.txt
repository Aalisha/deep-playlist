I sat with the drunks and the speed freaks
And I watched all the drones strolling by
We sat on the street with our beers and our weed
And we blew our smoke up towards the sky

I said, "It's one hell of an evening"
With a smile and I kicked back my can
They shooed us away so we walked down a ways
And we did the same damn thing again

Now I got nothing to wait for
And I got nothing but time
So I'll swim in these streams
And warm these poor beaten insides

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme the key to the city
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme the key to the city
These Midwest eyes are dead tonight
...
