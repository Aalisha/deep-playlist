Once upon a time, Brooklyn was the scene
In the project that they called Fort Greene
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, Dana Dane
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin' to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
'We've got fresh gear and you've got rags!'
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a straw hat, while they had Kangols
Girls used to say, 'Dane, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them polyester suits'
Well, one day, up the avenue
There was a man surrounded by the Fort Greene crew
He said, 'Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess'
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said 'Step-dad, may I?'
And before I could finish, 'Hell no!', he replied
My brothers were goin', they were geared down
Even Pops was goin' for a piece of the crown
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
'We can and you can't' is what they taunted
They all stood there laughing in my face
And as they walked out they said, 'Clean up this place!'

(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
But I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame
(Cinderfella Dana Dane!)
Yes, I'm the rapper Dana Dane with fame

Well I shrugged, I hissed, 'They're all tryna diss
I'd get them back if I had one wish'
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, 'What's up, Dane? My name is Hurb
I'm your fairy godfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish'
