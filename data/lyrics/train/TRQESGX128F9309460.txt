Declining, all color fading
Defining, time coming for me
Rescinding, my inspiration
Receding consciousness

Back in the day, I can recall that,
My thoughts were unclouded and sage
There was no black staining the walls of my memories
Now there's a haze pushing me sideways
And leaving me nothing to gain
Taking me back, locking me cold in disparity

Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Released my soul forever
I'll have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

Color declines, all that defines me
Is falling away, far behind
Nothing to keep me with the time, the here and now

Where am I meant to be?
...
