I just pulled out of Minneapolis and I aimed my headlights south
Got the taste of cherry lipstick still a clinging to my mouth
She begged me not to leave her and she cried till I nearly stayed
But I glanced at that old roadmap and she just didn't make the grade
There wasn't nothing wrong with her lovin'
She just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi

I got a doll in Pascadola I got a jewel in Gulf Port
And both of them more warm blooded that any woman I've made up north
