Out of my head and delighted, somebody knows how I feel
If you ask me to play it, you won't have to say it twice
'Cause I'm goin' to the head of the line, I'm takin' my life away
I'm so glad you made it, and now that you're ready
I'll begin to tell you what you want, but I know
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel, I feel) somebody knows
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel, I feel)
Somebody knows what you want and what you're tryin' to do
