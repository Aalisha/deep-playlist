Sitting in a bar room must have gone past ten
Well I had the kind of day I never want again
I got this gun pointing to my head
Gonna pull the trigger baby cos you want me dead

It's got so bad hey what ya doing to me
Everywhere I look what do I see
Whoah whoah whoah there she goes again ooh yeah
Whoah whoah whoah there she goes again
