Far from the smell of Picadilly trains
I go walking through lanes
Clears my mind
Don't take too long 'til I see what I've done
Oh, those city boys sure have me blind
Did you mean it when you said I love you?
Did you mean it when you said I need you, oh
All that we need's another faker in the world
My back will not be turned
My back will not be turned
Go for the money, boy, it's all you'll ever earn
My back will not be turned
My back will not be turned
So I return with this lesson I've learnt
