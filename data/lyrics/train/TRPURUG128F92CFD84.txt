want your fire
Give me your fire

So we're good together
We should really settle down
Maybe get married - even buy a house

Start popping out the babies
You'll be a great Dad

Just a few changes
It's called settling down

We're always in a fight
From thing little things you say
But I won't change a thing
Cos I like it this way

Give me fire
I want your fire

I want your fire
Give me your fire

Is there water in the room
There's a fire in the house

I want your fire
I want your fire

You said
Yes baby I love you
But I'm not ready to commit
I'm not ready for the mortgage
