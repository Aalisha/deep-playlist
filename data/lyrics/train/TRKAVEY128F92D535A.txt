You wonder why you drive me crazy
You don't watch the road signs baby
You never learned to stop at the light
You wonder why I get so uptight
The way you drive your automobile
You're the most dangerous thing on wheels
The way those wheels burn up the road
It's a wonder that they don't explode

Chorus:
Babe you're a reckless driver
Bound to be buried with your pride
