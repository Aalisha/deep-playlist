I don't know where to begin
I don't know how to get out there to see you
I don't know where to dig in
I don't how to get in there... to feel you

It's been too long and I'm about to be in time for me
It's been too long and I'm in time

Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold on to that
Baby there's something about you that
I can hold on to
I'm going to hold on to that
