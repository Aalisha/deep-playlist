Walk blindly to the light and reach out for his hand
Don't ask any questions and don't try to understand
Open up your mind and then open up your heart
And you will see that you and me aren't very far apart
'Cause I believe that love is the answer
I believe that love will find the way
Violence is spread worldwide and theres families on the street
We sell drugs to children now, oh why can't we just see?
That all we do is eliminate our future with the things we do today
Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay
