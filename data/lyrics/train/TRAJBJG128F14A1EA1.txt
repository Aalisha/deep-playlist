Give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death
Of a race is a game

Where seldom is heard
A peaceable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came

Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an Indian Chief

There is a secret I keep
It's called 'The Talking Leaf'
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs

Like a rock that bleeds
In a sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks
Of a wounded knee creek

American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance
American ghost dance

Today a new man
