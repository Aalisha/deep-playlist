Doe, a deer thut Nugent shot
Ray, a fish that's flat
Me, the guy who's always getting fucked
Fa, the ride to our next gig
So, it means I'm not impressed
La, a place where we record
Ti, H C it's found in pot
Dough is what I never seem to have
Mother Goose was never here
Father Christmas was a drunk
Easter Bunny well done tasted good
Peter Pan hung out with fairies
Tinkerbell got blown away
Mary Poppins O.D.'d on Quaaludes

Yo, a word to call my friends
Hey, it's how I say hello
Skeeve, the guy who drives your bus
Ma, the one who sleeps with dad
Bone, a spliff I roll myself
Pa, the guy who whips your ass
Dis, a bust on someone else
