Well you love me and I love you
So what's the problem?
Can't you see that I'm sinking fast
And I'm near the bottom?

Whenever you feel me slipping away
Then that's when you should hold me tight
If you sense that there's something wrong
Then why not make it right?
Make it right
Maybe we'll get it together
