I like it when you're watching me
you grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you look at me
you still say please
and the way you can't say no

It's late at night she's at my window
(I'm a fool)
She's drunk again and wants to take it out on me
(You know you do)
She never says goodbye
but what we did plays in my mind
All over you

I like it when you're watching me
you grind your teeth
I like it when we're up against the wall
I like it when you talk to me
you still say please
and the way you can't say no
You take me places I've never been
...
