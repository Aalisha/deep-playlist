Ohh no don't you come at me
With that look you got so down
You got me floating like a bubble
Ever since you came around

And even strangers seem to notice
And all my friends can tell
To keep you comin' I just keep on running
But your lovin' tripped me and I fell

I hope I always
Always feel this way
Always feel this way

Pushin' my buttons like we're on the elevator
...
