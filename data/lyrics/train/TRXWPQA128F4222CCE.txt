So listen down you little man
i'm not the one who is trying to change you... yeah.
and if you come to understand, it will be okay yeah
you need to change it now!
I'm not the one who's tryin' to be
i'm not the one who's tryin' to be your enemy!
that's somethin' you need to change.
i'm not the one who's tryin' to be your enemy!
that's somethin' you need to change.
So listen down you little man
i'm not the one who is trying to change you... yeah.
and if you come to understand, it will be okay yeah
