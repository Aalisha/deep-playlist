He's drivin' a jeep
But he ain't in the Army
Gets all his cigarette money
From his mommy
Dressed like a rootin' tootin'
Texas cowboy
But this lone ranger's
Never seen a horse

He wanna be Americano
Americano, Americano
He wants to drive a Cadillac
Now he's chasing showgirls
Smokin' Camels, whiskey and soda
Now he's never goin' back

He's cruisin streets for gold
Dressed in designer clothes
Brother if your too slow
You'd better not blink
...
