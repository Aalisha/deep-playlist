Sit around, dream away the place I'm from
Used to feel so much, now I just feel numb
I could go out tonight, but I ain't sure what for
Call a friend or two I don't know anymore

Sit and listen to the rain
Sit and listen to the rain

Gonna ride down to the river where it runs
Gonna watch TV and pray for decent reruns
...
