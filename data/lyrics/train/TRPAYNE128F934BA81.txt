She's from whom is behind her
Screaming with terror in mind
The nightmare attacks
There's nowhere to run
Theres something screeching out side
She doesn't want to sleep alone
Now she's trapped in her dream
With blood on his gloves, and knives on his hands
He haunts her from the fire below!
chorus
DREAMS OF TERROR
DREAMS OF TERROR
MEET THE GLOVE!

repeat
