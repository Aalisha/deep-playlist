They turn the lights down low
In shadows hiding from the world
Only coming out when it gets cold

The seas part when they hit the floor
The voices carry on and out the door
Everything you touch turns into gold

Like the angel you are
Laugh creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes they penetrate me
Your answer's always 'maybe'
That's when I got up and left
