She bought herself a diamond ring
Before the evening show
A ninety dollar bracelet
On daddy's visa gold
Short black skirts on warm days
With her black socks to her knees
Now she's wearing corduroy
Instead of bongo jeans

She's a preppie girl
Who rules the fashion world
She's a preppie girl
Makes me wanna hurl
Fucking preppie girl
