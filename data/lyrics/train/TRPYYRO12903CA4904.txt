Girl, you say that you love me
There's no doubt I love you
And we're getting closer
To a love that's so true
This could be the beginning
Of a lifetime romance
There's only one thing that's missing
It's time that we took the chance
So why not tonight?
We've waited so long
Something this right
How could it be wrong?
Girl, I know you can take me
Where I've never been
...
