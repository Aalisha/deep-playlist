Don't you know sometimes
These things they don't work out?
Best to walk away
Before your love runs out
Don't you feel sometimes
You don't know who you are
Giving all you got
But you're all just taking off

I'm love.sick
I'm lovesick
I'm love.sick
I'm lovesick

Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
In your arms
In your arms
Cold hearts
Hold the world in your hands
Got me feeling lovesick
