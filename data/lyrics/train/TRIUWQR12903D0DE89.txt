As they done wrong and we done wrong
Now what makes you so certain
All their finger pointing's done
As they don't know what they been told

They say it best
They're already there
And it's not
The way it seems at all

So come on now
Now shake things down tell me
How everyone's gone way to soft
'Cause they don't know what it might take

They say it best
...
