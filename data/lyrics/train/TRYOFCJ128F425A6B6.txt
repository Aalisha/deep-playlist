Lovely to see you, it's really nice to be back here with you
Lovely to see you, so nice to be with you again
It's been a long time
It's been a long time with you gone
Lovely to see you
I'll never make it on my own

(Been so long that you've been gone, its soâ€¦.)
Lovely to see you, I'm so happy now that I can fly
