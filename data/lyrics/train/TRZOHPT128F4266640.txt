I hear a low faint voice that says 
Papa and mama's dead
And it comes from the poor orphan child 
That must be clothed and fed
And it comes from the poor orphan child 
That must be clothed and fed 
And it comes from the poor orphan child 
That must be clothed and fed 

Savior, lead them by the hand
Savior, lead them by the hand
Savior, lead them by the hand
Til they've all reach that glittering strand 

Think of the many children now
Poor little boys and girls
Who once had mother's loving arms
To smooth their golden curls
...
