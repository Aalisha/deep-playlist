Have you ever heard the rattles of agony?
When each minute seems like an eternity
When the silence is broken by the screams of anguish

Perceptions altered by rage
Enclosed in a cage
Howling
Encircled by morbid visions
Which take all the place in me
Submitted to emptiness
Envolves merciless spirit
I have made things I cannot speak
Dreams which never die in me
