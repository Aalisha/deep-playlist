"Yo Black B, what's the deal?
What's popping?"

"Ain't nothing"

"Aight, what's the deal?
We got to get this paper y'all
This cat had to come through or something"

"I hope his paper's is long"

"Aight, youknowI'msayin?
I got this cat about to come up here though
I'ma tell you about it later, oh shit is real
Aight catch ya"

"Now"

I'm in this tight situation
I'm at this chicks crib uptown
Niggaz try to come through and lock me down
Now it seems like a set-up
and niggaz try to wet me from the door
Half a second of gun blaze then I'm in my detour
Shot through the glass hit the balcony
How could she set me up like that?
I caught my balance, shot back
I'm jettin down the fire escape I started sprayin
I'm takin five steps at a time enemy is gaining
on me, my niggaz tried to warn me when my steppin
It's good though cause on a low a nigga had his weapon
I'm jettin down this dead end thrill
I hit the street I got no jacket on my back
But I got my Tim's on my feet
when my life broke across me back against the wall
I'm lookin for my enemies I'm searchin for them all
No bullets being fired so now a nigga's jettin to the corner
that's where most of the people settin
I break-away my burner now I'm searchin for the train
The only motherfucker with no coat I'm in the rain
There's beef walkers walkin I gotta play it cool
Even though he's firm with that I walk covered up my jewel
I'm in a tight situation?

"Black B the shit went down world wide B"

"Word, what happened?"

"Yo nigga started mouthing off
I don't know if nigga's still breathing
All I know is that I made moues"
