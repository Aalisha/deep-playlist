I guess I should've written, Dad
To let you know that I was coming home
I've been gone so many years
I didn't realize you had a phone

I saw your cattle coming in
Boy, they're looking mighty fat and slick
I saw Fred at the service station
Told me that his wife is awful sick

You heard my record on the radio
Oh, well, it's just another song
But I've got a hit recorded
And it'll be out on the market 'fore too long

I got this ring in Mexico
No, it didn't cost me quite a bunch
When you're in the business that I'm in
The people call it puttin' up a front
