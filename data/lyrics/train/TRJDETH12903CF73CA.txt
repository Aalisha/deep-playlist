Eyes like flowers, I love the way you see, you see
You see you're the best thing that's happened to me
Maybe I should fight harder for you
But I said I'd let you go when you wanted me to

Have no power, I see the way you run, you run
You run as soon as we start to have fun
Maybe I will feel better alone
Or just feel something, my heart is turning to stone

So, so slow
Can you feel me letting go?
I, I know that we turn away
When the cracks begin to show
