Nights don't come any longer
Days seem to last forever
Nothing you can do
Could bring him back to you
Forever blue

Trying hard to force a smile behind your tears
Though you try these memories won't disappear
Your heart's still beating out of time

Nights don't come any longer
Days seem to last forever
Nothing you can do
Could bring him back to you
...
