Once upon a lonley time
I could barely make it through the night
It always seemed the sky was falling down on me
Well lifes funny
You don't own it
Things can change in a single moment
Thats what happened to me

Everytime a promise fell through
Everytime my heart broke in two
It was always too dark to see
The horizon
When I thought I had it right in my hands
It would slip right through
Like sand
I didn't know why
But now I see that
Life had other plans for me
