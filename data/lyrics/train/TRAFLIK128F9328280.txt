I started getting juicy when I saw what it does
Nevermind my tunnel vision and skin crawling with bugs
My pores start to hyperventilate, hypes of my mental state
Go psychedelic out of my skeleton to celebrate
This hell is great, rapidly tweaking to corpse with me
Then stumble the bundle, into the freezer like Walt Disney
Drain the liquid from me then stick my earths tummy
When I'm reborn you can't take shit from me

Because dead.
Because dead.
Because dead get to shine all night long.

Because dead.
Because dead.
Because dead get to shine all night long.

Unusual part of a funeral marks the musical dark
Moodkiller got full peaked body-bags of leak with smells reeking through
Zippers
Morticians prescription strength, soaking peoples tuxedos to the bone
There's no place like a funeral home.
My newports get mummified corpses dripping from orifices
