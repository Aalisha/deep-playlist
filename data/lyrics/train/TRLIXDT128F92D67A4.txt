He got a new mercy a new grace
Street corner preacher with the angry face
He got two years off for good behavior
Back in the neighborhood working for the savior

Two old ladies and a junkie noddin' out
He can see for sure that his work is cut out
Though he walks through the shadows workin' for the savior

He understands the need for livin' large
But it's hard to get a job with a felony charge
Now he's workin' in a hospital washing dishes
