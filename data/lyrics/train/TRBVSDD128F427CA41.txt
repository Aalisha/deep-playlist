She changes your mind
When you see the joy in her eyes
It makes you feel
It makes you feel

She draws your eyes from all the things
That made you numb
And makes you feel
And makes you feel

If I could open up my heart
And let her out
I would never have to sing her name aloud
It was your "hello" that kept me hanging on every word
And your "goodbye" that keeps me listening
For your voice around each corner
