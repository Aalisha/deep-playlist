The men stood tall on the battleground
With pride in their eyes
And with faith to guide them
Blood was spilled over the fields
The won but for what cause?
What we do echoes in eternity

Now as brothers they unite
And as enemies the shall apart
For the glory of the Empire
Now I've been betrayed
But there is no one here to tell
I must walk towards the deadline
I must walk it alone ... all alone

On my quest for a new horizon
I've been waiting for so long
In the time of a desperate fighter

Free me from the spell that I'm in
Through these eyes I have seen
With my soul I have been drowning
This journey must end
I must enter the scene once again

My name has been taken
...
