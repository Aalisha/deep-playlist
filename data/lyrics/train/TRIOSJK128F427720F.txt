Well, you can't deny how good he looks
Couldn't find another on the cover of a book
Believe me
Well, I've almost loved him once or twice

But don't be fooled by his innocent smile
He's clever as the devil and just as wild
He's crazy
But a little crazy's kinda nice

He's a heartache
Lookin' for a place to happen
Lookin' for a little action
Livin' for the moment not for lovin'

He's a heartache
Lookin' for a place to happen
Temporary satisfaction
