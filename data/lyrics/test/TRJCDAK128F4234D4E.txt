So you're fading kinda fast
Like the red brake lights rushing past

This more than waking up when you're still at the bar
Lurking around with the queens after dark
We've come a long way just to end up lost
We're drifting, yeah we're drifting, we're drifting alone, alone

Cut it up, cut it up
Until the pain goes away, until the pain goes away
Cut it up, cut it up, cut it up, cut it up
Until the pain goes away, until the pain goes away
...
