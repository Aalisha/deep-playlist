My love, lately I see you just ain't with me
A distance growin', oh, how can this be?
Departing slowly and I don't know how to stop this wind
From the way we're goin' this love is fadin' away

Nobody knows but I know, yeah, I know
They don't see it but I feel it
Without you I never will be as strong
Oh, I need ya, oh, I need ya

You're the definition of a life I would be missin', oh
We can make this right, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose your love

I cannot live without you by my side
Take all my love, take my soul, my mind
Too much to let go, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose my love

You are my love, don't wanna lose my love

Running in circles, let's get it past the hassle
...
