there is a time for flying like an eagle
there is a time for falling like a stone
but if you stop dead
take a look around
maybe you'll watch the seasons flow
and then you'll finally know

as the atmosphere rolls away
though appearances stay the same
you can't fly twice in the same patch of sky
you won't find rest till you're ready to change

...
