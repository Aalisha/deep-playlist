Tryin' to keep my eyes on this windin' road
Oh, but it ain't easy with you paintin' your toes
With your feet up on the dash, your legs so long and tan

You're my Dixie girl with a summer smile
Oh, just enough sweet but just enough wild
Oh, it's just that kinda day everythin's goin' our way

We've got the sunshine, the coolers in the back
All day and all night, we'll see where this might go
We can drive real fast, girl while we take it slow

We've got the warm breeze blowin' off the coast
One hand on your knee, yeah we're gettin' close
I feel a good time, I feel a good time comin' on
