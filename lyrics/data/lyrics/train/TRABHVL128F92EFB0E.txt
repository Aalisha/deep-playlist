The night is starting here we go
(I check out everything)
This is our time to lose control
(What do you want from me)
You line them up we'll put them down
This is so frustrating
To watch you sleezing all around
Yet you keep on smiling

What can I do to make you see?
(You're guilty)
What can I do to make you feel?
(You're wanted)
What can I do to make you see?
(You're guilty)
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow

Her skin reflects behind the blur
I'm intoxicated
