Headed 'cross the border
Looking for a place to play
I left the sun behind
I don't mind
But I think that it looked like rain

Hold back the water
I gotta find time to burn
Hold back the water
I gotta find time to burn

Headed west to Georgia
Looking for the road to L.A.
They say the weather's fine
But the sun don't shine
'Cause the smog's always in the way

Hold back the water
...
