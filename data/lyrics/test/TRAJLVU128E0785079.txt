Sometimes I wish that I could be the person that you are
Just for a minute, long enough that I can break your heart
Can you even comprehend?
Did you even understand a single word that I said?

I wonder why you do the things that boy you do to me
I can't image why you treated me so horribly
Are you listening to me?
Are you trying to ignore me? Do I stutter when I speak?

What you gonna do baby? What you gonna say?
I'm cutting you loose 'cause I've got no time for you
Who you gonna run to? Who you gonna blame?
As a matter of fact I won't look back

I don't want you, I don't need you
So let me tell you where it's at
I'm through with you
Can you understand that?

I don't what you, I don't love you
Hit the road Jack
'Cause I'm through with you
Did you understand that?

Sometimes I wish that you could be the person that I am
