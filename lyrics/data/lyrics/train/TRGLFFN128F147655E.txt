I'll let it burn.
Words in a dirty paper cup.
And I'm gonna turn, cause I've had it with this place for now.
I'm gonna find shelter where you can't call me, where you can't grab me.

If I got to choose, had the opportunity to switch location or set my mind on whatever I wanted to,
I would take it right away from you.
