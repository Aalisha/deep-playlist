Sun was out
the fish were swimming
in choke polluted water
all the fishes
dying from them toxic
seebees dumpin in our stream
but we didn't give a fuck
ya know we had some
cheap american brews
ya know some nice hot dogs
figured ya know... get out the
little transistor radio,
sit back relax have a nice
little summer barbecue

It's a beautiful,
what a beautiful,
it's a beautiful,
...
