Yesterday my troubles seemed so far away
And now there's nothing left to do but watch the choices slip away
And all the voices ricochet – our conversation disappears
In recrimination – voices ricochet – they're just
Words in the distance, like birds inside my head, and
The water runs red – you're a
Stone on the windscreen, you shatter the world ahead

Voices ricochet – you can picture a big ‘thirteen', try to extinguish me
Relinquish me from the damage
It's only mortality…
It's the echoes of carnage
Now the view is all tarnished – the rest is just wreckage
...
