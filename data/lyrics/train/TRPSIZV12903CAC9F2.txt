See the sky open up, then turn crimson red
Judgement time is here tonight, all will soon be dead
Centuries past have warned about doom that has arrived
Armageddon upon the Earth, evil will arise
Unholy ones desecrate, 'cause they gotta burn
Coming from the other side, here we now return
If there's a knocking from the coffin
Then you better let us out
We rule through ultra-violence
And we are foaming at the mouth

Watch them die
