(All)
You're the last of a breed and it's begining to stink
So you take to the clouds with your bible and drink
The proclaimation was made, the proclaimation was felt
There's a new notch on your belt
Very carefully you've protected your house
Now there's no getting out

(Chorus)
It's too cold
It's too late
It's too far
