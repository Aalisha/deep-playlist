You can't seem to see past your own reflection
Caught up in the halls of your introspection
And you're staring at your mirror on the wall
Asking, "Who is the fairest of them all?"
â€˜Cause, Lord, I know it's not me

If only you could see
That you've already been set free

Come on, come on
Let's throw our mirrors down
Come on, come on
Let's shatter the glass on the ground

But you say, "Hold on, if I could just try this one thing.
Well, I know I can change and that would change everything."
