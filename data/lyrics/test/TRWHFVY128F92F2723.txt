don’t tell me It’s over just yet because when you said you’d be here forever
I figured that bought us some time
but time past through us and left you wanting more but this is it kid,
our hearts beat for it, it doesn’t get any better than this
so don’t look back, don’t look down
what could’ve been isn’t even an option
