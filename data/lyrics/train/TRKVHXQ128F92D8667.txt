I just don't wanna be lonely
Cause the lights, were shining ever so bright
In my hand there's a pulse of my beating heart
Biting my tongue there's a plastic man on the telephone

Can you see the bright light? Shining, I dont know
can you see the bright light? Shining, shining, shining

I saw a UFO and nobody believes me
I was sixteen miles from home with nobody in sight
I saw a UFO but nobody believes me
And Whats it gonna take to get me back home tonight
