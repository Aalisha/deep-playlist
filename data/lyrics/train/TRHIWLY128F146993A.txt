Touch my hand
It's only me, listen
I'm here.

Come to stand
In sultry fields
With you.

And now
Old dummy day
I know
Is over this way.

I'm laughing
Saw you gonna kiss me
You see
Yeah as I said.

One day she won't
A lonely bird
Alone.

Judgement day
Saw the world it's gone
Unheard.

Sold the sea
A lot how it feels to me.
