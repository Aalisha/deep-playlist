(whisper: yes yes)

Yes yes yall

Yes yes yall
Looks like im freakin' some more
Yes yes yall
Freak freak yall

Looks like im freakin' some more

I'm a spirit
See im looking at my bed and my body's still in it
Like in a minute sixty seconds
I reckon
Like i be floating, not stepping
But checkin' out the mad levitation
