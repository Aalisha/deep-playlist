Dirty fingers, please believe us
Everybody dies
Guilty perfect, murder suspect
That was not your crime

You never do nothing (hey) and that's all you do (hey)
You never get lonely cause nobody gets you
Wake up, wake up
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you

The weight has been hard on your back
You're wearing well out of respect
Slowly it's dragging you down
I'd never call it that
You're running away and you feel
