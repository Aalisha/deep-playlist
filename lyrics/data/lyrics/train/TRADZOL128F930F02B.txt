Don't do it, cut through it
Keep your mind on the track
Or you know you're gonna screw it
Don't do it, get to it
There's a smile on her face
And you know that you can do it

After one, the playing's done
It's time to end the game
One more drink, you just might sink
Don't care about the name

Love toys
She's just another piece for the boys
Like an action set
Love toys, better roll the dice
Bad boys
Just playing a game

Don't do, hold to it
It's love on the rocks
One more shot is gonna do it
...
