I sing oh-oh,
Oh, oh, oh,
I sing oh-oh,
Oh, oh, oh,
...

Yeah, now, I love my baby,
And my baby loves me.
Well, if we could get together,
Ow! how happy we could be.

I sing oh-oh,
Oh, oh, oh,
...

Yeah, my, all night,
And all day,
Well, the reason I'm unhappy,
That my baby went away.

I sing oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh,
...

Yeah, my, all night,
...
