Well Suize, oh Suzie
Come on and let me in
There's love in the air
Love on my mind
Love in the pores of my skin

I worked real hard, all week long
Kept on singin' the same damn song
It's one for the money
Two for the show
Paid on Friday and I'm ready to go

And if I'm wrong or if I'm right
I don't give a damn tonight
