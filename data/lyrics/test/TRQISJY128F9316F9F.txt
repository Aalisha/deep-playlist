French pedicure in the air
French pedicure

French pedicure in the air, it's plain to see that you like 'em there
It's never too much, yearning your touch
French pedicure in the air, it's plain to see that you like 'em there
Love is beautiful also physical

I been thinking of ways to make you fantasize about me
I been thinking of moves, the pressure I put upon your body
When I demonstrate girl, you're extremely over excited
But don't hyperventilate just relax please, baby invite it

All the faces you make when I'm off in it
Got me pulling your hair girl, let's get ignorant
Ain't nobody gon' freak you like you know I can
Your swagger, your style girl when you smile
And I grab your legs and your

French pedicure in the air, it's plain to see that you like 'em there
It's never too much, yearning your touch
French pedicure in the air, it's plain to see that you like 'em there
