Defiantly opposing your
Weakening the foundation
Jeopardizing stability with betrayal
Rebelling for reasons to defy your kind, Treason
Of the highest degree
Do you think severance will set you free?
Think again
Disconnect from us and
Depend on all against one in the end
Fend for your life as your strength descends
Your defenses will fail
Against the masses you were born into
Retribution, execution, sentenced for your false delusions
You have chosen to be disfavored by your equals as a traitor
Traitor, your acts of sedition will have you punished by death
