Car broke down on highway 49 today
Had my shades on
You were drivin' by
Pulled over to the side to help me baby

Next thing I know
You had fixed everything
Before you hit the road
Let me buy a coffee for you at the Corner Caf'

Sun shinin'
I was drivin'
You were ridin', ridin' by
Just drivin'
You were ridin'
I was stranded on a warm and sunny day
And you came my way

Where did time go
Enjoyed your company my friend
By the way thank you again
For all of your time
Was very much appreciated
