Noticing all these changes,
widening our fucking ranges,
Writing down all these pages,
Usually filled with rage when I jump onto the stages.
I've been demolishing your bullshit for ages,
This time I'm breaking it, our friendship, your smile.
See you in the city while you are faking it.

From Hertz Island we expanded,
Never delivered or landed,
More than the label demanded.
Competition telling us to follow those guidelines, and to stay right handed
But music comes from the heart, lyrics from my head to my hand, and I 'm left handed.

My friend, watch out for the traitors.
I see them but I try to close my eyes for the haters.

My friend, watch out for the traitors.
