(Pride) a deeper love
(Pride) a deeper love
(Pride) a deeper love
Woah woah woah woah
(Pride) a deeper love
(Pride) a deeper love
(Pride) a deeper love
Woah woah woah woah

People let me tell you I work hard every day
I get up out of bed, I put on my clothes
'Cause I've got bills to pay
Now it ain't easy but I don't need no help
I've got a strong will to survive
I've got a deeper love, deeper love
Deeper love inside and I call it

Pride (a deeper love)
Pride - a deeper love
(Pride) a deeper love
Woah woah woah woah
It's the (pride) power that gives you
The (pride) strength to survive
(Pride - a deeper love)
(Woah woah woah woah)

Yeah ooh yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Now I've got love in my heart, it gives me the strength
To make it through the day
Pride and love (pride is) oh respect for yourself
And that's why I'm not looking for
