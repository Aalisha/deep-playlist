Oh, there's something that I want to say to you
That jumpin' in your face just wouldn't do
'Cause summer in the sun don't pay.

And sure, if crazy's what you feel then tell her so
There's something on your plate's still getting cold
Well, ain't that just a crying shame?

It's hard having fun when you can't see the sun anymore
Wasting my time and I see when you're following me to the door
It's hard having fun when you can't see the sun anyway
Wasting my time and I see when you're following me all the way

There's black jacks runnin' down my back and I say STOP!
'Cause I love you, baby
I fight hard and blue, with you
When I'm down and I say
Black jacks runnin' down my back and I say STOP!
'Cause I love you, baby
I fight hard and blue, with you
'Cause you drive me crazy

New York nothing
Come and get stuck in
Won't you come rocking?
Cos I gotta feel
...
