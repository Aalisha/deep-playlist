Setting the tone, hoping to reach what I aimed for
Trying so hard to figure out what I came for
But it really don't matter, speaking nowhere

And something was said without meaning
Doing what I was meant to, stop you from reeling
But it really don't matter, really don't matter no more

So tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel when you die
Tell me how you feel
Tell me how you feel when you die
How am I supposed to rob you now?

Tired like hell, sleeping away till the evening
Wondering why it hurts when I think about leaving
But it really don't matter

Nowhere to go and nothing is left to believe in
Looking around, I can't understand what I'm seeing
But it really don't matter, really don't matter no more
