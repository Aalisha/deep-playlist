Don't run too fast
Like a shot from a gun
Don't jump too high
And knock out the sun
Don't stray too far
Out on your own
When you finally come knocking
When you finally come knocking
There'll be nobody home
Nobody home

Don't pull too hard
Like a kite in the wind
You'll break the string
When I reel you in
Don't take off flying
All on your own
When you finally come knocking
When you finally come knocking
There'll be nobody home
...
