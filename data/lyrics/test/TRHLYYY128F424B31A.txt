Ashes of burned memories cover my marks from infinity. but just how many
Times i have walk this same path over again.

I can see the shine of deception in your eyes. i was born to hate you and
Your kind. you promise heaven, but all you can give is lies.

I see the fear of being left alone in your eyes. all those ruined lives,
Corrupted minds with lies.

Now those forgotten souls scream your name from behind the graves. there
Will be no tomorrow, there wasn't one today. every morning you will wake up
...
