All the Polish workers fight to make their stand
And behind them every honest working men
In unity there's each other
And your friend becomes your brother
And in the tyrant's heart will be a lesson learned

Give them hope, give them strength, give them life
Like a candle burning in the black of night
We are with you in our hearts and in our minds
And we'll pray for our nation through its darkest times

I know that your hearts are made of a further kind
