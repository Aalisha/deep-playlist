I'm sitting on the roof again
Staring at the stars
Hope lies in the shadows
I wonder where you are
Are you listening for my voice
I feel you so close yet you're far away

Sing for me one more song
Play for me one more time
I can feel you though you're not here
Your voice whispers in the breeze and you are near

Through everything around me I find comfort in you
Through trials and the heartache
Your words, they speak the truth
