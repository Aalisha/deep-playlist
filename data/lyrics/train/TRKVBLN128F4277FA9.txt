[Verse 1] 
I said listen, I'm a nigga on a mission 
Do what I gotta to get my people in position 
Help 'em envision a better living condition 
Stop putting so much trust in your religion 
They couldn't conquer without division 
Boy you still black, I don't care if you Catholic or Christian 
Police'll still fuck you up, young buck 
Bust you in your head, leave your body by the dump truck 
Revolution got me pumped up 
But it's still a fact black people still think so fucked up 
How they got money to go war with whoever wrecked the buildings 
...
