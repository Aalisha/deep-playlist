Hushed up touched up
I see myself and all I've fucked up
I've been sold a million times
It's just as well
I can take three thousand times
Fine
They get at you inside you
You're always hiding inside you

Got far looked hard
I've seen myself and all I've messed up
I've been told a million times
It's just as well
I can see as the signs go by
Fine
