Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on

I've been doing this my way, your way, our way
I can't make it work
When all I have is not enough
I've been doing all I can, my plan, your plan
And all I get is hurt
This game we're playing has to stop

I got you stuck in my head
And all you do is breaking me
I can't continue taking this
I tried my best to understand
But I cannot make sense of you
I've got to take a stand now baby

I don't want to waste another day
I don't want to live my life this way
I'm tired
I just want to lie back down and
I don't want to waste another night
I don't want to keep on chasing lights
So go on, go on, go on,
Go on, go on, go on
Bye Bye
