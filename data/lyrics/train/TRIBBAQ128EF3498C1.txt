I remember Sunday morning
I would meet him at the park
We'd walk together hand in hand
'Til it was almost dark
Now I wake up Sunday morning
Walk across the way to find
Nobody waiting for me
Sunday's just another day

Sunday will never be the same
(Sunday will never be the same)
I've lost my Sunday song
He'll not be back again
