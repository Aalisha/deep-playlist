ENDLESS...
APOCALYPSE...
ENDLESS... ENDLESS...
APOCALYPSE...

There wasn't any reason
To change the melody
Are you a real person
Or do you just play one on TV?

People say - why don't you die?
I keep waking up and when I do I'm alive

Slipping on a lampshade
Wishing you were me
You're just wishing for poop
But happy with pee
We're just part of one filthy family

Its hard to feels so down
...
