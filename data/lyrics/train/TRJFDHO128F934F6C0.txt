Gonna build a big fence around my baby hum-hum oh yeah
Gonna build a big fence around my baby hum-hum oh yeah

I like everything that you do why honey that's why I'm in love with you
Gonna build a big fence around my baby so they can't steal my baby from me
I just love the way you sigh and the twinkle in your eye
