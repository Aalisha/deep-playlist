Miss joker, joker laughing at me
Oh,? cause I know all of your schemes lately
Like the way you move your hips
Seductive licks for the money clip
Do you own this? And I know this, that? s when I noticed

She looked me over and moved so easily
But, in fact, fuck all that, I like the way you use me
The evidence is missing with my Steiny
Turn it on until dawn, I like the way you use me

Welcome back to the counterfeit stacks
Baby slow down, you? ll have a heart attack
? Cause I like what I see, oh, my approach into the night
