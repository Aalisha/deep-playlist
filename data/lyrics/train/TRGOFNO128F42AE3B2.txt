Here I am laid bare at the end of my rope
I've lost all hope, so long
Molly Connolly just broke up with me
Over the revealing nature of the songs

You goddamn kids had best be gracious
With the merch money you spend
'Cause for you, I won't ever have rough sex
With Molly Connolly again

Here I am, laid down at the end of my rope
Wishing I had not been born
Now I've spewed too much, I can never shut it up
I thought you should be warned
