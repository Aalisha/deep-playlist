Deep in the heart of every man
Lies a hidden dream or plan
To be a millionaire
Life without a care

Hey cool cat
Does this apply to you?
Oh don't you lie?
No, you lie
Cause' you can't hide the truth

I can see what's behind those eyes
YOUR tongue is so twisted from telling lies
You might think you're strong
