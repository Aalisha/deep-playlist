Do u gonna be there?
Are u sure u gonna call back?
When I'm calling up and all that?
Did u know that I'm sick?
Did u think I would quit?
Did u think I'll go home?

Can't u hear I'm sick?
I'm lovesick
Can't u hear it explode?
Like my heart is quick
I'm lovesick
Can't u hear it explode?
All down
Can we make it up?

Can u call it a sound?
Can u move to the beat?
Can I listen in?
Can u feel my beat?
Can u feel the bass?
Can u hear the clapping?
Can u make it a sound?
