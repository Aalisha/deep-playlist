It was almost Christmas time,
There I stood in another line
Trying to buy the last gift or two,
Not really in the Christmas mood.
Standing right in front of me
Was a little boy waiting anxiously,
Pacing round like little boys do,
And in his hands, were a pair of shoes.
And his clothes were worn and old.
He was dirty from head to toe,
And when it came his time to pay,
I couldnt believe what I heard him say.

Sir, I wanna buy these shoes for my momma please.
It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size.
Could you hurry, Sir?
Daddy says there's not much time.
You see she's been sick for quite a while;
And I know these shoes will make her smile.
And I want her to look beautiful if Momma meets Jesus tonight.

He counted pennies for what seemed like years
Then the cashier said Son there's not enough here.
