It's been so long since we said goodbye
I guess that's the reason why I sit and cry
I miss you, baby, every day and night
It's been so long since I held you tight

Everything's different since you went away
I get so lonely every night and day
I can't help feeling that you ought to know
I love you baby and I miss you so

Nothin' ever seems the same
My sunshine has turned to rain
Every time I hear your name
...
