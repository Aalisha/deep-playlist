Oh she can wait,
For what I can give,
She knows what I am but,
She won't believe me,
Is it all ok?
Will I come off the lightest?
I can't believe it,
It's always like this,

Kept it at bay
Yes you kept your words
There on your mouth
But it's not what I heard

If I follow the light
That I deem the brightest
I won't believe that
It's always like this

No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not whole
I'm not whole
You waste it all
...
