It? s changing all to yellow and it? s carving a path
So now we? re on our way
It? s taking us on journeys
While we wipe away frowns amongst the crowded place

Say why you never call me? No, you never seem to call me
Now that I? m okay
I? ll beat you in the end
And every time you turn around, here comes the coming of age

Oh, she saw my party, she saw my party
Oh, she saw my party, she saw my party
