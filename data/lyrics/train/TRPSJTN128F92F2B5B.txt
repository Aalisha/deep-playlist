["hey" repeated throughout the Intro and Chorus*]

[Intro: Classified - talking]
My word, ha!

[Chorus: Cuts by DJ Jorun - w/ ad libs]
"We don't even speak the same kind of language"
[Dr. Dre:] "They want to know if he still got it"
[Classified:] "Plug my mic back in, let me begin"
"I'm on the mic, you're on the run"
"Because, this is how it should be done"
"Word up"

[Verse 1: Classified]
Yeah, uh, yeah, I wipe off a fresh pair of Nikes and roll my pair of
Dice (yeah)
Infectious, I'm passed on like a parasite (ha)
I've seen the Eiffel Tower and all the Paris sites
But comin back home, there ain't no comparin, right?
It's time to play ball and it's a big inning, I mean the beginning's here
And the picture is clear
Your whole team's played out like a pitcher's career
While we home celebratin with a pitcher of beer
And yeah I do this rap thing but don't say that I sing
That's just me spreadin the icing (icing)
Huh, I'm goin end to end like hockey icing (yeah)
Fuck up the flow, so you don't know if I'm wrong or writing
I've been here, holdin down base (base)
Blowin out the speakers, turnin up the bass (bass)
Back to the basics, basically I do this shit faithfully
And no one is replacin me, take a seat

[Chorus: Cuts by DJ Jorun - w/ ad libs]
[Dr. Dre:] "They want to know if he still got it"
[Classified:] "Plug my mic back in, let me begin"
"I'm on the mic, you're on the run"
"Because, this is how it should be done"
