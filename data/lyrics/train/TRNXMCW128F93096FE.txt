When I was a little girl
I never thought much of this world
Like why the night was night
And day was day
But my mama always made me feel so happy
And I always would start to smile
When I heard her say

You've got the love to last
If you really want to make it
And they'll always be someone there to help you sing
Go on and love to last
All you got to do is try it
And find you'll have all the strength

When I grew a little bigger
That's when I begin to figure out
What made me different from my friends
And I found it wasn't something on the outside
It was the happiness in my heart I felt within

You've got to love to last
If you wanna keep on growing
And it's really not hard to do once you start
Come on and love to last
And your sunshine will be glowing
And they'll see all the love and joy
That's in your heart
...
