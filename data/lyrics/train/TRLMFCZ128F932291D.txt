If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby

I wanna take a little time
To refresh your mind
Because the boys are back in town
With a different kinda funk
Who's gots da funk?
We gots da funk, right
Everybody wanna boogie down tonight
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Move 'em 'round from side to side
I got what it takes, the beats, that brace, the funky bass
I'll give your body crazy shakes, come on

I heard somebody say
(What?)
She's at the party so
(Who?)
I'm gonna get me some
(Aah)

If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Come and get it on baby
I want it now baby
If ya gettin' down baby
I want it now baby
Move it all around baby
I want it now baby
