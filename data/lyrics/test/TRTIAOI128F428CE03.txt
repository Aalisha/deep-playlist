Born, a human life into this world.
Dead, the sad result from disease.
A century of sacrifice is lost in greed.
In a time of massive wealth, where not one sees.

Chemical children are raised in the streets,
Their whoring mothers begging beside.
In prisons the riots are breeding resistance
The starving all seek to be fed.

A shit-city built on the backs of the poor
where the real world is buried beneath.
While tourists and business, partners in greed
devour the fruit of the land.

Starving and dying, assassins surround to kill them.
Praying for something or someone to set them free.

Life in Babylon, post-A.D.,
defined in terms of what can you do for me.
