Vision of darkness, mad gothic splendour
Rhyme of primordial neverending war
Carved in the white rock under the ghost town
Son of the darklands, black pride of Kron

Two-hundred nor of unholy stone
Speak through the tears of desperate souls
Legend and myth will never reveal
The infinite pain behind Nekron's will

Wars of the underworld
Fought by our brothers who'll never return
Wars of the underworld
Fought by our brothers who'll never return

Broken emotions wet from the shy rain
Lords of the lost time dream of great revenge
No chance for mind's rest, fear in the dawn's breath
...
