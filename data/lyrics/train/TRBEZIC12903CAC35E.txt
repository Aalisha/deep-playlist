When there's nothin' to believe in, I believe in you
Forget the past and let my hand in yours, be the proof
Though the strong could be my company, you're the one I choose
So remember, I believe in you

I know it feels like every eye is watching you
Waiting for you to fall, expecting you to lose
But I see victory, so all you have to do
Is remember, I believe in you

I believe, even when I see you cryin'
I believe, let me dream for you
When nothin' comes from tryin'
Oh, remember, I believe in you
