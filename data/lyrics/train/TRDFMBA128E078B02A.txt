Guarding yourself from the love of another
Left you with nothing tonight
Why does it sound like the devil is laughing
Leaving me haunted tonight
You did decide

Now I want you when you're gone, and now it's like
You're holding something just in front of me
Well, then I can't allow this to become another
One of those times that I'm left in the cold dead
There's no compromise
Just another tie
I know I need to sever
...
