Caught red handed
Blood drops cover your face
The gun still smoking in your hand
You did not do it

The rest of the world is always wrong
As you see it from where you stand
Always try to find another
Fool to sacrifice your mother

They probably know that there in your game
Anybody really will do
fine as long as it wont be you
You let the dice decide whos to blame

Bite it, Bite it like a bulldog
Bite like a Bulldog
To the Bone, Never let it go

Bite it, Bite it like a bulldog
Bite it like a Bulldog
