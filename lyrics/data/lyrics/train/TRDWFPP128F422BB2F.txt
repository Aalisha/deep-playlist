Doo doo doo
Do do do
Ya ya
Doo doo doo
Do do do

Hello friend, it's me again
I just called to tell you
Even though I miss you so
I've been thinking of you
All my dreams are coming true, at last... oooh

The perfect ending to a wonderful year (ooooh)
Would be to celebrate the good times with you here
Cuz I know
For sure
I never wanted anything more

The greatest gift that there could be
thats underneath my Christmas tree
Would be the same my whole life through
I'd spend the perfect Christmas with you
Though the winter seems so long
My faith in love has kept me strong
...
