Too many problems, oh why am I here?
I need to be me, 'cause you're all to clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?
At least I gotta know what I wanna be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely, you got no-one
You got your body in suspension
That's a problem, problem, problem
The problem is you
Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want and you fade away
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five
It's too much fun of being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You work for me, living for the screen
