Early in the morning clouds are dropping on my head
Remind me the things last night I should have left unsaid
So please forgive the words I use, my mind it tends to run

My head it tends to stray away sometimes I cant see clear
Oh dear, oh dear
In spite of all the things I said, I always want you near
