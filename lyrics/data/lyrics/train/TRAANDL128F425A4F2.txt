I told you before and I tell you again
It doesn't seem to matter what I say
I told you before and I tell you again
You don't want to listen anyway

I pick up the car keys I walk down the stairs
I'm gonna see my brother he's in town
There's money on the kitchen table

I'm really glad it came this far 'cos you were
Really close, yeah, really close to be my wife
But now I want nothing, I want nothing
But for you to get the fuck out of my life
