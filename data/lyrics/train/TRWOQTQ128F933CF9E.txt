[Killah Priest]
Yo, there's still time
As the door close, the cold wind blows
Down America like the Wall of Jericho
Some will walk the sheet close
Many are called but few are chose
Who knows until the day they be exposed
UFO's surround the globe
The world is prepared to explode
So I grab hold of the North Pole
Not tryin to meet the lost soul, at the crossroad
We're bein sucked up into the black hole
Young becomes old, mighty clouds roll
Unfold the scrolls that were foretold
by the forefathers, the end of the world saga
Streets flooded with lava, mommas and pappas
Toddlers, hip-hoppers, and rastas
Rock stars and mobsters, above streets in helicopter
Filled with doctors, readin the death roster
Guts spillin out like pasta
Sky, misty, often tipsy, from off the whiskey
The gypsy, told me, my chances, were risky
Cops, pull up and frisk me
but never could they get me, too shifty
I will go, into my dungeon, and summon up the second comin
People started runnin,
Aliens with hair like rastafarians
Captured, placed inside of aquariums, studied by scientists
This is it, The Apocalypse
I see the mother ship, above the cliff, over Egypt
It made me sea sick
I see the eclipse, and the abyss, the night shifts

Chorus: Hell Razah (repeat 2X)
