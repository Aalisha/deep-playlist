I saw you burning in a starlit night
Just like a pantheon of comets in flight
Time of place or face, no matter
Now listen to an idiot chatter

Truth be told you're at least half gold
I love ya like a dog loves to run and ramble
Make the brook babble and let the bell ring
Don't let the action of factual things
Fracture your casual swing

You are the sun and that's LAW
I got a mouth like a donkey chewing on straw
Calling all stones, calling all streams, one piece many parts undivided in a dream
