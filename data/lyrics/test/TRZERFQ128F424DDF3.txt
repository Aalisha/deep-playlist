Time sitting on
waiting for the mood to make me real
and then I will reveal
that you, you are the only one who knows
just which way the wind blows
to us it's real

if you believe in god
then believe in me
cause when you get there you will no
it's not a crossroads it's a junction
where the devil sells his soul
...
