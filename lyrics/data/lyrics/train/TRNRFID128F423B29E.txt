Sarah
Won't you tell me her name
I've been waiting here for hours
In the garden by the flowers
You're so shy
So just open your eyes
The boys all form a line to be written out in time
A long, long, long, long, time ago

Emergency
I think I am falling apart
Emergency
I think I am losing the fight
And I don't know if I can do it
...
