Some folks are born made to wave the flag
ooo, they're red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"
ooo, they point the cannon at you, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no senator's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me... I ain't no fortunate one, no
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, yeah
...
