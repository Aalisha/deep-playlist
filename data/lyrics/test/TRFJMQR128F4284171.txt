I dreamed I was a bottle of bourbon
Trapped in a burning down house
Then I heard you screamin' in the other room
Tryin' to catch that roustabout
Breakin' lamps and tippin' over tables
Rubbin' your big knees to the bone
I heard an ashtray fly when he said goodbye
I was adreamin' I was still at home

So I jumped a couple trucks goin' southbound
Tucked the money in the toe of my boot
Left my bills in the bottom of the chimney and made
off with my best friend's suit
Flyin' on down the two-lane, sittin' in the free man's zone
And then another Peterbilt turned over
It wasn't traffic it was just like home
...
