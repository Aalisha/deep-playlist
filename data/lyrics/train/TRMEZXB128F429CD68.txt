At one
I was sitting and thinking of all the beautiful things he could have become
Instead of a lyrical oracle and I'm the most appreciative one
'Cause I'm in a world of my own when I'm into it I don't want anything else
And nothing can bother me when I'm inside of it cause I'm outside of myself 

Midnight Marauder spinning on my stereo
Mr. Desmond Dekker has a crown made of gold
The kids are alright 
A what-a what I hear
London calling 
But I have no fear
Ms. Ella Fitzgerald got no peer
A Music sweet music make the truth so clear
Classics of love make a dark day light
If you don't believe the words then just look into their eyes
