When the sky is filled up with storms and heavy rain
And trouble starts sliding across your mind
It's hard for me to see
Which road I've gotta take
I know I need to find a way to leave it all behind

Let it shine on
Let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

Let it shine on
Yeah, let it shine on
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me
