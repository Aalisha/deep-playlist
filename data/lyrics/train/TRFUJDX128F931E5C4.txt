I see you with your girls and I truly do apologize
Yes, I really realize you're not here for these dudes
I see that big ring on your hand and trust me, girl, I understand
Back at home you got a man and that's not the way I move

But when the DJ threw this record on, I saw you throw up your arms
Close your eyes and sing along, guess you like this tune
And your legs can't stay still at all, those high-heel shoes, you took them off
So let me escort you to the floor, girl

Can I borrow you? Maybe he wouldn't mind
If for a song or two, you can act like you're mine
Oh, can I borrow you, girl? Would that be ok?
Maybe when the song is done we can just walk away

And I watching as you go
(Walk away)
As you
(Walk away)
As you
(Walk away)

And I watch you as you go
