I hear voices but there's no one there,
You speak to me in another language.
Computer says it's a binary code,
It's such a pity I can't understand it.

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking.

I see a ship from a golden sky,
I sent a message. Will they understand it?
Computer's ready but to overload,
This isn't happening the way I planned it.

It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
It's not me talking,
...
