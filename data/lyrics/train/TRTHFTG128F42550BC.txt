[DJ Paul sample]
bustin with that 45 make them bitches back it up, back it up [repeat 4X]

[Verse 1]
I'm 5 foot 8, from the Bay, white as fuck and do not play
If you want me, come and get me, Fraiser Drive is where I stay
Won't you come on down my way, I hope that you ain't afraid
You won't even need the numbers 'cause we posted every day
On the corner or in my front yard where we smoke marijuana
Sit back, wait on the police to ride by and stare so we can dog'em
Know wha I'm sayin, they can't fade us, so what the fuck you think you gon do?
We HCP, clicked up with the rest of the world and yes we deep foo
You don't wanna end up an example of what we would to to haters mayne
Victimz have said that we bring the pain and witnesses that we all the same
I don't wanna stress on otha shit that y'all been constantly questionin
Shit that I'm preachin come from people teachin
The shit that I remember so deep within
And when I get to where I'm gonna be in my successful life
I'ma look down at y'all haters in disgrace 'cause I done took my flight
And when I get ready shine in that stage of my life
I'ma make sure all y'all haters remember me and I'm gon allrigh

[Chorus]
So many haters in this world they wanna see us fall
