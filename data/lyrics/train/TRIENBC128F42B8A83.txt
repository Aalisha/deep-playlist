Sometimes when I'm on my own
My bed too cold for one alone
I try to lose myself in dreams
But you're not here so I can't sleep
I suffer when the night is long
My heart cries out for yours is gone
You take me to the edge of heartbreak

Then I turn and there you are
Sometimes near and yet so far
You touch my hair, you pull me close
We're cheek to cheek and nose to nose
Your velvet eyes so dark and deep
You're like an angel when you sleep
...
