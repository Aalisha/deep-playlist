Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar
I got my buddies and a beer I got a dream - I need a car
You got me begging on my knees c'mon and throw the dog a bone
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone

Baby baby
Rock 'n roll and brew
Rock 'n roll and brew
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you
Rock 'n roll and brew
Rock 'n roll and brew
I know that you and I oh we got better things to do
I don't know who you are or what you do
Or where you go when you're not around
I don't know anything about you baby
But you're everything I'm dreaming of
I don't know who you are
But you're a real dead ringer for love
A real dead ringer for love

(Cher:) Ever since I can remember you been hanging around this joint
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do
But a girl - she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew
Baby baby, baby baby
