Hate is nothing new
Murderers watching every step
Ignorance, oblivious to all the evidence
Repent, for all that were innocent
Forget, so we all can rest

Hey it's the end of time
We all will see it our lifetime
We all will die
Violently

It's painted in the sky
We all can see it
but ignore it, and live our lives

The fear of dying
it finds us, no matter where we hide ourselves
Hide, some place in hell
In spite of living
The dead men
Know where we can hide away
