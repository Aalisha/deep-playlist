My name ain? t up in lights
But I? m a hero in this bar
And I play four big shows a night
With just me and my guitar

I don? t make a lot of money
And I don? t have a lot of gear
I don? t sell a lot of records
But I sure sell a lot of beer

If you wanna hear Bob Dillon
I? ll play like a Rollin? Stone
If you wanna hear Bob Wills
I? ll play the Rose of San Antone
