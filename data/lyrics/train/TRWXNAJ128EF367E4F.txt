This is re-evolution
Regeneration
Re-presentation
What's your destination?
Maybe star status amongst the constellations
No conversation without contemplation
Premier lyricist in deep concentration
Beware
Or you'll suffer severe complications
Straightening learning curves with re-education
First lesson-
Never question my dedication
Most of ya'll are in it
For commercial presentation
No rockin' without the proper documentation
Fuckin' with it before you're committed
Is fornication
I rock hard
With a rock-hard fortification

Nowadays
MCs are either pimps, players
Killers or murderers
We drop jewels like
Two clumsy-ass burglars
Straight tripping on MCs
More than Vincent
