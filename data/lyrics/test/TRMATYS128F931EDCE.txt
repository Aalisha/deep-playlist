Here we are once again, it's the same old story
You and I, me and you claiming we're just friends
When are we gonna learn that we don't have a choice?
We both know how it ends so we just choose to pretend

In a way it's all secondary for the way that things have been
We fall out of love and back in love again
We'll go round and round and still say we're just friends
