My hands are tied behing my back my face is red with hate
I know i've tried to be the better man but I can't accept this fate

It's seems every time I cross the line and wonder that
Am supposed to figure which way you want to go
And I can see that misery is plaguing you
And i'm supposed to be there when you have no one

Take my hand i'll take from where you stand
