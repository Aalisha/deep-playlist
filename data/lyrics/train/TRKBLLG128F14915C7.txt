"Jingle Bells"
(with The Puppini Sisters)

- Merry Christmas, ladies
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Buble
- Are you ready to sing a little Jingle Bells?
- Yeeeees

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
...
