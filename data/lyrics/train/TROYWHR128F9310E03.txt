I used to change my accent, change my stance
My phone number, the way I dance
Some people change lovers like they change their sheets
But I won't change you, honey, you're for keeps

I used to think I had to change the way I am
To feel better, to get a man
But once I stopped trying I fell for you
You fell for me, so I'll stay the same for you

Oh yeah, I know that I'm not perfect, baby
Oh yeah, it's no reason to go crazy
Oh yeah, boy you can always count on me
For better or for worse, I will always put you first

Now that I have found you, you've changed my life
'Cause you're the one who showed me I had everything right
We're never gonna differ 'cause we know it's true
So don't change me and I won't change you
