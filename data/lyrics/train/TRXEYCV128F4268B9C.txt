(Muir, Pleasants)

I don't know what is it
But I'm acting like I know
I don't like what I see
But I never let it show
You can not understand
What you were not meant to find
So I lock it in a vault
Halfway up my head
Halfway up my head

Halfway up head
Halfway up my head - that's where it got stuck
If you're trying to change me - well you're just out of luck
I know what I am and how I must be
