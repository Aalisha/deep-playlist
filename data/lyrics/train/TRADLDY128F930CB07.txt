I am a courier
Crawling in the dirt
Toward the front line
As the crow flies
A note stashed in my shirt
From the Prince of Wales
Far above the field
With his marshalls
And their chain-mail
Their banners taut and high

I did not ask him what the note said
He did not offer to explain
It s not my job to ask the questions
I m just the courier
