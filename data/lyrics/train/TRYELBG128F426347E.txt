These wars of words are pointless
Nothing gets accomplished, no
To see you bent and broken
You'd think I'd like it

But I don't
It disgusts me
That I can be
So petty and so weak

Yeah, You're sorry
Everyones always so sorry
Yeah,
And I thought I heard you say
"To lose is not ok, win is the only way"
Guess what I did with my day
