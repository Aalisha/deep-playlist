She can do anything at all
Have anything she pleases
Power to change what she thinks is wrong
So what could she want with me?

Wait just one minute here
I can see that she's trying to read me
Suddenly I know

She's going to change the world
She's going to change the world
She's going to change the world
But she can't change me
No she can't change me
