Oh, oooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah

Sun's bursting in through the drapes
I awake as a new day starts
Feeling I am clear in my mind
I'm alive, I'm in love
Feel it in my heart
The day opens up
On the world like a dream
And I start to smile

This thing I have with you
Is not a feeling
A sense it is more
Like a state of mind

Wherever you go I will follow
I just wanna be where you are
Like a shooting star
You shine brightest of them all
Wherever you go I will follow
...
