I love you, I love you
And this is eternal

It's love, true love
That brings my heart to you, home to you girl, yeah
And it's the same deep feeling of love
That brings you close to, to me baby

Oh but tonight I want my arms
And body wrapped all around you, all around you
For as close as we both are so much closer we will be
Believe in me, yeah

Here and now, I wanna take a lover's vow
I want you to come with me now
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal

Day and night, we'll have an everlasting life
I wanna feel it shining bright
Let's make tonight the first night of a love eternal

Here in this place our passions move
Move in slow motion, oh while the rest of the world
In real time passes by, rushes by

Oh I expressly forbid any heartache to ever, ever, ever
Ever come anywhere, anywhere, anywhere near you girl
Oh we'll use our love as protection, you'll never, never, never, never
Never have to cry, oh, dry your eyes

Here and now, I wanna take a lover's vow
