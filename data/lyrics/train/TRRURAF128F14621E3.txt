Lovin' you is such a pleasure
Especially when you're holdin' me like this, baby
The love we share can't measure
Each and every day just gets better
'Cause I found out that you were all that's missin'
In my life and it's you that made me realize
There's someone who can do it right
Love me, baby, both day and night
No one can do what you do
'Cause you do it right, oh oh
Keep on lovin' me, baby
Keep on lovin' me right
Keep on lovin' me, baby
All through the night
Keep on lovin' me, baby
