Lady Dujour
I called you up to find out what you'd like
For a special evening planned tonight
Anything you want I will provide
I'm all yours the moment you arrive
You're such a special lady
Girl you drive me crazy
You're my lady dujour
Oh, oh, oh
For you I don't mind waiting
I'm anticipating
My lady dujour
Oh, oh, oh
Soon we will be standing face to face
W'ell fill each other with a warm embrace
Your touch will set my body aflame
I'm dreaming of the feeling that you-ou-ou-ou-ou bring
Ooh, my lady
Cause girl you drive me crazy
You're my lady dujour
Oh, oh, oh
For you I don't mind waiting
I'm anticipating
My la-a-a-day-ay dujour
