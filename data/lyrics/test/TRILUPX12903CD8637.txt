I cut your wings the moment you think that you cannot fly
Smother my habitat, foment the thoughts of my demise

Seems like we've met before - you may not know me but I know you
Pretence paradox - fault of purpose amputee

Am I your enemy or what?
I attack from inside
When I rule there are no principles, but I know where they lie
Keep your hands out of this, an untouchable progress has begun
