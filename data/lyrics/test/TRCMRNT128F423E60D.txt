Swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming
Just stay in your lanes
Swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming, swimming
Just stay in your lanes

No bombing and no heavy petting
So just stay in your lanes
Verruca socks and not forgetting to
Just stay in your lanes

Madam's and monsieur's, please return to your cubicles
Madam's and monsieur's, please return to your cubicles
Madam's and monsieur's, please return to your cubicles
Madam's and monsieur's, please return to your cubicles

Madam's and monsieur's, please return to your cubicles
Madam's and monsieur's, please return to your cubicles
Madam's and monsieur's, please return to your cubicles
Madam's and monsieur's, please return to your cubicles
