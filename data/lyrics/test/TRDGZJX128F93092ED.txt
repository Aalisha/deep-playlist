Something about the way you look at me
Tells me that I just might be worthy
Of feeling you despite uncertainty
Despite the way that you might hurt me

I wanna take your love and mix it with mine
And maybe have a cocoa baby
I just wanna put this all on the line
Make sure that you appreciate me

If it's a question of your pride
Put that thing aside
Just let your guard down now
Lemme show you how much I want you

Oh, take my hand and dim the light
For the rest of the night
We'll be making love
The way that we're supposed to, yeah

I wanna give you all my love
...
