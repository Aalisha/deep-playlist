When will you ever see?
You're killing me with the things that you say
It's all so gritty
What am I to do and do
Am I to do or do
When will you ever see?
To let it be

Don't cry
It just ricochets
Into another day
Into another day
Please try to have something to say
There'll be another day
There'll be another day

Take a look around
