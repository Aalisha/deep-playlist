like himaalan cold winter
these jaws of kali yuga
yeah it's a crazy kind of cold
a lifeless slumber in a stranglehold
yeah tibet, she can't even touch this
I'd rather freeze in her forests
we're in a spiritual winter
and I long for the one who is

Fire!
amongst the dreamers
you are in my heart

like the sun on the icecaps
...
