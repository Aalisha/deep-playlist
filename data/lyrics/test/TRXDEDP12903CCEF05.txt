Life is a mystery
everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name

And it feels like

home

When you call my name
it's like a little prayer

I'm down on my knees

I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power

Just like a prayer

you know I'll take you there
I hear your voice

it's like an angel sighing
I have no choice

I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes

Oh God I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes

Heaven help me
When you call my name
it's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
...
