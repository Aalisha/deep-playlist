I can pacify your violence
I can guarantee no pain
Feel the ugly force of motion
Deep inside your guilty brain

Going out to get you
Going out to get you
Going out to get you
Pulpit of the Python
Chasing out the innocents defiled

Leave your weapon in the cool stream
Rest your body on the stone
Multitude will beckon to a clear sky
Rise again to follow all who came
...
