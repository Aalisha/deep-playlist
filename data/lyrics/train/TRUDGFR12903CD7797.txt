It started with the sun in your eyes
The devil in your throat and in your thighs
A pocket full of notes, a head of lies
Is no good for you

Wrestle with the questions in your head
Fumble with the stranger in your bed
Condemn it to the great abyss instead
Whatever suits you

'Cause in the dark we do our worst
(Turn the lights out, turn the lights out)
You'll be my last, I'll be your first
(Turn the lights out, baby, turn the lights out)

Lay down slowly, don't you fool me
'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
The best is yet to come
(Ohh, ohh)
The best is yet to come
(Ohh, ohh)

It finished with the stars in your eyes
He's just on your breath and in your bite
Listen to the pleading and the cries
...
