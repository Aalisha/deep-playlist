on the corner of 5th and main
by an old riverbed and a railroad train
there's a shop near the track
the owner works in the back
he's got a hole in his shirt, a hole in his shoe
he walks around without a whole lot to do
he's got no car, he's got no clothes
does what he does
and that's all he knows

coz he's a donut man
he's doin' what he can
he's happy every day
he's got nothin' to lose
he's found his way
he's a donut man
he's doin' what he can
he's happy every day
he's got nothin' to lose
he's found his way
...
