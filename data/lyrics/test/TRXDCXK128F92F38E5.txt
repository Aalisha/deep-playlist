God, I don't know where to begin
I'm so lost, I can't even pretend
Like the girl that I see right in front of me
Don't have control, she's like a friend to my heart
Key to my future lover of soul

Crazy thing, I didn't even know her name
Who she was and where she came from
But she passed me this passion
Pushed back my action like we couldn't deal
Said something 'bout timing
Paths not aligning but I need her still
...
