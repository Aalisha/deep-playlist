"Well God said to Abraham kill me a son
He said man you must be putting me on
God said "No!" Abe said "what!?"
God said, "You can do what you wanna, but
the next time you see me comin' you'd better run"
Abe said "Where do you want this killing done?"
God said, "out on that Highway 61"

Well Georgia Sam he had bloody nose
Welfare department would give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard "Where can I go?"
Howard say "There's only one place I know"
"Sounds great man, tell me, I gotta run!"
