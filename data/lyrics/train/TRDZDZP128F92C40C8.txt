Verse 1:
In Your presence by myself, its You and me Lord and no one else, and I don't have to say a whole lot of things.
You already know I need Your help, my enemies want to see me fall, so they can say I told you so.
Mmmm, Lord I don't mean to bother You with my small problems, but there is no where else I can go.

Ooohhh, oooohhh, oooohhh, oooohhh, ooohhhh.
