I despise your killing and raping
You're despicable are you, my judge?
It's just you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?

Yo, yeah, yo, yo, yo, yeah
Check these high hats sting things moving through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's ticking, eruptments conduct

Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling Hemingway novel model

For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with something that's round and profound
Blood brothers people of colors we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things being said

Nine Diagram acid black evil red left his
Mic half a dangle, seriously man
My mic clapper def wish, everlasting plan
Heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner

Night champion, old villain style seem a
kiss of spider, to God saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters

Number two, Chao San Poi

This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks that's rough
'Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough

So we attack this and grab all within' reach
Throw a scrap back to niggaz perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands

Niggaz look on and get hooked on this mic line
Real thin and shift through the pipeline
LP's delivered with style and potential
