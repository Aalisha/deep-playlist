Lies, all the things you told me
No base in truth, blatant fiction tales
Lies, obvious evasion
You're speaking words that don't mean a thing
When we are in the same room
You talk like I'm a fool
You think that I believe everything
When really, I don't believe anything
It's all lies, speaking in distortion
