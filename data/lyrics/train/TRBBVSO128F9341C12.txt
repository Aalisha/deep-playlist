(matrica berg/randy scruggs)

I sent myself a dozen roses
Right before the office closes
Just to make my girlfriends green with envy
Ever since I lost you
All the crazy things I do
I didn't even know I had it in me. oh but

Hey it's all right
It's just another saturday night
Got nobody. got no nothin to lose
