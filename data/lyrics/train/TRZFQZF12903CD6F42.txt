There's still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
It's still a little harder to say what's going on

There's till a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
You step a little closer each day
That I can? t say what's going on

Stones taught me to fly
Love, it taught me to lie
Life, it taught me to die
...
