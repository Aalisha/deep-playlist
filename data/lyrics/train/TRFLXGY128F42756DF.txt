Sight to freedom rises descender.
Ground to screen of the seer, the sight, and the seen.
Up to obviate the sentinel and ground prevails.
Fuse to seed at the flight into absalom.
Orbits arm across to light the new day.
Harbingers eclipse a pendant of time unseen.
Solidate unto the field of a flow remember.
Glows serene to attenuate the space and time.
Crows the severeic rite to freedom.
Shored the origin forms to a ground accede.
Axiom core of the light shrine flight to shining.
Glows serene to attenuate the space and time.
