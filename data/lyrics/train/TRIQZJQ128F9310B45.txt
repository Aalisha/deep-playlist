When you've decided to hold on to all that you've lost
When you've decided to hold on to all that you've lost
All this is nothing if she comes and tears you apart
All this is nothing if you hold the key to her heart

If you've decided to change what you thought was your way
This new way will take you to her and to midsummer day
All this is nothing if she comes and tears you apart
All this is nothing if you hold the key to her heart
