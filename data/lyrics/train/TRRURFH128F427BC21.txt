Welcome to the Northern regions... Black hearted emperor
Intensify the pagan night... Black hearted emperor
High upon the angel's mountain... Black hearted emperor
Overshadowed by the moon... The crown of the black hearts

Urine is poured over leaves
Purified in Gabriel's chalice
Gazed into the eyes of the king
See the Heavens sky in malice
