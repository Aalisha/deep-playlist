He jumps in the taxi, for the sky
He's off to slay some demon dragonfly
And he looked at me, that long last time
Turns away again and I waved goodbye

In an envelope, inside his coat
Is a chain I wore, around my throat
Along with, a note I wrote
Said, "I love you but I don't even know why"

Darling, I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell how hard you're trying
Just have this secret hope
Sometimes all we do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
