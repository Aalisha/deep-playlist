You remember your first kiss?
Well how can I forget?
My hand still shivers from the very thought of it

Well sometimes I almost regret it
like I regret my regrets.
I see myself on my deathbed saying
"I wish I would have loved less".

But that's when the feeling hits,
so just lick your lips.
These are the good times that you'll miss
when you are sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories
...
