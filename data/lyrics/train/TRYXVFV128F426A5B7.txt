Confusions born here every day
Spinning circles upon my brain
No idea which way to go
Roam around without a home

So fucking lost, invalidated
So brought down demasculated
All the joy just disappeared
Another bed full of tears

Hope dissolved, degenerated
The negative has penetrated
No wish for sympathy
...
