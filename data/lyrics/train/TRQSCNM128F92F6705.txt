It's so black as I crash into the backroom
I feel so sick honey listen to the girls moan
My eyes they water and my knees is a-weak
And I fall down every time that you speaks

Shine on shine my little star
Up above the world honey that you are
Shine on now you don't give me no love
Hit me like a deathray baby from above

Come on!

Speeding down the highway you got no time to waste
Brain all used up just like the human race
Head spinning around from the 39th highball
And your sultan owns a queen who ain't nothing but a screwball

Shine on shine my little star
Up above the world honey that you are
Shine on now you don't give me no love
Hit me like a deathray baby from above
