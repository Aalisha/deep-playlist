I can't explain it (whoa)
The way you make me feel (waiting)
The way you hold me (oh)
The way you kiss me (yeah)
(Yeah whoa)

Why
Why did I even dial your line
Quietly I smile at your sweet reply
And as my eyes close
The ground beneath disappears
And all over again I feel a love
I know is real, so real

So high I can't look below
When you say my name I lose control
And I start to float
(Ooh) I float
And whenever I want this feeling to go
I touch the sky and realize
One look in your eyes
I float

And I'm wonderin if maybe you feel the same
Or am I all alone
Cause I'll pay almost any price
For the way you bring my heart to life, no lie
I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying
...
