Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spendin' my money, I didn't care
I carried my friends out for a good time
Buying bootleg liquor, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low
I didn't have a friend and no place to go
So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagle's grin
...
