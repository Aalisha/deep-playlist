Those where the darkest hours of them all.
And I can easily say I had no love.
I see myself outside it all, but somehow I’m always there.
Cause all I know is what I bare.

Now I dare to think of love.
And now I dare to think of something that I’m not.
Now I dare to think of love.
And now I dare to think of something that I’m not.
Now I know. Returning here
ain’t that hard, despite my fear.

I have no brightest hours to extend for you.
