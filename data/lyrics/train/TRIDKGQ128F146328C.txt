Child 1:
He kind of started all the plants growing, and he started people. Well, I guess he's kind of big and fat.
Child 2:
He can see us wherever we do ... whatever we do. He has such powerful eyes -- he has to have millions and thousands and billions. And he can still see us when we're bad.
Child 3:
He could be sitting on the table right now, but you can't see him.
Child 4:
He can't be everywhere at once doing everything for everybdy. Everybody can't get what they want.
Child 5:
Well, his job is to make us good and to make us happy and make us parents happy.
Child 6:
Good is the right thing and bad is the wrong thing.
Child 7:
When I'm good my mother never yells at me, when I'm bad she does.
