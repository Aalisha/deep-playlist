When she was younger
Stood staring at the door
Waiting for the day that she knew would surely come
Tied bows in her hair
Dressed as she thought you'd like
But as time ticked away
Promises fade one by one

And now she's all grown
Made it through on her own
Now strong enough to see
That you've been where you want to be

No longer dying inside
I will not let you define
Everything I am by one thing that I don't have
Cause I'm more than that
I will not be made to hide
These tears won't fall for you this time
I will not be ashamed
Of my name
Anymore
