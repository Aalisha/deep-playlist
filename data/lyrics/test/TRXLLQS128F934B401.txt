One injection, one infection
One injection and the dead are resurrected
One injection, one infectionm, feasting on the dead

Now there is nowhere left for me to run
The armies af the dead come
Breaking into my place
Their teeth tearing into my face

My blood's now starting to drain
The changes have started in my brain
Awakening as one of them now, killing as I only know how
...
