She is not calm till sheathed within
Her black constrictive latex skin
From head to toe no flesh exposed
A Rubber Doll to fuck and pose

An eyeless mask engulfs her face
Her features swallowed in it's tight embrace
Her breathing heaves, she moans with lust
I polish and buff my latex slut

Custom rigs and racks built to aid her transformation
She'd rather live her life as a household decoration
