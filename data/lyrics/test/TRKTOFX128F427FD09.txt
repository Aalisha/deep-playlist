Don't look for compassion
As long as you
Keep turning away
It's all that matters to me
When I try to puzzle your pain

You struggle against yourself
By living in the dust
Can't you realize
There's no one here
Who you can't trust
May the gods have mercy
On your bastard brain
Hold on one more second
My fatal one

Feeding angels with despair
Flameouts reigning everywhere
And you need it so
You just can't let it go away

I try hard to pull the
Strings of your life
Adopting my soul
To figure out what's right
Deep down I know
You can make it shine
