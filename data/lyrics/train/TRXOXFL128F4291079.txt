Catered to undo
Mistakes you have made with you
The lessons catch up with you
As I lay awake in bed at night
The thoughts of life
Pass left and right
They appear on my sensory screen
Mistakes in route are quite expected
My existing plan is well protected
I light the bulb that soothes my brain
For not to learn is not to gain
Tarnished, are the thoughts
