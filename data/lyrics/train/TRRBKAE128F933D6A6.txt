My love for you grows with each passing day
I'm by your side when you're away
And when I miss you and long for your care
I close my eyes and you're there

All that I ask is one moment in time
No strings attached, no drawing lines
You feel my thoughts even when you're not here
I close my eyes
Close my eyes and I feel you're there

Take my love, take my heart
Carry me with you in your dreams
No, no, never let go
Wonder of love, magical glow
...
