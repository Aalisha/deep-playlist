(I) I sit by my window with everything I've done
Doors that I've opened and webs that I've spun
And the candle besides me burns to the left
And the rain on the clay sends the lizard to it's nest

And there will be a time, that I hold you again
With my arms spread out, just you'll rest
And I'll write you a letter with everything I know
About the weight of the world and the way things could go

So live up my friend, step back again
For some things will be given, for some you'll have to bend
You'll have to bend my friend, to hold on to this
For some things will come easy, and some will be a test
...
