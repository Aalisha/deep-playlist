Well, I was gone
Gone to the army
I was gone, ver' long time
Well, when I come back home, my baby
Still says she's mine
She still says she's mine
She still says she's mine
She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right
She's all right, she's all right

Well, I give 'er
Give her all a-my money
Tell me what more, can I do-ooo?
Well now, I really don't
