Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah

Another winter of your discontent
I know how you scream and shout
When nothing you see makes any sense

Invaluable excuses drop like pearls in your self defense
You never do nothin' about nothin', no
Where's all your confidence?

Why can't you reach for a closer dream?
The reason you fail is you go to extremes
You don't have to lie, you gotta try
If you fall, you can call, but you don't have to crawl

You give up, hah, baby, when it gets too rough
You ain't got what it takes, no, you ain't tough enough
