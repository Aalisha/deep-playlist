I can't wait to show you what a jaded fuck i've become
i'm officially finished singing about some better way
cause we're all so young and there's time to change
just tell me aren't these the reddest eyes you've ever seen
sitting on the steps of where my family's grown
i fold from this game after the hundredth time
this feeling's passed over me
i'll try my best not to take my time in...
maybe the telephone ring
i'll waste my life and never make up the time
i wrote this for my brother
...
