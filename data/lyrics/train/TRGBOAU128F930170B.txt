Yep
This one's called "Alabama 69"

I come from Alabama and I work a ten pound hammer
And my woman's picking cotton for the bossman on the hill
They work us till they break our back
Beat us cos our skin is black
I guess I'll have to slave till the whip is in the grave

Yeah, when will we be free
I wanna walk down any road
And feel I have my liberty

Well, from day to day I live to die
The scars across my back don't lie
Ain't there anyone out there
To hear my freedom cry

Well, I believe a man's a man who earns his pay as best he can
The colour of his skin don't mean he ain't just like you
