We said we'd try again but tryin's not enough
Actin' like strangers, ain't no way of makin' love
It's never gonna work, it's time we stop pretending
Time to turn the page, all stories need an ending
It makes no sense to stay
Livin' my life in yesterday
I'm leavin', I'm leavin' and I'm beggin' you
Heart don't change my mind
Oh heart, be strong this time
And try to help me tell him goodbye
It'll only bring pain for us to stay
Oh heart, it's hard for you, I know
Let me let him go
Don't let me think about how good it was before
I know you'd try anything to keep me from that door
