All my life I've wanted to be somebody and here I am
I know what I've got and there ain't nobody
Gonna take it away from me
So let me tell ya what I am

I'm a red hot fox, I can take the knocks
I'm a hammer from hell, honey, can't you tell?
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one

I'm a touched up freak on a winning streak
I'm gonna own this town, you can't hold me down
I'm the wild one, yes, I'm the wild one

Well, it ain't no use, turn me loose
...
