Ba da pa pa pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa paaaa
Badia badia badia-ia-ia-ia-ia
Bad a pa pa paaaaa

Now I'm so high and I'm so fly
My kids on deck my beard ain't growed yet
I'm so on point I'm so on one
This is how we do it here in Philaphornia
'Sco mack toe back
The one y'all love to blow back
I got five fingers it ain't no riddle
Why the only one showin is the one in the middle
Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the dog
Going at it over kibble out in the back yard

I drink Yak hard y'all act hard
Now I gotta cut ya up like a MAC card
Everybody packin a strap to spark
But don't everybody want to scrap this ball
I'm old school wit it, no tool wit it
Head up till we fed up that's hard
Smooth sailin'

Ba da pa pa pa pa pa
Ba da pa pa pa

I got the ladies sayin
Ba da pa pa paaaa
Hell I even got my momma singing
Badia-She sayin
Badia- yeah
Badia-ia-ia-ia-ia
Big Sco singin- Ba da pa pa paaaa
My big bro singing
