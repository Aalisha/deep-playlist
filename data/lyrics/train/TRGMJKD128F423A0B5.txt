laughing in a crown of jewels
numbness from a scepters wound
toss and turn, i spin and learn
"catch yourself before you burn"
a joker's dance before the king
jangling beads, and silver rings
close your eyes and bare the sound
jumping up - falling down

falling, falling, falling, falling down
look yourself in the eye before you drown

royal rebels discover you
trust? you turn there is no truth
and circle, circle, why are you scared
...
