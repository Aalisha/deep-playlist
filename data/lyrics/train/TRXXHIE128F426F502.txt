All thick girls report to the dance floor
Right motherfucking now, ya heard me
It's about to go down, yeah you come here

Uh, uh, uh (where them P-Poppers at)
Come here, uh, uh (where them P-Poppers at)
Yeah you, uh, uh (where them P-Poppers at)
Yeah you, uh (where they at)

Come here baby, you about to give me a seis-a
Tell me the secret, what your mama feed ya
Cause you super thick, with your Godly features
Hop up in the Benz, boo tonight I need ya
Bow legged broad, said her name Kadisha
She said she don't play, she guaranteed to please ya
I said with all that ass, baby I believe ya
But after I smash, I'ma catch amnesia
Took her to the room, it was on and popping
Because her jaws was locked, and then her drawas was dropping
When I smacked her on her ass, it was soft like cotton
She had the nice double D's, when she took off her topping
Then she got low, took it to the flo'
Asked, (how you wanna see me shake it Lil' O)
I said you a pro, act like you know
Make them cheeks jiggle like Jello, whoa
