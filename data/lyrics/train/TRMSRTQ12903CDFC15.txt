On a Saturday morning anywhere on this planet
There's a guy dressed in black renting a camionnette
He's about to leave with a couple of friends
To play a show with their band called RINGLESS WITCHES HANDS
Six hours on the road across half their country
Driving carefully yet possessed by the spirit of the Unholy
How could they've known about the underground curse
(They'd spend) six hours on the road to have the pleasure to rehearse

Every Saturday evening anywhere on this earth
Guys in black plugging amps make the spotlights burst
Try to raise true evil from a bunch of customers
Then negotiate a beer with a close-minded bartender

Underground lives and forever will! 
Bring me the head of the guy who's gonna pay the bill
Underground force shall rule forever! 
Not tonight for this is a satanic disaster
Underground is something funny
Make a step out of it, be considered as trendy
Underground force shall rule forever
Not tonight for this is a satanic disaster

The power of the Goat nobody can deny
Is unfortunately stuck outside the doors of the bar
