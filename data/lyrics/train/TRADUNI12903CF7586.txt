A church house gin house
a school house outhouse
On Highway Number Nineteen
The people keep the city clean.
They call it Nutbush
Oh Nutbush
Call it Nutbush city limits.

Twentyfive was the speed limit
Motorcycle not allowed in it
You go t'the store on Friday
You go to church on Sunday.
They call it Nutbush
