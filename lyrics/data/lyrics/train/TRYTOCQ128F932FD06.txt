I've fallen in love with a special kinda friend*
A small lovey, little one with lots of love to spread,
I love the anxiety, the tension, excitement,
Is it in my head? Is it in my head?
You take tha medication, gulp down some beer,
It's a winning combination, No worries no fears,
Just the greatest fuckin' feelin' you fucks will ever feel,
So call up your dealer and get some fuckin' chickaz!

I keep takin', poppin', droppin' ecstasy!
