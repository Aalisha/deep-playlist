Stung to death as punishment
Eternal years of torment
They took the arm with a saw
Judged by their own marshal law
Nightmare printed on the wall

Be my victim, be my crime
Sweets to the sweet

Candyman - his name is
Candyman - you blame the
Candyman - here comes the
Candyman

Shadows from the dark corridor
Dreams will never be, be like before
Hear me whisper in your ears
...
