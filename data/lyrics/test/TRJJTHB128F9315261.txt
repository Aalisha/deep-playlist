Verse 1 (Ryu)


Yo, takin the game back
Point blank, aim gats
We both dope, from the same cocaine sack
Laugh with no pain, we never go glitzy
Pop-thug, my necklace dangle my M60
Outta control now, half of the globe
Rappers reek of wackness cover your nose
So take your weeks of practice back and
Freak your flow and that geeky accent, Callin' all freaks
That's what you get, get, got it good
Yo Cheap, we got a smash hit knock on wood
That's it put your hands up(Uh), they can't stand us
Dig a big pit the size of the Grand Canyon
Push 'em over the cliff you nutty as squirrel shit
Thinkin' your so sick, but I carry a cure, bitch
Lots of sleep, plenty of pills and flow
Now who want it with the S.O.B., Let's go

Chorus

Stand up(Come on) And if you like it say(Uh!)
You like it say(Well!)
You love it say(Yeeah!)
So get up, and if it's hype say(Oh)
Ryu and Tak what's up, now we outta control
Hands up(Come On) And if you like it say(Hah)
You like it say(Whoa!)
You love it say(Awesome!)
So, get up, and if it's hype say(Oh my God!)
Ryu and Tak what's up, now we outta control

Verse 2 (Tak)
Yo, wakin' up early goin' to work is a joke
So deep with no sleep, it hurts when you don't
So I picked up a pen and scored a couple of quotes
