Come on people
Got to get on board
Train is leavin'
And there's room for one more
God, don't listen to the devil
He got ways to move you
This train don't carry no smokers
This train...


Well, come on people
'Cause it's startin' to rain
Get on board, it's the gospel train
Don't listen to the devil
...
