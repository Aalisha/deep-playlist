Baby, listen

I never meant to be so, so, hard on you
But my, my pride had me thinking
Thinking that it was the right thing
But girl I really love you
And it's drivin' me crazy
That you're not here to hold me anymore

How long must I cry?
How long do I have to try?
To make happiness my friend
And how long will it be
Until you come back to me
And let me feel your love again?
