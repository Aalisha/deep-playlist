I travelled through the eyes of the Necroscope
Into the realm where marble tombs lay open
Where Death and Decay hold their thrones
And sorrow chants her funeral song
A weird sweet music fills the air
As shadow forms gather in circles
And it is nighttime, so cold, so dark
When spirits start their dance macabre
Ghostly dancers whirling around
...
