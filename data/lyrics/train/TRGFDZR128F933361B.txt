The time has come for colds and overcoats.
We're quiet on the ride, we're all just waiting to get home
Another week away, my greatest fear
I need the smell of summer, I need its noises in my ears
If looks could really kill, then my profession would staring
Know we do this cause we care and not for the thrill
Collect calls to home to tell them that I realize
That everyone who lives will someday die and die alone

And we won't let you in though we're down and out
We won't let you in
You win
