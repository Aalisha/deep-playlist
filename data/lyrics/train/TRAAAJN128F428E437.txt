The world is my oyster...
Ha ha ha ha ha...

Life goes on day after day

Who-ha who-ha
Who-ha who-ha

Ha

The animals are winding me up
The jungle call
The jungle call
Who-ha who-ha who-ha who-ha
In Xanadu did Kublai Khan
A pleasuredome erect
Moving on keep moving on-yeah
Moving at one million miles an hour
Using my power
I sell it by the hour
I have it so I market it
You really can't afford it-yeah
Really can't afford it

*Shooting stars never stop
Even when they reach the top
