Far away on a hill to sunny mountain side
Many years ago we parted, my little Ruth and I
From the sunny mountain side

She clung to me and trembled when I told her we must part
She said, "Don't go my darling, it almost breaks my heart
To think of you, so far apart"

Carry me back to old Virginia
Back to my clinch mountain home
Carry me back to old Virginia
