On this night of Nights, She's coming my way
Under this rain, dirty with agony and pain
Mistress of Doom, winner of all fights
My glance is reflected in the blade of the Scythe

A sparkling golden sickle
Mows down souls whistling in the air
Reddens little by little
The seas of life and mankinds lairs

A fall into the abyss
Deep into agony and pain
Spiral down to the anguish
It had been all in vain

Welcome, please join the fair of failures
Enter into the hall of pleasures
Righteous the act to kill
...
