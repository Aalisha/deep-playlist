I get a little bit vicious
That's why you love me
Because you can't resist it
that you do anything for me

You want out but we're off the ground
So, pick out your parachute
'Cause I'm not gonna let you down
I won't let you get away, not that easy anyway

I don't want to know and I want you for the cause
How does anybody get anything done?
You depend on us.
You'll never get to Heaven as the radical son
Just keep it up, you soldier

You won't help. I can't help
I've got to make you understand:
You gotta take it like a man
