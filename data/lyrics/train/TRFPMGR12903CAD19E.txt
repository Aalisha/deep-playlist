We’ve been friends for so long, I can’t deny,
These feelings are so strong I keep hot inside,
Wanna tell you but I can’t find the words to say,
So afraid if I do things will never be the same,
I gotta work it out, times really running out,
Don’t know what to do but I know I gotta say it now,
Don’t wanna lose and friend but why should I pretend,
That I don’t love you when I’ve waited so long,

(So long) been waiting (so long) been waiting (so long)
I can’t hold it back cause I’ve been waiting so long,
Been waiting (so long) been waiting (so long)
Been waiting (so long) I’ve been waiting so long,
I’ve been trying to tell ya, tell ya,
That we should be together, everyday,
...
