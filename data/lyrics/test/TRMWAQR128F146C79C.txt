Man it must be so cool,
You're barely out of high school,
A seven album record deal,
That was no big deal alright,
Oh yeah.

Too right you're always out of tune,
It's your shaggy hair that makes it swoon,
It's not what you say it's what you wear,
You look good up there alright,
Oh yeah.

You spend a lot of time thinking about the things you've never had,
Congratulations Jessie,
Congratulations Jessie,
Congratulations,
Yeah you finally made it.

All across the nation,
And on every single station,
It's part of Cribs and TRL,
Man it must be hell alright,
...
