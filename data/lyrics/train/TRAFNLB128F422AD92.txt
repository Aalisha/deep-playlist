Put it on ice bitch, Dr. Pepper
Feeling so clean, it don't get no fresher
Chillin' in the freezer when I'm under pressure

I put it on ice bitch, Dr. Pepper
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper
Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper

Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper

Chilling in the freezer when i'm under pressure
I put it on ice bitch, Dr. Pepper
Can't handle this volume
Can't handle this

Can't handle this song
But you going bounce to this shit
Bounce to this shit
Bounce to this shit

Put your this face on, lemme see you bounce to this shit
Phone calling I'm pressing red
Only red cup that's in my hand
I ain't got the time, so why you asking

I got a flight to catch, I'm always traveling
They packing
