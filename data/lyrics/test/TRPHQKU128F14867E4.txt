This would be easier if you'd understand
Face the truth and realize
That none of this was planned
The way we worry about such little things
Take the time to take the break
Darling, spread your wings

I stole all the roses that make your crown
And now it's easier
To just put aside the things that face us now

Strange when something comes from nothing
I came around to your way
Of thinking about these things
Saw your face in a crowd
I knew that you were special
And it would change my world
If I could help you now
