(Lee)

I couldn't believe, the temptation that came with you
Oh I never knew
I couldn't believe, the amazing things that I would do
Oh when it came to you

But I believe it now when I put my arms around you
There ain't no doubt about it when I lay my hands upon you
I believe, I believe

I couldn't believe, another pretty face like you have
Hey could lay me out
