There's a stonegarden where my lover lies
The flowers never grow, they bloom there and die
Much like the day when the earth was tilled up
And tears in my eyes, to the brim they filled up
Days and night pass, but still I must go
To lay in the grass and weep by the willow

In the stonegarden, the garden, the garden
Where old seeds are planted but nothin sprouts up
In the stonegarden, the garden, the garden
The love lays forever then turns into dust

Some days I put on my Sunday best
...
