I'm not scared of you, no
Or so i say
There's no reason to run
Although i may
I'm not as sure as i seem
This much i know
What does it mean you leave and i follow

I could try to forget what you do when i let you get
Through to me but then you do it over again
I could rage like a fire and you'd bring rain i desire
Til you get to me on my morningside

Keep my distance i tried
No use
