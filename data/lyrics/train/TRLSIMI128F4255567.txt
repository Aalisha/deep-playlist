I blew out all my plans
The world fell in my hands
The day that I began
Trying to love you

The secrets I have kept
The nights I haven't slept
I've laughed until I've wept
Trying to love you

Trying to love you
No one's come as close or gone so far
Trying to love you
I've lost and found myself in who you are
Trying to love you
...
