It started out when I met this girl
She threw me down on this spinning world
I'm over my head, yeah it could have been
But I'm a bird with broken wings, 
She's a song I love to sing
Come curl up to me, we'll let our bodies test their chemistry
She's got blue eyes and a smile like the sun
And then she cries "I think I'm done"

But then I swear that she's the one
(Swear she's the one)
I swear that she's the one
(Swear that she's the one)
I swear that she's the one
I swear that she's the one
That I'm falling for

Love's a tree growing in your heart
Better look out when the roots start
I'm the bloom that began such a long time ago
