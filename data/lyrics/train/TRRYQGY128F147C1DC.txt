We could be perfect one last night
And die like star crossed lovers when we fight
And we could settle this affair
If you would shed your yellow
Take my hand and then
We'll solve
The mystery of laceration gravity
This riddle
Of revenge
Please understand that it has to be this way

Stand!
Up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
And take!
My fucking hand
