See, people are too hung up on the word itself instead of the intent, it's the intent what you mean when you say something
Some smart nigger
Hey whitey,
You and your punk friends killed my man
Please! Don't kill me!
I didn't mean to do it! He told me to!
You need to know!
Please, no, aah, aaaaah!
The black was in the trunk - dead
We must not sit back and be spectators
We must uhh - killing is good
Then we must uhh, take a position
And if we're capable of taking in - killing blacks - a meaningful or useful action then that's our responsability also
You disgusting men are filled with deceit!
Yip yip, what's that?
