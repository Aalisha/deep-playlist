I will bring anything for three
With a dusty smile and a loaded gun
You ask me again, whats in it for me?
Well thanks and tell me come undone

Painted red, our hands are white
I've never seen this place before
Seen through, we're on our way
Through and through each bolted door

Driving us down for it's chase
And we run any day we'll skip town
It'll never hear us come
Driving us down for it's chase
...
