3 years gone by and still everyone screws up our name
no matter what you do still some things never change
seen a lot of the world, met a lot of friends
got a lot of fond memories
there's nothing like playing a basement show
on a saturday night in pennsylvania.

start the show, here we go
jumping in the crowd
we've gotta tear this building down.

the cops show up as usual
to try and ruin our fun.
it's time to show 'em all
just how its done.
