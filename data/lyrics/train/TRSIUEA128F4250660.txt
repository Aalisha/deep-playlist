Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors

Suicide doors, sui-suicide doors (brown) Suicide doors, I'm clean in this bitch

I could give a fuck about you niggas and you hating hoes
Super black Escalade, got some suicide doors
Inside: peanut butter, Peter Pan brown
I'm a country ass nigga with some doobs on the ground
Shoot a motherfucker hollow when he skating, beating down the street
Sipping on some purple while your baby momma sucking me
Got 'em jumping out my seat and ladies skeet if ya fuck with me
I don't have to throw a pitchfork to show you I'm a fucking G
A to the N to the G-S, T-AR
Some country ass niggas from the cities who are
The men that got some dro, man, you can bring the cigar
You can hit the bird then buy off the bazaar

Suicide doors and a blonde-haired genie
