There was a man who owned a part of town
Approached me in his own saloon and said, "hey boy, sit down"

"Was I unemployed or would I like a job"
He said he owned the stageline, and were men who liked to rob

He offered me his daughter's hand, advance of salary
A fancy gun, a pair of boots, a share in the company

Now I ride shotgun on his stageline
I ride shotgun on his life
I ride shotgun on his money
I ride shotgun on his wife
Shotgun ... rider ... shotgun ... rider

There were outlaws who waited on the trail
For the stagecoach daily run with payrolls and the mail
