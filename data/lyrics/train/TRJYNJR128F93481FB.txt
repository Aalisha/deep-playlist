The other day I swear to God
I got a letter in the mail that
Said register with us or you're
Gonna go to jail
You'll be put inside a cage, then
Forced to enlist
Well I laughed out loud, said I
Won't comply
To be labeled as one of those
Who qualify to be shipped off to
Fight some fucking war
'Cause war's not about policy-religion
It's about economy and I'm not dying
to set your country free

I'll never bow to your expectations
I never have I never will
...
