My heart is breaking, my whole life is shaking, mm
Every way I turn, I know this love is gonna burn me
But I'm waiting on you, no matter what you do

Ever since you went away, I suffer each an' every day
An' I can't hide the heartache anymore
You left me all alone, just waiting by the telephone
Too scared to step outside this prison door

An' I'm waiting on you

No matter what you say, no matter what you do
This heart is dedicated to you
'Til the rivers run dry and the sun no longer shines
I'm still gonna make you mine

I'm waiting on you, waiting on you

Ever since I started drinking, my ship's been slowly sinking
So tell me what's a man supposed to do
When people stop and stare and see me drowning in despair
'Coz it's written on my face, what I've been going through
...
