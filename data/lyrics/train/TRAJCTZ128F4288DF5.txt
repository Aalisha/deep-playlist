(Intro: Bronze Nazareth)
Yeah... you know.
Aight... yo.
Knowimsayin, let me walk through the yards... yo.

(Bronze Nazareth)
Let me walk you through the yards where life is truly hard
On the pathway, from a disease that ashtray
All day, we on the grind like Monday
Just let me smoke my insence, life is intense
Like the Black Day in July.
Excuse me, mam, I'm just try'nna get by
Just try'nna get past these souls that fly
Like the bullets down my way, hoes around my way
Souls is drowing in the dead sea of sex and Alize
Look out for the dead children, maybe you'll find hope
Sitting in the building, around a plate of that coke
Damage your mammo-grammy, we see what's in your heart
On the road to nowhere, the boulevard; Rosa Parks
Those are sharks, wake up, cause the jakes up
Just try'nna reach for his goal, he reach for his gun
It ain't no Tums when the heart burns like the sun
Tears for the whine, sims, this can't be life
Flowers for sale, half off the funeral price
...
