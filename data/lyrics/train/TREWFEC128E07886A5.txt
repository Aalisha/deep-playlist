Think about what you're doing baby
Think about faith
Think of the blood that's running
'Round in your veins
You're soft and naked
You're young and strong
My heartbeat races
As you aim the gun
And these prison walls
Can't hold me anymore

Run silent, run deep
You've taken over me
And even when I sleep
...
