Fall in love
All I want is love

Don't you touch me
Baby don't you touch me
What do you see?
You're in ecstasy

On a mission
Haunted by the vision
Got to believe it
Now 1-2-3 yeah

Caught in a trap
Then we change
All is moving on

And now you're lost in outer space
And all I want is love

(Fall in love)
When did I dream
(Will I fall in love?)
That's it's only love?

Runaway, get away
Gotta fly away
TV warm
Following scenery

Incredible getaway
Gotta fly away
Billowing submarine
...
