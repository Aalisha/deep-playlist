Woah!
Yeah!
I think we've had enough of all your spineless talk
Of all your hateful words
We've drawn the line
This is a battle cry (the cry!)
This is a raging war (the war!)
This is the fight that we have been waiting for
There's no more compromising (compromising!)
there's no more falling back (falling back!)
