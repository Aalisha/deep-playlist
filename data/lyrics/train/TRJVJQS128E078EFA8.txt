There was a time when I thought life
Was over and out, when you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe
Would sit in my room because I didn't want to
Have to go out and see you walking by

One look and I'd break right down and cry
Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Cause it may seem hard to believe, but

I'm doin' just fine, getting along very well
Without you in my life, I don't need you in my life
I'm doin' just fine, time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
