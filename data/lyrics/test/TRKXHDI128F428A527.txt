I left the city for another life
To start it all again
All I wanted was the solitude
And time to think alone

Peace and quiet seemed the only way
But I guess that I was wrong
Now I stand with gun in hand
I should have known it all along

I don't need to know what's right
Now I know I have to fight

Lust for freedom
Taking it all the way
Lust for freedom
Somebody's got to pay

Lust for freedom
The future is in my hand
Lust for freedom
Everyone take a stand
