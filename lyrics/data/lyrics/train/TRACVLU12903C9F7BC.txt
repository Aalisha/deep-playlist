God's written
Words of lies
God has given
World of lies
Blind, crippled and diseased
Death is coming over me

God is real
Believe me
God is real
Release me
God is real
Abuse me
God watches over me

If God is in the rain
Please let it rain on me
If God is in the rain
Please let him down on me

If God is in the rain
