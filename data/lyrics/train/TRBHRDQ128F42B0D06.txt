Money money
Welcome to my new and improved life
On the darkside
Climbing in the neverending stairs of gold
Just trying to grab and hold

It's all good
My face on the magazine
Limelights
And everybody's loving me
I made a deal with these so called "friends" of mine
And now I burn art
Like I'll burn all the bridges behind
...
