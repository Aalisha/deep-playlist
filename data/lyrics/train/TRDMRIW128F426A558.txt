Darling, give me your absence tonight
Take the shade from the canvas and leave me the
white
Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside
and don't bother leaving the light on

Cause I suddenly feel like a different person
From the roots of my soul comes a gentle coersion
and I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion --
a vacancy that just did not belong
...
