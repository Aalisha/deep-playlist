Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies

All the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
Yeah, an' I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play soft and low

And all the night's magic
Seem to whisper and hush
All the soft moonlight
Seems to shine in your blush

Can I just have one more moondance
With you, a-my love?
Can I just make some more romance
With you, a-my love?

Well, I wanna make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'till the morning has come
And I know now the timin' is just right
And straight into my arms you will run

And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then I will make you my own

Everytime I touch you
You just tremble inside
Then I know how much I want you, baby
That, can't hide

Can I just have one more moondance
With you my love?
(My love)
Can I just make some more romance
With you my love?
(My love)

Scooby-dooby, Scooby-dooby

'Georgie Fame' ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it'

It's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies

All the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
Yeah an' I'm tryin' to please to the calling
Of your heart-strings that play, that play
