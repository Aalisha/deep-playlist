And so they say they're leaving
While you sleep away the day
You go out every evening
Collecting waifs and strays

They follow their illusions
They don't know what to do
They need a clear direction
That's why they turn to you

You're pleading
Please don't leave me
Don't go from me so soon
I need to be found
For I'm a stray too

Don't go
Just wait until tomorrow
Just wait until tomorrow
...
