Once on a ride
I was left in the forest
And the leaves and the wind
Seemed to carry me home

But when I arrived
It was long after morning
And the heat of the day
Left me standing alone

Voices calling, I go falling in
Someone said, "Let's go" but it begins
And it seems like I've been here before

Leave me my red cherry wine
And I know I'll be doing just fine
'Cause I'm keeping this
Deep heart of mine from feeling

Long after dark
I was left out there wandering
