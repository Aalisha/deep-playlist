I've been waiting for a good day
I've been holding back long enough
I've been hurting to tell you some thing:
It's not the falling of the temperature
That's making all our bones run cold
It's the breeze you make
The presence felt when you're around me

And it feels like im at an all-time low

Slightly bruised and broken
From our head on collision
I've never seen this side of you
Another tragic case of feeling
Bruised and broken
From our head on collision
I've never seen this side of you
Another tragic case
And I'm still

...
