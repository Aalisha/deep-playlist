SHA NAGBA IMURRU!
SHA NAGBA IMURRU!
ALL NAMES, ALL FORMS!

obsessed about
money & power

obsessed about
sexual encounters

obsessed about
passion & pain

possessed like martyr
getting high off the flames

I HAVE A BULIMIC MIND!
I HAVE A SOUL THAT'S ONE OF A KIND!

I HAVE A BULIMIC MIND!
LOOK AT ME ENEMY OPEN YOUR EYES!

accept your fate
for the hate you create

i'm sick of pretending
that you're world is not ending!
