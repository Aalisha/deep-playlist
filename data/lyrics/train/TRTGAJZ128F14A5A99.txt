Let's cough this silence away,
And save it for a better day,
One with firesides and catalyzed love,
So breathe this breath with me,
A momentary coalition,
It's a chance for love in all the right ways

And tired, these hearts, they fall,
So simple now,
So simple now. 
And tired, these hearts, they fall,
So simple now,
So simple now. 


Break this vase with me,
Shattered glass and splitting heartaches,
This bloody mess washed down with tears,
And well toss this up to fate,
...
