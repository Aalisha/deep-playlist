(Planet Asia)
Cali Breeze, Planet Asia
Cali Breeze
Through the mist, I stays true to this
No matter what the opportunist consuming, confuse me not wit foolishness
I stand on earth as the Asian beneficant
Vocalist, don't wanna focus cuz the brokest ones be the best rappers
To keep you listenin, but still that ain't true
Cuz you can make a million bucks and still all praise due
To the highest degrees, I manifest to be the flyest MC
My final chapters you been dyin to see
Cali Breeze, male and fishy cuz these cats be killin big fish
For small change, dyin off without eatin the big dish
Witness life at its worst, evident witness at the finest
I Timex raps to keep my stats at a climate that's cool
Cats only climax cuz cats make sense
Cuz how the fuck you 'bout to MC when you can't make rent
For shelter, so keep it movin if your goal in life is shiesty
I hold the mic for days cuz rhyme pays, quoted by Ice-T
Precisely, I patternize thoughts that's frightening
Sometimes I drops lightning on the poisonous minds
I run the lines like Rasco but blown off hash though
G's for Cali Breeze cuz my steez is cash flow
