There's a faraway Island neath the silvery moonlight
Just a paradise of dreams across the sea
There's a maiden all alone and still waitin'
On that old Hawaiian shore for me.

The tears they were falling and the nightbirds were calling
As the breeze that night waved through the air so free
The palmtrees were swaying south guitars were playing
Aloha where I dwell to be.
