One, two, three, four

Fire won't burn, water is dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water is dry
And I, I never cry

I never miss you, no, I never miss you
Except when I'm awake
And I don't need you, no, I don't need you
Except when my heart breaks

I'm getting used to being alone
In this empty house, that's not a home
And tell myself it's over, now put you on a shelf
And tell myself I'm happy and I also tell myself

Fire won't burn, water is dry
And it snows in July
Fire won't burn, water is dry
...
