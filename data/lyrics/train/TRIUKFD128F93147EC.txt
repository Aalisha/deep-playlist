I found out just a little too late.
I had my doubt, but I decided to wait.
Even though I could feel somethin' comin'
It came as such a surprise.
I should have known when you first started
runnin' away before my eyes.

I'm so out of season
You left me cold and I'm standin' here freezin'.
I'm so out of season now.
