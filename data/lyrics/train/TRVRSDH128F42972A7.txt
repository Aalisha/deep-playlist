[George:] This town has its claws buried in my neck
This town, it takes lives, without mercy, without hate

[Dallas:] The streets are in distress
The sun suffocates behind darkened skies

[George:] The grass is growing on top of my feet
I'm sinking, won't be long, before I'm too deep to run

[Dallas:] The line up seems endless
Underneath the salvation signs.

[George:] We are the dead ones, we are the lost cause
We are the bend before the break. Our steps seal our fate.

[Chorus:]
Because this city, this city is haunted
By ghosts (ghosts) from broken homes (homes)
Because this city, this city is haunted
And there's no hope (hope) left for these souls (souls).
