Apathy is what got me here, I sit around and wait
I watch the world across the room content with second rate
So called friend all pass me by, in and out my space
In and out my face, found another place

I don't know where it is, I just know there it isn't
I don't know what it is, I can feel something's...
I don't know why it is, but I feel something's different
I don't know what it is, something's definitely...

Solitaire, an empty room, the pot is in the bad
Winning seemed so easy when I cut the cards in half
Don't tell me that I'm all alone, I choose the path I take
...
