You know like I know you ain't never ever met nobody like me
You know like I know you ain't never ever met nobody like me

Chorus

You never met a girl like me
I ain't goin' such other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is when you got a down low chick on ya team

Verse 1

I might wake you up in the morning and cook for you
If you having problem with a song I'll write a hook for you
11: 30 at night I ain't gonna look for you
cause I know you coming home with me
I will never stress you or make you feel misled
