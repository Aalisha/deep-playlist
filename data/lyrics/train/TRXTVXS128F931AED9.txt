Inhale.
Want to lick it
We're passing
Face to face on streets.
Blood drenched thoughts of wars and battles past
White eyes stare out of faces red and I need,
Want to lick it,
Out of your face, and to smell the sweat

One for the others... and the others for the blood
This is the day of reckoning.
Days of greed, don't you hit me.
You fucking hasty cunt
and it always goes like breath, breath
Like I'm gonna suffocate
Breath, breath
Like I am the reckoning.
Like the others of the bloodshed generation once.
Like the others of the bloodshed years ago

Hit me and I'll rise to
...
