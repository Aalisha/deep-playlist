I lost my head, lost my mind
Living in the middle of a prodigal life
Oh, that's where you found me
About neck deep in a heap of sand
You asked, do I want a new life to live
And you, oh, you said love could save me

And there in a moment, things changed
For the first time, I found grace
And the old me began to fade away, until it was...

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
...
