And suddenly I felt it all
I disappeared from the world you never fear
I'm waiting for it to explode
I want to see you burn

Suddenly I have a heart
I disappear from the love we never had
Will you ever hit the ground
Or keep it in my mind

'Cause I'm losing my perspective
As I want you all to know
That I'm free from your injections

You'll never see me run again
On the way, on the way to your heart
...
