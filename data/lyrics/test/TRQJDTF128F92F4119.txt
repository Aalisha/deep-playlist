I heard every word you said
And trying hard to understand
Exactly what it is you need from me
Baby I apologize
I never meant to make you cry
But there ain’t no doubt, we can work it out yeah
‘Cause I’m going to be around

Don’t worry baby
I ain’t no maybe
Rain or shine
This love of mine is for you
Let my arms remind you
I’ll always be beside you
Holdin’ on until this ride is through
So away we go, down that forever road
