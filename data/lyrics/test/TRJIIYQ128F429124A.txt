She sees the darkness
Breeding inside his rotten soul
She fears the sickness
Bleeding black as fear unfolds

Blood splattered wedding dance
This heart shaped violence

Literal masquerade
A dark secret carved in the heart
Must maintain the charade
Until death will do them apart

Saw herself in white
Seduced by the power of love
Kissed the fist goodnight
The white now soiled with her blood
...
