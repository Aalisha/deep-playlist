A credit card, A busy street
I didn't buy anything
It wasn't hard for me to see
There's nothing here I'm missing
The pretty things you bought for me
That ain't the stuff I really want
I'm missing you terribly
And I know
There's one thing that I want and it's you
To be with me in sin
Be with me in sin
Be with me in sin
There's one thing that I want and it's you
It's nothing that I've got to prove
Just wanna feel
