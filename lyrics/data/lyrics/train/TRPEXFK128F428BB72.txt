Fortunes in Hades are the last hope,
Swallow...
Forgive the Leopard King and the hangman's gallows.
Shark People Wear Shark Clothes!
The bite was ugly as sin.
But we were ready, disguised the malice stone.

[Chorus:]
Our friend Lazarus sleeps,
Her lips shake with every, with every word.
You were my favorite.
We both know our love will never end.
Conform me in, into the wicked...
