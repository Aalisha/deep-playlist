You're just nineteen
But already the bitchiest queen
Your room's a mess
I'm not impressed
But, damn, you have
The cutest dress

The world's not fair
You just can't deal with your despair
Aspirins and alcohol
Are not enough to die, Nicole

Here's a party you're waiting for
Make some room for the perfect whore
All your friends are arriving
Mainstream hits and magazines

Morning comes and you're not home
Hey Nicole, what have you done
What you've lost is memory
Poor Nicole

Aspirins and alcohol
This is a cocktail for Nicole
Fuck Nicole is out of control
