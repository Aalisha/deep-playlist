Hee
(You are under my power)
(It is the power of love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You say my kisses taste like magic, well, stop
That's got to be the classic line
Please no more presto change-o
Now that I'm in love, baby, 'cause that would really blow my mind

I'd pull a rabbit out of my hat
Or cross a black cat's path to find you
And darling, you can best believe
There's nothing up my sleeve but love

It must be magic
(It must be magic)
It must be magic
(It must be magic)

It must be magic, got me under your spell
It must be magic, oh, baby
(It must be magic)
It must be magic
(It must be magic)

Ooh, you got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
Keep workin' my love, such a magical feeling
You got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
And I love it, love it, love it
(Tilt me)

It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good
It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It must be magic, baby
'Cause it feels so good

You say, you know I've got the potion, well, stopc
No baby, don't stop, don't you dare
(Don't you stop it, baby, don't you dare)
Aladdin, Houdini and Merlin, the magician
