America is a sharecropper's son
Who plays a guitar
And grows up to be a rock and roll star
Yes even a sharecopper's son can go far
In America

America is an immigrant's daughter
With something to say
Who grows up to be a writer one day
An immigrant's daughter can turn out ok
In America
America

You can build a bigger bridge
You can make a better car
Erect a building tall enough to almost touch a star
