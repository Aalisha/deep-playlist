I said, Lou-ee-ise
The sweetest girl I know
I said, Louise
The sweetest girl I know
She called me to warm Chicago
Down the Gulf of Mexico

Now look-a here, Louise
Somebody, fish in my pond
Carryin' all the perches, mama
Grinding all, up my bone

Lord, Louise
Honey, please don't do me wrong
Lord, I ain't had no lovin'
Honey, since Louise been gone

Now look-a here, baby
Across that river long, she's on
Bank a-sand, she don't
Fair deep water, 'clare, she will nev'r
Never land

Lo-ord, Louise
