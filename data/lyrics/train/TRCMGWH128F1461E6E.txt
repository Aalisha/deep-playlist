If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
You just leave my woman alone

If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
If you don't want, you don't have to get into trouble
You just leave my woman alone
