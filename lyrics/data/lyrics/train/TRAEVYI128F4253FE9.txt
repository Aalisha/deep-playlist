The world is full of married men
With wives who never understand
They're looking for someone to share
The excitement of a love affair
Just as soon as they find you
They wine you and dine you
You fly on the wings of romance
But in the eyes of the world
You're just another crazy girl
Who loves a married man

Oh your love is a secret
And you've got to keep it
As long as you can
No don't cry for your lover
There's always another married man
The world is full of married men

Oh yeah you make him feel so young
But his wife will still be number one
He promises to marry you
Just as soon as his divorce
