God-brother... you lie...

When you see a fire burning inside your minds eye
Grieve/Breathe the meaning of the flames before you let them die
Let them burn you through until you know that you can fly
Twisting - turning - falling - burning
Roaring balls of fire
Eyes that see them have no need
Of guides to span the wire
Let the flames burn you right through
To low the burns through higher

Come and see
Come and buy

I can sell you the love
I can buy you the morning sun

You can buy seven/sand/sun(?) from the morning
From suns to the set in the morning for tea
Pockets of love but nothing to buy
Crystals of beauty - the mountain - the sea
Something that ain't through a mind full of pride
Going hands with the sun and set yourself free
Come and see
Come and buy
Come and buy... buy my love
