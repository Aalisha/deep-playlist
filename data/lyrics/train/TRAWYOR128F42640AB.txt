Ya know what I want
Come here
Nah, closer
Check it

(Chorus)
Pass some lovin' baby
You're lookin' rather tasty
I never take a small bite
Got to last me all night
After dinner we can see
Just how long you'll be with me
Slide that, real good, lovin' on

I need a man with a big strong hand
Packin' it in a gangsta stand
The twisted dreads, not brushed babe
Even with his hair shaved
Ya need a brotha that'll speak his mind
Never thinkin' twice about what he might find
Pick me up in all ways
Thought that (?)
