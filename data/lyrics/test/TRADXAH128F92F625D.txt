Sometimes you just get caught where the smoke blows
And you just have to breathe it in until it all goes
Don't you know it'll all be gone when you're gone?

Sometimes a thing look shit on the inside

Don't you know it'll all be gone when you're gone?

A small mind with a big notion
Brought down to earth by the size of the ocean wide
