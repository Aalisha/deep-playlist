I'm knockin' at your door
And there's no answer
I hear the moans and groans
Of your nasty laughter
I'm kickin' in the door
As your breathin' gets faster
Your trail of clues
Is leadin' to disaster

Once I looked into your eyes
I thought they were true
Innocence can turn to lies
And now the finger points
At you, baby

Shame Shame Shame
You should've known better
Than to cheat on me
