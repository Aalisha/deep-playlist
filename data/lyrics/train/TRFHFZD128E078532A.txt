Blow? s been dealt and is taken its toll
Listless, I stumble like a drunk in the cold
Questioning foundations and a hope I took for granted
See my soul choked by the rope of a slanted view of reality, so it seems
And maybe I? ve been living in some childish day dream
As not but dust in motion, insignificant drop in an endless ocean

So rend the veil, the shroud that clouds my eyes
I want to see you and every fiber of my being is longing for you, you
So rend the veil, the shroud that clouds my eyes
I want to see you and every fiber of my being is longing for you, you
