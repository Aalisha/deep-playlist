Smother his life
The words cut right to the heart
Disease and threaten my family name
An epic stand is made
Condemned I will not plead
Damned to the beast of torment
Damned by the beast within us all

Crushed by the the fear
More stone, more stone, more weight for Corey

Not one set forth could capture admission of guilt
