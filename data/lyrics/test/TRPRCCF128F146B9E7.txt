If you think your mind is ready
Then open your heart and let it fall
If you keep on hiding from me
You're not gonna live your life at all

'Cos if it's love that you want
You've gotta give me more than you've shown
Because the sweet light of love won't come down
If you don't cry, cry to be found
If you don't cry, cry to be found

So get yourself together, let it
Be something you'll treasure for ever more
...
