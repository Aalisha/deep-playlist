Million eyes and million souls
Never seen beyond the zone
As Charon proclaim the law
Winds come front, reveal the ones who gone

Transform all suffering into plagues

The slaves never seen beyond
Forever locked behind the rusty door
Naked suffer but they never die
In chains polluted, bless they alive

Wild annihilating riders
...
