A clean up woman is a woman who
Gets all the love we girls leave behind
The reason I know so much about her
Is because she picked up a man of mine

Chumpin' slick was my ruin
'Cause, I found out all I was doin'
Was making it easy for the clean up woman
To get my man's love, oh yeah
Just making it easy for the clean up woman
