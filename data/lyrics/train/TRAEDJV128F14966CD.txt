I am, I, I feel
I am, I
I close my eyes and make a wish
For inner peace and tranquility inside
My mind, I feel it's changing
Breaking down the defenses of my heart
It's like a new adventure
And this is my life
No longer know the girl inside
The stranger in my mind
I'm running away, running away from you
Though I beg you to stay, I'm running away from you
I'm running away
From predictable, Miss Reliable, so methodical
Wanna be individual and original
