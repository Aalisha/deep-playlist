I'm in a circle, looking up above
I'm turning purple as she smothers me
I watch her thinking, face is changing shape
How is she happy when she thinks of spit and rape

I know who you are
You left a big black scar
I say there's no escape
You'll know when

Fucker you're going down
Girl you're going down
Fucker you're going down
You and spit and rape

I'll get you
...
