Oooh, yeah
Oooh, yeah
What a cool an' deadly
Some call it Spanish Town, ah' Prison Oval Rock (2x)
Oooh, yeah (2x)
What a cool an' deadly
The people are skanking,
while the daughters dem whining,
The rude boys dem creepin'
Oooh, yeah
What a cool an' deadly
Hand inna di air like ah' Jockey fashion,
Cock out yuh batty like ah' water pumpy
Wine slowly that ah' cool an' deadly
...
