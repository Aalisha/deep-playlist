(Ron Haney)

I get excited at the thought of you
Growing up to be the girl I knew
In my dreams

Silly me I must have overslept
Maybe never didn't get here yet
When you said
I could be the shield to your sword
And I had your word

Oh now running in circles
Back to the crime
Give it time
Oh now running in circles
And wasting my dime
