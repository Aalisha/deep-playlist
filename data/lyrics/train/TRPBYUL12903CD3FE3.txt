I will see you
In some place and time
For the light you held
In my heart

Sugarcane and jealousy
What a scene
Will I burn in hell?
Will I live to see the day?

I try to visualize
Imagine myself
In the same position as you

It was my decision to let you
Know where I was going to
I did it to wind you up
