There is a paradise that can be found
A better life to bring us round
And all we really need to do
Is see the world like lovers do

I want to take it easy, take it slow
To catch a fire and let it go
I wanna give myself to you
So we can live like lovers do

Like lovers do
I wanna feel that way
Yeah like lovers do
They lose themselves for days
And I need to feel, I need to feel that way
...
