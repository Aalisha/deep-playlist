Requiem eternam
Et dona eis domine

Ride, ride, over the land
Sorrow comes without a waring, dear
And do never start to sacrifice your faith
They, they betray
And poisoned voices creep into your mind
For this will be their final stand

Ride, ride over the land!
Outside - a light!
He awakes in the deep of a stormy night
They have come to get him now
A feast for the raging crowed
With torches still alight
...
