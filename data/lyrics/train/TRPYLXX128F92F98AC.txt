Shoot, shoot, shoot all the clowns
Shoot, shoot, shoot all the clowns ... shoot, shoot

I've been down at the crazy house
I've been playing with the cat and the mouse
I've been down, I've been down
I've seen the crazy people running around

Shoot all the clowns
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down
Shoot all the clowns
Shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down, shoot 'em down

Welcome to the circus where I fool around
I've got the killer smile, I'm a killer clown
