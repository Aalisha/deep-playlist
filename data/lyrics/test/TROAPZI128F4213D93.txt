ı am at long way from home
ı cant sleep at night
ı grabed my telephone you know
something just aint right
ıts evil hey
look what is evil
gotta run
yes ıt is baby
you know ım warning you brothers
you better watch your happy home
yes ım at long way from home
ı can not sleep at night
ı got a call on my phone babe
