The sun rises at nine, departs at five
Ain't doing overtime no more
Because in this world of color
The brightest picture is plugged right into your wall

And maybe there's a million people singing shoe shine blues
To no one that they've ever met before
And indifference is a drug that I see people buy
At the local store, local store

You, you, you think a little love is all you need
But love is such a small thing, can't you see?
I think you'll find it lives in the colors
And brightens this picture you see

I say you just feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel, what you want it to be, oh, oh
You just feel what you want it to be
What you want it to feel, what you want it to be

The man in the moon has a cold
In the back of his head today, so dark is the river
As the old bridge of lovers finds it's getting washed all away

There are three wise men in the darkness of the desert
