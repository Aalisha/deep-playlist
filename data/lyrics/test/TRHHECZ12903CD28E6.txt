Aspirat primo fortuna labori (The fortune is smiling at our first effort,)
me duce tutus eris (let me lead you and you will be safe,)
vox populi vox dei (the voice of people, voice of god)
ad maiorem dei gloriam... (for bigger glory of the god)
ad infinitum (to the infinity.)

You know just who I am
Don't be so distant
Cause when you're lost I am solely there
To share your grief

Wailing your sorrow is only my way to comfort you
Reminders of innocent youth
