You know I'm around you
I wouldn't be if I didn't love you
I'm going to run through you
You know you're quite a character
It goes that I haven't got a care
When we float down the river
I wonder will I lose you
When we roam through a blizzard
We'll joke and have another cry
I hope I'm not the other guy
