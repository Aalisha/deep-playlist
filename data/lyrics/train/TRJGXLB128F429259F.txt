If it wasn't for yo' momma
Never thinkin' I was good enough
If it wasn't for yo' brotha
Always checkin' every move, I gave up

If it wasn't for that bitch
Down the block always in yo' ear
Be no room for messin' up
But baby love, you'd be right here

Tell me why must I, since they bought us things
Suffer indefinitely for loving you
Sugar why must I prove to anybody but you
Feel I been chosen to loose, I paid my dues, oh

If it wasn't for yo' momma
Never thinkin' I was good enough
If it wasn't for yo' brotha
Always checkin' every move, I gave up

If it wasn't for that bitch
Down the block always in yo' ear
Be no room for messin' up
...
