Geah. Wutup? The Compton phsyco is back
Here goes something for the niggas

Listen up mutherfuckers cause its hard times
MC Eiht comin back with the hard rhymes. Geah
So bring your pen and pad and start learnin
And sit your ass down for the Eiht root sermon
You know the hard life comes livin with livin in the ghetto
Nigga hello, don't be shakey like Jello
And you better know where your from
Or you might catch the blast to your sorry ass. Geah
And the gang bangin done got me in the slum
So I gotta be with it, fuck the dumb
Down for the hood, holdin my own
Livin it up cause one day I'll be gone. Geah
Now the shit done hit the fan
14 Year old nigga headed for the can
Blame it on the world, because everybodies buggin
Can I get help because a niggas strugglin
