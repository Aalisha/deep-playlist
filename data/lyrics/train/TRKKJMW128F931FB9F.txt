I never really know who you are
You could be a ghost for all I know
whenever you're home
Picking up pieces of my heart
Like leaves that have fallen on our garden path

Who's gonna fly your plane
When you need to make your getaway?

But I'm still holding on
Calling you back home, calling you back

I never really know who you are
