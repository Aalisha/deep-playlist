Looks like it`s over
the beginning of the end, between you and me
there`s sadness in your heart
trying to hold back the tears in your eyes

I`m empty inside; my soul`s left to die without you
I`m losing my mind
and I don`t know what I should do

Try to retrace where we wnt wrong
it`s not the same without you
...
