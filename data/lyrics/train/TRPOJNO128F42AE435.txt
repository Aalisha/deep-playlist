You know where I've come from
You know my story
You know why I'm standing here tonight
Please don't go
Don't be in a hurry
I'm here to make it clear
Make it right
Well I know I've acted foolish

But I promise you no more
I've finally found that something
Worth reaching for
I'm not here to say I'm sorry

I'm not here to lie to you
I'm here to say I'm ready
That I've finally thought it through
I'm not here to let your love go
I'm not giving up oh no
