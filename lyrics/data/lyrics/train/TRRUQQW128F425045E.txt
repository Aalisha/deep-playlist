Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang
Shoop shoop, shoop de-lang-a-lang

Oh what you gonna do, Katie?
You're a sweet sweet girl
But it's a cruel, cruel world
a cruel, cruel world.

My pins are none too strong, Katie
Hurry up, Mrs Brown
I can feel it coming down
& it won't take none too long
