14 to 41
Start blind, end up dumb 
You're 16, You're 23, you're 32, you're 41... 
14 to 41
Start blind, end up dumb 
You're 16, You're 23, you're 32, you're 41... 

Gonna leave it all behind and not say sorry 
Yea you are always right, so why worry? 
You learn to steal and lie to friends -- You trust no one 
My birthday's comin' around again...
