There will be no kisses tonight
There will be no holding hands tonight
'Cause what is now wasn't there before and should not be

I know I've broken some hearts, I understand
Some firecrackers blow up in your hand
And while fucked up, I have always tried to be true

But I would never kiss anyone
Who doesn't burn me like the sun
...
