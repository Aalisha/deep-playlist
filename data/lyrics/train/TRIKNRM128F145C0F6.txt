I am through with hanging around
All the boys in town
Now I want a man around
Get me out of here

Now I am a just red brassiere
To all the boys in town
Put this bus in top gear
And get me out of here

I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low
I must have been desperate
I must have been pretty low

I was always driving home
All the boys in town
But they never telephoned
Get me out of here
...
