You feel like Steve McQueen
when you're driving in your car
and you think you look like James Bond
when you're smoking your cigar
it's so bizarre you think you are
a new kind of James Dean
but the only thing I've ever seen of you

was a commercial spot on the screen

Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
you think you are a movie
Movie Star, Movie Star, ahahar
you think you are a Movie Star, ahahar

You should belong to the jet set
fly your own private lear jet
...
