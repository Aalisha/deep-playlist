I'm walkin'
Yes indeed, I'm talkin'
By you and me, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me, yeah, yeah

I'm lonely
Yes I can be, I'm waitin'
For your company, I'm hopin'
That you'll come back to me

What you gonna do when the well runs dry?
You gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side
