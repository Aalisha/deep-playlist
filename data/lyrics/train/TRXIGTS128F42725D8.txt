Everything's fine for now, no one's really laughin'
Everything's just all right, or is it now
Turn up to the round, but keep movin' on
We can cut the cord now, just draggin' along

Now there's too many people tryin' too hard
Not to be outdone
They follow close behind their proud
Smokin' gun

Some people mean whether to pay them any mind
Some people turn to tomorrow and some a bottle of wine
...
