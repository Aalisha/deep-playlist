"You first found me in my holding pen
Stopped to take a look and stuck your finger in
I bit one off and you came back again and again
Then the nice people let me out one day
And you told me how to act and what to say
But you never get what you wanted that way

You never get what you want
You never get what you want
And I don't think it's my fault
You never get what you want, do you baby?

Everything's always such a mystery
Including your sad little history
Do you still think someone should take responsibility and pay
