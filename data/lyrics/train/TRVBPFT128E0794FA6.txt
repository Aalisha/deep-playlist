He looked beneath his shirt today
There was a wound in his flesh so deep and wide

From the wound a lovely flower grew
From somewhere deep inside
He turned around to face his mother
To show her the wound in his breast that burned like a brand

Was the sword in his mother's hand

Every day another miracle
Only death will tear us apart
To sacrifice a life for yours
I'd be the blood of the lazarus heart
The blood of the lazarus heart
