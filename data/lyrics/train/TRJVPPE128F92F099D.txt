Here in this room, this narrow room
Where life began when we were young last night
I feel your back pressed close to me
And hear your steady breathing as you sleep

Then as the first soft glow of dawn moves silver gray
Like paint along the wall
I touch your hand and feel your ring
And know this night is all we'll ever have
...
