She's got something that moves my soul
And she knows
I'd love to love her
But she lets me down every time
Can't make her mine
She's no one's lover

Tonight with me she'll be so inviting
I want her all for myself

Oh, temptation eyes
Looking through my, my, my soul
Temptation eyes
You've got to love me, got to love me tonight

Got to love me, baby, yeah, mmm
