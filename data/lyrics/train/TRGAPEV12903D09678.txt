Proud and so glorious
Standing before of us
Our swords will shine bright in the sky
When united we come
To the land of the sun
With the heart of a dragon we ride

We are flying on wings in winter sky
With fire burning deep inside
We are warriors of endless time forever and on

On wings of steel an ancient flight
We see the powers that unite
The gods will now send us a sign of battle once more

Through the valley we ride
Full of glory we soar
Where the fights will be raging
For now and for more

When united we come
And divided they fall
Tonight you will witness it all
