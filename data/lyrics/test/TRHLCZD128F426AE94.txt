Gamble everything for love
Gamble everything
Put it in a place you keep what you need
You can gamble everything for love if you're free

You gotta gamble everything for love
Baby are you cold? Are you cold?
Baby I can wrap you up, wrap you up in my love
If you wanna you can gamble everything for love

If you wanna you can gamble everything for love
Tell me are you're feeling lost?
Have you crossed into places that you never knew to get through?
Tell me are you gonna cry all night?
Tell me the truth and I'll tell you the truth
If you gamble everything for love you're gonna be alright

Alright
Make a list of the things you need
Leave it empty
Except for number one, write love
