I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know (I don't know)

Baby I don't know if I can let you
Get that close to me again
Cause last time I let you
Our life was one big argument
And I'm willing to bet you
That we'd be better off as friends
Can you accept just being friends

You're telling me that we should sit down
And talk about us
But truthfully, I really don't agree
Cause we don't have much to discuss
For some reason you think that we could work it out
I have serious doubts

Baby I don't know if I can let you
