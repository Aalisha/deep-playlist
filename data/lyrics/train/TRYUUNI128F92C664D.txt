I can only speak for those that do not know me,
I can only write the words that would not show me,
I will never quite explain what I've been doing

I am you and you are me but we are nothing,
My heart broke and rose to go but I'm not going,
'Cause I loved you long before the day I told you

And it's you and it's me,
And it's time on our side
...
