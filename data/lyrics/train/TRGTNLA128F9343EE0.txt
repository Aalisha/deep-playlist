Let the trigger finger put the pressure to the mechanism
Which gives a response, for the automatic
Clip to release projectiles in single file
Forcing me to ignite then travel through the barrel

Headed for the light at the end of a tunnel
With no specific target in sight
Slow the flow like H2O water
Visualize, the scene of a homicide, a slaughter

No remorse for the course I take
When you pull it, the result's a stray bullet
Niggaz who knew hit the ground runnin' and stay down
Except for the kids who played on the playground

'Cause for some little girl, she'll never see more than six years of life
Trifling, when she fell from the seesaw
But umm wait, my course isn't over
Fled out of the other side of her head towards a red Range Rover

Then I ricochet fast past a brother's ass, oh damn
What that nigga say, "Aw fuck it", next target's Margaret's face
And I struck it, now it's a flood of blood in circumference to her face
And an abundance of brains all over the street

Shame, how we had to meet, dashin', buckin'
Greet by fuckin' family, they follow behind me in a orderly fashion
Bashin' through flesh, I'm wild crashin' through the doors
Of projects hallways to deflect off of the tile
...
