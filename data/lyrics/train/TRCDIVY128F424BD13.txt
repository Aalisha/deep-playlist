Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glenn to glenn and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide.

Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, the pipes are calling
From glenn to glenn and even down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses falling
It's you, It's you must go and I must bide.
