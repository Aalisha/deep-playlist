Over my head I hear music in the air
Over my head I hear music
Over my head it's loud and clear
It's going to my head

Music, music, I hear music
Music, I hear music, music, music oh oh oh Lord
Music over my head
I, I, I, I hear it so clear
I, I, I hear it so dear
I know, I know, I know I'm not crazy
It's going to my head

Music, music, I hear music
Music, oh I hear music, music
Music oh oh oh lord, yeah
Music over my head
