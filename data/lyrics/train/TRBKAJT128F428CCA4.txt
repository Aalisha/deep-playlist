Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
Its really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee
Now picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring, yes
