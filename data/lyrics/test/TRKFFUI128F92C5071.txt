You stand here in my place
Feel the warmth upon your face
Stand back and start to smile
You now have time, you now have will

I would never want to leave this country
Where rules are fast and knowledge easy
I would never want to take you with me
Unless you're open and trust my hand

I would never wish this much on you
When what you have might be enough
I would never want to drive that fast
Unless you're ready, willing, happy
