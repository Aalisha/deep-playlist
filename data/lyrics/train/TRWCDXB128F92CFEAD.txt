I remember how we met
But your name I forget
Like the door that I have kept unopened

I remember it was wet
And the swelter and the sweat
And the shelter of the bed we were cloaked in

You were stroking me like a pet
But you didn't own me yet
And the tape in the cassette deck was choking
Spat out a broken hallelujah

But I've seen the way the earth
Throws its aces with a curve
You were waiting for the words
To come to yer.

Just to say that you prefer to be lonely
To be cursed
And to do the very worst you can do.

Yeah I remember you like a verse
That I didn't want to learn
I just looked into your eyes
And I knew yer.
