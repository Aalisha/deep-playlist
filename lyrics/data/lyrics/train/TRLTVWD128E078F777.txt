I know that every morning you go thumbin'
Through the personal want ads

You grab the latest copy, a cup of coffee
And settle in for a good laugh
I've been trying to catch your eye but I'm so shy
I'm hopin' and prayin' that
Today's edition is gonna catch your attention
'Cause there's a
Single white female
Looking for that special lover

To put it in a nutshell
A one womsn man who doesn't want no other
Oh, you never can tell
She just might be your dream come true
A single white female
