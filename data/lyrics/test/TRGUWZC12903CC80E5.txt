Baby kiss the sky you will be free
Paint yourself the picture believe what you see
Everybody gonna slow dance on the moon tonight, yea
Baby kiss the sky and take off your clothes
Let the summer air liberate your soul
(Everybody) join the crossroad caravan tonight

(Earth, sun, moon and rain will live on)
We are all here learning to fly
Epiphany on the horizon
Welcome to a brave new world

Brother (kiss the sky)
You're alive and hear the sound
A million angels sing and dance around
...
