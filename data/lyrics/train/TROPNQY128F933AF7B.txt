You and me in the photobooth
Waiting for the flash, close the curtain urgently
You and me like young lovers do
Timing for the kiss and close enough to hear you breathe
You and me in the photobooth
Waiting for the flash, style with a cup of tea
You and me in the photobooth
Giving it the nash, posing like we're this years models

You take a lot
And call me up
You should. call
I suppose you're right
I tell a lie
It may.yay end

You wanna shake it right down
