This is my same old coat
These are my same old shoes
It was the same old me
With the same old blues

Oh, then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
And when I look in the mirror
I see a brand new girl, oh me

Just because of you, boy
Just because of you whoa, oh, oh
Just because of you, boy
Just because of you

I got the same old friends
And they've got the same old sins
I tell them the same old jokes
And I get the same old grins
