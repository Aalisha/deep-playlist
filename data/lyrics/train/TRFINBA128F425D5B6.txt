He used to be a singer in a rock and roll band
He would write the songs and I'd tremble at his hand
But oh, la, la, he lost poetic ethic
And his songs were pathetic, he's a failure now

You'd never catch him looking up and never see him down
But oh, la la, he couldn't raise a smile
No, not for a while and he's a failure now
