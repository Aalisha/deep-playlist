Yeah, ya know
Nah, nah, nah, outta road
You have to defend your own, well

Now ease off, squeeze off, pop it off
Now ease off, you have to defend your own so
Now ease off, squeeze off, pop it off
Now ease off, you have to protect your own now

Full clip, banana clip, hollow tip
Yeah, it a fling if a bwoy trip in here now
Full clip, trigger nah stick, rubber grip
Bullet a fling if a bwoy slip

Evidently, them a no badman
Them always talk 'bout them a gangsta of the century
Whe them a do, whe them a try
Come dis badman fool that a tempt we

Me no care how much bling you have
Bullet a boar through you and your Bentley
Almighty God a protect we
Yeah, me bun the sweet sensi

Keep my mind off of bad mind, hypocrite and people who envy
Come a try to take what is mine, bwoy, de clip get empty
Don't bother talk about six shots, pussy
I bust twenty, protect we, nah, nah, now

Now ease off, squeeze off, pop it off
Now ease off, you have to defend your own so
Now ease off, squeeze off, pop it off
Now ease off, you have to protect your own now
