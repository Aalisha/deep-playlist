Ice will melt, water will boil
You and I can shake off this mortal coil
It's bigger than us
You don't have to worry about it

Ready or not, here comes the drop
You feel lucky when you know where you are
Y'know, it's gonna come true
Here in your arms, I remember

It's only natural
That I should want to be there with you
It's only natural
That you should feel the same way, too

It's easy when you don't try going on first impressions
Man in a cage has made his confession
