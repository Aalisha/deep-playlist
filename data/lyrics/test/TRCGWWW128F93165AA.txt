You could break this silence with
words we wish we'd never said,
but I can hear it like a scream.
What's become of you and me?
Are we still inside this night,
or am I going crazy?

I'm just trying to understand
who I was and who I am,
but you are changing just the same.
So you can tell me who's to blame?
Could we put our weapons down,
just to figure this out now?!

Pride is out the door
cause I know we can make it before...
Make it before...
...
