Once again the pain has come
Blood fills my eyes
Another voice lies dying in the wind
This remains constant
Repetition breeds normalcy just the dying whisper of an infected fool
One more face has come
And walked away with a piece of me
Leaving me along bleeding and speechless
Preserving silence
Please understand you've done this to yourself
A dying flower and a piece of blame
That I used to know
I remember you staring back at me
Through broken glass
So tear apart your memories
And suck your fingers dry and look for another way
To fill an empty life
...
