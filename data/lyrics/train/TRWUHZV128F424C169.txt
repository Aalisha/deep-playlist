To do what I should do
To long for you to hear
I open up my heart
And watch her name appear
A word for you to use (ooh-oh)
A girl without a cause
A name for what you lose
When it was never yours (oh-oh do-do-do)

The first time baby that I came to you
For I'd do things that you want me to
The second time baby that I came to you
For oh you found my love for you
The third time baby that I came to you
Oh, oh, oh, I knew
The last time baby that I came to you
Oh how your flesh and blood became the word
