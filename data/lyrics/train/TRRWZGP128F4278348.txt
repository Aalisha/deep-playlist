This is not the way I wanted things to be
I hope someday you'll understand
My heart beats stronger when I know I'm close to you
It's helped me be a better man

Why must all of the love come falling
Why don't we just take our chance
I could walk this road again with you, my love, oh, oh

Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love, some elusive dream
Why can't you find your way
I'll fall for you no matter where it leads

This is not the way we started, you and I
