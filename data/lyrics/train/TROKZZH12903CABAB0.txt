I still have last night in my body
I wish you were with me
I still have last night in my body
I wish you were with me
I wish you were with me

I still have last night in my body
I wish you were with me
I still have last night in my body
I wish you were with me
I wish you were with me, David

I still have last night in my body
I wish you were with me
I wish you were with me, David
