Never a heaven an age old question
Written from a cold place
I gotta feel sour, I need a shower
Or just a slap in the face

Circumstance has left romance
And a puzzle in front of me
Who knows the ending
If the truth need bending
A lie is the tool that you'll need

So, I'm under a mountain
Stuck to this mattress
Perfume and Valium
