Now that we've reached the new millennium
Let's stop a while and re-adjust our minds
Cause this oppression has gone on to long

World leaders are brain washing all mankind
Unveil the mystery of iniquity
Religion's been the backbone of our strife
When you go back into history
False prophet's have misguided our lives, Hey!

Find some way, There must be a way, Let's do it today
Find some way, There must be away, Let's do it today
