Glade told her ma, "Home scene's lame"
"I gotta go in into town, blow some steam at the rock show"
Sneak through the back door and head for the pit
And then some drunk stupid bruiser started giving her shit

Rednecks on parade
"Don't cross my line!" says Everglade
Everglade

He was whipping through the pit
Knocked her onto the stage
She said, "Have your fun
But stop being so lame"
