Days. Days. Days
Stealing secret moments
Breathing in the summer sun
As the sea of changes
Wash ashore

Days
In the great wide open
Theres so much to catch the eye
Your beauty, Shade and light
Shade and light

Quite Witness to forever
In my silene i keep holding on
I am waiting 'til forever
And i understand where we belong

Quite Witness to forever
In my silene i keep holding on
...
