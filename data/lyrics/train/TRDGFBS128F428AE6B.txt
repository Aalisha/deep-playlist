Ooooh...

[Tarzan Yell]

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

Hey! You wanna ride?
(purrs)

Riding the tiger
Mess with me, you'll fall in love
I said that you're riding the tiger
Are you red enough? (Are you red enough?)
Are you red enough?

Said, don't riding the tiger
Mess with me, you'll fall in love, baby
Riding the tiger
Are you red enough? (Are you red enough?)
Are you red enough?

Do you burn in the night?
Ahh, don't tangle with me
Could you put up a fight?
I'm not afraid to be free
Do you grin when you bite?
Jump off, and you'll see
Ooh...

Did you know where you've been?
I got a hunk every day
Is a pleasure of sin?
Gonna make you my prey
Can you tell when you win?
I don't let nothing stand in my way
Ha, ha! Whoo!

Sometimes it said love it taste so sweet
May knock you off your feet
If you can't stand the heat,
I said to get off my back, oh!
