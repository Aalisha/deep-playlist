Can't put my finger on what's changed
To my surprise I found everything the same
In a house that's not quite home
Nothing was missing but something had gone

I hadn't seen my reflection in a while
I tried to? direction for miles
So I took a walk through town
To see if someone moved the streets around

I was a teenage Steve McQueen
My best performance escaping
I was a teenage Steve McQueen
My best performance escaped me

The engine was running but I couldn't get away
I didn't see any reason to stay
All my visions have been erased
Cast an extra with nothing to say

I wrote myself into a new storyline
This part was different this time it was mine
Now I'm lost in my own town
