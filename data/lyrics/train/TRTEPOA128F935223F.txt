She fell down the stairs and opened her eyes
He's over the edge this time
He's all wound up from the nightmares
They make him lose his mind

She's distracted
Lost the sense of the urgency tonight
The sense of the urgency tonight

For a couple of years she covered her eyes
She'd give him hell sometimes
The makeup covered the bruises
But somehow made her blind

She got distracted
Lost the sense of the urgency in life
The sense of the urgency in life
Can she save herself? Save her from the nightmare
