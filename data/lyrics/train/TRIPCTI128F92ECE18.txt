It's up to you, you make the call
It's always been your choice
Maybe your right
And were all wrong
Were only some voices
Cause in the end it all depends
I'll step aside and let you decide

There was a season in your life
When everyone was smarter
The best Advice that they could give
You'll have to work much harder
Then finally someday you'll be wise
Realize only you decide

Cause everybody has to choose
