[Verse One]
My shit is thick like a wooly headed black Jesus
I was born to win skills like my nappy stuff
But when I gots my nappy stuff I got a flake or two
These irritatin flakes, I wipe them out the whole crew
Shinin through like the coconut, all on my scalp
Hey these irritatin flakes act like locks cause they dread
When I flex my nappy stuff, there's no whack jheri curl juice
In other words, a weak raps I never can produce
So cut them jheri curl raps, and try again naps
In skilled hard work, professor needs wax
Cause I got as many locks as the skins I busted
Extensions get dissed cause they can't be trusted
But I love it when they blow it feels good to my head
It's about the same length but two inches thicker
Like a dread from my bobbin head I swing back and forth
Suckers on me like my locks, they stuck to what sauce?

[Chorus x2]
MC's dread my skills (but I got 'em locked up)
MC's dread my skills (but I got 'em locked up)
MC's dread my skills (but I got 'em locked up)
Locked what? (Lock lock it up now)
