Baby, I don't understand
Why we can't just hold on
To each other's hands

This time might be the last time I fear
Unless I make it all so clear
I need you so

We're in this life together
Even when one moves without the other
Different pages from the same story

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong
And make it right
...
