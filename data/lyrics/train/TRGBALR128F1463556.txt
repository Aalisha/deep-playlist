I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you,

Some get their kicks from cocaine,
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff,
That would bore me terrifically too,
But I get a kick out of you,

I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me,
I get a kick tough it's clear to me,
That you obviously do not adore me,
