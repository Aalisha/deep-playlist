Yo, somethin' dangerous man, gangsta

Woo, do you wanna pimp wit this guy
Do a buck on a ninety-five?
Run with them hookers when they payin' sheen
Talk of sex appeal, I was born gangsta

Shit, don't play wit me
An' in the game I'm as real as they come
Threw the knife, baby, outta the sun
Even a susperstar, 'cuz I'm a gangsta

Now let's get one thing straight
You fuckin' with a nigga, that's liable to catch a case
I'll turn ya birthday into your worst day
Bitch, I'll have you on a high speed chase on the first day

Umm, try an' throw, I'm so affiliated
This greenery got me sedated, I'm feelin' faded
Hood life, the life of a robber on chrome wires an' switches
A nigga wit mo' crimes to riches

A ghetto jump start
Post it up with the tiny homies in my momma's front yard
A hood pioneer, can't function without the smell of gunpowder
An' fish fryin' in the air

I'm a sheist nigga, check for ice, nigga
Bitch, you got the wrong nigga if you want a nice nigga
I'm Dub C, fuck a MC, catch me in a MC
On a buck twenty, bitch, fuck wit me?

Woo, do you wanna pimp wit this guy
Do a buck on a ninety-five?
Run with them hookers when they payin' sheen
Talk of sex-appeal, I was born gangsta
