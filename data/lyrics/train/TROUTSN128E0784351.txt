Woh, check it out
Check it out

Some stupid things
Mean a lot in my life
Like the feeling like that I want to now ya.
Like the feeling like that I want to now ya.

If you're in my heart
Say I could and I would be strong, man
Say I could and I would be strong, man

World in another
I was trapped within
A world within another
World in another
Say I was trapped within
A world within another
