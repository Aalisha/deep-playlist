This cat's on a hot tin roof
Drinkin' that whiskey, 96 proof
Don't need no doctor, don't feel no pain
My legs are just two steps ahead of my brain

This cat's on a hot tin roof
This cat's gonna shake it loose
This cat don't get the blues
'Cause this cat's shakin' on a hot tin roof

This cat's been out on the town
