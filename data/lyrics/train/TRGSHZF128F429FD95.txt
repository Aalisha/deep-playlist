When I'm alone at night
Alone in my room
When I switch off the light
Then my friends walk in
And my party begins

Welcome home Lil' Abner and Snoopy
Tarzan, great to see you again
Hi Sheena, Barbarella, Modesty
Glad you could join in the fun
My friends are Superman and Linus
Dear Andy Capp and Doctor Strange
