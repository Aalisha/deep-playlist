Confession's of the brakeman's son
Vindicating setting sun
Look back at what you've done
You can't forgive

In the costumes of complacencies
Crime is worse than they can see
Beauty torn so tastelessly
It's all you give

All your faithless loyalties
They won't give me no rest
But I got little else to defend

Sure you've seen better but
For you I did my best
But oh no, I go faithlessly my friend
When I know I can win

Revolving door of Alabam
