When I wake up early in the morning
I lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
I stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)

Please don't wake me
No, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
Well, I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Until they find there's no need (there's no need)

Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
You're taking my time
Llying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
...
