So glad don't have to worry no more
I'm so glad, girl I don't have to worry no more
I didn't change my way of living
Woman I don't have to never worry no more

You know I've been up, God knows I've been down
I've been up, well, again I've been down
But I didn't change my way of living
Woman I don't have to worry no more
...
