I've got a plan to make it rich and famous,
Lucky for me, for you it's a bitch you ain't in,
My plans are slowly changing,
Fame is so contagious

Chorus
I'm willing to sleep my way to the top,
I wanna be pop-ular,
I don't wanna keep my feet on the ground,
I wanna be popular

I must confess,
I've been a ve-ry bad boy,
Been sleepin around,
Talk of the town,
My name is
Hol-lywood will beckon,
E-veryone will listen,
Play my video hear me on the radio,
Dancin to the disco no one ever says no
...
