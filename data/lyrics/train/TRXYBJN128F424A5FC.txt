She stepped off the bus
Out into the city streets
She's just a small town girl
Whole life packed in a suitcase by her feet

But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright as they did
On her mama's TV screen
And the work seemed harder, days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be

But you know you got to stick to your guns
When it all comes down
'Cause sometimes you can't choose
A heads they win, tails you're gonna lose

Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, livin' out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
...
