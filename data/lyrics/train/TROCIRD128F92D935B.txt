For The Love Of You

Yeah
Well, well, well
Yeah, hey
Yeah
Hey, hey
Ooh

Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place
I'd rather be
Than with you, yeah
Lovin' you
Well, well, well

Day will make
A way for night
All we'll need
Is candlelight
And a song, yeah
Soft and long
Well, ooh

Glad to be
Here alone
With a lover
Unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon
Slowly comin'
Into view
Yeah

I wanna be livin'
For the love of you
Oh, yes, I am
All that I'm givin'
Is for the love of you
Alright now, ooh

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me
When the mornin' comes
Feels good to me, yeah
My love and me, well
