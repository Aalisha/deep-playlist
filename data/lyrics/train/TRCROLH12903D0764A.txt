Don't take chances on me
I don't think I can let you go
I'll be right here for you
(I'll be right here for you)
So just tell me and let me go
(So just tell me and let me go)
I don't think I can take it no more

I've had enough,
Forgive me if I can't hold my tongue
And I'm giving up
All I wanted was to be by your side
All I wanted was to feel alive
