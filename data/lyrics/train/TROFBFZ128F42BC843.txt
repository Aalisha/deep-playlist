Open up your box of sunshine
And smile as confetti comes
Raining down on you

You feel a lot like the good guy
Do you know why
Everything's so blue

Well, love is fire and
The coals are barely burning
Cold fills the emptiness
That fills this empty place

I taught you to walk but
Then you ran away from me
And that's not how
It's supposed to be

I, I collide with love
As an elusive state of mind
I know there's something else
It's supposed to be
I, I collide with love
As an elusive state of mind
Something's killing me

Tearful confessions
...
