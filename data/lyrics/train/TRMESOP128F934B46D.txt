Overwhelmed
Overrun
Oversaturated
Overpopulated

Imagine the earth as a corpse
That commited adultery
Sustenance for its lifeforms
But turned its back on humanity

A giant flood of homo sapiens
Of every race and creed
Upon the surface - billions of ovum
By the gallons - germinate the seed

Germinate. Cultivate. Ejaculate.
Populate. Much too late. Suffocate.

Testosteronal tidal wave disperses the estrogen
As billions of sperm cells come alive on your skin
Slithering
Squirming
Exfoliating
Uprooting bacteria still alive in the pores
Embedded memories
Humans masturbating
