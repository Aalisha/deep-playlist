Talk to my friends and we’re moving away
 I’ve had what I think is love but I couldn’t say for sure 
But all I’m saying is I might not make it I might not make it anymore. 
I’m done with these cold hearts and I’m ok to fight it 
This time I’m done with these alley cats and go go girls.
 But stay here tonight even more than it seems coming close but close is all
This should be easy on you, on you
This should be easy, I think we'll start again
This sjould be easy on you
I’m done with these cold hearts and I’m ok to fight it this time.
 I’m done with these alley cats and go go girls.
