Opened up my eyes and saw the sky
Over meadows where I lie
Then I heard the children cry
In my sleep I saw a distant light
It arose and left in flight
Then the shadows faded to white
In the night

Shame on you, shame on me
Is there any place to hide away?
Blame it on humanity

Why should everybody have to pay?
Shame on you, shame on me
Will our children have a say?
