You wanted a hit but maybe we don't do hits
I try and try, it ends up feeling kind of wrong
You wanted it tough but is it ever tough enough?
No, nothing's ever tough enough until we hit the road

Yeah, you wanted it lush but honestly you must hush
No honestly you know too much so leave us, leave us on our own
And so you wanted a hit, well, this is how we do hits
You wanted the hit but that's not what we do

You wanted it real but can you tell me what's real?
There's lights and sounds and stories, music's just a part
Yeah, you wanted the truth and then you said you want proof
I guess you're used to liars saying what they want

And we won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
We won't be your babies anymore
