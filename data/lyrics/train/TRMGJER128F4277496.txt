A funny thing happened to me
Just the other day, a girl came my way
She called your name, she said some things
I thought it was just some hearsay
But then she showed me a picture or two
Of her with some dude in positions that weren't cool

And then I looked again and I saw that this dude was you
My first reaction was to snap on her but what good would that do
You know that I have better things than fightin' over you
So many times it seems that I refused to see the truth
But this time you know that I am through

So just walk right out the door
'Cause you can't come back here no more
You know we've been through this before
So you can't come back, you can't come back
You're in and out of my life, this time was your last try
