You sow the seeds of endless chumps
and reap the weak with bible thumps
you cross your t's and dot your eyes
to fill the world with vapid lies
your judging ways are sick to death
your ignorance and praying breath
you profit from a confused land
that toils and dies to understand
we're born in pain and trapped in doom
our empty lives in empty rooms
the bible empties guilty minds
while cries for help face shutting blinds
these blind all scream for me to see
and disregard the ills of history
these fairy tales are memorized
and spew from mouths with empty eyes
No feeling
good book stole it away
