Arrival in the night out of nowhere
Telling stories about a butcher, a living dead

I eat your flesh, take your strength
Absorb your spirit, I feel so strong

You're one of us, give in to it
Eat or die, eat or die

No, he was licking my wounds
No, his lips on my wounds

Stabbing, stabbing, stabbing, stabbing, I'll rip you to pieces
My ravenous hunger becomes a craving for more

No, he was licking my wounds
