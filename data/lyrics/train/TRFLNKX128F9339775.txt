I had visions, I was in them
I was looking into the mirror
To see a little bit clearer
The rottenness and evil in me.

Fingertips have memories
Mine can't forget the curves of your body
And when I feel a bit naughty
I run it up the flagpole and see who salutes
But no one ever does.

I'm not sick but I'm not well
And I'm so hot, cause I'm in hell.

Been around the world and found
That only stupid people are breeding
The cretins cloning and feeding
