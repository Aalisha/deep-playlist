Riverbed, I'll lay my head upon your pillow
And watch the waves go flowing by
Riverbed, underneath the weeping willow
I'll sleep until the sunlight fills the sky

Never said, "I would be your super hero"
I never said, "That I was strong"
Riverbed, I'll lay my head upon your pillow
If you'd just let this night go on and on
