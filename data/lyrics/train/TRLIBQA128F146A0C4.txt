Time keeps slipping, keeps slipping
Time, time keeps slipping
Time, time keeps slipping
Time, time keeps slipping

Yo, the only thing Major don't waste is time in bed
My time is rare, take time, time to prepare
No time for fear, how many times I said it this year?
At what time ya going to realize that time is near?

Call a time out, Scritti Politti, Major climb down
The cracks of the streets waste no time on beats
Mos' Def, most definitely the rap chief
The new release, time to make cream, time to take a piece

And at the same time, time to rebuild, time is rilla
I swear I bring the heat, the tracks to Val Kilmer
You know that time waits for no man, in time you'll see
That you're wasting all you time while you're watching TV

And yo' Scritti, I'm on it like walls to graffiti
From night sticks, to plungers, to NYPD
From Lucille BB King, you've seen me rhyme
You stay away from drama if it's wasting your time

The time tables keep turning from Tinseltown
You've got the both ends burning up to the Boogiedown
(Time, time keeps slipping)
They play for time and work for spaces

The time tables keep turning and clocks are wound
You've got the both ends burning up and worked around
 (Time, time keeps slipping)
And in their prime they change their faces

Yeah, from Boogiedown to the Tinseltown I had em' all gettin' down
My baggage claim's got exotic names, I get around
How I'm livin' now, well that's a whole lot different now
