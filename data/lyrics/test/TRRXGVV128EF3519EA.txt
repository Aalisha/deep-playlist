Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you

Watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching you

Looking at the ladies, all of them fine
All of them so lovely, I can't make up my mind
But I'm lookin' at you from the corner of my eye
I can see you now, you're steppin' so high and I'm

Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (one look and I was hooked on you, baby, whoa)
Walking down the street watching ladies go by
Watching you (watching you)

Watching you
Watching you

There you go swayin', blowin' my mind
You've got everything groovin' in time
God gave her beauty, she carries it well
