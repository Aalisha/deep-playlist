I know there's a word for this
I know there's a word for the way I'm feeling
I know there's a word for this
I know it, and it's on the tip of my tongue
and it won't go any further.

I know there's a word for this
I know, 'cause it's in the dictionary
and when I find what it is
I'll write it down in case it comes up again
I'll be certain to avoid it.
