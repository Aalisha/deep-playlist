Pulling down the blinds, blocks what's left of the stars
So I'm tripping over bottles, tracing footsteps in the dark
Tomorrow would be a good day for broken glass
There are men in this room, who would pay for this
Missed calls to say I missed the morning's most.

You can't talk about it, you can't talk about it
Keeping (we) secrets (we) playing (can't talk about it) witches
Our bodies stretched out, our bodies stretched out
Casting sudden spells is not the answer
We'll build ourselves on hope and progress
Awake at water's edge, your eyes wide terrified
We'll build ourselves on hope and fortune
I wouldn't say
Wouldn't say it, to your face, I'm sure

Your life is a song, your life is a song
...
