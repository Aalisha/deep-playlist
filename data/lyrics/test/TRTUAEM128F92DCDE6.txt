Chorus:
I'm crying, jailhouse tears
And I've been trying all these years
Been trying to ride things out
But now I'm shifting gears
And we're both crying jailhouse tears

They say I broke the law
Now everything is broken down
Babe I know what I saw
I know you went downtown.

I went to the corner
To get a cold six pack
You're a drunk you're a stoner
...
