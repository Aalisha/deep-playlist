Something that you told me
Stayed in my head all night long
You wanted me to love you when you said, "Simply
Reach out and touch me, my love is in your hands"

Feel me, I want to feel the fire
Why do you want to play with my emotion?

And if I should lose your love
For any reason, any reason at all
Then just let my record show
I gave you all of my love I know

Feel me, I want to feel the fire
Feel me, I want to feel the fire
I don't want to play with your emotions
