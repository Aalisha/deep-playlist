Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?

Will you spend your days and nights in the pool room?
Will you sell caps of madness to the neighborhood?
Little ghetto boy, you already know how proud life can be
'Cause you've seen so much pain and misery

Little ghetto boy, your daddy was blown away
He robbed that grocery store
Don't you know that was a sad, sad old day?

All your young life you've seen such misery and pain
...
