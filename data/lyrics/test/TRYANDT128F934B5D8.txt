Doom
After the ageless doom
Mankind resurfaes
And all the lefts that are left
Will right the rights with
Blood

Searing through the years
You claim inheritance
You claim that all there is
Is promised for you

There's no one, no there has never been anyone
Who can save you

I commend you pain
All your hopes draining empty
...
