I was not looking for artsy fartsy love
I wanted someone to love completely
Someone more than weekly

I was looking for a decent boy
For a tender glance (o-o-oh)
For a safety dance (o-o-oh)

The Wuthering Heights
And the stormy nights

You give me 10, 000 nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so ooh, (du-du-du)
You're so ahh,(du-du-du)
You're so cool.

You came like a thief in the night and stole my heart
Uh, like a solitude erasure
Like an elevator

And I know we'd do anything for love (oh yeah)
And it is you and me (o-o-oh)
For all eternity (o-o-oh)

The Wuthering heights
And the stormy nights

You give me 10, 000 nights of thunder
But I will give them all back to you
'Cause you're so uhh, (du-du-du)
