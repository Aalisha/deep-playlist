Sister
We're so lucky
We came from love and we take in with
It's passing on like nobody business
Sing this song so the world can meet
My sister

You're so pretty
You don't know that some times
Don't you far for sun line
The best of all isn't good enough
For my sister

Change or never change
And you will stay the same to me
Change or never change
And i will keep your place
And i will be your biggest fan
cause i will know where you began
