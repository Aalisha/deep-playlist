I'll never get out these blues alive.
I'll never, I'll never, get out with these blues alive.
All a-my life, I been doomed with the blues.
I'm drinkin' black coffee and smokin' cigarettes.
I'm drinkin' back coffee an smokin' cigarettes all night.
I know I'll never, I'll never come outta these blues alive.
(Tell everybody now, Van).
Never, never, come outta these blues alive.
(No, you won't).
If I live to be a hundred.
(That's Van Morrison)
I don't think I ever will.
I can't understand, just exactly why.
I can't understand now, just exactly why.
All I know, same thing everyday.
You turn on the radio.
Hear the same thing ev'ryday.
You read a paper.
You hear the same thing, ev'ryday.
I don't know why, has to be this way.
I don't know why.
People tell ya, that change is gonna come.
Everybody tell you, some change is gonna come.
I've been through the third degree.
You know what I'm talkin' about.
Uh, uh.
