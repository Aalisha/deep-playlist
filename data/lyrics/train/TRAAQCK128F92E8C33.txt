Sunday morning
We were lying in bed just the two of us under cover
Under cover

With no warning
You suddenly became more than my lover(-a-a-ahh)
I've been waiting so very long for you to say it to me
Say it to me
I'd be skating
Skating on thin ice if I don't agree(-e-e-eee)

I know that you're the one for me
But it took me by surprise
And if I say it back to you
I can't look you in the eye
But I don't want to lose you
And I don't want to confuse you
