(King of Kings, hallelujah)
(Lord of Lords, hallelujah)
(King of Kings, hallelujah)
(Lord of Lords, hallelujah)

In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with Jah
And the Word was Jah

In the beginning Jah created the heaven and the earth
Then he created man of his own likeness and image
Gave unto man wisdom, knowledge, overstanding

Jah is my life and my strength
So whom shall I fear
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand
Jah is my keeper
