You think that I will change
But you know that will never be
I'm just that way and that's just me
Well it's just the way I am
And I am doing all I can
Why can't you see I just can't change

Well I could care less what you see
I'm just never the less here for me

You're always getting what you want
But you still keep looking
I guess you're just never getting what you need
With your eyes wide open
You still keep looking for your dreams, that's just me

It doesn't matter what you say
'Cause my confidence will lead the way
Words will never do, sad but true
...
