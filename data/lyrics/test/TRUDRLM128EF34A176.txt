Whats the matter with your life
Is the poverty bringing u down?
Is the mailman jerking u round?
Did he put your million dollar check
In someone elses box?

Tell me, whats the matter with your world
Was it a boy when u wanted a girl? (boy when u wanted a girl)
Dont u know straight hair aint got no curl (no curl)
Life it aint real funky
Unless its got that pop
Dig it

Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space 2 fill
Pop life
Everybody cant be on top
But life it aint real funky
Unless its got that pop
Dig it
