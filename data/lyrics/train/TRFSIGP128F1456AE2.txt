Ooh, oh yeah
Saturday
You kinda got mad at me
Then you went and said some things
I know you didn't really mean
You said you wasn't feelin' me
And I can see who I wanna see
And all that talk about you going to leave
Who think is gonna believe?
Cause...

If you was on you're way out the door
Would've been gone long time ago
Would've been making plans and packing clothes
Leaving keys but I got you on your knees

Talk if you wanna talk
If you wanna walk
Walk if you wanna walk
If you wanna front
Front like you gonna leave
You know you wanna be here with me
You can't leave me

Talk if you wanna talk
If you wanna walk
Walk if you wanna walk
If you wanna front
Front like you gonna leave
You know you wanna be here with me
You can't leave me
