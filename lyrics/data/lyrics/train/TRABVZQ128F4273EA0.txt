Looking for an exit in this world of fear
I can see the path that leads the way
Mama never left, and daddy needs me here
I wish the wind would carry a change
Looking through the window to a world of dreams
I can see my future slip away
Honey you won't get there if you don't believe
I wish the wind would carry a change

I've had enough
I'm standing up
I need, I need a change
I've had enough of chasing luck
I need, I need a change

I'm setting fire to the life that I know
Let's start a fire everywhere that we go
We starting fires, we starting fires
