C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Rock! Rock! Rock! Rock!

Jump up and down if you love the sound
We rip and rock until we tear shit down
Rip Rock stands for hip-hop mixed with Rock 'n' Roll
I'm hardcore to my inner soul, hold on as I swerve outta control
Directly into the unknowns of a black hole
All my real niggaz with fucked up neurotransmitters
Wavin' glocks and swastikas, I'ma take twenty shots of this hard liquor
And swigga 'til I'm drunk as the Pississippi River
Even though I know the shit is fuckin' up my liver
Tomorrow when I wake up, I won't even remember how I got home
Or where I got this tattoo of a mic on my arm from
Or when I fucked them bitches last night, I shoulda used a condom
I guess not, now that's what I call Rip Rock

Rip, Rock, Rip, Rock
(C'mon)
Rip, Rock, Rip, Rock
(C'mon)
Rip, Rock, Rip, Rock
(C'mon)
Rip, Rock, Rip, Rock
(C'mon, yeah)

Rip, Rock, Rip, Rock
(C'mon)
Rip, Rock, Rip, Rock
(C'mon)
Rip, Rock, Rip, Rock
(C'mon)
Rip, Rock, Rip, Rock
(C'mon, yeah)

You want Rock 'n' Roll?
