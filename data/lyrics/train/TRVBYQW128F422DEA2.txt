I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against a child in your face
Won't escape my attention

You keep your distance with a system of touch and gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration do I miss you this much?
Oh you're wasting my time, you're just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
...
