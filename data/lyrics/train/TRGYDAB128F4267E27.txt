Listen people to what I say
I say everybody's got to have their day

And don't you know that
Everybody's got to love somebody sometime
Everybody's got to win a heart
Everybody's got to love somebody sometime
When you do, I hope you never part

I once found love, found love just like you
But then he came, he might come to you
