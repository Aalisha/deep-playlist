Don't call it a movement, there's other ways of saying it
Call it brown cable and I'm laying it down
Big and brown, leaving it where it counts, fat amounts
Blazin', a butt raisin dingleberry, yes my butt is hairy
Every nation a-backing â€˜em out, come on everybody let me hear you shout

I'm gonna back one out
