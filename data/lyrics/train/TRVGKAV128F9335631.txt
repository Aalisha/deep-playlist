You'll be accepting my apology
For taking things too seriously
Sometimes I'm old enough to keep routines
Sometimes I'm child enough to scream

For everything, I broke in two
You're barely missing me
I'm missing you and everything you do
I really do, I really do, sure I do

My once photographic memory
For recollection's sake is failing me
I can't remember for the life of me

Sometimes I can think to recite
Words that I read and rewrite
My pens paint people that I've proven wrong
...
