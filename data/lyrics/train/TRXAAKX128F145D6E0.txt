You're such a pretty little thing
I wanna put a wedding ring on your finger
Baby can't you see that we were meant to be together
Yeah the joinin' of our hearts is written in the stars
We've got a love made in heaven
So baby take my hand I wanna be your man forever

Well I can't think of anyone else it's true
All day long there's no one on my mind but you
And I have loved you since you were a little girl
You mean everything to me and you're all I'll ever need in this world

You're such a pretty little thing
