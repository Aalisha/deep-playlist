[DINNER WITH CHANTEL]
© Krista Detor, [Cover Their Eyes]

Paris wasn’t lit the way I thought it would be lit
A photograph or two – maybe a chance, a postcard view
But no sparkle in the wine – love to compare
It’s just a city, another city, and paper falls out of the air

Newspaper ad, a playing card, a morning magazine, a candy wrapper
A crust of bread gone stale – an apple underneath the rail
The pavement grayer still, no shadow dancing upon it
And Paris wasn’t lit the way it should be lit
...
