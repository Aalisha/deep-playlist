If I didn't love you, I'd hate you
Watching you play in the bath
A soap sud stickleback navy
A scrubbing brush landing craft

Your skin gets softer and warmer
I pat you down with a towel
Tonight, it's love by the fire
My mind goes out on the prowl

If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I
If I didn't love you, I'd hate you
I'm paying your stereogram
Singles remind me of kisses
Albums remind me of plans

Tonight it's love by the fire
The wind plays over the coals
