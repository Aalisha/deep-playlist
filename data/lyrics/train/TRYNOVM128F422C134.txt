I've been pushing stones away
Far from these shores
I pretend that it's all okay
Till on the brink of what can't be adored

We survived
Well we can change
So let it fade
Just let it go
We pretend so nothing does change

We're flowers never breaking through the stone
...
I pretended and prayed it all away
...
