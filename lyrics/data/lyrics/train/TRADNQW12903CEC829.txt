What do you have to say?
I know it anyway
You´re not the one to blame
Liars always repeat their game
Get on the podium
To spread your valium
It´s all too much for me
Please get away or leave me be

And I am waiting for the waves now
Hopefully they will wash it all away
I´m longing for that day
I´m waiting for the waves and somehow
None of the lies are gonna stay

Let `em break
Right down on it all
Let ´em break
Now who is standing tall
Surrender defender
You don´t need to tender
Anything to me
Or anyone
