You say you've never seen the light before
Does anyone believe you?
Don't let them hear you say any more
Nothing's really safe around here

We are an imitation of the crown
We never turn the pages
They cannot let your spirit touch the ground
And nothing's going to change around here, no

Crack in the ceiling, hole in the wall
...
