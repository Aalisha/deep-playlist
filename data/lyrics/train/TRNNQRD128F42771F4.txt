Now you're back in my arms again
Let your heart be rearranged
While you were sleeping the reaper's been reaping
The times have changed

Speak softly to me
You have more power than the bomb
The tears in your eyes are just medals and prizes
The war is over
Miracles will come and go watch it all work out
But don't give in

If you should climb to the top of the world
Just to take it on the chin
...
