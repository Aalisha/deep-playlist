You might be crazy
But then again so am I
They aught to stick me in an institution
Just so I could be by your side
Look at me
Still hangin' 'round
Still hangin' 'round
Ah baby I'm still around
You might break up
In a million pieces
Cryin' in the middle of the street
Blame it all on me yeah
Look at me
Still hangin' 'round
Still hangin' 'round
Ah baby I'm still around
People say
You're gonna fall in and out of love all the time
