To steal without lifting a finger
It's quietly kept
The real terrorist
By way of the West
(One by one by one by one)
One hundred thousand starved
Their eyes glazed, stare westward

See something want it
Put a figure on it

Abandoned for triple the profit
Longer for less
Imperialist by way of the West (one by one by one by one)
One thousand jobs lost
...
