Pimp dolls, jam
Jigglettes, slam
Pimp dolls, jam
Jigglettes, slam
Turn it

Just because I shake and party
And roll my sexy body
Don't mean that I'm tryin' to tease

It's called body talk, it's not like the walk
'Cause this time
You're wearin' blue jeans

You rub your left leg slow
And let your body go
And do a little sexy scream
(Oh)

Jam, let's party out
Make your body sweat and shout
A visual sex machine

You're talkin', body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
(Talk body to me)
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk, oh

Jigglettes gonna slam
Yeah, pimp dolls jam
Let your body talk to me

You're lookin' real fine
You're workin' overtime
You're footloose and fancy free

Now it's all about the feel
'Cause now you know the deal
So pump your body 'cross the floor
