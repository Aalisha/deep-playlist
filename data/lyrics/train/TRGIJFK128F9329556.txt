adrenaline, my heart was pumping
now it's crucial, blood starts to burn
I took the bait, my hands are bleeding
now it's too late, when shall we learn...

my eyes are tired, can't get no sleep
it's been a while now, let's activate
they'll soon be here now, they're getting closer
if I could reach it, now it's too late

we built a flagship on a lie
we built our honor on a lie
we built our pride on a lie
we built this world on a lie
we built a flagship on a lie
we built our honor on a lie
we built this world on a lie
now we'll repair it on a lie
...
