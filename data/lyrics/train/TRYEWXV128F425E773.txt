Go back.

Perhaps you didn't realize.

Like it a liquid switch up on some other channel.
I maybe twist and wind we want to unravel.

Let it get better there's nothing like a breath of freash air.
A uni-vibe alright we got to get together.

From everywhere we feel our body feeling searching.
We work'n it.
We keep returning.

It's time to bury them old style life lover.
Don't worry white man we just want scrub the gutter.
Lift up our layer drop it on a better fresher.
