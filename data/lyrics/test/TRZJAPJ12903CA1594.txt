Oh Sweet Pea, come on and dance with me
Come on, come on, come on and dance with me
Oh Sweet Pea, won't you be my girl?
Won't you? Won't you? Won't you be my girl?

I went to a dance just the other night
I saw a girl there she was out of sight
I asked a friend of mine who she could be
He said that her friends just call her Sweet Pea

Oh Sweet Pea, come on and dance with me
