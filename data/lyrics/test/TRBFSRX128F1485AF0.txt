Yeah she's been walking down my street
Saluting magpies, avoiding cracks at her feet
Oh be careful, they can break your back you know

And that superstition don't count for much
It's all in your head and not in your touch
If it's working, IÂ´ll reconsider

So what you crying for?
You're a big girl now, no misters come to get ya
You've been trying
But you don't know how, is it cos they never let ya?

No, looks like it's all too much
...
