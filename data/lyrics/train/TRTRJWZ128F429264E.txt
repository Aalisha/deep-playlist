(look for me, look for me)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend
Ride with me to the very end just me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend
Down the ride till the very end just me and my boyfriend

(look for me, look for me)
Ain't nothing in this world that I wouldn't do
When it comes to being around you
You baby home boy
Don't you know that I would die if I had to live without you
Always there to wipe my tears
Been thinking all these years
I'm living for life with you
My love is true, you're all I need

All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend
Ride with me to the very end just me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend
Down the ride till the very end just me and my boyfriend

(look for me, look for me)
Even if the world would end tonight
I know that I would have you by my side
