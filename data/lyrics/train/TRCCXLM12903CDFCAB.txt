"Again I offer you my life
Lay down my heart at your feet
But if you accept this offering
Some obligations will have to be fulfilled

Remember to worship no other deity
Leave your earth's steady ground
Pledge allegiance to my gravity
To Mother Venus be forever bound"

Three-legged amphibian with coin in mouth
Save me from this wicked dream
Any kind of magic or miracle
