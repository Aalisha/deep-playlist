Yo
When the bass thump, the place jump like it's way crunk, yeah
Fake punks get they face lumped, sent to the most high by the most fit
You gotta do, fuck that almost shit, the fam is close knit
You diggin', know the clock don't stop tickin'
Glocks still spittin', the whole block politickin'
Like presidents with they minds dead on arrival
Leaving no evidence of a struggle for survival

Songs relevant to the times like the 'Psalms' read in The Bible
Stepping to this leaves thoughts in your head 'it's suicidal'
It's the T to the A L I B, the deep rooter
Rolling with my Wannabattle cats with Chief Buddha
And see through the overspecialized, under pressurized, no lie, texturized
Emcees who got the masses mesmerized
With empty rhetoric, they better quit
Niggas, so hollow that they echo like sentiments

Nowadays rap artists coming halfhearted
Commercial like pop or underground like black markets
Where were you the day hip hop died?

Is it too early to mourn? Is it too late to ride?
