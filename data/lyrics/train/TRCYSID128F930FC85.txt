Lost Parade

woke from a dream I called
out of my head that night
there were marchers
saints and things singing
the epoch still leads
the party lines were drawn
it feels again
feels again so long

remember
we cried
the universe is mine
tonight
we'll take it all this time

on and on we live it long
...
