Ask any girl
In this lonely world
Ask any girl
She'll say make it last forever

I'm holding out my hand
I finally understand
So turn out the lights, oh yeah
We'll make it last forever

I've been down the streets of desire
Sometimes I was so uninspired
You found what was locked up inside of me

Oh, whoa, this could be the night
The night to remember
We'll make it last forever
This could be the night
