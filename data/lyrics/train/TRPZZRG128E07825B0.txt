Midnight rockers, city slickers
Gunmen and maniacs
All are featured on the freak show
And I can't do nothing 'bout that, no

But if you hurt what's mine
I'll sure as hell retaliate

Telling us what is infectious and dangerous

You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight

You can free the world, you can free my mind
Just as long as my baby's safe from harm tonight

Telling us what is infectious and dangerous
Friends and enemies, they find us contagerous
I was looking back to see
If you were looking back at me
To see me looking back at you
