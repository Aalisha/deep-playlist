I, I long to be beside of you
I was wrong to tell you what I knew
I know I'm a victim of my pride
I belong to all that I've been through

I drove for miles in a city trance
I came to ask for a second chance
But I won't dance, no, I won't dance

I came for miles on a broken wheel
I came to see whether love can heal
But I won't kneel, no, I won't kneel
