Running in the parking lot, I'm four years old
I am lost, those were the days
Soft murmur of voices in the other room
Comforting you, as you fall asleep
Staring at the mother-daughter clones go by
We're in a race against time
And time might be winning

And it's not gonna take all day long
Watching the urban decay all around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way, oh, somewhere
Feels like I'm going left and right in the dark
How long must you wait
How long must this stay
Wake up I'm ashamed that there may have be sometimes
...
