They call holidays an option for a reason
I heard you're comin' back to life just for the fourth
I've been catchin' all your ghosts for every season
I pray to God that you won't come back here anymore
Do you pray with him too?

They should deliver all my blessings
In small brown paper handbags near the porch
I wished I'd known that you were bleeding
While I sat and watched you reading with the Lord
I read with him, too

When you look at me
I'll be digesting your legs
