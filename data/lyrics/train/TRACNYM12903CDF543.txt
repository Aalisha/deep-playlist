Monday morning, up at eight,
The bus comes early from the bottom estate,
The weekend was blue, and so are you,
Sad boy

Front seat, top deck, look at the view,
Wish you were 14 and going to school,
Can't forget what your girlfriend said to you
Last night - she said

You should put an advert in the music press,
'Sensitive boy needs a girl in a flowery dress',
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Need a stick to get rid of you,
You're like bubblegum on my shoe,
Can't get it off, can't get off on you
