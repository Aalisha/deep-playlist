You have a chance to really shine now
Well patience never was one of your true virtues
Stop trying to control everything, and fuck what they say
What do you have to prove?

So why am I waiting?
This time that I'm wasting
If that's what you mean

How will this be when all is said and done?
Will I know where I'm from, remember me?
Where will I be?
I guess I'm on the run
And time is catching up behind me
Behind me, yeah
Behind me, you
Behind me

And I'm scared to be the only one
