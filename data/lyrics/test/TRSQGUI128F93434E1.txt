I saw her in Roosevelt Springs
Where time doesn't touch anything
She never did say she could sing
But I figured it so
I needed some company then
Not sisters or children or men
That's a hell of a spot to be in
But she put me in tow
Money and liquor and lust
Had taken my heart and my trust
I could see ashes and dust
Headed my way
She tended bar in the town
Her alto settled me down
So I started hanging around
Didn't need much to say
She smelled like cigarettes and wine
And she kept me happy all the time
I know that ain't much of a line
