And on the cool check in
Center stage on the mic
And we're puttin' it on wax
It's the new style

Four and three and two and one, what up
And when I'm on the mic, the suckers run, word
Down with Ad Rock and Mike D and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint

Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick
B-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D
Ah yeah, that's me

I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it, I got it, I know it's good
The rhymes I write, you wish you would

I'm never in training, my voice is not straining
People always biting, and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker, and I smashed your glasses

You're from Secausus, I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'

There it is, kick it

Father to many, married to none
And in case you're unaware, I carry a gun, where?
