But when the fire goes out
The dark starts moving in
And that's the truth

Right now you're on the stand
And I feel like the judge
Who needs the proof?
The slaves of truth

It was on every face in town
But I would not understand
Waiting for the news
Will it ever come my way?

But when the fire goes out
The dark starts moving in
And that's the truth
(That's the truth)

Right now you're on the stand
And I feel like the judge
Who needs the proof?
(Who needs the proof?)
The slaves of truth
(The slaves of truth)

I won't be beat, not in a thousand years
I'll never lose, if I can prove you're not the one
Just leave me now, you're making my blood run cold
The word is out, so go, your feet won't touch the ground

Now that she has gone
I've got to shake the pain, act like a man
The sweetness that's inside
...
