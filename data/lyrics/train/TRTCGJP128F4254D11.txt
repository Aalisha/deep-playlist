I love my life
It's the most precious thing to me
I love my life
I'll be giving thanks itinually
You see

My life is my life
And I only got one life to live
I and I will live it upright
Regardless of the circumstances
My life is my life
And I only got one life to live
I and I will live it upright
Rastafari got no blessages to keep

My life is worth more than gold
It could never be bought or sold
It's so precious so Jah take control
My life is a blessing so I want the world to know
Don't you know life is the greatest gift
From the father always cherish it
The whole creation and you certainly get the drift
I love my life, so give thanks and praise for it
