I'm back!
i'm back in the saddle again
i'm back!
i'm back in the saddle again
Ridin' into town alone by the light of the moon
i'm lookin' for old sukie jones, she crazy horse saloon
barkeep gimme a drink, that's when she caught my eye
she turned to give me a wink, that'd make a grown man cry
I'm back in the saddle again
i'm back!
i'm back in the saddle again
