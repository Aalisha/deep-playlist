Ha, yo, are you ready for this one?

Yo, ha
Gonna mix, blend, rip up the track, new determination, can you feel that?
We fly on Virgin to countries and back, talk the talk as we wave the flag
Now how you liking that? Distribute likes stores in a street
Where people of the town are so quick to speech ya, greet ya, teach ya

I'm just Alesha, now I'm getting stressed, more pressure, more debts
I'm just trying to make a living for me, free ya mind and let people be
Why does there always have to be jealousy?
There's 'nuff room for you and 'nuff room for me
I'm gonna flip this script just one more time I'm a flip, flip, flip

We ain't going nowhere, we're staying right here
'Cause we do it just for you
And that's the truth, we ain't going nowhere
We're UK's finest, brightest shining stars
