I hope you're not a butterfly who's gonna spread it's wings and fly away, yeah-ee-yeah-ah
I hope you're not the moving type who's gonna up and pack and walk away

Bridge to Chorus
I need you to be there
To treat me like you care
I need you to be where
anywhere I need you
I need you to myself
Not layin' with anyone else
I need you next to me for always

Chorus 1
