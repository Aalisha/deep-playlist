How you gon' do that to me?
(Sigh)
I can't believe this

I wish I never ever got drunk that night
Made me foolish enough to come to your crib
Walked up the stairs and then I turned on the lights
Couldn't even speak because it happened so quick

I wish I never saw your punk ass that night
You always seem to calm me down with your lies
Even though I know better I try and I try
But u always have the perfect alibi

If a lie gon' get me through
I rather not know the truth
If the truth gon' make me cry
I rather just live a lie
I rather just live a lie
