I saw you waiting on the front porch
I had to sneak in through the back door
I guess it's just too much to hope for
That you'd simply go away
It's just too obvious to mention
I need a hero's intervention
The attention is crushing me
And it happens everyday

Could you pick on someone your own size
Get it out of your head that I'm just what you want
Could you give it a rest let me catch my breath
