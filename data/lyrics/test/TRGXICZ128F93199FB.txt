Blame - you can't blame me
Love - if you pay me
Hope - keep smiling through the days
Habit forming
And I don't care what you think of me
No, I don't care what you think of me

Greed - money greedy
Gold - dirty money
Feel no shame, you take the blame
No means nothing to me

And every time I let go, stay behind me love
Any time I jump off, be there to pick me up
