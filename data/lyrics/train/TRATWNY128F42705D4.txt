Black and white
But the time is stricnine.
You soak it down in your rubbing alcohol.
You're saying you're underdogs,
Knowing what they don't want
And what they don't want...

Strange boy
Scrounging through his pockets.
Scraping over nachos
And a microbrew.
Stuck in the middle one sucking up, up town
Clogging up the quarters at the arcade.

I said you're better than me at this
...
