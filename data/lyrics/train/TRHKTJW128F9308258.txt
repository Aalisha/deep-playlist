Don't act like you can't act
i know i seen you do it
you better learn to shake hands
and treat me like your mother

Don't act like you can't act
stand up like a man
you better learn to shake hands
and treat me like your mother

You came on too late
You came on too late now
You came on too late
to do a thing

C'mon look me in the eye
you want to try to tell a lie
i bet you can't and you know why
i'm just like your mother

aa look me in the eye now
you want to try to tell a lie
you can't and you know why
i'm just like your mother

You came on too late
