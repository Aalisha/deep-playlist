All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watching the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view
But it's not sane
It's not sane

I just want someone to say to me, oh oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, yeah yeah
Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today, hey
So stay with me and I'll have it made
