No more lonely nights to hurt me
No more tears left to spare
No more reasons to be unhappy
You threw them all up in there air

And I don't know how you did it
But you made me a believer
I never thought that love
Could turn someone into a dreamer
For the first time in my life
I don't feel like a need a breather
Cause everywhere I'm gonna go
I wanna know you're gonna be there

I'd give it all up for you
I'd give it all up for you
Do anything you asked me to
Anything you asked me to
You're like a pillow I can hold on to
Cause we got each other
We got each other

Now that this has gone away
You left me here without a trace
And now I'm in a brand new place
Cause we got each other
We got each other, yeah

And some times in the past almost pulled us under
But we got through all that and it made us stronger
Through the good, through the bad
There just ain't another
You're the best thing I have and we got each other

When the harder times confront me
You always show me that you care
