When I was young I spoke like a child
I saw with a child's eyes
And an open door was to a girl
Like the stars are to the sky
It's funny how the world lives up to
All your expectations
With adventures for the stout of heart
And the lure of the open spaces

There's two lanes running down this road
Whichever side you're on
Accounts for where you want to go
Or what you're running from
Back when darkness overtook me
On a blind man's curve
