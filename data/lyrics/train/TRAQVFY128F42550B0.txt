Go on and slip me two (X)anax Bars - I'm ready ta git fool
5th ta Crown ta wash it down, I'm downtown snapping rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game - in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxicotin in my system - man I'm feeling kinda strange
Watch me choke about this blueberry from Texas
You wanna get up in rotation that's too bad 'cause I'm stressin'
'bout now its 1: 30 am - 11 Percocets just entered me
15 minutes from this second - I'll be crawling on my knees
Laughing at the crowd of all the clowns that be surrounding me
Take another Lortab to calm me down and let me see
Body be relaxed - muscles be loose, and you have stopped the pain
No more bitchin' 'bout your day and work and driving in the rain
Put up with the fussing and discussion - I plant in your brain
Hypnotize ya minds, like all the rest but I come through the veins
Take a chill pill to slow me down and get back in the game
Gotta be up on ya P's and Q's to even feel it man
