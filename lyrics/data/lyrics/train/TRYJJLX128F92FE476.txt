I paid my money, dialed my numbers
I got the operator on the line
I wanna dial long-distance
That little girl of mine

She said that I could call her
Any time of day
I just dial the numbers
And she'll be on her way

Well, I said, "Hey, operator
Make the telephone talk to me
Hey, operator
Make the telephone talk to me"

Well, don't you rush me
Don't you leave the floor
And don't you tell me
That she went out the door
