Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you
then I realized
that it was just my mind
playing tricks on me...

It seems colder lately at night
and I try to sleep with the lights on
Everytime the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe
That we're through...

I miss you (I miss you...)
Theres no other way to say it
And I, And I can't deny it.
I miss you (I miss you...)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me...

Is it done and over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?
