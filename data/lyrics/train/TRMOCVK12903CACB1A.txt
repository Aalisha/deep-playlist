Open up my eyes,
Flooded with daylight.
Another sleepless night turns color black and white.

With all the things I've said,
There is just regret,
Repeating in my head.

Hands into a fist,
Static in my head.
Now I'm sitting face to face with loneliness.

What did I expect?
Did I see forever
In you?

I never want it to hurt
More than it should.
I hope you're satisfied;
I never could.
