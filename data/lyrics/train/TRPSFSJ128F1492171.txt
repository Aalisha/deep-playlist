Mr. Recordman, do you know who I am
Mr Recordman, do you really think I can
I've takin' a likin' to your game
I think we all, we feel the same
Is this a dream or is it real
You say you want to cut a deal
Mr. Recordman, do you know who I am
Mr. Recordman, do you really think I can
Don't need much time to think about
I'm sure that you have got the clout
