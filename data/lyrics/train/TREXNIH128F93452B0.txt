Do I remember not so many years ago
Me & the young McKenzies skulkin' at the whisky store
Just wee nippers (sippers) much too young to buy a dram
We came up with a daring plan & pulled a whisky scam

We don't care, what anybody say
Just gi' us a dram o' whisky & we'll get down the way
Well if she wants to go, she's gonna let you know
But gi' her a dram o' whisky and she's common with the night
