What the hell's going on around here?

First off let's take it from the start
Straight out can't change what's in my heart
No one can tear my beliefs apart
You can't bring me

You ain't never seen no one like me
Prevail regardless what the cost might be
Power flows inside of me
You can't bring me

Never fall as long as I try
Refuse to be a part of your lie
Even if it means I die
You can't bring me

You can't bring me down!

Who the hell you calling crazy?
You wouldn't know what crazy was if Charles Manson was eating fruit loops on your front porch

Time out-let's get something clear
I speak-more truth than you want to hear
Scapegoat to cover up your fear
You can't bring me

You ain't never seen so much might
Fight for what I know is right
What up? you got yourself a fight
You can't bring me

Stand up we'll all sing along
Together ain't nothin' as strong
Won't quit
We ain't in the wrong,
You can't bring me

You can't bring me down!
