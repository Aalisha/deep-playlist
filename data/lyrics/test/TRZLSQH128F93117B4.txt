You have longed for sweet peace
And for favour to increase
U have earnestly, so fervently, oh oh you really prayed
Oh yes you have
But you cannot find rest
Nor be perfectly blessed
Until all on the alter, until it's laid

Is your all on the alter of sacrifice?
Is it laid?
Your heart does the Spirit control?
Now, you can only, you can only be blessed
