Unceremonial descent
After all these years of blood, sweat and tears
In a permanent dispute
Just to settle and keep the flame alight

Never to regret one second

A blinding of senses
Comfort compelled as punishment
Itâ€™s a moment of bliss
As we cease to be

Inner peace with termination
The skin has shed
Leave the rotten core inside
Arise from decay
