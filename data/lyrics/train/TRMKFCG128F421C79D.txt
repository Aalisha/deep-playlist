Hey look at me, I'm a wastoid Android robot
Nobody ever believes me cause I'm skinny and silly
I'm just a clown in the circus with a license to be a reject
Rejection from the class
A classification to nowhere
C'mon, c'mon gotta give it everything you got [3x]

The merry goes the merry goes round and round
There he goes, the merry goes bouncing now
Off the walls on a high
Coming down dying to kick it

So you wanna have a good time?
