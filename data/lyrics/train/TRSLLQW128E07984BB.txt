I get high on a buzz
Then a rush when I'm plugged in you
I connect when I'm flush
You get love when told what to do

Wonderful electric
Wonderful electric
Wonderful electric
Cover me in you

I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love with a strict machine
