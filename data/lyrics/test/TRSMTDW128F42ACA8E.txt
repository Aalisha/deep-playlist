In old Savannah
I said Savannah
The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of a southern brand
But here's what I don't understand

They got a gal there
A pretty gal there
Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even icemen leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah
The meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
