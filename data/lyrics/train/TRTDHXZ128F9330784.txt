I'm sure you'd agree,
It ain't you it's me,
No matter how I try I just can't feel the way inside he wants me to,
So what should I do?
Mistakes we all make,
No matter how it aches I must do whatever it takes to love him

I don't know how to love him,
I don't know how to care for him,
Cupid shoot me with your bow,
So I know, how to love him so,
Oh Oh Oh

Got to open my heart,
And forget the past,
...
