Seems like almost everyday
Trouble carries us away
And sometimes when we hurt
We all need to be saved

Every time I'm in too deep
Someone always rescues me
It's like heaven's sending down
The help that I need

Life like a chain
Sometimes it breaks
We all need a hand
When we fall from grace

It could be someone walking down the street
A stranger on a bus
A little kid on his way to school
