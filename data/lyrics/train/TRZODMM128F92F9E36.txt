Oh, oh, oh, ooohhh
Oh, oh, oh

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight Everything it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe, no I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
...
