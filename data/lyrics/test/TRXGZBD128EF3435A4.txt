Missing you like crazy
I feel a million miles away
A part of me is empty
That noone could replace
So i'll run to you
Despite the shame
I'll leave it all behind 

On my way home
On my way home
I'm running back to you
On my way home
On my way home
I'm running back to you

How could you ever love me
When I didn't love myself
When my broken (ness?) consumed me
...
