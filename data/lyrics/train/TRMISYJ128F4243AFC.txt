His love is always there
No matter where you are
His love is always greater than your fondest hopes
And bigger than what you're afraid of
There is no heart so lost it cannot be found
There are no hopeless circumstances
There is no such thing as a godforsaken town
â€~Cause there are always second chances
Until this life is over
There is no point of no return
â€~Cause everywhere you turn
His love is always there
...
