She's an angel, but she sins sometimes
Dressed in white, gets drunk on red wine
Everyone loves her
But a child plays for pleasure and she'll play with your heart until she
Breaks down your defences one by one
So line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down
Coz Alisha Rules The World
You think you found a dream, then it shatters and it seems,
That Alisha Rules The World
For her love of power, and she's as fragile as a flower
But you better
Line up your soldiers and she'll shoot them all down,
Coz Alisha Rules The World

Alisha always walks where angels fear to fly
Perfection baby - you know you're qualified
Everyone loves her
But a child plays for pleasure and she'll play with your heart until she
...
