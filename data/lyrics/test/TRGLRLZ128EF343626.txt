I'm steady tryna find a motive
(Motive)
Why I do what I do?
Freedom ain't gettin' no closer
(Closer)
No matter how far I go

My car is stolen
(Stolen)
No registration
(Registration)
Cops patrolin'
(Patrolin')
And now they don't stop me and I get locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
(I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Headin' uptown to re-up
(Re-up)
Back with a couple keys
(Keys)
Corner blocks on fire
(Fire)
Under covers dressed as fiends
(Fiends)

Makin' so much money
(Money)
Ride up smooth and fast
...
