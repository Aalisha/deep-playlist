Two men sittin' in straight back chairs
Feet propped up on the railin'
Sittin' in front of the country store
Discussin' how the crops were failin'

About that time a car drove by
With an Ace Insurance bumper sticker
Well that must be the man been courtin' Abell
He's somethin' of a city slicker
(Ah, you can tell just from the way he's drivin' that car)

Do you reckon he's goin' up to see Abell
You know her daddy went to Maben this day
And her mommas been in Arkansas with her ailin' pa
Ain't nobody home that way
(Ha ha, 'cept Abell)

Now, I don't mean nothing by what I say
But if you won't say it, I can
She ain't got no bid'ness alone
With that Ace Insurance man
(Why there's just no tellin' what might happen)
