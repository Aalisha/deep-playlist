Distance between us bears its weight on me
These words I pledge to you
I will never falter
I resent the burdens laid on you
Through my convictions
We will be together again
No matter what the trials
They will not break us

My life reflects these screams
Hate tore through me at the seams
Been shaped through bitter years
The venom burned my tears
