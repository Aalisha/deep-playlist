Failure, should be your middle name
Anger, to focus all the blame
You think you've got the best of me
But what you have is nothing
I can see much clearer
All I see is failure
Now, you fail at life!
Have I succumb to seduction?
To forgive, and to forget
You've never been in the cards
You've always tried twice as hard
Fool me once, shame on you!
Fool me twice, and I'll cut your heart out!
You've never been in the cards
You've always tried twice as hard
