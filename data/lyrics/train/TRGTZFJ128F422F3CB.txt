Praises be unto the Almighty Himself
Oh well, oh well, yes

Jah Jah is the ruler - don't make nobody fool you
Jah Jah is the ruler - don't make nobody fool you
Jah Jah is the ruler - don't make nobody fool you
Jah Jah is the ruler - don't make nobody fool you

They're bigging up their chest
Saying they are the best, yes
But their only love is
Always doing what the devil request

Jah Jah is the ruler - don't make nobody fool you
Jah Jah is the ruler - don't make nobody fool you
Jah Jah is the ruler - don't make nobody fool you
Jah Jah is the ruler - don't make nobody fool you
