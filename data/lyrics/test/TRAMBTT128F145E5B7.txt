Every time I think of you it's like the last beat of my heart
The memory of leaving you is tearing me apart
No waves, no tears, no backward glance
But I'll always hold you dear
Never regret but I'll never forget
'cos there's not enough heaven here

Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean
Ocean

And every time I'm missing you I just can't let it show
And every time I want to cry, I just can't let it go
...
