Let's walk down the highway
The exit isn't too far
No don't be upset

We'll make it down to that tree
We'll lay back in the shaded green grass
We'll listen to the pond
We'll think of all the fun we will have in our lives now

Come on please
I know I've lied before
But this time I mean it
This time I mean it
When will someone care?
