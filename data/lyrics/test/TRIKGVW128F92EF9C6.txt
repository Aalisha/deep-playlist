Some day you'll see
Surrounded by angels
Floating atop of the sea
On banded knees
Don't go where they go
Don't sing all the songs they sing

[Chorus]

Nobody knows you the way you know you
But I think I do
But I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
Nobody knows you the way you know you
But I think I do
But I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew

Between these walls
