So tired of broken hearts, of losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny, I can't let go baby
Can't you see
Cupid please take your aim at me

Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
Cherish your strength
You got the to power to make me feel good
