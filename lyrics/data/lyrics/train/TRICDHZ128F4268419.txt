Just for the record let's get the story straight
Me and Uncle Tom were fishin' it was gettin' pretty late
Out on a cypress limb above the wishin' well
Where they say it got no bottom say it take you down to Hell

Over in the bushes and off to the right
Two men talking in the pale moonlight
Sherriff John Brady and Deputy Hedge
Haulin' two limp bodies down to the Waters' Edge

I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin oh yea
I know a secret that I just can't tell

They didn't see me and Tom in the tree
