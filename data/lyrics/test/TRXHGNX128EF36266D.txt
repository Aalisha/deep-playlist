Now this is the Cease and Seckle
So turn down the geckle
The dancehall get hot
And the kids them want their props
For the season
Here's the reason

Here we are
No one can steal this moment
'Cuz we're just where we belong
The vibe just keeps on flowing
It goes on and on
I see the young girls dancing
Rude boys are romancing
Making simple passes
It's a pleasure to see
People in harmony
For the ones who rule
Born Jamericans rule, yeah

This the Cease and Seckle
Turn down the geckle
Dancehall get hot
And now the kids, them want their props
It's the Cease and Seckle
Turn down the geckle
Born Jamericans are on the map
And now it is non-stop
(something in patois)
If you really take it out
You need a battalion

Who the hell can stop this, a combination
It's like you get a swift kick
When you are ready, a right hand
Me want to see the young girls
Just fling up your hands
And arch your backside, and start wine
Some girls them try the butterfly
But them look quite absurd
It's not the butterfly
But better yet the dead bird
Inclination of the Shine
Is the matter at hand
If I perpetuate myself
As a (patois)
I make you spin on your toes
With the rub-a-dub flow
