She never loved you
She was only passing time
She never knew you
You were just to run around
This is how it goes
You end up on the ground
But you can slow down
But you can slow down
But you can slow down

I'll be waiting
When there's nothing left to say
And you begin to fade away
You've got September all over again
I'll be waiting
When there's nothing left to say
And you begin to fade away
You've got September all over again
September all over again
