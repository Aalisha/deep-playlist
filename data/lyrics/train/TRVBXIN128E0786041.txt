If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right

Here we go again fuckin' right
Dog man X baby dog for life
Know how this shit go? Built off fights
Bitch dog be like aigh aigh aigh
This rap shit be gettin' kinda hectic
It's not a game nigga cats don't respect it
Real shit's been neglected for far too long
Let's get it on
I jump off slugs like packages from UPS
But you run when you see X
Pull out the front when you see Tex
The light is what you see next
Fuck who you listenin' to I'm the badest
Ninety eight percentage of the industry is faggots
Stewart little niggaz don't want no static
When they say, "Who shot J R? It won't be Dalas"

If I'm gonna rob I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin' then it's prob'ly a fight
If I'm gonna fuck bitches then they better be tight
If that's dead then the head better be right
