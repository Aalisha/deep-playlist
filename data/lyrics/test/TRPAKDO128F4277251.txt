That's right...
That's right...

Sometimes I wish we were more than just friends
I know that I'm dreaming cause you're crazy about her
Sometimes I wish all the time that
You spend with her was with me instead.
I wish that we could be more than friends.

It's time to let you know just how do I feel
About that day (that's right) you drive me crazy (that's right)
If she ever let you go, then you know the deal
Boy, you will be mine
Till the end of time

It's the same dream
Over and over
I can see us walking and holding hands
You and me
Closer and closer
If everything was different, you'd be my man.
