You know we gotta do one for all these niggaz
Out here sideline hatin', y'knowhat I'm sayin'?
Don't get mad 'coz a nigga straight up
Out the paint shop or the car lot or what not

Feelin' mean on the scene wit a pocket full of green
Y'knowhat I'm sayin'? An' any one of y'all hoes think
A nigga gon' give 'em somethin', I can't give ya shit
But this dick in ya muthafuckin' mouth an' ya muthafuckin' hole

An' you gotta reach me somethin' for that, ho'
'Coz I ain't for free, bitch
Pay what cha muthafuckin' weigh

I pull up clean in my black fuckin' truck
My rims still spinnin' so you know I'm cuttin' up
I'm ridin' down the street, bumpin' nothin' but us
I spotted me a freak, she was 'bout to catch a buzz

I asked her what's her name, baby, it could be love
But you know ya boy don't fuck wit nothin' but sluts
The ones that make money an' stack them bucks
A bank for that cap an' a bank for that butt

Nigga, I'll tell yo' gal she can suck on this big ol' dick
