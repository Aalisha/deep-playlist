Today I found a baby's glove
Lying on the drainage board, so still
Yesterday a leather glove
From the slim fingered hand of a woman

The next time I saw one
It was lying half frozen
And twisted on the kerb
And I couldn't take it

Now I have my own private collection
All lined in rows when you open up the wardrobe doors
Now I have no room for my obsession
...
