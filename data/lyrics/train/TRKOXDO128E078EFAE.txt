I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

First time I saw her
Thought that I would lose my mind
Just had to have her
I had to have her in my life

The way you make me feel
Is like no other feeling that I've had (I've ever had) before
You give the kind of lovin'
Make a brother wanna come for more
And more she's the one I adore

I can't let her go, I can't let her go
'Cause I need the love she gives to me
I can't let her go, I can't let her go
And she knows that we were meant to be

Just can't believe it
