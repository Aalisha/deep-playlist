You're all smiles and silly conversations
As if this sunny day came just for you
You twist your hair, your smile and you turn your eyes away
Come on tell me what's right with you
Now it dawns on meprobably everybody's talking
There's something here I'm supposed to realize
Your secret's out and the universe laughs at it's joke on me
I just caught it in your eyes
It's a beautiful surprise

When did you fall in love with me?
Was it out of the blue?
'Cause I swear I never knew it
When did you let your heart run free?
Have you been waiting long?
When did you fall in love with me?
When did you fall in love?

Make your way over here, sit down by this fool and let's rewind
Come on let's go back and replay all our scenes
Point out the hints, the clues, the twists and the smiles this time
All the ones that slipped by me
I bet my face is red and you can hear my heart pounding
