A deathwish for myself would be enough
Oh babe, i hope you would to kill this love
I'm trying to wipe this tears, but i couldn't face my fear
Afraid to lose you oh my dear

Correct me if i'm wrong my lovely queen
You hurt me bad inside and broke this dream
Hey babe look what you've done, i guess you're not so kind

And you have cheating everyone

You've ruin my sacrifice and now i'm dying
