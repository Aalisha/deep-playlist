Their blast inside
Devouring offals
The clot of blood in
My veins... Eliminating

Preventing any neurological orders
To their contentment to act
To their world to adapt
To their hell to descent

Captivated in the wake of moral decadence
Deprived inner sublimity
Hallucinations determing perceptive faculty
...
