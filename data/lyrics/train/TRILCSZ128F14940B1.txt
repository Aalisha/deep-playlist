I read it in the papers
It must be true
It said "Girl gives birth to alien boy!"
But do we see a photo of this bundle of joy?
No, no

I saw another headline
It knocked me flat
It said "Dinosaur found alive today!"
It's easy when you're talking the rhetorical way

It's what the papers say
You know it's right
It's down there written in black and white for you
It's what the papers say
You know it's true
'Cos they're responsible citizens and would they lie to you?
