Woohoo! Oh yeah!
"Injected with a poison!"
There's a rainbow inside the mind
There's a rainbow inside the mind
There's a rainbow inside the mind
There's a rainbow inside the mind
"Injected with a poison!
We don't need that anymore."
Woohoo! Oh yeah!
Free your body
Feel the energy
Free your body
I'm in ecstasy
Free your body
Use your fantasy
Free your body
"Injected with a poison!
Injected with a poison!
Are you listening to me?
