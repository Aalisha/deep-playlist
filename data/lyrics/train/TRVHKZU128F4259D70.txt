Through early morning fog I see 
Visions of the things to be 
The pains that are withheld for me 
I realise and I can see 

That suicide is painless 
It brings on many changes 
I can take or leave it if I please 

That game of life is hard to play 
I'm gonna lose it anyway 
The losing card I'll some day lay 
So this is all I have to say
