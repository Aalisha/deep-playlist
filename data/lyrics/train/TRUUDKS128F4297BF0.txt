The Web

See myself, standing on this shelf
See this suitcase, it's loaded here to go
See these lines, well the years have taken time
What you've taken, you've given back as mine

Everything you see
That's caught in the web
Well it's caught it for me

You're letting out your heart
You're trading in your soul
And would you trade it for me
Cos I would trade it for you

See this hand, it's shaking like a loaded gun
See this water, it's turning into wine
