Heavens rejoice and the earth will exalt
Oh no, come swing back like a catapult
The sea and its fullness will roar
He is our help and our shield our soul yearns for the lord
Burning G-d of Yaacov everlasting stronghold
Break down the door I can't hold back no more
Wait all night long, until the early morning
Like night watchmen wait for the dawning

Exaltation, my G-d of salvation
The field and there in will be filled with jubilation
The Lord's name will be proclaimed
Exaltation, my G-d of salvation
The field and there in will be filled with jubilation
The Lord's name will be proclaimed

Arise, be our help
