No wasted
No wanting the can't have
Untasted
Seems everything I have

Yeah ready
Heard everything you said
I'm steady
Even though it's half past dead

Welcome to the unforgiving
Franernity of pain where
the lines remains uncrossed
Are entertained

Greetings from the other side
Where all has gone array here
But in all honesty takes me away
There
