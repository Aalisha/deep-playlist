Just like a star across my sky
Just like an angel off the page
You have appeared to my life
Feel like I'll never be the same

Just like a song in my heart
Just like oil on my hands
Honored to love you

Still I wonder why it is
I don't argue like this with anyone but you
We do it all the time blowing out my mind

You've got this look I can't describe
You make me feel I'm alive
