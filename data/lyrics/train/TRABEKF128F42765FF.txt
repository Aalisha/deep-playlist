And when I open my eyes I see the end of an ending life 
I’ve forgotten how to live. 2x 
I keep forgetting, I keep rebuilding. 
This is when I say I’m done. 2x 
I 
Haven’t 
Learned. 
No one will show me, so I go on my own. 
Honestly, I’m so fucking pitiful. 2x 
So fucking pitiful. 
Don’t 
Tell me what I’ve heard before. 
Destined to walk another day alone. 
This day is dying.
