That look on your face
You're breathing at night
I'm counting the days
And the tears that I've cried

You said that you love me
Every word is a lie
I wanted you near me
And now it's goodbye

I'm feeling so deeply
I'm feeling so wrong
You better believe me
The love makes me strong

No way to defeat me
I got to move on
Now that you're gone
It's only...

A Memory, Memory, Memory
It's all over the top now
Memory, Memory, Memory
And I need you to stop now
...
