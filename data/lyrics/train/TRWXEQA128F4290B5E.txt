I'ts all the same.
Only the names will change, everyday
it seems were wasting away.
Another place, where the faces are so cold
I drive all night just to get back home.
I'm a cowboy. On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted, dead or alive.
Wanted, dead or alive.

Somtimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days.
Now people like me, must go their seperate ways.
Sometimes you'll tell the day, by the bottle that you drink.
