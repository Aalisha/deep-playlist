(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier, yeah
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier

Well he's in Indian Town, and what spots his eye?
A nice looking Indian, and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said "Excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?"
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said "Why do ask? You got your own Timex"
To poor old Dave that line was cold blooded
He felt that her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
"I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is Running Rabbit and I'm glad to meet you"
He said "I'm Dave, with crazy clout"
"Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner"

(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier

Well, he met her father, Big Chief Beretti
He said "What's for dinner?"
