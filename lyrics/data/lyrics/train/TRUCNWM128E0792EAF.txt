Yeah yea

We've got a map of the world torn up
And your future's five bucks a pound
And I've seen your Mum with her knees pinned back
You'll pay everything to hear that sound

We drove a truck to the ranch of life
And came back with another brain
So shake your ass at the scene tonight
And open wide and let it drain
