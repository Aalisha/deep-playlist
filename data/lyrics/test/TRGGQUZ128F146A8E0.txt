I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Now here you are walking right through my door.

(Chorus)
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

A sacred gift of heaven
For better, worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
