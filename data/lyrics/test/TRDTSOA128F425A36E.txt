It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate

It's five o'clock in the morning
And you're just getting in
A knock upon the door
A voice sweet and low says "Who is it?"
She opens up the door and she lets you in
Never once does she say "Where have you been?"
She says "Hold it, are you hungry?
Did you eat yet? Let me hang up your coat now."
And all the time she's smiling
Never raises her voice
It's five o'clock in the morning
And you don't give it a second thought

It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
