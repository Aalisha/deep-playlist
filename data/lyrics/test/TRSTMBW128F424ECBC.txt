Well isn't it like you to have 'em all fooled
Stand tall walkin' proud, now you're breaking the rules
Tell me honey, are you feelin' just a little displaced?
Let down and alone now, what a bad, bad taste

'Cause when I hear you say my name
I don't feel the same
Start to feel like I might break
And it's more than I can take
No use in trying to make me stay
When I'm already on my way
When I go you're gonna hear it echo
When I go, when I go you're gonna hear it echo

Now things just ain't what they used to be
Two years gone by and now it's just a memory
I tried to explain the reasons why
Step up or step down, come on baby pick a side
