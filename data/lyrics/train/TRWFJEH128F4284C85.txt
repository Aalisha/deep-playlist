You say my heart's an open book
There are pages of my life you've never seen
You're always there between the lines
But there's so much more you just can't seem to read
Pieces of dreams
Pull us our separate ways
But we'll return someday

(Chorus)
So let the wind blow
'Cause my heart knows
We were meant to be together from the start
When the stars shine
Over one sky
