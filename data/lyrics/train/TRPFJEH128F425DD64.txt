When you feel so weak
and you scratch those stitches
reminding you of why you fell away after the offset

And you cant hold sleep
and you gamble more than enough
you cant depend on them

Still, I adore the taste of rain
and the bounce of bone on ground
it reminds me

Make a wish tonight
all the stars are out
it's out of your hands but not out of reach just

It's not out of reach
no this is not out of reach

But you feel so weak
you've burst those stitches
reminding you just why you felt so cruel
...
