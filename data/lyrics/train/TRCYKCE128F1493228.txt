Sittin' on your ass all day
Thinkin' about your hangover
And the party, you left your fuckin' keys at
And had to beg for, a ride from a stranger that I never met before
He acted so friendly that I had to take the ride
But for some reason he resembled that guy
Wanted for a robbery and beatin' on his kids
"You remind me of my stepson," he chuckled with a grin

What was that move that they taught in self-defense?
Where you block the killer's knife move with some confidence
The signal when you're trapped inside a moving car
I wonder if he'll drive real far.

What a day
What a day
You should've stayed home shootin' the breeze all day
What a day
What a day

What a day
What a day
You should think next time before you start to play
What a day
What a day
I wonder what will happen today...
