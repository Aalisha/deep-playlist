Something caught my eye
Chilling out tonight as you walked on by
Missed a beat inside
Took my breath away and I just can't hide

You don't know what you're doing to me boy
You don't know how you're move into me boy
I don't know what you're doing to me boy

It seems like
Lately something's coming over me baby
A feeling must been driving me crazy
No one turns me on like you do
When I'm with you it seems like lately

Messing with my mind
As I lose control almost every time
Moving side by side
Gives me such a rush up and down my spine
...
