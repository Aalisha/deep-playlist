Looking back over my years
I guess, I've shed some tears
Told myself time and again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight things ain't right
And I'm losing again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

Think I'd better let it go
'Cause it looks like another love T.K.O., oh, yeah
Said, "I'd better let it go
Because it looks like another love T.K.O."

I tried to take control of my love
Love took control of me
