I want you to want me
I want you to know it
But I can't show it
You have always been my everything
You've opened my heart
With the joy you've been bringing

Just give me a sign, baby
I promise you everyday, yeah

I'm gonna love you, girl
But it's a sticky situation
Girl, I'm tired of waiting
Please let the love begin
And won't you open up
And let me in

I want you to touch me
And kiss me over and
over and over
...
