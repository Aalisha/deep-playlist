From the golden brow of a morning hill
The shadows rise in the early still
The earth is cracked and the dust is cold
The embers glow and the fire is old

Mountains on the sky, lightning cracks the night
Shivering in the cold 'til the morning light
I know this time around I'm treading on holy ground
I felt the ghosts, I've heard the sound

So I ride on into the sun
With the shadows of the deeds that were done
I can't imagine what it was to be alive
The magic is still in the hills

Watch the fire child grow
Watch the fire child grow
...
