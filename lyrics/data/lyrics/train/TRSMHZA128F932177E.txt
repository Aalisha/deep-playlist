KRS-One representing Ma 6T va Crack-er
Cercle Rouge, KRS-One
Droppin on em like this
Pick it up, pick it up
You know what time it is when KRS-One comes through
Representing all true hip hop culture
You know how we do
How can they throw you in prison now for long years
If in reality the black man doesn't belong here
Have you forgotten how we got to this place
Why then are all the jails predominantly the black race
If you dont teach me my culture I dont know who I am
I dont know the difference between my enemy and my friend
So I'm robbin and killin I got nothing to live for
You turn my father into a boy my mother into a whore
Now I'm hardcore on the Ave
Watching while people that got me to walk fast
After beatin us, rapin us and robbin us
400 years of that's what's inside of us
Take a look at me now I'm really your creation
A technological anti-human mutation
A mutation of a better way of life
You first pulled the knife but to heal it will take my whole life
I fought no force on this level
I listen to bass and treble
