I don't know why
I got it so bad,
But somehow I find,
Out of the fry pan
And into the fire,
We're at it sooner.
Buried our souls
Out of our headset,
Ready to go,

Slippin' and slide,
I'm out of control.
Crying'll hide my
Head in a hole.
There's something about you I got to know
Before we go too far.

What I wanna know

What I wanna know
I wanna know is
(Whoa) are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the -

Me and my girl
