There's a cabin in the pines in the hills of Caroline
And a blue eyed girl is waiting there for me
I'll be going back some day and from her I'll never stray
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline

Oh, the cabin in the shadow of the pines
And the blue eyed girl way down in Caroline
Some day she'll be my wife and we'll live a happy life
In the cabin in the hills of Caroline
