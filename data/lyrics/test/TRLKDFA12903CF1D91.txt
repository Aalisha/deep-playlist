So here it come
Living in a pyramid
If you ask me why I stay
And fill me with such dread
I said why ask about why the nose is always coloured red
I said why
Why cause she's the mummy

He always walks in
From up on that hill
With a beady little triangle egypt eye
on the back of your dollar bill
And if the devil himself don't get it
Well lord knows one day i will
I said uhhhhhhhh watch out
Cause she's a mummy
