Come, all you coalminers
Wherever you may be
And listen to the story
That I relate to thee
My name is nothing extra
But the truth to you I tell
I am a coalminer
And I'm sure I wish you well
I was born in old Kentucky
In a coal camp, born and bred
I know about old beans
Bulldog gravy and cornbread
I know how the miners work and slave
...
