PARTY!...PARTY!
PARTY!...PARTY!

[Verse 1]
Me and my G boys rush through the door
Time to get rowdy, we's about to take the floor
Gotta let em' know, represent, throw ya hood up
I yell "Where my G's at" and the whole club stood up
We bout to blow it out, these women lookin' stout
We fixin' to break em' off cause that's what we all about
The party don't stop, pop the top on the Moet
And if we run out, I got plenty we can go get
Diamonds on my neck, golds in my mouth
This is how we do it deep, down in the South
Candy paint jobs with the twenties on the Chevy
Plenty Optimos cause you know we rollin' heavy
You never can suspend me, you always see me rippin'
I keep the yok stashed just in case they start trippin'
In the parking lot hit the brakes to the beat
With Versace on my back and them gators on my feet

[Hook]
But cha' know it ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (PARTY!)
