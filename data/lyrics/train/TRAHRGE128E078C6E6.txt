Your love means the world to me
Words could not express the joy you bring
Your love moves me tenderly
To have you by my side means everything... I sing
Your love has the best of me
If I could give you more then that would be...

Settle for my love, settle for my kiss
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss

So give to me, darling take my hand
Settle for my kiss
Cause it's all I can give
Settle for my love, that you'll never miss

Your love means the world to me
...
