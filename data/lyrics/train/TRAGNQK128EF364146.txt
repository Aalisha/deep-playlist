They took a southern working man and chained him to a car
Claimed before the judge we didn't pull him very far
Anyway, he looked at us with murder in his glance
We want to make a bargain, and the plea is self defense

Look mother trouble the waters
We've lost our sons and daughters
Blame religion, blame the family
It had to be somebody

Painless violence, daddy's silence
Feed the glamour of drugs and guns
Somebody tell me, you gotta
Who threw the stone to trouble the waters

They took a student farmer and they chained him to a post
And sent their finest greetings with him to the holy ghost
This is a place where men are men and we don't need his kind
We know what he planned for us, we could read his filthy mind
