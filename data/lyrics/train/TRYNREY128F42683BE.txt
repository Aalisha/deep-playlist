Awaiting for a shadow to draw near my bned
Shakin' off thoughts that keep my head
She's a blackbird that swallows
Ruler of my world
Woman full of deception
Stole my heart with just a word
So strange to me, but she sends shivers through my spine
So strange it seems, oh she might be evil
But she's mine, all mine
...
