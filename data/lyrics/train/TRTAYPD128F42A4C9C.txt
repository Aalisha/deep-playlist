Whuddup'tho
Check it out, it's the end of the beginning
The end being of like10 years ago when I first started rapping
All I wanted to do was make shit
Get it to people; see what they thought
And see how they felt about it, get my props or whatever
Now it's the end of that
cause now I gotta do in-stores, photo shoots, interviews
(You guys come over here!)
Check the head with the fucking reps, man
And now it's like, it's not about you and me anymore
My job is to get it to the people, not the people who diss me
But the people who are feeling me, give you the
soundtrack for your life (For you)

(Verse 1)
Now when I came to the game I was wet behind the ears
All I had was some raps that I wanted y'all to hear
Straight low budget I was underground thuggin' it
You think I gave a fuck about a publicist? (NO!)
You think I gave a fuck if you dubbed this shit? (NO!)
Now the industry is runnin' this underground shit (What?)
The industry is runnin' this underground shit (Oh!)
Now what that means is my crew wants a street team
My crew wants a video so they can be seen
And that was my dream since I was pre-teen
