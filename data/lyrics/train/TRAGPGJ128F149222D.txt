[Verse 1]
Not asking for a Diamond ring
Dont need superficial thangs
What I want from you is easy, (easy)
If you really want me, Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you to love me
Kiss and to hold me
Treat me like you want to be with me
Anything you do to me
Makes me go crazy
See the good that love can truly bring

[Chorus]
Sweet Taste Of Love
(The Taste of Love, if fills me up, 
Sensation, sweet, dont ever stop, No, No, No)
Sweet Taste Of Love (Oh, oh, oh)
