Blue water blue eyes color me
If any could come this close I would let them see,
In and out again playing one more song,
Its all I really wanted who's to say that's wrong

Ain't that what you want them to know,
All they get of you is what they get out of the show
The rest is mine I guess the beauty and the mess,
To hide.

I pull my self under and down I go again,
Its just a little bit hard letting them win.
