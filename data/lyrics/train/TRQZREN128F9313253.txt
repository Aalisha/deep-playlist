She says you've given up.
Your folks told me you should be left alone
On a mountaintop,
Knocking the aeroplanes down with stones.
Do the whirlwind and carry the hope that stings all night long.
Don't abandom him, 'cause he quivers when he hears your song.

Believe me, it's safe to see.
At least be confused about right and wrong.
Plan to settle down
Over the moon under the sun.
Do the whirlwind and shotgun the seat that beat, that beats,
Hanging on to the one you love,
...
