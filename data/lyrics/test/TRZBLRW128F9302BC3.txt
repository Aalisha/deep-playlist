You...
Don't wanna hear your name
Don't wanna see your smile
'Cause baby, I'm still crying

And go, it's time for you to get out
I'm sick of standing my ground
'Cause I just stand up running
And I go to sleeping believing in tomorrow
But I wake up screaming, halfway through the night

You know I can't get over
And I don't know why
You know I can't get over
No matter how I try
And I don't know why
...
