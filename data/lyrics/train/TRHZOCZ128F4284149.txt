Take it off
Baby take it all off

Uhh, take it off chick, bend over, let me see it
If you lookin for a trill-type figure, let me be it
Got the V-12 Benz, parked outside
It ain't enough room to fit dem gulls in my ride
It's on a, work somethin, twerk somethin basis
Makin big change, dancin in them tricks faces
She sleep in the day, but bump some booty at night
You kiss that thang and I'm out, cause she been playin with my pipe
Now get your mind right, hater, you a simp (a simp)
And I'm a red hot undercover pimmmmmp (pimmmmp)
That make them gulls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Like a real live money makin pro, uhh

You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

Unh
It was a Secret that Victoria tried to hide
A little sly delight, I done pushed my pride aside
Just to slide inside, man I done died tonight
