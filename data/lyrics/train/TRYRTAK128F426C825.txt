I've got emotion dripping out my pores
And I thought I would let you know
You are the night light
Ripping through my wicked world
How you make it sparkle and glow
Before I lose control
There's just one thing you should know

This is for real, this time I mean it
I'm coming clean, please don't let it go
I said from the start that you could take it or leave it
Prefer that you keep it
Don't let it go
Don't let it go
Don't let it go

I had some nightmares
