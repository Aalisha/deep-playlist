The time has come, there is no second chance
We? ve been drifting on an empty aching sea
You were the girl I never knew I wanted
I was the boy you hoped you? d never see

And it? s a shame that we ain? t lovers
We could have been somethin? so big and grand
Just kissin? for hours underneath that sweet magnolia
Beggin? for answers, tryin? to make a stand

Been burnin? up the hours, talkin? to the midnight
Just dreamin? of ways I could hold you next to me
But maybe it just wasn? t meant, all things have a reason
...
