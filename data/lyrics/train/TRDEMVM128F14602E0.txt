Oh, you sure
You sure have got me, girl

At last I'm past the fantasy
Into my reality, oh yes, you are
More than just the love talkin'
Hey girl, we've got it workin', workin', workin'

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love

I'm so glad that I was patient
Lord, sent me your heavenly creation, oh yes, he did
You're all I needed, needed, yeah
Oh, but it's all I conceded

Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love like this before
Never had a love like this before
Oh, I never had a love
