(This is a fair request. And I promise I will not judge any

person only as a teenager. That you will constantly

remind yourself that some of my generation judges

people by their race, their belief, or the color of their skin.

And that this is no more right than saying all teenagers

are drunken dope addicts or glue sniffers...)

Do you think its strange
That there's a way
Of how you look and how you act and how ya think
Pretend they're not the same as you
Do you think its strange
That there's a way
Of how you look and how you act and how ya think
Pretend they're not the same as you
Do you know about his strength in convictions?
