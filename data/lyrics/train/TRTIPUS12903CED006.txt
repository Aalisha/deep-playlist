These are the eyes that never knew how to smile
Till you came into my life

And these are the arms that long to lock you inside
Every day and every night

Girl, and here is the soul of which you've taken control
Can't you see I'm trying to show love is right

Show and tell
Just a game I play, when I want to say
"I love you"
Girl, so show me, and tell me
That you feel the same way too
Say you do, baby

These are the hands that can't help reaching for you
...
