How you choose to express yourself
It's all your own and I can tell
It comes naturally
It comes naturally

You follow what you feel inside
It's intuitive, you don't have to try
It comes naturally
It comes naturally

And it takes my breath away
What you do so naturally

You are the thunder and I am the lightning
And I love the way you
Know who you are and to me it's exciting
When you know it's meant to be

Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
When you're with me, baby
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally
Bay-bay-baby
