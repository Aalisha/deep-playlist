Dictate
What you think is pivotal
Mandate
Just for the sake of
Ego
Controlling your decision making
The world we're missing is still ours for the taking

Accelerate
Into isolation
Gravitate
To comfort, presentation
Anxiety laden, restless confusion
No courage, no confidence, absent delusion

Most of us would be lying
Holding fast to denying
If we
Said we're all feeling swell and content
All of us would be slipping
Backpedaling, gripping
So tight
To our fragile confidence

CHORUS

We're trying
Just to convince
The world we're
Something
That we can't be
We are not
Afraid of
Being alone
Of being caught
By oursselves
With only
Our own thoughts

We're trying
Just to convince
The world we're
Something
