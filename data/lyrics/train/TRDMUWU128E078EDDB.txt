I'm not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone, but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb, or maybe just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy
Think I'm just happy

My heart is broke
But I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we'll come down and have a hangover
Have a hangover
...
