Misery's turning my luck around
Framed all the faces on my way down
I don't have a reason, a reason to lie
That dull pain is screaming to be left behind
Oh...

It's never easy to see your past
Unfold before you, the outcast
You don't have a reason, a reason to cry
Caterpillars turn into rare butterflies
Oh... woa...

The little things we hide
The little things inside
Don't want to show them and I'll be alright
Oh, oh...
...
