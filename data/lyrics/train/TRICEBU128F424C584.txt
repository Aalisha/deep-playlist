I can feel the eyes of your despair
Even where you're not here
I can feel your pain within myself
It's still keeping me down here
Life keeps on growing colder, year by year
With a winter heart and my frozen tears
I stand alone to face my darkest fears

I've been wasting away
I've been fading inside
I've been drifting
Away from the lights in my life
I've been living in vain
Living insane
I've been tripping
Down all the darkest of lanes
