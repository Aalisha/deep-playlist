She says I've got the best beating heart in the world
And it makes her want to twirl around until she hits the ground

I swear together we've been here before
But we never looked away
Two seats inside an empty room
(My chance to get along with you)
With one more night what's left to lose

She says I've got the best beating heart in the world
And it makes her want to twirl around until she hits the ground

We lay with not a word to say
Alone we'll wait 'til something's wrong
...
