They tell me blues and trouble, walks hands in hand.
They tell me blues and trouble, they walks hands in hand.
But you ain't had no trouble, till your woman falls for some no good man.

A married woman will swear, she love you all of her life.
A married woman will swear, she love you all of her life.
And meet her other man 'round the corner, and tell that same lie twice.
