[Intro - Ja Rule - talking]
Yeah ... ha, uh huh
You know how we do (we're gonna do how we do)
Uh, uh, yo my nigga Cad what's hangin nigga (gangsta shit)
Nigga Terry what's goin on nigga
Let me talk to 'em for a minute (Murder Inc. bosses in the building)
Yeah, haha

[Chorus]
Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about the benjamins and nobody ain't doin it like us
C'mon what y'all want?

Niggas! Grip the iron and keep it cocked
Bitches! Work your clit keep that pussy hot
Cause it's all about sex, money, and murder
Bitches that burn ya, niggas with burners
Cocked and let go!

[Verse 1]
Fuck all y'all motherfuckin bitch ass niggas
I'm talkin to whoever wanna be ridin my dick
And you know your gon' get it as hot as I spit it
It's the Rule and nobody wanna be bothered with
If I hit 'em in every direction with four fifths
Will expend like 45's with compact discs (c'mon)
It's a disappointment to see niggas flip on Rule like they double jointed
When I'm one of rap's anointed
Who else used to order it all on the dick
