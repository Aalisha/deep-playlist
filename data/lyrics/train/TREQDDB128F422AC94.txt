I want you to know the thoughts
my mind contains
i want you to feel the rage
pulse through my veins
i want you to see the anger
in my eyes
i want you to feel fear
for your own life
I want to see the tears
fill up your eyes
i want to see you beg
and apologize
i want to walk behind you
without a sound
i want to burn your body
to the ground
