I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed
You bathed in my wine
Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds

(Put a stake) Through my heart
And drag me into sunlight
(So awake) For your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer

Swansong, for the Wish of Night
God it hurts, give a name to the pain
Our primrose path to hell is growing weed
