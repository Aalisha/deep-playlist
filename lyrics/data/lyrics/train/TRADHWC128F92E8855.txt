This is partytime
And we're all having so much fun
This is partytime
I could look at all the girls that are in this room
This is partytime
I could think of what would happen if one took me home
This is partytime
I think I'll have another of those
You always act so stupid
You always talk so dumb
But this is partytime
And you've got to say its better than a war
This is partytime
