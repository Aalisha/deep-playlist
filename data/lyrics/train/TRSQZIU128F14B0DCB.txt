Intricate are you among the masses
Interested in you will never pass us
Intricate are you among the masses
Intricate are you among the masses
Interested in you will never pass us
Intricate... Interested

Woke up today in a praisin' state of mind
Had a revelation while I'm waitin' in line
A picture of your face flashed across the screen
It's time to come together singing 217
Stare at me, I can't forget a set of eyes
The window to your soul is what I like to analyze
So don't be surprised when I memorize you in a crowd
We the people got a purpose and it's now

Stare at me
Stare at me tonight

Intricate are you among the masses
Interested in you will never pass us
Interested in you
Intricate are you among the masses
Intricate are you among the masses
