i am giving into violent tendencies
anger rises in my head
so much confusion is living within me
now that my lover is dead

he said i could be his little?
baby, he was beautiful
and i know that things aren't always what they seem
i'm telling you i'm not a fool

well, how can you sleep at night?
i wanna know
how can you live with yourself boy?
don't you know wrong from right?
oh, oh, oh
karma's gonna get ya

hey, hey, hey!
you're gonna have to pay, pay, pay!
for whatever it is you did that day
you were never king of karma
