When I was just a little young boy
Papa said, "Son, you'll never get far"
I'll tell you the reason, if you wanna know
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go

Well, baby baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well when I get those jelly-roll blues
Why I go and get anything in this world for you?

And down to the jewelry store packin' a gun
Says, "Wrap it up I think I'll take this one"
"A thousand dollars please", the jewelry man said
Dupree said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead"
