Empty factories to the east and all our waste
the shape of things that came show on the broken worker's face
to the west you'll find a silicon promised land
where machines all replace their minds with systematic profit plans
the course of human progress staggers like a drunk
it's pace is quick and heavy but it's mind is slow and blunt
i look for optimism but i just dont know
its seeds are planted in a poison place where nothing grows

its 1989 stand up and take a look around
weathers' bitter tension it seems is sinking down
drunk with power
and fighting one another
every hour shows the winter's getting harder
there's a freeze up, there's a freeze up coming!
there's a freeze up--freeze up coming!
there's a freeze up, there's a freeze up coming!
there's a freeze up coming!
