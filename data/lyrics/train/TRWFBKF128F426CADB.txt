[Verse 1:]
Feelin' like you live in flames, everytime you think my name
Super hot and on the spot as Fly enter I dispose a lame
Never will I feel the same, for a senseless refugee
Quicka-ly give out yo hot cause in the indo Fly must be
Now you not so cool to me, stranger changin' like the weather
Right before my eyes a big surprise is backed up by the devil
But I'm on another level, ever is Fly stayin' down
Let my pimpin' reign forever, corny king ah Funkytown
Bound to reach the highest peak, fast and pray and never sleep
Land ah Lonely I will seek cause to the top the Fly will creep
Love for me my folks will keep, deeper than the world's creation
Serve Allah and Bill Star, is Fly only obligation
Destination of a player, rankin' top numeric value
Give your ears a chance to hear, then I know that Fly will have you
Hotter than a block of ock, then you wish to be a friend
Hear your hoggin' not me dog cause in to win I am again

Hook: (4x)
Now I got you hot but this playa shit will never end
