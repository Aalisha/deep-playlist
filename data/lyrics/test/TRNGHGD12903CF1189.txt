(Broderick / Conklin)

(MacBeth)
In my mind's eye I raise a dagger
With means to end Duncan's life
This thought possesses even in slumber
I will commit this ghastly deed
On my servants I'll place the blame

You must strike. The time is thine
They'll crown Mac Beth as next in line
This kingdom ours, now is the time
