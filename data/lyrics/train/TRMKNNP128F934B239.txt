Moving out from the inside, we breed our extinction
An approaching era of unlight beyond comprehension
What is what was what went wrong, the screams of the ageless
Brought down by the disease installed in the formula for our creation

We hear the final call
Echoing rage through the blood stained walls
Mother nature can feel the end
The coming face of season hell

When the last rain of judgement washes away
Traces of our existence, burnt embers astray
...
