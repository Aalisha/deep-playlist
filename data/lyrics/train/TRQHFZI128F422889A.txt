Angel of mercy
How did you find me?
Where did you read my story?
Pulled from the papers
Desperate and hardened
Seeking a momentary fix

All I wanted to say
All I wanted to do
Has fallen apart now
All I wanted to feel
I wanted to love
It's all my fault now
A tragedy, I fear

Angel of mercy
How did you find me?
How did you pick me up again?
Angel of mercy
How did you move me?
Why am I on my feet again?

And I see you
Whoa whoa whoa
