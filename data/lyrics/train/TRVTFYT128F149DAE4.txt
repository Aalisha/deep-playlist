It's time to face it, the simple facts are clear
No amount of lovin' you, could ever keep you here
Packed up to leave, and never lookin' back
And don't try to stop this train, 'cause it's headed down the track

Never a tear across that cheek
No sign of sympathy, for a man who's feeling weak
Walkin's much too slow
So you're running out on me
