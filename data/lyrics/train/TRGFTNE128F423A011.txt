7. The Unborn

Smell the stench of the human flesh
See the bodies so rotten
The broken arms and the broken legs
No chance to get away from them
A lonely girl standing in the dust
Her eyes are cold and blind
The world is dead, there is no hope
We must never be born

The end of mankind has finally arrived
The voices of death will sing to us all
We have seen the signs in the sky
Yet nothing new has ever been born
We are the ones who will pay in the end
For the crimes and mistakes we made
We don't see it's already too late
