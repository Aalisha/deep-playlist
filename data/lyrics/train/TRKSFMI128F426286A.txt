You got nickels in your pocket, man
Your unconventional way of makin' money sad
Call one of your sugar babies when you get hungry
You goal's a lot bigger baby don't get funny

Got to, take a look, take a look at what you got
All grown up don't got a lot to show for
Take a look, take a look to be sure
Don't let them tell you what to go for

Shake it up, shake it up don't put down
You can be the one that you always dream about
Take a look, take a look at what you got
You could be a star, ridin' limousines yeah, yeah

(Line 'em up)
And you knock 'em down
(Line 'em up)
And you watch 'em hit the ground
(Line 'em up)
And you knock 'em down
(Line 'em up)
And ya knock 'em
