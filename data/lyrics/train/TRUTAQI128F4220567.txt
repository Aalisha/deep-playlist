Lonesome for no one when
the room was empty and
war as we knew it was obsolete
Nothing could beat complete denial

All we do is talk, sit, switch screens
as the homeland plans enemies

All we do is talk, static and split screens
As the homeland plans enemies

Invasion's so succexy
so succexy
Invasion's so succexy
so succexy

Let's drink to the military
The glass is empty
Faces to fill and cars to feed
...
