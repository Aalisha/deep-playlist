Ooh, ooh, you might not ever get rich
But let me tell ya, it's better than diggin' a ditch
There ain't no tellin' who you might meet
A movie star or maybe even a Indian Chief

(Workin')
At the car wash
Workin' at the car wash, girl
Come on and sing it with me
(Car wash)
Sing it with the feelin' ya'll
(Car wash, girl)

Some of the work gets kinda hard
This ain't no place to be, if you planned on bein' a star
Let me tell you it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes, if ya act the fool
