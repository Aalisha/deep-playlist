You're my lover
Undercover
You're my secret passion and I have no other

You're delicious
So capricious
If I find out you don't want me I'll be vicious

Say you love me
And you'll have me
In your arms forever and I won't forget it

Say you miss me
Come and kiss me
Take me up to heaven and you won't regret it

You are the one
You're my number one
The only treasure I'll ever have
You are the one
You're my number one
Anything for you 'cause you're the one I love
...
