Old man sitting by the side of the road
He's not watching the birds today
He's not watching the sunset like he always does
He's looking at the future
He has seen the past
School boy passes by interrupts his thoughts
He said sir, can you spare me a dollar
I got to make in time for my grade 8 class
I am fresh out of cigarettes
And I can't be late
The old man said

Chorus
