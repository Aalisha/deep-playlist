Wake-up, Switch-on,
Tune-in to another day,
Stereo sound with double vision,
Daylight makes its first incision

Warmed-up Clocked-in,
On your feet and under way,
Got to fight that Monday-morning feeling!

But in my head,
A savage beats out time with a drum
And it won't go away
Gone Tomorrow, here Today,
Wish I was a million miles away
Imagination, takes me where I want to go,
Imagination, don't fail me now---I need you now,
