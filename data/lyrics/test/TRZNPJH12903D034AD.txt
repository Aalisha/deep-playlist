Information, let the freedom flow!
Transformation, let this demon go!
Let the light shine on all of our restraints, the ones that always keep us in place.
We start this debate on who's the master and the chief; I'm sure you always wanted to be...
You're twisting, commanding, manipulating me.
The nonexistent you're making me to see.
I'M TURNING into two, the mad and the sane. This battle tears the virtues within.
The bullet's inside and penetrates my mind.
I'm trapped in you and the horror comes alive...
Let me stay alive for the wave that begins to rise...
