Yesterday's winter brought a blizzard to my door
She said don't worry anymore
Whatever held you back is forever in the past
Won't let my youth go by too fast

If what we love makes who we are
You're worth the beat of my heart
If I could give you anything
I'd give you the scene in my sleep, what I saw

I might be stuck here, I've got something to say
...
