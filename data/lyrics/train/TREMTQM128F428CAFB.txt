There's a time I felt
I was bless to be loved by you
But those blessings turned to regrets
From all the things you put me through

I remember at night you use to hold me
'Til the sun rosed the next day
But now you sleep and just turn away
While my heart is on display and I say

Why should I cry one more night?
Why should I smile when it hurts inside?
Why will my heart say, "Get up and walk away?"
Why do I say?

Why should I cry one more night?
Why should I smile when it hurts inside?
Why will my heart say, "Get up and walk away?"
Why do I say?

There's a reason why I cry everyday
There's a reason why things don't go your way
There's a reason why I kneel down and pray
