Meet me somewhere by the brook.
Oh please; you can see me if you look.
I can see you, I can hear your name,
Try to touch you but my hand fades in vain.
Goodbye to the one that I have loved the most.
The most.

He lost everything without a hope.
A vain attempt; couldn’t hold onto the rope.
Now I blame you, but surely we’re at fault.
This case is dismissed and sent down to the vaults.
