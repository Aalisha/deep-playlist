I remember seeing you do your thing
With a brand new girl on your arm everytime it rained
Used to say one girl is not enough
Now you can't belive you let them go
Fell in love

You was a pimp, playboy
You're not a pimp 
Now I'm in your life
I'm exempt
Cause I've got your heart
And now you belong to me, yeah

When it comes to me
I get what I want
Cause I made you fall in love
When it comes to me
You don't have control
Cause I beat you at your game
I beat you at your own game
 
When it comes to me

Now when you go dancing your with me
