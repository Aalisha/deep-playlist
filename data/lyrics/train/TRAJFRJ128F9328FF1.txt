It's early in the morning and I can't get right
'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night

Now it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

I went to her house but she don't live there no more

And it's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
It's early in the morning
