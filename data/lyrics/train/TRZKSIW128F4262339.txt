I just got hit by a ton of bricks
But I won't lie down
While I'm alive I'm gonna get my kicks
I won't lie down
I'm old and dirty from the wrong side of town
I won't lie down
Aint got no money to throw around
I won't lie down
Doctor says I'm living on borrowed time
But I won't lie down
Get so sick my baby cries
