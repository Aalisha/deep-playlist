Do you hear that whistle wail?
I think the end is comin' in
I'm a whole lot worse for wear
But I'm determined to slip this skin

And I know you're dyin' for a good time

We could run all night and dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand, I'll give the very best I can
But boy, I still want to be your man
