Born Aware
Yet Destined Not To Be
To An Entity Of Pain You Serve
Taken From The Light
Nourishment Through Spite
Depleting Human Decree
Chronic Infliction Through A Sickened Will
The Many That Stain This Earth
It Doesn't Matter Who Must Suffer
When Your Sickness Claims Rebirth

Upheaving Desire - Heinous In Its Wake
Abandonment Of Life - This Baneful Mistake
Sickness Now Unfolds In You - To Death You
