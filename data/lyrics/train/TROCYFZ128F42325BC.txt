I am a god bless tell them my friend
So needless you tried no you won't catch me 
I am a god bless tell them my friend 
Needless you tried no you won't suceed

Stay there and set up all you plans 
Laugh with me in the face then stab at me in the back 
But Your conscious soon start ride you am giving your time 
For who god bless he said no man shall curse
