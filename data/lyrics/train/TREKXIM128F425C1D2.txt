With watching eyes
you see dreams dissolving
distant voices slipping away
i have to go - i hear
the call of something deeper
a voice inside of me
And tears return
beneath the happy ending
promised words that scattered
in the cold
i have to leave, i hear
the call of something higher
something young becoming old
I can't stay here any longer
trapped here by the rain
i can't stay here any longer
waiting for this train
I'm waiting for the last train
out of nowhere
i'm waiting for the last train
on the line
some people say that i will
never leave here.
but i have to go this time
I'm waiting for the last train
...
