Catch me
Come let me love you
Come let me find you
Together as one
Catch me
Come let me feel you
Come let me heal you
'Cause you are the one

Call me
Find me
Say my name

Since the first time we touched
We've lost so much so let me find your heart again

See me touch me hold me close

Love means what it seams and seams what it means
But did we ever realy know

Catch me
Come let me love you
Come let me find you
