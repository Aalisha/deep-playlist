I make the most of all this stress
I try to live without regrets
But I'm about to break a sweat
I'm freakin' out

It's like a poison in my brain
It's like a fog that blurs the sane
It's like a vine you can't untangle
I'm freakin' out

Every time I turn around
Something don't feel right

Just might be paranoid
I'm avoiding the lies
'Cause they just might slip
Can someone stop the noise?
I don't know what it is
But I just don't fit
I'm paranoid

I take the necessary steps
To get some air in to my chest
