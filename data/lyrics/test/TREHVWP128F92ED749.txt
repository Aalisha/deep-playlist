When I woke up I could see the daylight had already passed me
It was such a fight to fade away asleep
It’s a fugue
Come on
Found to chase down the dawn
Well I fell every night as it turns into light with my eyes just shut tight

Sailing all alone
I thought I made it home
But I threw it all away
Oh where I’ve been
Sold and spun again
All before me like a dream
Falling in between
I feel sick, I feel nervous
I know just what I did to deserve this
Though I know it’s not a dream

Keeping quiet
...
