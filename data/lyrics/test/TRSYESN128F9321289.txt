Small town homecoming queen, she's a star in this scene
There's no way to deny she's lovely
Perfect skin, perfect hair, perfumed hearts everywhere
Tell myself that inside she's ugly

Maybe I'm just jealous, I can't help but hate her
Secretly I wonder if my boyfriend wants to date her

She is the prom queen, I'm in the marching band
She is a cheerleader, I'm sitting in the stands
She gets the top bunk and I'm sleeping on the floor
She's Miss America
And I'm just the girl next door
