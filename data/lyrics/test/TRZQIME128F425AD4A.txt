Last night you breathed the deepest sigh
Turned away with those cold cool eyes
You said won't you give me space to breathe
And my tears gave you confidence to leave

Now you say I'm just to much for you
There are things you'll never know
If you lie and cheat so easily
You'd better go, go go go, yeah

All I know is how I feel
And my heart was always yours to steal
But you take and never give to me
Your kisses are charity
