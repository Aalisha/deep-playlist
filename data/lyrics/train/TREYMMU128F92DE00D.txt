Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good Golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin', can't hear your momma call

From the early early mornin' till the early early night
You can see Miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue lights

The good Golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
