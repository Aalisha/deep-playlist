How happy is the human soul?
Not enslaved by dull control
Left to dream and roam an' play
Shed the guilt of former days

Walking on the foggy shore
Watch the waves come rolling home
Through the veil of pale moonlight
My shadow stretches out its hand

And so we lay, we lay in the same grave
Our chemical wedding day
And so we lay, we lay in the same grave
...
