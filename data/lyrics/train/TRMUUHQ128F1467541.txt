Do you want to play?

Ring around the rosie
Hopscotch, Monopoly
Red light, green light
G.I. Joes and Barbies

Hide and seek, kick the can
Cowboys and Indians
Wiffle ball, paper dolls
Hacky sack and hangman

Do you wanna play with me

Tag you're IT, cops and robbers
Jungle gym, chutes and ladders
Tic tac toe, Mister Rogers
Marco Polo, London bridges

Simon sez, steal the bacon
Time out, trick or treat
Electric company
Olly olly oxen free

Do you wanna play with me, with me
...
