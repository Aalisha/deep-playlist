Yummy, Yummy, Yummy
I got love in my tummy
And I feel like a-lovin you
Love, you're such a sweet thing
Good enough to eat thing
And that's just a-what I'm gonna do
Ooh love, to hold ya
Ooh love, to kiss ya
Ooh love, I love it so
Ooh love, you're sweeter
Sweeter than sugar
Ooh love, I wont let you go
