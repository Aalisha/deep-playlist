I found your letter in my mailbox today
You were just checkin' if I was okay
And if I miss you, well, you know what they say ...

just once ... in a very blue moon
just once in a very blue moon
just once ... in a very blue moon
and I feel one comin' on soon
No need to tell me, you'd like to be friends
and help me get back on my feet again
...
