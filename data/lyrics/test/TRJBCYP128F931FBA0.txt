I waded through the darkest fields you'd imagine
Your pretty face sketched on the barrel of my gun
And I know you'll be the first to welcome me
When I climb into eternity, oh, oh

The forest always kept us warm
But it doesn't feel like home anymore
And I know there's bigger mountains where you are
And a better climate for my heart, oh, oh

I've been racing the clock and I've run out of steam
I am ready for my final symphony
Oh, my body is weak but my soul is still strong
I am ready to rest in your arms
