Days will come that make no sense
My present situation makes me think too much, too much
It all revolves around you
This life that I'm living
Means nothin' without you

I'd shed my skin for you
(I'd shed my skin for you)
What would you want me to do?
(What would you want me to do?)
I will always love you, but I can't live like this

This problem here
Is my fault
It's not that
I don't care
But I'm so lost
...
