On a cold winters night
With a storm at its height
The lifeboat answered the call.
They pitched and they tossed
Till we thought they were lost
As we watched from the harbor wall.
Though the night was pitch black,
There was no turning back,
For someone was waiting out there,
But each volunteer
Had to live with his fear
As they joined in a silent prayer.

Home, home, home from the sea
Angels of mercy, answer our plea
And carry us home, home, home from the(sea
Carry us safely home from the sea.
