Set me free, why don't cha, baby
Get out my life, why don't cha, baby
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on
You don't really need me
But you keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a comin' around
Playin' with my heart?
Why don't you get out of my life
And let me make a new start?
Let me get over you
The way you've gotten over me, hey

Set me free, why don't cha, baby
Let me be, why don't cha, baby
