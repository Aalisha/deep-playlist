I still remember the night we met
You said you loved my smile
But your love for me was like a summer breeze
Oh, it lasted for a while
I could hold on a little tighter I know
But when you love someone you gotta let 'em go so.

I'm gonna smile, 'cause I want to make you happy
Laugh, so you can't see me cry
I'm gonna let you go in style
