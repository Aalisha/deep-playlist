It all came down to you tonight
We'll never make it out of here
And all you did was try
By coming clean the past few years

It was a late night in the city
A romance in the making
If you play the victim I'll play the liar

Another drink and we can go spend some time at home
I know in the morning I'll eat every word I said
...
