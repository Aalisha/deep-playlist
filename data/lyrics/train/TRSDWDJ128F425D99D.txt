How do I love you, let me count the ways, I could go on for days
You keep on giving me a reason to stay lost in you
You fill me up with passion and still I never lose the hunger
If it isn't one thing, baby it's another

One minute it's your kiss the next it is your smile
There's no end to the ways you drive me wild
The perfume that you wear, your dress slit up till there
The way you run your fingers through my hair
When it comes to love, girl you've got me covered
If it isn't one thing, baby it's another
...
