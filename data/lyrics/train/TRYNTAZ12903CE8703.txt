I don't believe nothing is wrong

I don't relive my past
I don't believe in much
I don't believe in the system
It never works the way it should
I wanna hear about a livable world
A world of purpose, a world of good
But more it seems that reality has sharper teeth
Is peace a dream?

I don't like people dying
With hate muffling their cries
I cannot find where I belong
