Goodbye, goodbye, rock and roller
I said farewell, my friend
Time has slipped by much too, much too quickly
Looks like we've nearly reached the end
Dreams won't last forever
And just like the wind will change
Oh, there's been - Hard Times
Hold on tight, now, it's gonna get better
Goodbye - gotta be movin' on
