Keeping me away from elevation! Upset
Keeping me away from elevation! Upset

Keeping me away from elevation!
For something I don’t wanna ring the bell for
Won’t you let me stand at the top
You wanna keep me upset, yeah!

I wake up this morning like another day
Scarring pictures in my head as long as I go this way
Isolating me into a fake death
Isolating me into a fake death

People asking me about this place
They’ve never been before
The implications
Of my dark visions
Have never been told

Why do we always try to change our damn personality?
This solution always contributes
To fucking ease the pain
