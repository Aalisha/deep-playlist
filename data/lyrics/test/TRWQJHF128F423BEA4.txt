Before the world was formed
Before the beginning of time
I had plans for you
You were on my mind
Closet to my heart
From which you'll never go
More than you'll ever know
If ever you doubt or if you are unsure
Know that my love for you will always endure
More than a friend, to my love there is no end
More than you'll ever know
I came to earth for you
I gave my life for you
My best to you I did show
So you would know, that I love you more
More than you'll ever know
Yes, I love you so
(Ooh)
In case you didn't know
I gave my life to show you
That I love you
More than you'll ever know
Many mistakes you made along life's way
