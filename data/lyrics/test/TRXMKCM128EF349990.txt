With The Vancouvers

Malinda, Malinda

Malinda's the girl (girl)
Who came to my world
And made my interest
In all other girls stop

Malinda's a dream (dream)
Beauty to the extreme
Malinda is the cream of the crop

So many guys in love
With my Malinda (they can't get her)
You ought to see the presents
Others send her

Trying to make her surrender
Surrender them some of that tender
Love she's giving me (Malinda)

Oh, but she doesn't know
