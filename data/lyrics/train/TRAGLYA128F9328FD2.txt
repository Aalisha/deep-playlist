This song is dedicated
To the city of New Orleans
From the whole world, let's go

I feel your heartbeat, I see your tears fall
I see your hands go up, now you've given up on it all
I see your head go down, I know you've lost hope
You're walls keep on comin' down and you can't take no more

Every road you travel seems like your journey's end
That life's an endless battle that you can't seem to win
Well I say, stand up and claim what's yours
Leave those troubles behind and don't you look back no more

Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine
Let your light shine on the world
Let your light shine, let your light shine

I know your struggles and I feel your pain
You're doin' everythin' to stop yourself from goin' insane
