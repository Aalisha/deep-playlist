I don't need the same excuses
All this talk is really useless
You run for cover every time
I'm close to you

Don't wanna hear about the others
There's something here we should discover
Let's make a little magic
Before the night is through

Ooh, you've seen it all before
And heard the same lines
But if you're willing to take a chance
It could be all right, so fine
We'll find ourselves dancing by firelight

So don't you try to change the subject
Or try to put yourself above it
A boy could get pneumonia
Sitting next to you, that's true
...
