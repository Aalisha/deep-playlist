Why do rocks always survive
On their journey through the motions
Why do they not grow old
In the mystery of time

Why do they still stand tall
They keep patiently waiting
Why do rocks always survive
All the wartimes, the heroes

All the foolish, the brave
All the children, all the lovers
All the naked feet they've grazed
They just ignore the madness created by us

They have seen so many slip
They have seen so many fall
They have proved that truth is just a word
For the crown of creation

They have seen that the law of nature
Is a thing you can't ignore
They have laughed at you trying to hide your lies
Behind the name of the father

To justify your crimes
To justify your cruelty
They have gazed into the eyes
Of the origin of all evil

They have seen how the taste of money
Can change a decent man
They have smelled the inner thoughts
Of the greatest deceivers

They have smelled the weapon of hate and revenge
As it sneaks into the human mind
...
