Sad, sad story, about all the things I've heard.
Now baby, there's something on my mind.
You said I was your true love.
But I hear you're foolin' 'round.
I gotta know girl what's going down.

Oh, tell me, wher do we go from here and.
Are you just playin' me for a fool.
Ooo, lover, I'm tired of people talking.
Why don't you tell me girl if we're through.
Why can't I hear it from you.

Everybody's talkin'
They say you're leaving me.
They say you don't want me no more,
Oh baby.
I need some understanding,
Ooo, tell me who's right and who's wrong.
Baby yea.
