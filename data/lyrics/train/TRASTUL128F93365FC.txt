I done a lot of good, I done a lot of wrong, dis real shit, I advise u listen to this song.
A nigga robbed me 15 yrs ago(where)
Back in canridge swats sides on 4, never forget that day, thought it was all g's, but niggas hating man dey hating on a small g.
Stuck me witha shank, left a whole in ma face, took my heroin, bone, money, beeper off my waist. Next day I squad up, got all the
Tools out, got a hot bos, roll round lookin for dudes house, lucky for me I ain't catch him, woulda been dead, unlucky for him
Fucked round, he touched the wrong kid, that karm fool, it hit cha from the blind side, he got shot 9 times now he paraylized,
Plz forgive him lord, even a thug pray, but I pray my past don't come back to haunt me

Told me it was destiny, came to me 1 night I was dreamin, dese crazy visions I kept on seeing, all the money and clothes, all
The drugs that I sold from the life that I chose, but it could be karma, cause all these things u do it could haunt cha, if u do it wrong it come right back
On ya, all the money and clothes, all the drugs that I sold could be the reason u ain't livin tomorrow.
