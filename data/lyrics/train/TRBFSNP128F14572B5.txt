I'll tell ya that I love you,
if it makes everything alright
I just wanna hold you,
I've got something to prove tonight
I'm tired of the telephone,
can't you give me one night alone

I'm staring at your picture,
I realize what you mean to me
Every single moment is burning deep in my memory
It doesn't matter what they say,
our love's too good to throw it away
All we need is

One night alone -
just you and me, won't you give me
One night alone -
...
