War, war for power
Shut up

You stared at the broken mirror
Your heart's collecting dust
Secure that the sins are forgiven
Forgotten but still left with us

The crime is that you've failed in recognizing
The heart you broke, the life you stole
Bow down before your master
Well, get inside with this shit inside as I

Bow down, you're my disaster
