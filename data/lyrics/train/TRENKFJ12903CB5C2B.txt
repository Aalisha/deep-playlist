If I talk real slowly
If I try real hard
To make my point dear
That you have my heart.

Here I go
I'll tell you what you already know.
Here I go.
I'll tell you what you already know.

If you love me, with all of your heart.
If you love me, I'll make you a star in my universe.
you'll never have to go to work.
