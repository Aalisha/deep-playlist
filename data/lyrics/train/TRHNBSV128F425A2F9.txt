Waiting In Vain
(marley)

From the very first time i rest my eyes on you, boy
My heart said follow through but i know now
That i'm way down on your line
But the waiting feeling's fine

So don't treat me like a puppet on a string
Because i know how to do my thing
Don't talk to me as if you think i'm dumb
I wanna know when you're gotta come, you see

*i don't wanna wait in a vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in a vain for your love
I don't wanna wait in a vain for your love
'cause sommer is here
