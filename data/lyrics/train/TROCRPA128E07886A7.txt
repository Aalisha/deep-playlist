Hear my confession while it's on my mind
One holy hour of your precious time
Could save my soul
Bitter memories will faid away
You could make this fallen angels day
If you'll be there, if you'll take care of...

My sacred heart
Spare my sacred heart
My sacred heart
I give to you
My sacred heart
...
