Suicide
Don't give a fuck about this
My life or any other
Just go away and let me hang
Impossible to forgive, forget it, murderer
I'm in control

Living a lie
Make you pay at all cost for this
Love sick
Bullshit
Bring it

Decisions making themselves
I don't need you
Thorns in my side
So I die

No one
No one could ever understand
My life's exhausted
No one
No one could ever understand
This life IMN

Determined
To bring you all down with me
Break you
Beat down
No more fucking empathy
From me, for you
Fed up i've had enough
Duality
My war
Existence
Instigated controversy
Lay down
Sell out
So wrong
