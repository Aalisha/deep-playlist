I was sitting in my room, dark and gray and crying
Someone in my life I fear was at the point of dying
A cold wind blew right up my spine, it was the break of dawn
A little voice way deep inside told me she was gone

Oh... This house is haunted
Oh... That's how I want it to be
Oh... This house is haunted
...
