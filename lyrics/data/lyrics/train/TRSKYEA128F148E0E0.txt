I can't believe that when you said that you needed me to stay with you 
I can't believe that it was just what I needed to save me too 

I'm in love with you 
do do do do 
I think you should love me too 
Out Of The Blue 
Out Of The Blue 
In love with you 

I can remember all the leaves of september crushing under my shoe 
When we were walking baby, who needed talking 
All my dreams coming true
