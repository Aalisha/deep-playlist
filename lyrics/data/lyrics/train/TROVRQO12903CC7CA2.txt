Sleepwalking
I find myself
Follow my
Follow my

Sleepwalking
I find myself
I get lost, I get lost
Follow my
Follow my

How'd it start?
All starry eyed
Follow my
Follow my

Sleepwalking
I find myself
In shop windows
I get lost, I get lost
In all of my
All of my
Follow my
Follow my

Under June in disguise
Ugly silver skies
Summer blooms in you
