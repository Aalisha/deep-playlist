I'm thy blood abominated abd spilled
by the works of darkness and hatred
I'm abyssic flames infernal fire of dafamation
which burns and brands the sacred scriptures
wielder of the oppressive sword of revenge
blood of sacrificed showers from my blade
marching over slaghtered preys I feast
ascending storms of scourge I ride
spewing the rites of ritual sacrifice
I'm the one baptized in flames

Ceremonial death thru merciless desecration
