Yes

Why say no, when you can yes?
It's so easy, come on and say yes
You can change your life, if you can say yes
Not tomorrow but today, yes

Why say no, when you can yes?
It's so easy, come on and say yes
You can change your life, if you can say yes
Not tomorrow but today, yes

Everybody's got them days when they down
No one to call on, nobody around
You wanna smile but you can't smile
Hurt so many times you can't count

All the tears you've cried
So now you hold it all inside
Falling apart, can't keep it together
So many questions, well, here's the answer

Why say no, when you can yes?
It's so easy, come on and say yes
You can change your life, if you can say yes
