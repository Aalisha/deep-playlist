Tell the swine, we will make it out alive
There's a note in the pages of the book
So sleep tonight, we'll sleep dreamlessly this time
When we awake we'll know that everything's alright

Sing to me about the end of the world
End of these hammers and needles for you

Arise and be
All that you dreamed, all that you dreamed

The snow on your face and your razor blades
The twilight is bruised and there you lie
