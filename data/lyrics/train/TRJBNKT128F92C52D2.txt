On a river of sighs
A boat came towards me
A flimsy disguise
Covered the devil
Who sang from a songsheet
Of how modern life's a bore

In his choirboys' attire
He sang me the life to which
Good girls aspire
Where men in white coats
Give us pills to tame the horses that stamp on our floors
And pills for when the horses have bolted out the door

It's hard to explain
I don't like hanging on to reins in my hands all the time
I'm running out of trails
Worn paths don't lead to where I need to get to every time
She moves in secret ways
And there is grace and poised perfection when she takes the helm
She moves in secret ways

Now the house is on fire
The rats are all screaming
...
