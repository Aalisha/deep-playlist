Hey

Go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
It's the place that we meet
We can jump to the beat
Everybody, go dancing at the club
Friday night is here and everything is fine
We'll be going downtown to have a good time
Dancing's fun with everyone
Dancing close is the thing I like the most
Go dancing at the club
Go dancing at the club
Get up, up on your feet
Come on jump to the beat
