If we're grateful and we're thankful then we're spiritual
If we're hiding we're denying all the love inside
so don't let your spirit die
lay down your arms and we'll walk together
into the light

I cannot find the words to be all forgiving
it's gonna take some time
cos the old disease got a hold of me
and I need to apologize
and it's a myth to say we block things out
when we really block them in
Oh I'm so sorry baby
but I'm doing everything I can
...
