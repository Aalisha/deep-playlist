Angry little hearts unite this time it's us against the world alright
Gotta have the answers, want a new anthem
Gonna take it all back tonight
So throw another brick and cast another stone
Another broken home I don't want to be alone
Holding out for the answers
Hold it up for ransom
Gonna shout it out loud, Gonna sing along tonight

I don't want to be the one who brings the tears into your eyes
I only want to feel the light of heaven in your arm tonight
