Tash

Yeah, Tha Alkaholiks
Ay J, I got a crew
They called the Loot Pack
And they can get crazy fresh y'all, crazy fresh y'all
My man Jack is about to get fresh y'all

One: Loot Pack

Check the flavor here's a rootin tootin hydraulic trooper
Tha Alkaholik grouper in the house and when I bust the hula-hooper
Peep my ish, when I flips next I flash with the Cracker Jacker
A true Loot Packer
Gettin versatile when I smile toastin to the funk
All punks put your glass down, or end up in the trunk
You wonder when my dope styles sound kind of varied
The Pictionary, man with my backpack, I'll Carey
Mariah took her back, and show her how I Pack, Loot
Kick lyrics on originally outtrack black in fact
People call me moody, I simply knocks the booty
Pull up my hoody, and then I bust a Sam Goody

Two: Tash

Bitches on my woody cuz I likes to get the loosest
I eat niggaz up and wash em down with deuce gooses
A Colt .45 cuz I gotsta rush the likwit
Tash from the group that the bitches wanna get with
I kick it from the East all the way to the West
Yes stay away from booze that puts the hair on your chest
