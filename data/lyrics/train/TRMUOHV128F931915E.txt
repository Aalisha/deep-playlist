Everybody's a genius
And everyone's insane
Sugarplums and razor blades
Dancing in our brains
I've been gunning for sunshine
I want my piece of the sky
I think I'm going viral, baby
And I couldn't even tell you why
I'm a rock star, I'm a thriller
I'm a time bomb, I'm a killer
I've been a million people, yeah, it's true
I'm an actress, I'm a liar
I'm a sinner in the choir
Yeah, everything I am is killing you
