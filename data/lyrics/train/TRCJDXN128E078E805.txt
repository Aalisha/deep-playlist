Hey girl what you doin over there?
Layin down thinking bout me huh?
Guess what baby? I'm doin the same thing
I'm just sitting down with this chilled bottle of wine
Huh I want to share it with you tonight
Reminense the things we used to do
Horseback riding, walking on the beach baby
Why don't you slip on something sexy and sweet
I'll have my driver just drive on over there
Get you and bring you over to me
I'll have everything ready
I'll be waiting baby

Honey come on over to my place
Cause I got to have you baby eh
Come on come on come on
I want you to touch every inch of me
Lady you see a happy staring at you lady ooh
Come on come on come on

You ooh ooh ooh open up your eyes
Tell me what do you see
Do you see a sexy man?
Wanting your body-eh eh eeh

Ooh be sweet and gentle
Make me call out your name girl
Let's take our time and do it right
Tell me what you want me to do oh oh yea

Let's make love tonight
