You're crazy 'bout lovin', I'm crazy 'bout love myself
You're crazy 'bout lovin', I'm crazy 'bout love myself
When I'm with you baby, can't think about nothin' else

I've seen so many men, it's like looking through a fine tooth comb
I've seen so many men, it's like looking through a fine tooth comb
But these young cats 'll make a good girl lose her home

[Chorus]
I wanna go north, east, south, west
Every which way, as long as I'm movin'
Long as I'm movin', long as I'm movin'
Long as I'm movin', long as I'm movin' baby, I don't care
