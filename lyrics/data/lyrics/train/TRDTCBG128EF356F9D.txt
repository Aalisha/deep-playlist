*Wiley talking*
Yeh! [London]
It's me, Eski-Boy
Bow E3, all day long, hol tight Maniac
You know we do this
Oh my days, certain man tryna say like... 
I don't rep E3, I'm not E3
Are you crazy, I've been doing this
I went to Bow boys, I've been doing this for so long
Like... it's amazing how you can say that.
Listen... 

My names Wiley, I come from 'Bow E3'
07961897033, I'm so E3
The whole of E3's got so much talent, I hope you see
I know E3 so well, If you ask me Wiley speaks for the whole of E3
You can't say that, Scorcher wont make nobody bow to his foot, I aint Wolf Pack
Boy Better Know E3, wont just let another donut MC disrespect E3
I'm always tryna rep ends but certain friends on end they don't know E3
'Coz when it's reppin' time, I show E3
We made the genre everybody's on but, it's all come from Bow E3
It's Wiley aka Eski-Boy I'm from Bow E3

*Wiley talking*
You get me... that's why, 
And certain man are tryna say like Eski don't represet E3, 
I've been doing this for so long...
