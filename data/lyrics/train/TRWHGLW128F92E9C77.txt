Light your world, let the love of God shine through
In the little things you do light your world

Two doors down one rocking chair is rocking
She sits there all alone, her husband dead and gone
The best years of her life they spent together
He was always strong, but now she's on her own

And the telephone never rings
No one laughs, no one sings
It's quiet there, does anyone care?

Light your world, let the love of God shine through
In the little things you do, light your world
And though your light may be
Reaching only two or three, light your world
...
