Phone me and I'll hang up
Sick and tired of being bubble gum chewed up
Dark lane, bleak house shrinking rose, You're over and out
Tie a cherry bootstring, put your candy teeth in
Choking on a sweetheart, hang up, hang up, hang up

Go on girls - solo,
Go on girls - take a chance,
Go on girls - trust it,
Go on girls - the truth is ...

Cut your hair wear a chip on your shoulder
...
