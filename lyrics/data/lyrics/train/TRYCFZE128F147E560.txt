Tomorrow comes and then it goes,
What do we even care?
We're not about all the looks,
Or the clothes we wear,
If we started off the same,
Why are we going sifferent ways?

Do you even realise,
We're living in a compromise?
We start out young and new,
But are destroyed by misled youth,
We're never really satisfied,
...
