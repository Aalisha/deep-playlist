To my surprise I turn around
The devil's got a hold on me
How was I supposed to know
The devil got so damn pretty

Oh, you little devil
You got so pretty, you little fool

He pulls me in, he tears me down
He chews me up just to spit me out
But he holds me close like he's my best friend
When I open up he steals everything
He's gone again
