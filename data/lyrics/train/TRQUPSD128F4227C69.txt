All of our fashions have faded
Each generation has been here before
And how do we get so jaded?
Break this cloud that we're on
Let it rain, let it pour
When all is said and all is done
Will we turn our face to the Son?
Get back to the root of it all
Jesus is calling us to the love of a Father
Get back to the root of it all
Jesus is calling us to love one another
This world and all of its treasures
Pull in tied, chase the wind
