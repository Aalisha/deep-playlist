Bring along your fishin' pole and leave your dirty dishes
Meet me by the fishin' pole and wear your leather britches
Tell your mom and pa every thing's alright
We're gonna go fishin' next Saturday night

Lipstick makeup leave behind
Makeup takes up too much time
You're a little honey and you're quite a dish
But Saturday night we're goin' fishin' you fish

Don't forget the frying pan and bring along some manners
