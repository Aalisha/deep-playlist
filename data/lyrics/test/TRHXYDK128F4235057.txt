You're the opposite of me
And I'm the opposite of you
I know I'm really young
And that my life has just begun
Cuz I'm the opposite of you
And you're the opposite of me
I've done all I can do
So would you do the same for me?

I'm getting stronger all the time
It's an uphill battle but I'll be fine

You're the opposite of me
And I'm the opposite of you
(You're the opposite of me
And I'm the opposite of you)
...
