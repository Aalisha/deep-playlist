Memories of you
Haunt me every day
A never healing wound
And nothing left to say
I die a little every day,
(I die a little anyway)
For the memories,
For hell inside of me.

No true emotions
No true regrets
No true devotion can live off bitterness
My hollow inside
My hollow heart
My restless soul is longing to depart.
