Warfare, a promise to eliminate mankind.
The planet as we know it, taken by demented minds.
Warheads produced to exterminate the earth.
The sacrifice will lead us to our death, no rebirth.

No one has the power to declare this world to die.
Voting and electing the right to crucify.
Times of turmoil have decided what to do.
No need for common knowledge, we're through.
