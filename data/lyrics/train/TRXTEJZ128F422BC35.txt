I want your silent parts
The parts the birds love
I know there's such a place
I had my back turned
You didn't realize
I'm lonely
You lack the things
To which I relate
But I see no harm
Come wait, come wait, come wait
It's over
One
Two
Three
Do me
When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because
I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into my airspace
You move into my airspace
And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
