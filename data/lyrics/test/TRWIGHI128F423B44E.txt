Hey you fool what is it you do?
What you getting yourself into?
I won't be no good for you
(I'm no good for you)
Hey boy I'm sorry to say
I could do this everyday
I'm my own worst enemy

CHORUS:
Sooner or later
It's gonna come around for you, yeah
Sooner or later
It's gonna come around for yo, yeah
Sooner or later
I'll be be turning you on, yeah
Sooner or later
Sooner or later
...
