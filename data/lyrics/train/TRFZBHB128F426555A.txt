Oh!...oh!

Loves got me by the ass again
I've been in love since I don't know when
I keep a-runnin' and I don't know why
Love's givin' me a crock of lies
Out of breath and I'm out of time
Misery is a ruff fight

Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yes it's crazy
Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yeah it's crazy
Love's a bitch!
