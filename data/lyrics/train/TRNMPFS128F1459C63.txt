Say goodbye
Maybe that's one way to go
Walk away and say it's over
Call it history
Do I believe that we'd be better off apart?
Can I see my world without you in it?
Baby, not for a single minute

Let the moon give up the night
All the stars leave heaven on high
The sun would burn out before I'd ever lose you
We can get over any wall
If we have to fly, run, climb, or crawl
Love will always lead us back
Where we belong
