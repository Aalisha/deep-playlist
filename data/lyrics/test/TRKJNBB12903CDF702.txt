Being has overwhelmed the space between the silence of eternity
Vision has intruded upon the light that pours through me, my energy
Substance has veiled, the pleasures long lost, the beauty of emptiness
This very flesh confines, and spoils this demon's seed

Waiting to light, A dead sky aflame
To suffocate, to rejoice in your misery
This waiting it seems, for so long I've yearned to see
the burning flesh of your humanity
