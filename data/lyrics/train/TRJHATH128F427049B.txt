Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
Make you want to holler hi-de-ho
Burns your tummy, don'tcha know?
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug

Grape wine in a Mason jar
Homemade and brought to school
By a friend of mine 'n' after class
Me and him and this other fool decide

That we'll drink up what's left
Chug-a-lug, so we helped ourself
First time for everything
Hmm, my ears still ring

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
