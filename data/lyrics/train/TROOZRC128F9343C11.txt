I don't feel comfortable in the emperor's new clothes
I talked of ecstasy, you said 'I'll have one of those
I wouldn't listen, no I wouldn't change my mind
I'll be alright, you'll be fine

Something wrong, there's something wrong
There's something, don't you see
There's nothing wrong, there's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong with me

I talked of politics you were easily led
Even if I know nothing about any government
You wouldn't listen and I wouldn't change my mind
