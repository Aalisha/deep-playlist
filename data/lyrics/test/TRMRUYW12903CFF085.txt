You spend your time in smokey rooms
where haggled old women with cheap perfume say
"it never happens for people like us you know"
well nothing ever happened on it's own
and well the toilets smell of desperation
the streets all echo of aggregation
and you wonder
why you cant get no sleep
when you've got nothing to do,
and you've had nothing to eat
your life's slipping
and sliding right out of view
and there's absolutely nothing
that you can do, well

We'll live and die,
We'll live and die in these towns
Don't let it drag you down
Don't let it drag you down now
