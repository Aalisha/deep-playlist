Hey
You're undercover
My secret lover
You're what I need

My bullet's in the gun (bullet's in the gun)
You're undercover
My secret lover
You're what I need

My bullet's in the gun (bullet's in the gun)
I met you at the club no further comment
I said baby let's go back to your apartment
And girl take off your dress let's make this place a mess

It feels so good, so tell me why should i confess?
You're undercover
My secret lover
You're what I need

My bullet's in the gun (bullet's in the gun)
You're undercover
My secret lover
You're what I need
...
