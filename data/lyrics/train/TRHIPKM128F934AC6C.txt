Savior
Save me from this hell I'm in
Take me
Lead me out and take me in
Make me
Help me try to understand
Hate me
Just because of who I am

Judge you by the clothes you wear
Judge you by the length of hair
Find out not who you are
Take you just for what you are

Shame me
With a name that is not mine
Blame me
