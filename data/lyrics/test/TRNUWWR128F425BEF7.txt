Love of my life
Look deep in my eyes
There you will find what you need

And give me your life
The lust and the lies
And the past you're afraid I might see
You've been running away from me, yeah

You're my beloved lover
I'm yours
And Death shall not part us
It's you I died for
For better or worse
Forever we'll be
My love it unites us and it binds you to me
...
