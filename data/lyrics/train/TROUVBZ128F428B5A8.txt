I get off at three a clock in the morning
That's just how it is and it won't change
Ain't sad enough to tear

You and me were always out there dancing
But i don't get around much anymore

Ain't sad enough to tear
I'll keep the hurt at bay
Ain't sad enough to tear for you
You just left me merely blue
And I'm not sure what's left to say
...
