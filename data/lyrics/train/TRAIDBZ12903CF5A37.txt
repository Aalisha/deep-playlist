Yeah, X-Raided Locc
Back up in this bitch, nigga
I aint dead yet (dead yet)

187 gang related, I'm accused
After every court date my face is on the news
They say I wrote a song about a murder that I committed
Maintain innocence, Nothin but coincidence
I admit, It looks shady from the outside lookin in
Situation is serious, So folks don't comprehend
17 years young back in '92
Facin 25 to life for somethin I didn't do
My song is supposed to be a big admission on my part
And they gon' use the lyrics against me
When my trial gets ready to start
My words being misinterpreted
Nothin but the D.A. tryin to prove premeditated
They got the Raided stuck, Majorly crossed up
The D.A. got a fucked up witness and my lawyer is a drunk
Sittin in the county
It's three years already done went by
Pressuring my homies, tryin to get 'em to testifizzy
Snitching ain't no joke, It's hazardous to your health
Point one finger at me, You're pointing three back at yourself
Homies got convicted of murder in the first degree
And aint no doubt about it, They gone do much worse than me
Take me in the court room, In front of an all white jury
With the family lookin me with barely concealed fury
Lawyer standin next to me, prepared to represent
Help me get convicted cause to him
I'm guilty till proven innocent
