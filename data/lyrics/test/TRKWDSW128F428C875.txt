Sometimes I doubt the path I chose
Sometimes my dreams feel all on hold

There's no doubt that this will make me strong

Because it's the hardest thing I've ever done

Despite this cruel world
And all my best efforts
You surprise me with just how perfect you are

Even with all my flaws
And my bad examples
...
