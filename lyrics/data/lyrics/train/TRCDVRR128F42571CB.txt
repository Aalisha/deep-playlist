Wa-ooh-wa-ooh-why
Wa-ooh-wa-ooh-why
Wa-ooh-wa-ooh-why
Wa-ooh-wa-ooh-why
Look into my history
I can recall the days of slavery
How they treat our ancestors
They treat them so bad
They let them work the plantation
Even plough the earth
They work them and work them
They work them to death
Now they wanna come play the same tricks
On us, no-oh
You ain't gonna play the same tricks
On us, no-oh
A mister wicked - backway
You are vampire - backway
Slave driver - backway
You are vampire, ah-whoy
Wa-ooh-wa-ooh-why
Wa-ooh-wa-ooh-why
Wa-ooh-wa-ooh-why
Wa-ooh-wa-ooh-why
