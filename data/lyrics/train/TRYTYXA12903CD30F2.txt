I've heard the Angels
And I've seen the devil
Fought with the lamb
Sent through the fire

I've been in the valley
When it was dry
Walked thru the desert
To the other side

I'm not a preacher
And I'm not a hero
My life has never
Been that kind

But there is one thing
That I hold on to
I am yours
And lord you are mine

Through all these years
You have been there
Dried all my tears
And answered my prayers
