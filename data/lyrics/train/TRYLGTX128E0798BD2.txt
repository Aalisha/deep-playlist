I am driving
I am late for work
Spilling coffee
Down my whitest shirt
While I'm flossing
And I'm changing lanes
Oh Yeah
Now I'm driving
Through the parking lot
Doing eighty
Hey what the heck why not
Watch it lady
'Cause your in my spot
Once again
It's early to work
And here's a surprise
I got a McMuffin for just 99 cents today
I think they ran a special

CHORUS:
I can't stand still
Can I get a witness
Can you hear me
Anybody, anybody
I think I am running just to catch myself

Maybe someday I could fly away
Go to Key Largo or Montego Bay
Sport my speedo, maybe grab a tan
A dream vacation, wild elation
Now I'm running
Straight into my boss
And he's angry
Oh and he calls me Ross
Which is funny
'Cause that ain't my name
...
