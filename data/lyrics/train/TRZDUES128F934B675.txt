This brings me down
This angry field of soldiers that march in pairs
My heart still beats faster lets synchronize each movement
With every chance we have
Stand towards your enemy knowing your chances

Think twice with your fist closed tight
Angry eyes wonder through rough paths of a hollow souls
That brings me down - Slow emotions rise
Expanding what you've won, hoping for the best
Let your self win your own battle
