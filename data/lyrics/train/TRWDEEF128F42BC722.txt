(Verse1)
Been through so much
Font even know how i made it this far ya'll
But i yes we all made it.

(Verse2)
Even have to cry many nights,
The pillows wet with tears
But i sisters it's amazing how i made it.

(Verse3)
You think you got a friend
Can count on through the thick and thin
But I its amazing how i made it.

(Verse4)
About to give up,
Throw in the towel and call it quits
But I yes we all made it .

(Chorus)
O I Thank God I Made it. Through sunshine and rain heartaches and pain . O I Thank God I Made It. Through Troubles and Trials I stand on his word and fight on .

O I made it
