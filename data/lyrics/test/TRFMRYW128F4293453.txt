Give me all your love
Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love

Love, lo-lo-love
Love, lo-lo-love

Could it be that it's just my love?
There's no use in trying to give up
'Cause if you don't cross my heart
Even when we're far apart,
I'll need you

Wanting all is really not a crime
Though you'll say "too soon", I'll say "it's time"
I'm not trying to be aggressive
But I'm made to be possessive
I want you

Love is blind (love is blind)
