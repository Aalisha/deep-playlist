Breakin' down the fences
Breakin' down the rules
The reason for my heartbeat
The mysteries of woods
I talk to my dream
I hear a voice it was callin'
And I couldn't stop Justine
Cause my wild horse was fallin'
(It's a wish) gimme freedom in my dreams
(What a wish) gimme shelter yes it seems
(Yes it seems) bleeding heartaches ever cry
...
