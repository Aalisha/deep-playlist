I'm a going way to leave you, love
I'm going away for awhile
But I'll return to you sometimes
If I go 10, 000 miles

The storms are on the ocean
The heavens may cease to be
The world may lose its motion, love
If I prove false to thee

Oh, who will dress your pretty little feet
And who will glove your hand
...
