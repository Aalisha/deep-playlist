There’s a million ways and gloried days to take your breath away
But you can’t see what’s taking place
All you know is that the sun will set and the sun will rise
And everything will be alright

There’s a cry in the dark and it comes from way across the world tonight
It’s the sound of a drum that beats alone and knows what is right
And from Tiananmen to Timisoara
Across this land

(And they took the wall away) And they took the wall away
You see step by step it came down again
A chain reaction, a solemn vow
Who in the world can stop this now?

Lift your head to a new day okay
Dawn of the start of a whole new way
Hold on to the meaning of the word
And when you know it’s only gonna be a question of morality
It’s only a heartbeat away

You can call for justice, we’re free to be a part
