Madness fills the air
Easing your bleeding hands
Madness
Madness

Crying tears of pain
Dying in the end
Rescue me
Rescue me
What has bceome of our love
Deep rooted
Feeding my blood
Like a candle
Fading away
It's doomed to death

I can't believe
I'm losing you
This infinite quest led us
Away from our love
Our goal was in sight
Hatred and fears
...
