yea i know
i pissed away a lot of dough

what a waste of time
i spent every dime
not planning for a sound financial future

invested in the good times
you gotta learn to diversify
livin' large on the west side

inside tip
a high yield blue chip
the interest rates will fall
open gutter mall
planning for a sound financial future

invested in the good times
you gotta learn to diversify
