Get aboard the silver bird, departing gate 19.
Satisfy your Walter Mitty mind, tryin' out a dream.
Your sign is capricorn and every corner of your mind,
Says you'll remain my friend, my friend until your mine.

Silver bird, fly my lady away,
Silver bird, take her over the bay,
Silver bird, give my lady a ride,
And let her go see what's on the other side.
