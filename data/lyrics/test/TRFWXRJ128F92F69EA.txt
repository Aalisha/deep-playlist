Curly locks, now that I'm a dreadlocks
Your mama say you shouldn't play with me but it's alright
Curly locks, now that I'm a dreadlocks
Your mama say you shouldn't play with me
The sun is shining, the breeze is a-blowing too
And all I've got inside me is lotsa love for you, it's true
Curly locks, now that I'm a dreadlocks
Your mama say you shouldn't play with me but it's alright
Curly locks, now that I'm a dreadlocks
Your mama say you shouldn't play with me
