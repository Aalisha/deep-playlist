I need to open up my eyes
to see what's in there deep inside
I got to find out for myself
cause there is no one there's no one else

I wait for a thousand years
to see what you would do
I ain't got a thousand years
so what you gonna do

I need to venture out much more
to get much closer the need is pure
I won't regret a moment from this day
the key of life is calling out to stay
...
