Tell me through your beard the USA is weird, Aah
Hide your fears with hats and hang out at your flat, Aah
Don't know what I see but your song sounds good to me, Aah
All I wanna do iz listen to yuz
All I wanna do iz listen to yuz
All I wanna do iz listen to yuz

Now I'm not so alone
Now I'm not so alone
