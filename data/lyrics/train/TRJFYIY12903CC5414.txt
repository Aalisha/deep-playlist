Lately I have been noticing
That this other life
Does not revolve around
A silly war dream
I have been
Living underneath
And everything I'm meant to hear
Is not making sense anymore

Chorus:

Get up on me
Get down on me
I know you'll never claim me

All these years
Spent internally
Trapped under the wheels
Which would only spin
For the outside's needs
All so indiscreet
And then supposedly
All fell incomplete
I began to breathe
And then the grid fell in
...
