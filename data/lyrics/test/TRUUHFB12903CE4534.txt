Matchmaker, Matchmaker,
Make me a match,
Find me a find,
Catch me a catch
Matchmaker, Matchmaker
Look through your book,
And make me a perfect match

Ooh... Matchmaker, Matchmaker,
I'll bring the veil,
You bring the groom,
Slender and pale.
Maybe a ring cause I'm longing to be,
The envy of all I see.

For Papa,
Make him a scholar.
