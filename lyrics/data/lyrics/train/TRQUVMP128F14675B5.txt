What the hell is wrong with you tonight,
I cant seem to say or do the right thing,
Wanted to be sure your feeling right,
Wanted to be sure we want the same thing.

She said,
I can't believe it,
You can't,
Possibly mean it,
Don't we,
All want the same thing,
Don't we,
Well who said anything about love...

No, not love she said,
Dont you know that it's different for girls,
(Don't give me love)
