You say you got to go and find yourself
You say that you're becoming someone else
Don't recognize the face in the mirror looking back at you

You say you're leaving as you look away
I know there's really nothing left to say
Just know I'm here whenever you need me, I'll wait for you

So I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you see what you need to see
When you find you
Come back to me

...
Take your time I won't go anywhere
Picture you with the wind in your hair

I'll keep your things right where you left them, I'll be here for you
And I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you see what you need to see
...
