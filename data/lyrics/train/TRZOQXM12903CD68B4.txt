God knows I've longed to feel something, but now's not the time.
I'm caught up in the heartless disorder of a Friday night.
Focused on staying distracted 'til I lose sight of the tiresome and clinical patterns of my life.
I will cherish this love for the rest of my night.

One day I'll find myself facing the firing line. Serves me right.
For the record, I've written my crimes.
I will cherish this love for the rest of my night.

Lord have mercy on my soul.
I've had a good run, but can't run anymore.
Just put me down.

Can't sidestep the long arm for too long with this paper trail.
