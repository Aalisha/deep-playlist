Howling is a werewolf
howling on the moon
a whispering in darkness
in my body bloody cool
a london after midnight
a castle of the death
a black house on the black hill
rising hollow an now

London after midnight
london after death
london after midnight
castle of the death

London after midnight
london after death
london after midnight
castle of the death

Come on, come on, come on, come on
...
