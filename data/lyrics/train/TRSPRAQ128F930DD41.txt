On the dark nights by the fire light
I see her face before my eyes

Lady Rose, Lady Rose
Oh Lady
My Rose
My Lady Rose

From the shadows through the bright lights
From the dark nights through the sun light

Lady Rose, Lady Rose
Oh Lady
My Rose
My Lady Rose

Lost in mem'ries of the moment
Of the time spent how the days went

Lady Rose, Lady Rose
Oh Lady
