Like the knife of a thief that's held close to the throat
I'm threatened by you and the cruel way you gloat
You once turned me on, now all it seems so remote
You broke me in pieces, you cherished each blow;
The harder you hit me, the stronger I grow
I'll leave you tomorrow, take my pride and I'll go

You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul
I've had all I can take
I'm leaving tomorrow
I'm leaving tomorrow
