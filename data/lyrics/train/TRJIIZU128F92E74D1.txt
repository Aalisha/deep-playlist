I can make you a believer in fate
Divine intervention and signs of the sun
You came to me not a moment too late
With death at my door and time on the run

And destiny surrounds you
But now that I've found you
I'm never gonna let you go
I'd be lost without you now
I'm never gonna let you go
You're the one sure thing I've found
So you better stick around
