On a lonsome evening, when rain turns pavement black
I put you on a train, I'd never see you back againÂ…

CHORUS
'cause you were leaving, I couldn't fathom why
And the moon was a slice of lemon in a gin and tonic sky
Gin and tonic sky

Well I put you on a train, you should have heard the engines laughter
Sayin' "I'm takin' her away and don't come running after"
You gave me one last cold kiss, colder than steel
...
