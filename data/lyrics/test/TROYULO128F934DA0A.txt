Baby I need you to come over
Yeah
I mean I need you tonight
I need you to handle your business
It's been a minute
N I'm good n ready

[Chorus:]
Kiss all over your body baby
Touch you where you like
I wanna lay you down close the door
Give you what your yearning for
[x2]

I'm missin you cuz I cant forget
When I'm kissin you how it makes me feel
Inside I'm longin for your touch tonight baby
I'm feelin strong n I'm holdin on
Baby don't be long bring that lovin on
Tonight
Something just came over me
