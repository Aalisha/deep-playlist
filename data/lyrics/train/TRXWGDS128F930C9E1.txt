In your soul time when you're closing down
Shadow sun
Divine sleep of death
Divine sleep of death

I am, babe, standing still
In the blackest rain
Denying you
Breaking day

In the name of nothing
When we break apart
I'll raise the dead
The chain of lies

I'm ever freezing over
Crystal mountain clay
Cloud of darkness
...
