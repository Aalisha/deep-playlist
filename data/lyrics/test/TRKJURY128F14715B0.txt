I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
I have tried, I have tried
I have tried, I have tried

I can't get me no, ha, ha
I can't get no, uh, now

When I'm driving in my car
And the man talks on the radio
Keep tellin' me more and more
About that useless information
He's tryin' to mess up my imagination

And I can't get me no, no, no
And I can't get me no
Hey, hey, hey, what I say
