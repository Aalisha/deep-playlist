Tears, tears at the waters edge
Hey little sister give us laughter instead
Tears for the teacher, from the eyes, for her soul
This restless spirit takes a long way back home
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper I hear you, so talk to me
Oh, I believe, aye do aye
Say brother sisters, see your brothers in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's only glory from the story untold
