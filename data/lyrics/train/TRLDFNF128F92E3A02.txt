No matter how far, I'll find a way.
The vastness of space won't slow my pace.
I don't care what they say.
You'll be mine. It's a matter of time.
Just wait and see. It's just you and me and all of infinity...

It might not make sense, but what ever does?
People do terrible things for the ones that they love.
It might not be safe, but I still have to try.
I found a love so right I could die tonight and that would be fine.
