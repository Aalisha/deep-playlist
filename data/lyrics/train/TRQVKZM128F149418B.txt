She has a place where she keeps her space neat
In a tiny room where she never sleeps
And she doesnt't go there very often, but dreams of it nightly
It holds tightly to her glass
These feelings always pass

The skys are not clear for Calamity Jane
Everyone feels her pain

Silly to hide it will get you again
And no one is to blame
It's just the way
...
