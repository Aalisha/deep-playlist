I see your momma and the candles and the tears and roses
I see your daddy walk his daughter down the isle
I feel my knees start to tremble as I tell the preacher
Don? t she look beautiful tonight

All the wonderful words in my head I? ve been thinking
You know I wanna say? em all just right
I lift your veil and angels start singing
Such a heavenly sign, yeah

Lost in this moment with you
I am completely consumed
My feeling's so absolute
There? s no doubt

Sealing our love with a kiss
Waited my whole life for this
Watching all my dreams come true
Lost in this moment with you

I smell the jasmine floating through the air like a love song
