Travel the world
Don't you come run away
From the person you are in your heart
You can be who you want to be
Make us believe in you
Keep all your light in the dark
Be searching for truth
You must look in the mirror
And make sense what you can see

Just be
Just be

They say learning to love yourself
Is the first step that you take
When you want to be real
Flying on planes to exotic locations
Won't teach you how you really feel
