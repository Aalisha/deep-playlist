Feeling alone, kicked out at fifteen
Father oh... where am I going to sleep
I had a home now hungry tired, filthy
You had a son and walked away from me

Met your new wife
Start your new life
You got no more time busy
From house to house I sleep on the couch
Whoever has room for me

Being a man comes with a price tag
What happened dad you walked out left for dead
Negative thoughts became reality
Having a child should not be so easy
