Life, life, life

It's the city of jackers, swindlers, pimps and hoes
And niggas that bang and slang in kilo's
Where the rule is 'Fool, we don't play that'
Bomb to your motherfuckin' lip, watch it get fat

4 deep in a car on a mission
Load up the glock and watch it start spittin'
Nobody understands the gang mentality
I don't give a fuck, just want to see some casualties

And we'll beat your ass down with the quickness
Busters know that they can't get with this
Put the sweat down on a fool at the bus stop
Wrong set, wrong move, get smoothed popped

Gots to make our money on the corner
Try to squeeze, nigga please, a straight goner
Survival of the fittest with a gun or a knife
Geah 'cause it's Compton 4 life

Hey man, what's up, nigga? This [Incomprehensible]
Compton, Compton
Hey man, what's up, nigga? This [Incomprehensible]
Compton
(Life, life, life, life)
