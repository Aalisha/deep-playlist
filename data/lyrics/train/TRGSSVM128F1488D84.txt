Amazing, felt like I was caged in
Wrote a rhyme and started blazing
Turn the page and you'll feel my raging
Thunder when my foot hits the pavement

Maxed out, grabbed the mic and blacked out
Punks spot the yang and backed out
Took the back route, rap up on them with the get out
They looked at me and passed out

Hungry, so it's gonna get ugly
I'm feeling like nobody loves me
Funky and I'm a microphone junky
...
