When we met
The sparkle in your eyes
Showed me
We were meant to be
In love
Sharing our fantasies

You touched me
Then we kissed
I could not believe
That love was so strong
It didn't take too long
To learn

Love will go on and on
Love's an everlasting bond

When I'm next to you
Our love flows through
I can't explain
What you do?
When I'm next to you
I feel brand new
I love you for
All the things you do
...
