Nothing to see, nothing to hear
Nothing to be, nothing to fear
Nothing to prove, nothing to say
Nothing to loose, nothing to gain

Nothing to feel, nothing to hate
Nothing is real, it's all too late
What do you do when nothing's wrong?
Ain't got a clue, ain't got no sub

Yeah I'm foaming at the mouth
Yeah I'm mad without a doubt
'Cause I'm really freaking out
And I'm going out of my mind
TV got me going blind
