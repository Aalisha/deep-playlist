The world is full of fools
Who never quite get it right
You don't know what to do
So you do anything you like

(Put your foot down and drive)
Oh you're a silly thing
(Put your foot down and drive)
You're such a pretty thing
(Put your foot down and drive)

You're never going to be like all those fools
You're coming out tonight
There's nothing to lose
You're going to give it all a try

Don't ever change
Don't ever change (never change)
No never change (never change)
Never change (don't ever change)
