Alright now

My mama warned me about boys like you
It's the reason I wear these high heel boots, yeah
And let me give you a little piece of advice
My papa packs heat and he won't think twice, yeah

Well, why do you think they call me Jessie James?
Too much trouble, better stay away
Grab your hat, better get gone
But if you stay you've been warned

I'm a bullet and I'm headed straight for your heart, yeah
Be careful what you start
I'm a bullet and I'm headed straight for your heart, yeah
It's gonna leave a mark

Be careful what you wish for, you get what you see
Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
I'm a bullet and I'm headed straight for your heart, yeah
