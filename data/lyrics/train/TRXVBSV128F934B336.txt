Little soldier, plastic pistol
aiming for the head.
Now you see me, now you don't.
You missed me, you're dead.
Laughing, hiding in the bushes,
scatter for your life.
Little soldier tripped and fell,
get him with your knife.

Electric eye is loaded,
it shows them it's okay to kill.
They eventually will.

Mother calls you in for lunch,
put the war on hold.
Too rough to play with other kids,
how many times you've been told.
Laugh at pain it's silly.
He'd make the soldiers bleed.
