The way you make me feel...
The way you make me feel...
The way you make me feel...
The way you make me feel...

Mocking bird in the sky
Let me know if the sun will shine
Spread your wings, draw a line so gray
So I'll know my love will stay

Mocking bird in the sky so high
Let me know if the wind will blow
Spread your wings, draw a line so blue
That I'll know my love is true

'Cause thats just
The way you make me feel
...
