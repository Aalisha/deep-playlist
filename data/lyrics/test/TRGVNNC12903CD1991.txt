(Sylvester Stewart)

Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the thinker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
I am everyday people, yeah

There is a blue one, who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo
We got to live together
