Everybody's watching, none of them I've ever met
Starring in the headlines no good news is death
Threats fly through the airmail, e-mail and express
Fax instructions for the bomb
A bone breaking game of chess

Starved and banged what a way to go
Slit wristed, run over and hanged
What a way to go

Pushed too far by numbers
Payments way past due
Additional tack on late charge
Who'll be screwing who
...
