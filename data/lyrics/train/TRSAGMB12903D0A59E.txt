Rock my heart
Rock my heart
Rock my heart
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
(oh oh oh oh)

Celebrate, celebrate fatality
Free your mind, do just what you want to
You and I celebrate a special love
That is why I wanna be with you

(chorus)
Rock my heart, when we come together
We'll make it better every day, yeah
Rock my heart, when we come together
We'll make it better every day
Rock my heart (oh oh, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
