Lover power, 
Talking about love power, 
Talking about love power, 
Talking about love power, 
Come on, put your hands together, yeah.

Oh yeah, yeah.
Alright now.
Yeah. Awww... 

Lemme tell you about this love power.
Talkin' about that love power.
Lemme tell you about the love power.
Gotta tell ya about this love power

Talking about that thing yea
have you walking the street late at night
Talking about that thing yea
that sometime make wrong seem right
Talking about that good ole feeling
