You've been living awhile in the front of my skull, making orders. You've been writing me rules, shrinking maps, redrawing borders. Ive been repeating your speeches but the audience just doesn't follow. Because I'm leaving out words, punctuation and it sounds pretty hollow. Ive been living in bed because now you tell me to sleep. Ive been hiding my voice and my face and you decide when I eat. In your dreams I'm a criminal, horrible, sleeping around. While you're awake, I'm impossible, constantly letting you down.
