Little girl with your mother gone, so afraid nobody to tell
She's going through changes
Treating him don't mean a thing he don't trust you girl
He's going through changes yeah
When you're all alone nobody to lean on don't think so heavy
You're going through changes baby

It's just a little love, just a little hope
To fall down beside of you, and man you're flying
Just a little love, when a far wind blows, just to pick you up
Man you're flying, say yeah
You're flying yeah

Damn the world says the man who can't see his own kid
