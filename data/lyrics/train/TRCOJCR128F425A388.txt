It's a little past supper time
I'm still out on the porch steps sittin' on my behind
Waiting for you.
Wondrin' if everything's alright
Moma said,"Come in boy, don't waste your time,"
I said,"I've got time. Well he'll be here soon."
Five years old and talkin' to myself.
Where were you? Where'd ya go? Daddy can't you tell?
