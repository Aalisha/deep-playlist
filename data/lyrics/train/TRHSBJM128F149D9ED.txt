Here's a health to you, bonnie Kellswater
For its there you'll find the pleasures of life
And its there you'll find a fishing and farming
And a bonnie wee girl for your wife

On the hills and the glens and the valleys
Grows the softest of women so fine
And the flowers are all dripping with honey
...
