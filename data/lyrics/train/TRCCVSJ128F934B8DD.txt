Don't let your white dress wear you out
Oh it hurts to look in your eyes
'Cause honey I can see him

All my life
I'd hurt the ones I'd loved
Oh but baby you can turn it round

She don't love me like you
She don't know what you do
And it's so hard
She don't care what you say
So just say it, say it anyway
It's so hard

All my life, they tried to push me down
Oh but baby you can turn it round
Oh but honey I still see him

Don't let your friends tell you why
'Cause I'm a bad, bad, bad
I'm the one
Oh but baby you can turn it on
