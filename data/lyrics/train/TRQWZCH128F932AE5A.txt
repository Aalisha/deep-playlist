The man I've got loves cleaned up home and he likes to wear the breeches
He don't like doin' women things like washin' clothes and dishes
You'll find he's not that hard to please if you love him right and fill his needs
To make a man feel like a man you gotta show him you're a woman

Show him what you are you know you can do it
