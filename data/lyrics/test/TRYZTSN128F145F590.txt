If I could right the wrongs

The past iust wouldn't be.
How could I fall in love at zero gravity?

And if I did make you love me

Will you make me belong?
And I'm waiting for the time
Like the calm before the storm.

Oh no
You're not free to fall
Free to fall

Oh no
You're not
Not free to fall
Oh no
Oh no.
