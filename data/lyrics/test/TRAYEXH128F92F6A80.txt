All the myths on sunday (x3)

Oh. i am a humble man thankful for my rights and inheritance due
How about you?
And i wan't to stay in sight of things that i believe in
And i know to be true, the sweet sweet truth
I wouldn't question letters of authority,
Yeah i keep the bedroom cold to save energy,
'cos it's good for me

And as long as there's something for me
And long as the world swings my way
I don't have any complaints
...
