Up in the attic where the skeletons hide
We all live in fear of the door and what's behind
A door you dare not open, 'cause what you'll find
A close encounter of the sexual kind
Love in the shadows, like a smoking gun

Batten down baby, lock all doors, you got the love that I'm coming for
Your hair's so straight, I can make it curl
There's a little bit of bad in every good little girl
Love in the shadows, like a smoking gun

Is it really what you want, one more broken heart, one more lost and lonely
Is it really what you need, another broken heart
