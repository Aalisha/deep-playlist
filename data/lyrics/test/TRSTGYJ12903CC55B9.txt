Where do I sleep tonight?
Where did I leave my mind?
I'll end up on the floor
And these words will do just fine.

I remember the nights spent up on rooftops.
I remember bike rides in the rain.
We spray painted all their signs to what we wanted them to say.
But we got so far away.
It was a matter of time
Between the age that we left reason
And the day we chose to leave it.
I'd rather stop the beat then
