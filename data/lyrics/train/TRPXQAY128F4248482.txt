Compensation: a self-induced coma
repetition of an error camouflaged with love
the end is a ship that never wants to leave the quay...
grotesque!
when soul reclaims new drugs to blind the risk to find yourself
the end is a ship that never wants to leave the quay...

it starts again the game for fools!
