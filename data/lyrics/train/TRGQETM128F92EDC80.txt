It feels so good it's so intense
I wish that this would never end
Eternity starts here and now
I wanna hold it but I don't know how

It's so warm, I know it heals
All the joy which it reveals
Eternity starts here and now
I wanna hold it but I don't know
I'll keep my peace, so be at ease

It feels so great, it breaks away
From scars and insecure barriers
I wish I could stay here
To keep this peace, to be at ease
...
