Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead
you just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head
or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book
when you were at school?

When you think about death do you lose your breath
or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope
do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light
