the beating is of my heart alive again.
faint sound so frightening, yet so compelling.
eyes collided, two hearts decided.
this isnt the end it has only started.
two hearts can beat as one, one beat is not enough.
a line was drawn to never be crossed.
her cardiac arrest is both of our lives lost.
i etched forever in your eyes.
but forever will always end in time.

a bitter collapse to my knees.
with this bitter kiss.
this shame now feeds sympathy.
accept your words were severed.
tears soaked into each page.
you will unwrite this novel.
