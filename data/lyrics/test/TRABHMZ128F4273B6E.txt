Close my eyes
Evening dies
My friend rise up to the sunrise
Brand new day
New chance
Some say
If I can make a difference
In this world
Then I may
So I must
So I trust
All my lyrics just bust
Into this new day
Like I was busting a nut
Ohh feels so good
Rising up the "mornin-ornin" (morning)
I just got on the radio
It's a positive moment
It's something like
Just the perfect moon
Sonic waves glaze
For days
In the sunlight haze
I feel good to be alive
All the shit that beat me down
Been doing this
I still survive
It ain't at all complicated
I'm glad I found ya
It's when you open your heart
That love surrounds you

Mmmmmm yeah baby
Mmmmmm aint that rightâ€¦.
