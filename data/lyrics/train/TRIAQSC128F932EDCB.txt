Wish I knew
Why I'm so in love with you
No one else in this world will do
Darling please save your love
For me
Mmmm run away
If I were wise I'd run away
But like a fool in love I stay
And pray you'll save your love
For me
I can feel it
Even when you're not here
Can't conceal it
I really love you my dear
Though I know no good
Can come from loving you
I can't do a thing
I'm so in love with you
