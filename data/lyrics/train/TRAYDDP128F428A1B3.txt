Many places I've been
Many faces I've seen
But I still haven't found any place in this world
Where a man can say he is free

Many people I've known
Many seeds that I've sown
But I still haven't found any place in this world
Where a man can call his own

So I'm walking on...

Walking on, walking on, walking on and on
No I still haven't found any place in this world
And I wish I was walking home

Many times that I've wondered
