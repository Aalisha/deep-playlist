So if we're good, this means of course,
That things can only go wrong.
And what's that, like, the law of averages?
It's like a natural rhythm, and we knew it all along.

But does that make it better?
This awareness, will it set our minds at ease tonight?
If we accept it, does that make it alright? will that make it better?
If we allow it, do you think we'll get some sleep tonight?
We should face it, that will make it all right.
