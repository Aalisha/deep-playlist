[U-God]
Brand new magnetic Killah Hill scorches
Monster talk bosses, spank 'em, step into my office
Crunch time steroid big boy itches
Eyes that lay for blood money riches
Switches thug men gunmen dirty lung sticker
Arch-crime Hitler, lurking with the lifter
Shift the man vs. man heavy on the hands
Chef in the kitchen cooking love love.slam!
Blow out the stash; keep the bundle in the bush and the trash
D-up, burn brother for the real.fast
Terrible lung split frame for reala
One-man go low hit man guerilla
Whispering there something of a thriller, killer
Drift, dirty fiend snore, scratch and sniff
Dirty tombs diggin' you and my duty
Rudy, mighty rap now toss another beauty
Truly yours Golden Arms New York native
Talk, shankin' my mouth now gangsta walk
