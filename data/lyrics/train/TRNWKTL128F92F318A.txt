Your butt is mine
Gonna take you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how i feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Come on, come on,
Lay it on me all right

I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's
The limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have
Seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad-
Come on
(bad bad-really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad-
You know it
(bad bad-really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad-
Come on, you know
(bad bad-really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
Just to tell you once again,
Who's bad . . .

The word is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long,
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna take you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight,
Your talk is cheap
