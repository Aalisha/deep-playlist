To be with you
I would risk a thousand lifetimes
To be with you
There's no mountain that I wouldn't climb
If you're the sky
Let me be the cloud that runs right through you now
You don't know just how I need to

Be with you there can be no substitute
To be with you
I've tried to hide my passion but it's
Just no use
Piece by piece I lose it when you
Walk in the room
How can I get through
...
