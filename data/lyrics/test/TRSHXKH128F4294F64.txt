Well, I'm savin' this dress for my wedding day
Momma wouldn't have it any other way
She says, when she married, her waist was twenty three
I guess, I'll never wear it anyway

I don't believe I care to marry
Though I cannot explain exactly why
It somehow seems to me, matrimony is misery
Simply a faster way to die
