Slave driver I know you want no part of me
Slave driver won't you open up your heart to me
Slave driver why do you look right through me
Maybe if you don't you could never use me
Well i'm sailing away
The sun shining bright in the sky and i'm free when i close my eyes
Help me wash away my sorrows, help me drown out my pain

One brother lost and another one found
One man killed and another one drowned
Slave driver drink my blood
