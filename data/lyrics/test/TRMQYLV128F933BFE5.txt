Nitrogen Pink and a whole load of Wednesdays
They're these sweet rotting memories
That keep you alive
Nitrogen Pink please
Throw me a moment just to
Get my composure and to
Stamp on a fly

And the boys had they're pearls
And the girls had to backs
And everybody was laughing at you
Singing isn't it, isn't it, isn't it
Such a funny old world the way tragedy strikes

Nitrogen Pink and a whole load of Wednesdays
They're these sweet rotting memories
That keep you alive
Nitrogen Pink please throw me a moment just to
Get my composure and to stamp on a fly
...
