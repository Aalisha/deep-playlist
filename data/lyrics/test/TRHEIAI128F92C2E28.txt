T Shirt
Talk: Hey Baby, I wish you could see what I have on right now
You so sexy Imagine how intense it would be to hold me right now
Our songs playin
Verse 1
At night when your far and I'm alone I feel the fabric from your T-Shirt flowing through body I can still hear your bearing tone and now you telling me you'll take it slow and I was in the mirror playin role like you were here I couldn't turn me on so I fell asleep with music on woke up lookin hearing the same old song playin.
Hook: Aww Give it to me deeper
Aww givin me the viva
Aww now you got my feet up this one is a keeper now the second verse is playin
Aww wont we try to stand up
Aww hold me with my hands up
Aww then the music gets us and the scenes were shattered I'm thinkin ti myself again
Course:
When your not hear(I sleep in ya T- Shirt)
I wish you were here(To take off ya T- Shirt)
After we make love(I sleep in ya T-Shirt wake up in ya T-Shirt to smell the scent of your colone)
I need your feel(I sleep in ya T- Shirt)
BoyI need your help(To take off ya T- Shirt)
