I comes from a city where they love to hate, especially on that Triple Six
They see we really got Bentley's and Benz's and they hate the shit
They try to come up over us, the radio even help 'em at it
But yall ain't got no flows, so hang it up you silly rabbits

I'ma keep on hurtin' you boys, by makin' this motherfuckin' world rock
Side to fuckin' silence bitch for years and man we still ain't stop
We still ridin' clean, makin' cheese and carryin' plastic glocks
And please don't try to test us 'cuz you know we'll let these bitches pop

On you hoes, you haters, you niggaz really like us
'Cuz if you thank us, then you wouldn't try to sound so much like us
I'm the KING of that MPHMS
HCP, to the END, others gone be less

Come prepared, man I swear they wanna be down with my team
Don't let the shit talkin' on them CD's fool you
That ain't what they really mean
The truth can hurt so bad so look in they faces when you play us
And watch how they look, and watch they jaw drop to the pavement

Why y'all testin' my gangsta?
These bitches testin' my gangsta
Why y'all testin' my gangsta?
These bitches testin' my gangsta

Why y'all testin' my gangsta?
These bitches testin' my gangsta
Why y'all testin' my gangsta?
These bitches testin' my gangsta

Why y'all testin' my gangsta?
('Cuz it's on now)
These bitches testin' my gangsta
(Nigga, yeah, it's on now)
Why y'all testin' my gangsta?
('Cuz it's on now)
These bitches testin' my gangsta
(Nigga, yeah, it's on now)

Why y'all testin' my gangsta?
('Cuz it's on now)
These bitches testin' my gangsta
(Nigga, yeah, it's on now)
Why y'all testin' my gangsta?
('Cuz it's on now)
These bitches testin' my gangsta
