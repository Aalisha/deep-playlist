All the old walls are tumbling down
Bringing us freedom for moving around
Coming and going, doing no wrong
Dancing and singing to the gypsy song

I want to sing in Riga, Krakow and Prague
Me and my guitar, and a little Irish flag
Ljubljana sounds like a city of grace
They tell me Budapest is a beautiful place
