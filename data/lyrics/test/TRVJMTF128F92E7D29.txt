The first time I saw you
You were selling hot dogs and stealing your mom's VCR
You sold your Nintendo for a shitty drum set
That you sold for a shittier car

You'd come sell us weed or you'd just watch TV
And she'd sit in the Chevy and wait

The last time I saw you
You worked the the Lakeview with that guy with those bad tattoos
