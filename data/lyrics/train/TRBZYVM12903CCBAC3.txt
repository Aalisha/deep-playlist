People get ready
It's time to show what you got
Players take your places
There's only one way to the top

You must feel the victory
Release that energy
And ride like the wind
With fire in your eyes
Shake those butterflies
And do the best you can

Victory (sweet) victory
Let the party begin
Victory (sweet) victory
Let's do it again

You are the best
You seem to stand out from the rest
Ooh, your intentions
To be more than a honorable mention
...
