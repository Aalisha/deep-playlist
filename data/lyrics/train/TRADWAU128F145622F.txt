Long summer days, I keep thinking
What to do with my time
So many ways, I keep sinking
What's to do with my time?

Take me back, I don't mind
Take me back, I've got time
Take me back, and let me start again

Time hurries by, I keep thinking
What's to do in our time
Don't let it by, just keep thinking
What's to do in our time?
