Love was your hero
Why did you let it go?
Face of the week
It was TV Times
You've got your life
And I've got mine, so you say

Fame goes to your head
Pictures above every boy's bed
You don't answer the 'phone anymore
In case it's the public
Oh, what a bore they can be!

Love is the ballet where the dancer falls
