Looking into me
Too many different choices
Too many different voices
Telling me what to do

Feeling find again
So many words and faces
So many sounds and noises
Where do they lead
Where do they lead
Where do they lead

Before the summertime
I'm gonna clear my mind
I'm feeling fine

Before the summertime
I'm gonna clear my mind
