Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
There you are lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them

My father told me, son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
You're not the only one
Although my Grandma used to say
That he used to sing

Darlin' hold me in your arms
The way you did last night
And we'll lie inside
A little while here oh

I could look into your eyes
Until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped In light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine
And slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
...
