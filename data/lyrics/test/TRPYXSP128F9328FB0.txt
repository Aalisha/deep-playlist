Would you believe me if I told the reasons why
You can't rest, and drink yourself to sleep at night?
Now, like it matters, you can't escape, don't even try
We speak what no one knows

(Oh, I've got to get to sleep)

You lie awake and you hope it's all in your head
You're counting teeth with your tongue, are they all there?
There's no relief in the dark from what isn't there
But you don't feel alone

We are the ones you should be fearing
Coming in the night and take your teeth away
