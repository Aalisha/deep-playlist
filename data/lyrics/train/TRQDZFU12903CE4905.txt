He’s picking up daisies that you left in your front yard
The postman delivered but your words were still too far
You know he wanted it, he really really wanted it oh so bad
But he always wants what he know that he can’t have

I’m not writing this love song for two
I never made it one of my big to do’s no no.
I’m not writing this love song for two
I’m not writing this love song for you.
