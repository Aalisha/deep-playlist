Well twirl my turban, man alive
Here comes Mister Five by Five
He's one of those big, fat, bouncin' boys
Solid avoirdupois

He's five feet tall and he's five feet wide
He don't measure no more from head to toe
Than he do from side to side

Got fifteen chins and a line of jive
He's a mellow old cat, a real hep fat
He be Mister Five by Five
