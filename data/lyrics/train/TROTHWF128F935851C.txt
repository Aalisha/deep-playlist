"Hey, ain't life wonderful? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful... Isn't everything wonderful now?"
I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are good
open my eyes and I count ten

Hope it's over when I space them
I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten

Make everything be wonderful again
I
Would figure out why they get so mad
I hear them scream

I hear them fight
They say bad words that make me wanna cry
I close my eyes when I go to bed
And I dream of angels that make me smile

I feel better when I hear them say
"Everything will be wonderful someday"
Promises mean everything
When you're little and the world's so big
I just don't understand how
