Just stay the night
And well see that things can work out
And this will last forever
How long can we wait for things to change
And this will last forever

Every day, this I say
Turn to dust and fade away
This will last forever

Every day, this I say
Turn to dust and fade away
This will last forever

Still waiting for tomorrow
