Jesus Lord, my best love Thou art,
Thou hast fully captured my heart;
There is none in heav'n nor on earth like Thee,
With Thy beauty none can compete.

When Thy voice first came to my ear,
Whisp'ring in my heart words most dear,
All past loves and aims lost their charm for me,
All my boasts so vain now appear.

Throughout all the world, who compares with Thee?
Who so full of worth, who so fair and sweet?
Only Thou art worthy my love to win,
...
