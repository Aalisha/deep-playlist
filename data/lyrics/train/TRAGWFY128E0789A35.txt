And so this is Xmas
And what have you done?
Another year older
A new one just begun

And so this is Xmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A merry, Merry Xmas
And a Happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fears

And so this is Xmas
For weak and for strong
The rich and the poor ones
The road is so long
