In and out and out and in
And up and down and all around
We're goin' through it nothing to it
All you've got to do is do it
Goin' through the motions, 1, 2, 3, 4

I go you go you go me go
Everywhere that we go we'll be
Goin' through the motions, 1, 2, 3, 4
1, 2

Goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions

I don't really care 'cause you're goin' nowhere
You've got nothing but fear in your eyes
You're leading me on but you can be anyone
'Cause I know you'll be gone when I rise

And we're goin' through the motions
And we're goin' through the motions
Yeah, we're goin' through the motions
Goin' through the motions

Staying with you gave us something to do
I always thought it was true for a while
