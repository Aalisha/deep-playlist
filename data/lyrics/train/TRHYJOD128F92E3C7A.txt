Put off the mail and I left on a light and I
Locked up the house and I jumped on a flight and I'm
Still by myself but I'm thinking more clear
If I'm gonna be down, gonna be down, way down here

Where no one will ask 'cause nobody knows
That you're not in my life anymore
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears

Nor the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves
Ain't gonna wash your memory away
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier
...
