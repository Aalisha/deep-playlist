He said you're just as boring as everyone else
When you tut and you moan and you squeal and you squelch
He said you're just as boring as everyone else
Nothing ever happens

Things replace things
Days replace days
Things replace things

She said I'm gonna use my teeth and my claws
She said I'm gonna use my teeth and my claws
She said I'm gonna use my teeth and my breasts
I'm gonna make it happen
She said

(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
And you cannot run or ever, ever escape
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
You cannot run or ever hide it away
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
Something glorious is about to happen
(Run, run, run, run, run, run)
The reckoning
...
