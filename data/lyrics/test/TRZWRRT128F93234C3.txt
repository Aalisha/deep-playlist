He doesn't wanna stay in
Yeah he's gotta go out
Cos he's gotta be part of the in crowd
Takes a big deep breath
He sticks his chest right out
Yeah he's gotta be part of the in crowd

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh repeated)

Little Big Man
Yeah, you Little Big Man
Little Big Man
Yeah, you Little Big Man
Little Big Man
Yeah, you Little Big Man
Little Big Man
Yeah, you Little Big Man

He's gonna earn some cash
He's gonna sell some weed
