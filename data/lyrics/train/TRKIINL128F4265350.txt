"Coming Back For You"

Looking at the same sky that we used to lay under
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us?
When you close your eyes, do you see me love
Am I keeping you awake
What you scared about are you giving up
When you know you know you know

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl, don't you worry girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry girl, I'll be back for you

So you better wait up keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Givin' that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you
