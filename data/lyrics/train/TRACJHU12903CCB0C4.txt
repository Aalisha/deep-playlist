Some bits of snow still hanging in the air, but that's outside
Take off your clothes and lie down over there, oh that's just right
I sat by this window and just watched for you. No you weren't late
There was a thousand things I had to do, they can all wait

You don't take away my hand, like you ought to
You've become my family
I don't want to understand why I need you
You've just become my family

I lay down there and watched you getting dressed. It's still so clear
