Lead Vocal by Greg

Well, these late night conversations
Leave a strange taste,
Like french cigarettes.
And these coloured drinks
that you keep on throwin' at me
Just keep on reminding me
I came to forget.

So now every night
You insist on reminding me
Of my lost possibilities
And the stains on the wall.
Well, I don't mean to complain
...
