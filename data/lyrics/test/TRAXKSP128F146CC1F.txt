Rats they run across the field
Crows rest in the tree
Barking madly at each other
Standing from the rooftop I screamed
Won't you bark for me?
As you turn your back and fly away

Caught on the fence you left behind
Darted to an empty room I've tried
Oh I've tried, oh I've tririede
With nothing in return
