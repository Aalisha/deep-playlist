All winter long while I was locked in my room
Your face at the window and my hair on the floor
I was thinking of

All winter long while I was locked in my room
Your face at the window and my hair on the floor
I was thinking of you

The phone rang all night long to tell me I was wrong
And I watched while the officer wrote all their ages down

Strange things happen when you're not around
