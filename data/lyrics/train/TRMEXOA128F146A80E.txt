You smile to sweeten what you're saying,
But you wound with your words so fine,
We all get the lives that we deserve what?,
You're cruel to my kind,
Do you think that I've got no feelings,
left to hurt inside,
You aim is high and you don't miss much,
but my eyes are open wide

If I'm gonna have to push the boat out, 
to meet that tidal wave,
I'm gonna need more than a moment, 
to find a face that's brave, 
and if I'm looking in the desert, 
to find the blazing flowers,
I'm gonna need more than a minute,
more like twenty four hours,

Run that by me one more time,
I gotta have a chance to recover,
run that by me one more time,
I gotta have a chance,
run that by me one more time,
before you blow my mind and my cover,
run that by me one more time, 
cos I'm strong enough,
