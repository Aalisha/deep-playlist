Pinch your cheeks so flush with light
leaves little dents so ill-defined
A finger bound in knots of twine
To ground the things that slip your mind

Pale your wrist stays, blue on white to
Match the shapes beneath your eyes you
Fake it through those trying times and
All that's left are laughter lines
...
