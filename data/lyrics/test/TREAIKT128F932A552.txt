Today could be the day you might make a change
Lock yourself indoors and plan a getaway
Take a walk outside in the heavy weather
The British summer time's just great, whatever

Join a local gang and get a cool nickname
Make your lifelong sweetheart your ball and chain
Convert yourself belief for a new religion
Or leave the TV on, make a decision when you're

Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else
Waiting for the day you're not looking
For something else, for something else

Go put your last five Pounds on the lottery
If you're not in it to win it, well, then you won't receive
