Snowgoons... one two
Heheahahaha, uhh
Yeah? Yeah...

Yo, feast your eyes, two double oh-five
While two double oh-six is here
My energy be for all to accept and hear
I'm not ashamed for the ten years plus in that game, won't ain
O.C., speak my mind cause I ain't no lame
Never defendin, creates my own lane
Long live the saga, with a clear slate clear head these days
Works for hire, possible if I'm prepaid
Welcome me back, give a toast to my libido flow
Similar to sex spurnt from my urethra
Friction, give off heat like a fever
Good lucks for those who wish, I don't need it
Much to my amazement, or should I say that I'm not surprised
I still reside in the basement
Wits and charm is what bless this tongue
Along with the mindstate for me to write these songs
Uhh

No pain, no gain, no guts, no glory
