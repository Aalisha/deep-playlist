You can't get it back
You can't get it back
You can't (can't) get (get) it (it) back (back)
You can't (can't) get (get) it (it) back

Verse 1 when we begun
You know you had a sister all sprung, with ya tongue
I thought you were my baby Now
When we lay-ed, you always knew the right words to say
We got engaged to be married the very next May

As the time moved on
The love we had got torn
You used to love me from dusk to dawn
But now you tripping from night til morn
Now you wanna change
I'm sick of you playing these games
I'm telling you one thing
You ain't getting it back you ain't getting back this ring

Chorus
