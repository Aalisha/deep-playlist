Spectral look in your eyes, you caress my skin
Everyone in disguise to hide from the sin
Go on, inhibitions all gone
In the hope of carnal fruition we swan
In the hall of the masquerade ball
We're finally free 'cause of the mask and the shawl

Like phantoms we dance on and on
Fed upon a desire with no conditions

Time to doff your attire
Wear the mask and release the fire
That's been smothered by the rules
Made up by charlatans and fools
...
