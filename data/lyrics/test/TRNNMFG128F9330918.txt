Just a mother and sons living under the gun
Bruises on their backs were just another
Sign of the push & the shove & the lack of the love
On the side of the tracks that they were brought up
Now they're speaking it out through the silence & doubt
Try to figure it out but get caught up
In the here and the now & the where & the how
You know what it's about when they say

Wake me when it's over
Pick me up I'm on the ground
Wake me when it's over now!

She's just a girl on the run hit the streets so undone
Mistreated under the sheets by her father
Keeps her heart cold & numb thoughts she can't overcome
Still she looks for the one that could save her
