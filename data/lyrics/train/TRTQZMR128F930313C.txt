Crazy. . .Babies. . .
Crazy babies never say die
Born to live on a permanent high,
Flying high above the world below,
They'd better come down soon
Or everyone will know
YEAH!

Nobody's gonna change them, change them,
They've gone over the top
Nobody's gonna tame them, tame them,
They're never gonna stop

Walk that walk, ooooo
Talk that talk, ooooo
Walk that walk, ooooo
Talk that talk, ooooo
