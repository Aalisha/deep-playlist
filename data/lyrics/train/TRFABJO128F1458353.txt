Believe me when I say to you that every word is true
Oh, that a change is goin' to come
You can hear it in the broadcast on your radio

Ooh, why are you runnin'? Was it somethin' that somebody said?
What are you hidin' from? Are the voices alone in your head?
I can make it look natural 'cause the more that you see
It's the less that you know, it's the more that you give

Believe me when they call for you as you cry out in the night
These four suspicious riders have been circling
The borders of your bungalow
