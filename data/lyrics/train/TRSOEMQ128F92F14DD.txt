Somebody told me a long long time ago
Baby, I feel the change in me is comin' on
I've found the strength I need to carry on
Something's come over me at last

Ooh, sweet darlin'
Long as you stay by me, I'm halfway home
I can see brighter days before me
Though it's been stormy, at least I know I'm not alone

'Cause there's just too many people in this world who are undecided
There's just too many broken people afraid to take the stand
Oh, there's just too many lonely people livin' in a house divided
By loneliness and sorrow, I'll never understand
