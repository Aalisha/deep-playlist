Baby, when I found out you were lyin´
Playin´ around and connivin´
Undesired tears I was cryin´
'Cause sugar coated lies I was buyin´

I was just a backseat driver in a car of love
Goin´ wherever you take me
Don´t know why I put up with the pain
'Cause nobody else could make me

You got me goin´ (Stoned out of my mind)
You got me goin´ (Stoned) Hey, hey (Out of my mind)
You got me goin´ (Stoned out of my mind)
