Living it up all night
If you're in it for the money that's alright
This is the midnight hourd
Forget about your troubles hold on tight
Gimme a time and place
Just shuffle to the music the band plays on
Take what you can from life yeh
My father always told me when you're gone you're gone

BRIDGE:
Everbody knows her name
Everbody knows this game

CHORUS:
Go down living it up
Fall down giving it up
Deep down everybody loves her
Go down living it up
Fall down giving it up
Deep down everybody loves her

Man on the street says Baby if you're in
It for the money I'm with you
Living on dreams look now cause the door is lying open
Walk right through
The look in her eye says Baby I'm taking you to heaven
Lights say red
...
