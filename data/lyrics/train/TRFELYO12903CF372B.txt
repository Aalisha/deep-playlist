We had an apartment in the city
Me and Loretta liked living there
It's been years since the kids have grown
A lives of their own left us alone

John and Linda live in Omaha
And Joe is somewhere on the road
We lost Davy in the Korean war
I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore

Ya' know that old trees just grow stronger
Old rivers grow wilder every day
