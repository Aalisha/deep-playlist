Echoes thunder. almost every night
Why this prison, if we're all alike
Look around you, look at all your friends
Tell me, are they, just what they pretend

Listen to my story, if you have the time
Yes, we'll make a difference, if you really try
Listen everybody and start to make it right
One and all together, you feel it from inside

Tell me why
It echoes every night
Why we fight
Just to find who's wrong or right
Don't let it slide
You can't run and hide
Tell me why
Oh, won't you please tell me why

Give me a reason, for this senseless cry
We can change it, why'd they have to die
Think of the children, tomorrow's their future
Don't make them feel it's just another day

Tell me anybody, why can't we live together
End all the fighting, erase it all forever
Listen for this reason, before it gets too late
Soon there will be no one, no one left to hate

Tell me why
It echoes every night
