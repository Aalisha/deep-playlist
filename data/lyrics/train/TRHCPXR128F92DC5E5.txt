This old boat kept us afloat
All those years on the lake
I remember that day I heard my best friend say
This is probably the last trip I'll make

'Cause the doctors are saying it ain't looking good
And they doubt that I'll make it to spring
And it's a hell of a note when you never know
What tomorrow might bring

So I don't buy green bananas
I don't play the lottery
Right now's all I've got goin'
Yeah, and that's just fine for me
