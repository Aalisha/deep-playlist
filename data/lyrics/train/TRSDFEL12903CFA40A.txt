One of us
Will make a game out of that which makes a game of us
The game goes dust into dust into dust into dust into dust
And all we've known, and all of the rest
Must someday creep silently to death 
And never say goodbye

You're The Reason Why I'm Afraid To Die
Ooo-ooooo-oooooo-oh
You're the reason why

You're The Reason Why I'm Afraid To Die
Ooo-ooooo-oooooo-oh
You're the reason why

You're The Reason Why I'm Afraid To Die
