Take me away,
Take me away
Yeah

Dream tripping
I'm dream tripping
Yeah

Dream tripping,
You're the only thing,
You're the only thing

Take me into insanity
Yeah, dream tripping, yeah,
That's where I wanna be,
That's where I wanna be

Come on and take me into insanity
Yeah, dream tripping, yeah,
That's where I wanna be,
That's where I wanna be,
Wanna be

Dream tripper, teach me how to fly,
Oooh come on baby, take me so high
