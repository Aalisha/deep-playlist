Holiday quiet on these streets, except for some stubborn leaves
That didn't fall with the fall and now they clatter in vain
Holiday sky, midnight clear, wind is high, hard to steer
Old muffler rumbles like an old fighter plane

In search of some rest, in search of a break
From a life of tests where something's always at stake
Where something's always so far

What about my broken car?
What about my life so far?
What about my dream?
What about?

What about everything?
What about aeroplanes?
And what about ships that drank the sea?
What about?

What about the moon and stars?
What about soldier battle scars
And all the anger that they eat?
I am not in need
