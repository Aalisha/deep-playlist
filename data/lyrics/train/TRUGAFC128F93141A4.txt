I hear you crying and I know what it's like to be alone
Your scared and I'm not there
It's like you're living with a ghost
someone you can't hold
and you say it's so unfair

And just so you know the distance is what's killing me
time and space have become the enemy
And what I need is so far away
and so it goes
the distance makes it hard to breath
My heart won't let go easily
I don't want to be this far away
...
