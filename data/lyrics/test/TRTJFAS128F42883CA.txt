I wanna hold ya
I wanna hold ya, yeah
My soul wants to love ya
My eyes wanna touch ya

Telling me about your loving
Telling me about your hugging
So good ooh, so good ooh

All I wanna do is squeeze ya
Never want to release ya
So good ooh

Living inside your love makes me feel alright
Things are oh so nice, I got to say it twice
Living inside your love makes me feel alright
And I had to sing it twice

So good ooh, so good ooh
So good ooh, so good ooh

I don't wanna own ya
Just wanna love ya, yeah, yeah
All my love is about cha
Can't do without cha, ooh

Telling me about your loving
Telling me about your hugging
