Jesus, King of my heart
Father, my peace and my light
Spirit, the joy of my soul You are

Jesus, to You none compare
Father, I rest in Your care
Spirit, the hope of my heart You are

The Heavens declare You are God
And the mountains rejoice
The oceans cry, "Alleluia"
As we worship You, Lord
For this is our song of love

Jesus, You save my soul
