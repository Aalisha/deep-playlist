Once, when the dark veil
Had covered the lands
And it seemed to have frozen time
I stood there in wonder of
What the light had left behind
I wandered through there vast
and untouched lands
Unaware of being trapped
In a dreamlike state of mind

The unspoiled - endless
Beauty - as old as time
It takes - caught me
My breath - unawares
It freezes - my blood
My memory - my body
Puny - mortal
That I am - not worthy
...
