Smashing through the boundaries
Storming through the burning fields
Stand before the Evil One on towards the morning sun
Falling under skies of pain

Soldiers searching endlessly
Crashing over seven seas
Torture in the winter skies, riding over plains of ice
Shadows in the fields of the slain

Crashing steel and raging fury
Smash the cross, destroy the army
Crush the legions of the twilight
Templars of steel will burn

Cry far away, as we reach for the day
Passing our way through the punishment and the pain
Reach for the world, as the sky begins to fall
