I know they all want you
With your Desdemona's eyes
I'll keep you from danger
Save you from prying eyes

I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Come and live over here
I can make the world safe for you
Nothing bad'll happen now

I've got a problem
I think you know how I feel
Plans piling up in the corner
...
