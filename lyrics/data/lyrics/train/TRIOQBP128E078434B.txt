You, you, you were my first love 
And you, you were my last 
And I was coming on strong, coming on strong, 
Coming on strong 
I can feel love, I can feel love, I can feel love 
Coming through your heart 
What can you do with those attitude blues 
They'll make you feel alright 
Yeah, they'll make you feel alright, yeah 

You, you, you were my first love 
You, you, were my last 
And was a coming on strong, coming on strong, 
Coming on strong 
I can feel love, I can feel love, I can feel love 
Through your heart 
What can you do with those attitude blues 
They'll make you feel alright 

Cos they'll make you, they'll break you, break you 
They'll put you back together 
Again and again and again and again 
I don't believe, I don't believe, that the price isn't high enough 
I don't believe, I don't believe
