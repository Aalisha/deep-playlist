I have to lock the door
So you can't see me here right now
You don't deserve to watch me cry
'Cos of what you did to me, No!
I wanna be Free!
No matter how or why
You spend the last one of your lies
It's gonna be on me
Last time I watch you roll your dice
If you ever wonder where I am
I'm in your past
And if you ever wonder
No I'm not comming back
