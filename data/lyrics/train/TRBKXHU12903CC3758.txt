Don't look out at mefrom behind your blinds
Come on, now and seewhat I am made of
I know you're prettyand I can feel high
And I can do something with you Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Think I love you Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Neighbour, neighbour
Think I love you Looking at you
