Ooh!
It's not whatchya call it
It's how it makes you feel

Yea-Yea-Yea-Yea-Yea-Yeah!

Ah
Ahh-Yea!

Lay down your guns
You got fire in your eyes
And your web is spun
Mmm I feel your stare
Burnin' out of control
You'll get your kicks out there
They won't crucify a dying soul

Oh I'm not the one
You should be lookin' for
Yeah and I'm not the one
Who's gonna give you more, yeah

She got a whole lotta monkey
Whole lotta monkey on her back
Ow!

Desire my city child
We know the world can wait
There's no sympathy in your fate
Mmm and I know it don't mean a
God damn thing to you don't
