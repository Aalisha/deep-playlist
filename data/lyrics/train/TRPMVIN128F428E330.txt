The nights are long
And the days roll into each other
In the City of Angels I can't get no sleep
I wish that I was sippin' coffee in your kitchen
Yeah I'm stormy from the mountains to the sea

Left her standing
At the gate
Couldn't talk I was running so late
Thought I heard her say goodbye?
Saw the sun fade in her eyes

I brought my rain to California
All the way from Philadelphia, PA
And on the way my tears fell for you
I brought my rain to California
...
