We started out as simple friends
that kinda friendship never ends, no baby.
But we were fortunate to care enough,
we knew just where we stood.
But soon as love appeared,
you turned away.
And you were so unsure and so afraid
of feeling what i was feeling.
You were scared that love would
blow your heart away.
And you were certain that in time my love
would stray... so

Where, where will you go?
