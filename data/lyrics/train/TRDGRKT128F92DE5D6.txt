Out from the north into the south
Winter turned his frozen mouth
Tearing down the voices of living
Leaving bodies buried in ice

The wrath of distant clouds
And the weeping of the ground, it will come
Cold wind carries the voice of doom
Singing songs for the damned

Descending winters for all lands
All hope is gone in his hands
...
