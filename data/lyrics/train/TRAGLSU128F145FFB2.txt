Yeah, got it, the remix
[Incomprehensible], yeah
Turn this up, yo
Heaven only knows if they heard this
Heaven only knows if they heard me, yeah
You know what?

Heaven only knows
'Cuz I don't understand, understand now
Won't you tell me, please? Tell me
What's the master plan? Master plan

Spent so many days, many days
Sitting on a cloud, sitting on a cloud
Heaven only knows, only God knows
So I'll just move the crowd
Yo, tell 'em, tell 'em
Now, now, now

I break out my physical shell and excel
Past the so called body used to go to the party
But now I sit and chill with the pen and a pad
Dropping ill philisophical science

Me and my dad, we talk about life and how it started
How we departed from lights path and probable right math
The task at hand is makin' people understand
That we're not who we think we are

Within this land of lost the cost of souls could be so high, high
People be gettin' high, high, wonderin' why we die?
But it's all planned, right, to get your fear take the hand
We keep on returnin', 'cuz the lessons need learnin'

Concernin', what? The fact I sing and I rap
I hold this mic contact
Critics can step back and analize
I energise with cosmic rays of days they ignore
[Incomprehensible]

Heaven only knows
