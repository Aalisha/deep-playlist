Sometimes I try to realise that you are gone.
Sometimes I think that I'll never, (Can't) go on alone.
An endless fight, to look normal, to be funny.
I can only paint deadly smiles on my poor face,
My poor face...

How could you leave us so suddenly?
How will we live?
How could you leave us so suddenly?
How will I live?

I'm so angry with you,
How could you
Hide your pain this way?
