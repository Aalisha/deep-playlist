Hooray for me!
Call me stupid, call me crazy, call me what you will
I don't write this music with intent to pay my bills
Cookie cut-out cardboard bands and we all sound the same
Guess I'm just a hypocrite for living out my dreams
May not make a difference, not trying to make you see
May not make much sense to you, but oh it does to me
When it's all been said and done, I know that I had fun

I'll take it to the grave with me
