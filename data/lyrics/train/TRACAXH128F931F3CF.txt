And we go a day, not believe in God
The gray skies fell, we felt the pressure drop
And we were feeling down
Some eyes were looking down at us
The souls that made the call
The judge what when they spoke said, "Not at all"
The words that came made not a sound
A mouth said, "Not a sound at all"
What Sheldon said, "We wrote a book"
And rearranged the size and forms to look like something understood
Like something we had seen before
And waiting pent, save, sad, and look
Up to the stars and counting all the suns and all the moons
How sad it was that we could not believe
