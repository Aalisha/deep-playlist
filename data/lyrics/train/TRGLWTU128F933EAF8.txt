Where is the promised land?
Where is the brave new world?

The earth is shaking
Down below our feet
We move in wonder
And we generate the beat

Our blood is boiling
Wonderful in heat
We glow like embers
Dancing in the dark

Where is the promised land?
Where is the brave new world?
Where do all dreams go when they die?
Oh, we can move the streets today

Where is the promised land?
Where is the brave new world?
Where do all dreams go when they die?
Oh, we can move the streets today

Where is the promised land?
Where is the brave new world?
Where is the brave new world?
