There was a place, a little town
Where we used to play and laugh around
We went too far, reaching for that star
And the light moved away from me

And the spirit never died, the world belongs to me
This is when I've been given time to live and see

I'll never give up, never give in
Won't stop believing, 'cause I'm gonna win
Sing with my soul before I get old
'Cause there may be no tomorrow
There is no limit to what can be done
Climbing the mountain with power so strong
Dusty roads, down the way
Leaving the future behind me

I got a fast car like a rock star
