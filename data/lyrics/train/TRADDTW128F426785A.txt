I'm in the Bathroom
listenin to the girls who saw you in the Car
and they want you baby
Can't blame them kinda feel the same
it's about to be a game and i have to win it

Wanna know you before they do
and i got a little place we can go to
and you can show me some of your tatoos

Hey mommy take it easy
just lookin at you can't phase me
what can i say feel the same way
lets go somewhere we can play

(Chorus)
Why do they call you sexy
I'll tell you why they call you
cos your pants be singing
and your smile be ringing
a cool little gangsta style (baby)

Why do they call you sexy
I'll tell you why they call you
cos your hips be showing
and your lips be singing
so many reasons to call you sexy

Yo it's the back and G and teeth clean
...
