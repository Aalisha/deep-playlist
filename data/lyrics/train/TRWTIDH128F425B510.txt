Breaking up in the station, a final train
I don't even know if I'll ever see you again
Is it a choice that we even have?

Bang, bang down on piano 'til I smash the keys
Living alone with the melodies
Everything's gone and I don't know where

And the rule of thumb don't apply anymore
'Cause the house is burning

I'm trying to pull myself away
I'm caught in a pattern and I can't escape
I'm trying to pull myself away
...
