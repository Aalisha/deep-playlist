I pulled into Nazareth, I was feelin' about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
I said, "Hey mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook his hand, no was all he said

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
And you put the load, put the load right on me

I picked up my bag went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the devil they was walkin' side by side
I said, "Hey Carmen, come on let's go downtown"
She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around"

Take a load off Fannie, take a load for free
Take a load off Fannie
