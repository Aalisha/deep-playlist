Waitin' all night not a call in sight
I got the bait but I got no bite
Wanna have some fun, wanna have someone
Who can make me feel alright
I'm lookin' at you, you're lookin' at me to
Yeah you know what I wanna do
But your girlfriend wants the night to end
Baby tell me somethin' new

It's too bad about your girl
She doesn't look like she's much fun
It's too bad you got a date tonight
Cause you're lookin' like you're the one

She left but now she's back
Stickin' out her rack
She got you runnin' down the wrong track
