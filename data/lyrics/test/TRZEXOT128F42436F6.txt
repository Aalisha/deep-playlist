One of a kind they say

They've never seen before
Investigate the aberration
Disorder in the core
I never tried to hide away
Or tried to keep your pace

You walked me to the slaughter
With a smile upon your face
From the cradle to the madhouse
A twisted mind
There's no way out of this hell

For twisted mind
There's no way out
There's no way out
You come to see the healer
So don't you be afraid

They call me tranqualizer
