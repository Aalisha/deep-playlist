Don't know
What I was looking for when I went home
I found me alone
Sometimes
I need someone to say, you'll be alright
What's on your mind?
But the waters shallow here
And I am full of fear
And empty handed after two long years

Another sunny day in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance to feel it
