Staring at the sidewalk, there's a crack in which a flower grows
reminded me of somebody not hangin' around here anymore
and everything is so pretty/pretty fucked up, obviously
when you call me from the other side to tell me everything is fine
and I will always love even when your eyes are fading
and if they catch you, I will save you, I will get you out

And this, what about this?
is it anything at all, is it a growing cancer in your heart
and this life... I don't have a clue
but when they told you not to worry, didn't it bother you?
well all that's very nice but this is still a song against life
...
