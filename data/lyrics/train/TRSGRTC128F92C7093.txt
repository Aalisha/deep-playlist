heaven, i'm in heaven
and my heart beats so that i can hardly speak
and i seem to find the happiness i seek
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
heaven, i'm in heaven
and the cares that hung around me through the week
seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
when we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
oh i'd love to climb a mountain
and reach the highest peak
but it doesn't thrill me half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek
oh i'd love to go out fishing
...
