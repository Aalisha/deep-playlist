Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
...Listen

(Verse 1:)
I Thought
You Were
Always
Gonna Be Here By My Side
It's Taken Such A Long Time
For Me To Find
What I Want To Do
Too Much I Never Knew
You Could Do What You Do
I'm Asking You One More Time
Is It Always Gonna Be This Way?

(Chorus:)
To All Of Ya'll
Who Said I Couldn't Be
And Tried To Hate On Me
And Take On Me
You Waiting On The Day
I'm Falling Down
So You Feel Proud
Why? Why?
Why? Why?
You Gotta Understand
What You Mean To Me
Why Can't You See
I'm Unhappy
To All Of Ya'll
Who Said I Wouldn't Be
Now Look At Me
Bye-Bye
