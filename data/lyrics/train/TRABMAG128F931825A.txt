It's not like I wouldn't dream, 
if you had not shown the way
It's not like I wouldn't fight, 
not knowing 'bout your life
It's not like I wouldn't stand, 
right here with my friends

But you threw us all a line, 
when our days slipped away
You gave us of your time

Cause you were my hero, my Friday night
You wrote the soundtrack to my life
