It's not a spark that gives me light
It's not the days, I'm up all night
Is it a story I have read
Or a picture in my head?

It's not the world that pulls me through
It wasn't a question before I knew
It was just an answer here by my side
I found it out just in time

It's you, yeah
It's you, it's you
...
