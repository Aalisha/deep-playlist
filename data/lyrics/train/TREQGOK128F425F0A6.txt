Look sharp, stay on top of your game
Always looking out for number one
You can feel the tension in the air
On these streets there's no where to run
Live fast, excitement runs through your veins
Go wild on the wrong side of town, wrong side of town

Hey, here come the mods!
Look out!
They're coming for you
Here come the mods
