She's got that dark hair falling 'cross her shoulders
There's not a man alive that wouldn't want to hold her
And the way she moves, just the way she moves
Well, that's enough to keep me on a slow burn
Keep me on a slow burn
In her high heals kicking 'cross the dance floor
She's more woman than I could ever ask for
Still there's something in her eyes, in those dark eyes
That's love and that keeps me on a slow burn
...
