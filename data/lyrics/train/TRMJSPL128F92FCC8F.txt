feat. Mos Def)

I've been gone awhile away from you, and I hope you overstand
That I got to do what I must do to be a better man
Cause if I was just to act the fool do nothing for myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed my world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and think cause of the good things that we have
And what we do to make it through when the good turns into bad
Well I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I must go do what I must do

Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

A time and space a different place a perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you be that widow tree
And I could never bear the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day, you'd be the cool of night
