We live forever now I want to know who you are
I thought you'd never come back so soon from afar
You are my savior gone is the scratch from my wound
How long does it take ya to materialize in my room?

I am so sorry, why do you take so long?
I'm in no hurry, I cannot see and I'm ready to break

She moves ghostly, oh so slowly
She moves ghostly, ghostly
