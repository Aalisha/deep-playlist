let the mayhem begin... 

i thought you had my back. thought i knew you 
it's clear to me. you'll see. i don't play that game 
don't claim to be the same as me, cause you're not 
you ain't gotta shot. shot. in this world 

i will attack 
you best be steppin way back! 
get away. get away 
how bout a bitch slap. egomaniac 
god damn. i can't stand the sight of you 
i'm so glad to meet you 
...
