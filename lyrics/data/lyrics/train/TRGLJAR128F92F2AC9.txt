Girl, you've been so busy I ain't seen you around
You got the world on your shoulders let me help you put it down
Baby come inside and leave it all behind

You got your boss, your friends, your family every second of the day
People push you, people pull you a million different ways
I'm feeling it too, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do

Now that I got you here all to myself
Baby, I ain't sharing you with no one else
...
