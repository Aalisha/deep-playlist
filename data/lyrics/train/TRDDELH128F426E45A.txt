I must fit in, pretend that's all I've got to do
(Watching from above)
And I am there where
(look down)
I want to be on top, they say, aside who am I?
(I see it so clear)
I can't remember
(in mind)
What it is like to have the dreams inside
(When nothing is real)
So
(I know)
Find me beaten by my own morality
(Releasing)
Hang on
(So let go)
