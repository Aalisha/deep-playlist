This is just about as much as I can handle
I'm not nearly strong as I can sometimes seem
My life turned on a dime
And nearly threw me out of time

Same as you
Same as me
Same as everything we've seen
Same as you
Same as me
Same as everything we've seen

Oh and everything is nothing
Cause everything was me
Oh and everything is nothing
Cause everything was me

All of you
...
