Corrine, Corrina, where you been so long?
Corrine, Corrina, where you been so long?
I ain't had no lovin' since you've been gone
Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
Corrine, Corrina
I love you so
I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I love Corrina, tell the world I do
I pray every night she learns to love me too
Corrine, Corrina
