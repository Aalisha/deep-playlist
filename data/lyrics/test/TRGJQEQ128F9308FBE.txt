Some are young
Some are dumb
Some wanna die
They

Fill the streets
Broken beats
Lonely eyes
But

Something seems to be in me
That just don't seem the same
I was dreamin' when I saw you
I was dreamin' on the avenue

I was dreamin' when the bomb blew
Because this endless desire won't leave me alone
It will not leave me alone
It will not leave me alone
