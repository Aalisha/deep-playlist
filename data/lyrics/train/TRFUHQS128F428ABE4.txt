Gimme that old fashion morphine
Gimme that old fashion morphine
Gimme that old fashion morphine
It's good enough for me

What was good enough for my grandpa
It was good enough for my grandpa
It was good enough for my grandpa
It's good enough for me

Sister don't get worried
Sister don't get worried
Sister don't get worried
Because the world is almost done
