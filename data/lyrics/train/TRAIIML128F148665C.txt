The moon above is shining bright
Come on, boy, the time is right
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, oooh

There's a mist of ecstasy
That's flowing over me
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, oh baby

My love is new, my love is sweet
Now's the time that I'll be sweet
Hold me, boy, don't hesitate
I need you now, don't make me wait

You're the one that I adore
Tell me what are you waiting for
Here I am
Take me in your arms and love me, oooh

Boy, I'm hungry for your love
