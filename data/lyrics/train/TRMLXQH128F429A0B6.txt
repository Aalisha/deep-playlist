Yeah, y'all know who it is huh
Tum Zilla ya dig, you know I got that blue monster
On them blue D's mayn, square bidness huh
That grey on grey slab huh, square bidness
Everytime I step in, got them boys hating
Keep them broads looking, square business
Ride with the bang loud, cruise with the top down
With a pretty round brown, square business
Z-I double L to the A
Lone Star hustler, 3rd Coast all day
Fresh cruising, thinking due while I be
Big baller belly, you can tell I get the cheese
Haters hating, boppers still bopping
I'm doing my thang homie, hell naw I ain't stopping
Hit after hit, chick after chick
