Y'all ain't ready for this

Swing with me, baby
Rhythm's got me crazy
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby

Baby, let's start to swing
Skirt flyin' high while you're twisting me
Shuffle boy, to your knees
Work those hands to start ruffling
Feel these legs movin', baby
Rub 'em up and down 'til they drive you crazy
Don't stop just give it to me
Do the doo wah diddy, baby, shimmy, shimmy, shimmy
When I feel you're body upclose to me

Steam me up, can you feel the friction?
Pull my hips baby bend me please
Can ya stand the heat comin' from the kitchen?
Turn ya on like an old Duprix
Baby, rev you up when I turn the key
Normally I don't like to tease
But baby, tonight just swing with me
Swing with me, baby
Rhythm's got me crazy

Shake it for me, honey
Work it like you want me
Bass hits the floor and the room's vibratin'
Straight through my hips and I start gyrating
Swing with me, baby
Dance with me, baby
It's like 100 degrees
