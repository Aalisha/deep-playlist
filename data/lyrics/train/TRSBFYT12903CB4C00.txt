There must be something fishy going on
You said you were goin' on a fishin' trip with some old friend
You said that you'd be home tonight somewhere around ten
Well here it is, it's two o'clock and you're still not at home
I think there's something fishy goin' on

I think that I'm a sucker that's swallowing your line
I try to make myself believe that it's all in my mind
But you never asked me if I'd like to go along
So there must be something fishy goin' on
