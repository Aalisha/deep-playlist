I am the master of the game that's made a fool of you
I'm watching from the highest tower
You've got the aura to enchant them and a symphony
And I have got the power

You better taste: they call it life - my special area
I'm breeding winners over there
Ain't it a sin to turn your back on what you're given?
It's time to take your share

God left me for dead - I've been turning my head
Away from the living - the time has come
To gamble for gain - to tear down the gate
And see what's inside
...
