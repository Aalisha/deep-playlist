The ropes want to feel your neck
To embrace is good for dirt and wood
Growing shadows with every light you stepped into
They're coming for you
Smothering the sun

Before the skies come down
You try some more than me

The stars have led me astray
Beneath my feet the Earth just moved away
Who changed the world, unhinged the time?
