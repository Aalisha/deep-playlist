You hide high speed out of engine greed,
And don't stop to look the world you bleed,
Cars carousel on an unmade bed,
Drive the point home after what you said.

Still life in an apocalypse,
Add some dirt to your endless list,
Force fed freedom defaced your will,
Adds an age to the time you kill.

This is you - stateless
