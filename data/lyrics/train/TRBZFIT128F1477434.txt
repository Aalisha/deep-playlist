Why should I hide
The way that you're making me feel inside
You're giving me signs that I can't deny
When I look at you
I've looked at love now
But love never showed me the way
But I look at you in a way
That I just can't explain

See I'm falling
And there's nothing I can do
Said I'm falling
And it's all because of you
Yes, I'm falling
And no matter how I try
There is not a day
