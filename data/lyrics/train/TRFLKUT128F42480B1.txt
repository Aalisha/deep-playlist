Bye, bye, life goes by

Well, I go to work, my boss is a jerk
I try my best but my feelings get hurt
They treat me like dirt, the only thing worse
Is I need the money, honey

And I, I look at the news, a river of blues
I'm so confused and I'm starting to sink
I can't even think, yeah, let's have a drink
And turn up the radio baby

The world is a mess I feel like dancing
Forget all about our cares for a while
