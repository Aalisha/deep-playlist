You make me smile, you make me sing the very thought of you
Keeps me flying in the sky
It's such a thrill oh how it feels it's like a precious dream
Upon a magic carpet ride
For you my love runs deep, the depth of any sea
On this earth
I'll travel anywhere to be within your care, you're all I need
Can't you see why

I'd climb the mountain swim the sea
Yes I will
As long as you're waiting for me
The two of us
The two of us were meant to be
Just like the flower blooms in the air of June
