Says I've come over here sweet baby,
'cause I'm all alone,
haven't got nobody,
Just to carry my smoking on.
Won't you just drove my cigarette,
smoke it that whole night long.
Just drove my cigarette baby till you make my good ashes come

Now I got to go up the country,
just to get my cigarette boiled.
