There's no mistakin' what's taken place here,
I can't pretend anymore,
You know that I love you, but its not enough
To keep you away from my door.
Now its too late to wonder what's left to be tried
Your mind's made up and my hands are tied.

It's just one of those things
That I can't do nothing about
Your love is something that
I'm gonna have to learn to live without
I could beg, I could plead and get down on my knees
...
