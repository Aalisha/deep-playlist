I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel, so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you
Me sayin' since, baby, since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue, ooh baby
