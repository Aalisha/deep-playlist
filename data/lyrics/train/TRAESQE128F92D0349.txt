In 3B it's Diane
and she's makin' a plan

she says
I'm gonna change my hair
it just don't fit my face anymore
I'm gettin' out of here
I just don't like this place anymore
tired of all the stallin'
this time it's for good

come monday
come monday
my life starts again
my new point of view is beginning

come monday
that one day
my ship's comin' in
and this time I'm ready to roll!
come monday
come monday
