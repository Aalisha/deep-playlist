Yeah
AOTP
Come on!
Underground legends
Yeah
Yeah! Army of the mother fuckin' Pharoahs!
And what I'm saying, independent
Warriors taking over the game
And I'm sayin' it time for y'all to lay down
And I'm sayin' we back. It's been too long
And I'm sayin', the deer hunter is here

Ain't no need to know my ethno', 'cause world wide is where my respect go
My flow is multi-spectral, like I'm space spaced on LSD
Entranced state dancing techno, tellin' y'all haters to let go
It's enough beef, but be vegetarian: observe the spiritual laws
Purify your channels and clearly hear your flaws
So I won't have to convince you
That you wack and shouldn't be here at all
Kamachi's dissin' that I hear it all
And see you run from your squad,
Screamin' that "I wasn't there wit y'all"
I start wars with the toungue like it's a lesbian arm
Talk with that Thesbian charm
And you can let your stereos amp this, it's the old English
Pamphlets of a hoodlum hamlet
Or the literary FBI cameras, candid daddy
Come on, yeah!(Ha ha ha ha)
This shit is child's play man

Don't let your life be the aim of pure misery
