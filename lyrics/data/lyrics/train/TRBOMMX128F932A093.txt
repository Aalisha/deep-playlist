If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, sing it
If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
So I'll just sing it, just sing it

I wrote S O R R Y
I'm tellin' you that and I don't know why
Maybe because I was sky high
And thinking too much about my life

So I turned off the light and I tried to write
But only bullshit left my mind
And most of the time I was fine but you're windin' me up
While I'm hard on my grind

When were you born? 1985
Why didn't you finish school? Because I skied
Step back, get back, come out of my face, yeah
I'm just tryin' to live my life

If I could play guitar then I'll play it but I can't
