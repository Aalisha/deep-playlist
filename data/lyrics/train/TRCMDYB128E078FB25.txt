intro: (mr cheeks)
back as a boy i longed to be
that nigga smitties loved to see
and had them all consider me... a ladies man
i dreamed of mc wit the light
and merry moanin in the night
as i became wit all my might... a ladies man... and its all rite

decks in the house
this is how we get puffed out ya-know-whut-im-sayin
shout out to cross town connection
and the trinity crew ya-know-whut-im-sayin
and 1-3-4 ya-know-whut-im-sayin
lost boyz back streets watch fam
linden and the van wyck ya-know-whut-im-sayin
well check this out this is how we get down

verse one (mr cheeks)
i run wit crooks that be a diamond boys books(?)

aint nuthin pretty in my city thats shitty
my man was runnin wil' up on the isle he caught a buck fifty
to the grill things is gettin ill
at times it makes me wanna holla when im down to my last dolla bill
well keepin it real see thats the only way to keep it
see im a legal drug thug gettin legal drug money so peep it
back in the days when we used to hear about the square
i heard a lot of bodies used to get caught up by shotties there
an out in fordy where ebony she got killed

wit so much envy gotta kill a man if he comes
