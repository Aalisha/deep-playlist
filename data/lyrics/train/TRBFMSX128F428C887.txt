You're saying
That you're leaving my love
I'm crying
We both know that it's wrong
And I'm feeling
Without you I'll be alone

I remember
Baby when we first met
Forever
Things I'll never forget
There's still loving
But something is missing

Who's gonna hold you now
Through cold and lonely nights
Who's gonna be the one
To make you smile
Shine like a sun
Tell me without a doubt
Believing me now is right
Baby let's find a way
To make our love
Shine like the sun after rain
