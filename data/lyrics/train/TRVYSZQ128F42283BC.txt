[King Kobra / H. Banger / Proffer]

The sound of thunder crashed down the alleyway
Who can remember the last time it rained
As you pushed through the crowd
Into the mean streets of town
There was something I needed to explain

You accuse my of having a heart that was made of stone
I'm hard on the outside, that's how I survive
Baby deep in my soul
Is where you had complete control
But you'll never see a teardrop in my eye
