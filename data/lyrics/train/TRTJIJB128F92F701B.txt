Tomorrow's always far away
When you are stuck in yesterday
And this old town keeps you locked up and lost inside
It draws the lines upon your face
It makes you old before your day
Though it's raining don't stay in
No escaping we are dancing

My heart is not the type to sway
It's good for any other day
So if you say that you will stay and you'll be mine
Oh I'll make everything o.k
I'll push the hurt a worl away
Though it's raining don't stay in
...
