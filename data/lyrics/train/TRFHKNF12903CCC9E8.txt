My life served on a plate
For all of you to eat
Take my love and hate
But what is this inside of me

Pity me, pity me, don't you pity me
Pity me, pity me, don't you pity me

Don't you pity me
Don't you pity me

Under everything
Something that you can't see
I can't even believe
Something is wrong with me

Pity me, pity me, don't you pity me
Pity me, pity me, don't you pity me
