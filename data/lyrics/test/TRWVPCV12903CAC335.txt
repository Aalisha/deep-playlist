The story of my life I can't quite comprehend
So tell me if you know how it ends
When everywhere you go feels like a mirror maze
And you're not sure how you're stuck in this place
And you've got nowhere else to go
And you're lost within your own home
You're trying so hard to win
You keep trying, it's embarrassing
And how you don't even know
But you know you're off the tracks
And how did you get in here
Thinking, how did I get in here

I'll help you break the walls down
I'll help you break the walls down
And bust you out
And take you home
Believe you me
You are not alone
I'll help you break the walls down

Does anybody know where February went
I was hoping that by now it'd be the end of this
