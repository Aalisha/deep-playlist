Intuition tells me
What I'm missing
When I look at you
So tell me, honey
Am I dreaming
Or do you feel it too?

'Cause I feel that you know
You've got me just where you want me

I'm crazy, crazy for you
And there's nothing that I won't do
I'm caught by the look in your eyes
And it's all for the love of you
