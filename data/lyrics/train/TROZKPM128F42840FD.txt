What's the long face
What's all the crying for
Didn't you expect it?
When you opened your door

To the man with the long coat
And the long list of victims
Everybody watching knows
He's the one keeping the score

From where she sits
Everyone stands in judgment
And people watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long, slow fade

The show goes on
And the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on
As the autumn's coming and the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

Some say, "She's alright"
...
