Baby, you're hotter
Than a bowl of soup
You're oh so very hot
And, baby, you're cooler
Than the coolest snow
You know, you know
That baby, you're sweeter than sugar
Uh huh, (uh huh), uh huh, (uh huh)
Oh, baby, you can't be beat, no, no
Sweeter than sugar
Oh, sugar, you're so sweet

Baby, you're softer
Than a cotton field
You're oh so very soft
And you're so good lookin'
