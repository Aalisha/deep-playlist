Ancient cities lost in time
Nations of the grave
Banished to a crypt of freezing pain
Children of the seven seas
Beneath the heavens roam
Searching for a place to call a home
(CHORUS)
I wake up dying
Trapped in this hell
In search of finding
In death we are alone
Does the madman plead insane
Is there death that gives no pain
Blind aggression bring you fame
I just need a chance
To win
or lose
