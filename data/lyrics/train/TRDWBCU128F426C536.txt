She don't know who she is
Oh, I can take her anywhere
Do whatever comes naturally to you
You know she just don't care
You know she just don't care

'Cause I am always where I need to be
And I always thought I would end up with you eventually

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
