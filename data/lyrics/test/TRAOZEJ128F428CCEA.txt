In the zone like Keyser Soze, always the usual suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And southern pride I be, checkin' my fuckin' head
Scared, lookin' up in your face, Boy I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be
Enemies in the P's freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs

Only the twenty piece mojo, flow zone like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could yo' hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin'
Never bakin', rebukin' satan, we had you waitin'
