We got bruised wrists
Kick flips and an ill invasion
They say loose lips sink ships but might get you probation
And we're deep six in the mix ripping round rotation
Chucking cheap tricks and kung fu kicks just to get sensation

So turn your radio off
Press one for love
You got to cough to get off
What's done is done
Turn your radio off
It's never enough
Want to change it all
I want it all

But you can't always get what you want, you can't always get what you want

Give up, give up, give up
The dream is over
We lost the buzz
And now we're running sober
Give up, give up, give up
Don't even bother
Can't get what we want
Give up, give up, give up
The dream is over
We're going slow
And driving on the shoulder
Give up, give up, give up
Don't even bother
...
