Devastation in slow motion on a wing and a prayer

Big, big city colours, small people despair
It's just an analgesic love song but it's wearing me out
All you disenfranchised children it's time to come out

And it feels like I'm home again
And it feels like we've got to shelter from the rain

You say that you can, but I'm more of a man
