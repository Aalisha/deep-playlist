I cant imagine losing the world
After spending a lifetime together
Im sure its not easy facing the dark
I wish I could make you feel better
It doesn't seem fair and it doesn't seem right
Your not alone, Ill be right by your side

Im glad I could stay a while
Im glad I could make you smile
But it's a long drive home and I really have to go
Everything will be alright
He'll be with you in your dreams tonight
And I can see his eyes when you look into mine
In his eyes
