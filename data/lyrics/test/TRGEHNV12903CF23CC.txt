Shut your fucking mouth.
You don't know a single thing about me.
So I heard what you said when he walked away.
Don't you think I can add up the numbers.
It's a sour taste.
A knowledge I wish I've never gained.
So you think you could match me?
Well these are the things I see.

A perfect body. A twisted mind.
Starvation and loathing.
We fuck 'til it bleeds.
Scratch claw and scream.

'Til it feels like I'm almost alive...
These are the words to justify
All against all.

Almost alive...
These are the words to justify
...
