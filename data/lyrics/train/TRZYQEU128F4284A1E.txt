Looking for the buttercups, and I won’t say too much,
And then it comes a new disease and I won’t let it grow,
But how many roads have you used for gold?

Another race, another speed, so don’t hold back,
Sixteen little seconds, and you won’t stop running round the track,
Forgive me because I can’t leave,

Oh uh oh, where do we go?
