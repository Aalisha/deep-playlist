I ain't never been cool,
I ain't never been cool.
Won't get in your gang, (ain't getting in, I'm)
Won't fit in your clique (not unique.)
Won't tap you on the shoulder,
Or kiss you on the cheek.
I heard you do want to, do what you want to.
Oh, but you don't though do you?

I ain't never been cool,
I ain't never been cool.
Won't get in your club, (ain't getting in, I'm)
Not quite up your street (not your scene.)
