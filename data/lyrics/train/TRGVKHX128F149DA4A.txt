Fuck you!

Three, two, one your time is up
Shit out of luck, too fucked up to think to duck
You're looking for me? Well I'm huntin' for you
I'm ready to handle some business I'm attendin to
(Oh Oh) Are you ready for this shit?!
(Oh Oh) You better ball up your fist bitch!
I'ma' show you what I'm all about, ride out
And do it how we do it in the south so watch out!
I've got this disease.
So stay away from me!

Fed up. with all the mistakes that you made
Not sure. how much more of this I can take
I know that I'm through with you, you say fuck me?
Well I say fuck you too!
