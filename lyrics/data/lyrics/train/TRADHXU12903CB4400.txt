Run it
Oh, hit it

Hands up in the air as we attack the sound clash
So we emptied out the wallets, steal all of your cash
Now we've got this sound surrounded, so surrender your stash
And now that competition's done 'cuz hasta your mash

If you only use samples, well then you're not original
If you're not original I won't be your criminal

Freeze, jump back, put up your arms and
Freeze, jump back, put up your arms and
Freeze, jump back, put up your arms and
Hold up the dance like a robbery

Freeze, jump back, put up your arms and
Freeze, jump back, put up your arms and
Freeze, jump back, put up your arms and
Hold up the dance like a robbery

Operator, butter finger, record fumbling
While across the dance it's our system with boxes rumbling
You got your fat face, fat lace, groupie lovin' you
