Mine, immaculate dream
Made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you

Signed with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you
Was created for you

Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?

Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone, now

We're trying to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me inâ€¦ TO CRY!

Who do you need?
