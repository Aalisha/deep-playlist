I'm standing before you and I'm naked
Stripped down to my soul
(Down to my soul)
I've nothing to hide, no inhibitions
In total control
Gonna stay here forever
Going to make a start
No one true sign will end, oh [unverified]
Separated from my heart
Right from my heart
Right from my heart
I've waited many years
To stand up to my fears
And now the sadness in freeze
Nowhere for me to run
I'm gonna overcome
All of these, all of these
...
