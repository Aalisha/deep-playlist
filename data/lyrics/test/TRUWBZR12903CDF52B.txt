Don't claim to be a prophet
Don't claim to read the stars
But I can see a future
Mapped out in scars
Look to the skies
Keep praying to your gods
Your only salvation
Will come in the shape of the bomb

No clockwork orange
The doom watch ticks
There's no second coming
Only final conflict
Blind pessimism?
Only time will tell
The cold hard reality
Is that this world had gone to hell
