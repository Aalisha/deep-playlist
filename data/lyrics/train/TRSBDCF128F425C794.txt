Face to the future.
The past will cling and gather to us
Face the future, free from all
Look beyond where nothing gathers
Where no voices ever call.

There we stand and look upon it
There we are and here we stand
Looking down on ourselves
Either of us on both hands.

It's love that gathers
And love that falls
And love that delusion shatters for us
There the sunbeams shines so brightly
Thru the shadows of ignorance.

And there lays my call beyond it all
To return in every single word.

And learn: That nothing ever was created without a purpose.
And ignorance is the choice not to know
(And) so - across the sand I go.

Water run the sunlight glisting
Like a jewel, 'cross the pearl
Water run the sunlight glisting
See the sunlight dally home
From the mountains you can hear the voices calling
From afar you can hear their echoing
Now you look upon the stars
Gaily brightning, brightning
From the light of the sun.

Every star and every planet should be heard
Every word shall be spread
Across the universe
Every gathering, every man,
Everyone who's ever heard
Himself be calling to them, say:
Oh Lord, upon the God of all
Behind the universe
Everything spells your name
Everything calls your verse

Every word and every tree
Every land and every bee
Every bird, every beautiful woman,
Every strong man, every understanding
That is you and the living too
We know that we're coming thru, coming thru...
Across the sand... coming thru...
...
