If everything you do has got a hold on me
Then everything I do has got a hole in it
I? ve been here before, I should be used to it
But I can? t take it no more, I can? t take it no more
Oh whoa, oh whoa, whoa, whoa

Yr mangled heart, your battered love
That? s hanging on to memories
You? re letting go of everything that used to be
I? ve had enough, you'll build me up to let me down, yeah

If everything I do has got a hole in it
Then everything you do has got a hold on me
