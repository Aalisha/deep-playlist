Some things never seem to change
Kids still call each other names
Should get better, but it's sad and strange
Every insult still the same

Growing up in small town hell
They bide their time till the dinner bell
Take a swing with a bag, and they wait
By the school gate

All this pushin and shovin
When you need a little lovin
A little human kindness
...
