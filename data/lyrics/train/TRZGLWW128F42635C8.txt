I got some big six-shooters packed up on my steed
And I only take 'em off unless I got some flesh to feed
Intimidation to the max is what'll do it to me
I'll rip it right and rip it left but just to make your heart bleed

Laying down in the dirt, a big bottle of wine
Rather listen to some blues or love a women 'til she's blind
Got a lot of time to waste on shining my big gun
But when I ride into your town you and your sister want some fun, yeah

I'm looking for a Juliet to take my cowboy blues away
And the ten down broken hearts behind me, they're not mine
I'm a gunfighter looking for love, a gunfighter for love
I'm a gunfighter looking for love, a gunfighter for love
Gunfighter for love, gunfighter for love
