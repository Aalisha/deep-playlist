This feeling speaks
With the quiet flutes of fall
That disturb the sleep of sunken images
The memory of voices in abandoned rooms

Walk with me
Walk with me down to the river's edge
Walk with me
Where the secrets lie and wait

These wounds bleed
The solemn pride of morning
An overwhelming pain nourishing the flame
The cold embrace of breaking heart

Take this pain away
Don't take this pain away
...
