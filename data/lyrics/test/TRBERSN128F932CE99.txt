There is a bar right across the street
He's got a need he just can't beat
Out on the floor he shuffles his feet away
He'll get the girl 'cause he looks so fine
He's gonna win her every time
He knows he will, he's dressed to kill
He's a night owl

Move on, there's a howl of a night owl calling
To belong, she's crying in the night
Be strong, find the heart of a night owl falling
Stay up till dawn until the night is gone
