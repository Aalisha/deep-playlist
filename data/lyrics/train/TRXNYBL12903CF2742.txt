So here's a question I have to ask
Do we take the time can we make it last
A gift so precious we choose to ignore
Now face the facts, no turning back

Wishing for the chance to say the things you couldn? t say
Wish it was differently
Taken for granted it may be too late
With every breath closer to death

Suffer the pain of a loss so suddenly
Regret now what could never be
Feeling it can never happen to me
Until you spent so much time on your knees...
