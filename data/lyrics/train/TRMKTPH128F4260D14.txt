Biting my tongue just to get me by
Sick of going back and forth with the cheap shots all night
I sink my teeth in a little bit deeper
The red on my teeth should be enough for you

Just one more and more, it's never enough
To have me wrapped around your finger
I've got you turning blue
We can't put down our pride

When did we think that this would be easy?
We must have been out of our minds
We were holding so tight
It just slipped through our fingers but we won't let go

Holding your breath just to pass the time
