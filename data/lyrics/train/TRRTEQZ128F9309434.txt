Boots n' braces, spikey hair, you see us on the street, Dead end youth with no hope now it's time to fight back, No future, no feelings, fighting for our rights, We still fight for something...
Injustice and inequality fuels this revolution, Of death and destruction and no solutions, Looking back with no regrets, Politicians create their only threats...
Our youth!
