[from "Get Rich Or Die Tryin'" soundtrack]

[Intro]
Yeahhh...
Whooo Whooo. Whooo Whooo.
Haha.
Fuck Tha Police!

[Verse]
Think about it every time you bitches come around (yeah)
Either we runnin' or we layin' on the fuckin' ground (come on)
Just look at Chris a nigga popped and shot him in the club
They called the ambulance and y'all dan't even show up (bang)
Oh let me tell you about La Ricky when he took his bullets (ok)
You want the trigger man, y'all was the ones that pull it (oh)
Thats why we represent them niggaz like Larry Davis
Before he let you cowards kill him, he just came and sprayed it (come on)
Now what you wan' do (whooo whooo), bitch I got a gun too (whooo, whooo)
We gon' keep on sendin' shots (whooo, whooo), everytime y'all come through (whooo, whooo)
Got the nerve to tell him nigga put his hands up
And beat him to the ground (yeah), when they put the boy in handcuffs
