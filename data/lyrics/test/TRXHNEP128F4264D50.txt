(Chorus)
Beautiful eyes something bout the way you look at me
Is making me feel like this is a love for all time
Beautiful eyes something in your eyes has got me hypnotised
That I wanna stay in this dream for life

You're my wonderful miracle so precious to my heart
I never thought it could be this incredible to have you (to have you)
In my life you have completed me
You got me opened me
In love I always wanna see your (see your)

(Chorus)
Beautiful eyes something bout the way you look at me
Is making me feel like this is a love for all time
Beautiful eyes something in your eyes has got me hypnotised
