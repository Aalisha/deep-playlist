Hey
With a sleight of hand
And then a word of mouth
She's a cat been caged too long
And now she's breakin' out
Well, get it straight
You better cross your heart
'Cause sparks are gonna fly
Let me tell you what it's all about

Better run for cover, babe
She's gonna make her move
You know she could, she's a get rich bitch you better get her while the gettin's good

She's a vision in leather
Like salt on a wound
