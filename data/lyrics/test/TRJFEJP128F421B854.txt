Take a look at the new rules of this game
Wicked laughters are feeding their fame
Hearing the cries from the empty shells
Unmoved they seem

Hungry for turmoil and wedges
Ivy-clad so that we can't see
One peace at a time they steal
Collecting memories

Notch up another victory
Upon our shoulders and true beliefs
With wheedling words they reign
So sweet is our decay

Raise your voice
