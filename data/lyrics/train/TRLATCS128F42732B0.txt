If you leave,
Where will you go?
Before the regret you hold in your heart,
Will start to show

If you leave,
How will you know?
If our ever after ever had a chance to grow.
Do you dream or do you sleep?
Do you pick and choose amongst the jewels for one to keep
Do you wish upon a star?
Or does everything just out of reach seem just too far away

Nothin seems to change
Let alone you won't forget my name
Just don't lose what you know
Just don't lose what you know
When you're so far away
