there ain't shit on tv, i got no new pornography.
i got to find a reason to want to stay alive.
not a word is heard i said,
i might as well just stay in bed.
to find a better way, i doubt i'll even try,
just another boring story, about a teenage waste of glory.
trapped in a town, gonna drag you down, my life is such a mess,
i cannot help but feel depressed.
i doubt that anyone would miss me if i wasn't around,
