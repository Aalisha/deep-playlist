Legalize it, don't criticize it
Legalize it, yeah, yeah, and I will advertise it

Some call it tampee, tampee
Some call it the weed
Some call it marijuana, marijuana
Some of them call it ganja, ganja

Every man got to legalize it, and don't criticize it
Legalize it yeah, yeah, and I will advertise it

Singers smoke it
