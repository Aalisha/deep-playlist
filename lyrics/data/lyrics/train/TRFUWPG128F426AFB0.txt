A change was made today, somehow the reason got lost along the crooked way.
This so called peaceful state, where only wars are made,
remain still and enjoy the ride, right into your goddamn graves...

Seeking so desperatly for nothing at all, tasting every drop of rain.
Without daring to look, you're turning every stone.
Generation cold and dead...

Move on in and let them forcefeed the weak, the divine gets them on their knees.
You preach about doomsday, you differ from me.
