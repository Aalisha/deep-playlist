Been getting tired of my motor running
feeling over heated cause my life keeps comming
my hearts been troubled by the speed of love

Searching the streets for a soul commity
talking ideas on lust and pitty
the fables I've found have no place at home

Well I, need you, to want me, to hold me, to tell me the truth
Say I, need you, to want me, to hold me, to tell me the truth yeah

Ain't no party in a sad sad city
