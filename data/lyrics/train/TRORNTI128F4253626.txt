Empty frames, Withered leaves and a broken window
"18 years have had to go, They're gone, Who found the path"
The angles to my heart wide open with angelic speech
But it can't be said out loud, The thing is that it can't be said
Or the morning sun will set into magic sleep
Something in my heart told me I must have you
Tonight I'll have it all, Now lay on the bedded grass
It's coming and it's a long night
For the souls who got nobody
