I gave my heart to you
I gave up my friends like you said I should do
Put aside my smile for you
Threw out my dreams if you said you didn't approve
I gave my mind, compromise my life just to see I'd find
you were trying hold me back slowly you throwing me off my track
Disappointed again

[Chorus:]
I'm through with love, I'm through with it, through with love,
Through with it, I'm through with love, I'm through with it,
I'm through with love,
I'm finally giving it up,
I have given so much in the past for a love I never had
I'm I'm through with love, I'm through with it, through with love,
I'm finally giving it up

Oh, there you go, comparing me,
