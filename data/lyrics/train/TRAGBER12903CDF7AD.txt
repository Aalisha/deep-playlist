Welcome to this world guyz.
Stop to talk!
Reset your feelings!
Close your eyes cuz the best is yet to come!
What?
Close your eyes cuz the best is yet to come!
Fearless now and get ready for all,
We need flash to satisfied the whim of a good tie man,
Of a good tie state-man!
Talk to me like you talk to a baby.
Tell me your reasons and
I will fight for you!
I will kill for you!
So sad!
I'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid
To die!
I don't know why!
And creep
I'm afraid i'm afraid i'm afraid
For you!
