Sabbat
History Of A Time To Come
The Church Bizzare
The stage is set my friends for the play
that never ends -
this comedy we call the Church Bizzare,
once you enetr you are bound to find
salvation by the pound,
assured the more you pay the nearer God
you are.

Your mouth so paralysed with fear you
dare not speak,
your eyes so blind and hypnotised you
cannot weep,
so blinkered to reality that you no
longer care,
that profit is the prophet of corruption
and despair.
