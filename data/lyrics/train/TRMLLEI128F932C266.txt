Nothing good was on T.V.
Called you up got your machine
I thought I saw you in my dream last night

Think I cried myself to sleep
I thought about you had to weep
Seems the world was very mean that's right
And I wanna see, what happened to you and me

Thinkin bout her eyes and hair
I thought I saw you everywhere
baby, you're not playing fair anymore
You're my one and only care
But my heart you have to spare
