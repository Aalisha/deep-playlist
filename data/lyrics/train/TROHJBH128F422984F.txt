Jacqueline was seventeen
Working on a desk
When Ivor
Peered above a spectacle
Forgot that he had wrecked a girl
Sometimes these eyes
Forget the face they're peering from
When the face they peer upon
Well you know
That face as I do
And how in the return of the gaze
She can return you the face
That you are staring from

It's always better on holiday
So much better on holiday
