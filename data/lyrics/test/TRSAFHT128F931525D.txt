Verse 1 (Tak)


Ha
Shake
Move
Hello how you doing
It's nice to meet you
To ruin the space that you continue
To take in this music
I'ma move in your space and snake the pawn
And crown myslf the Don
Of a bass and bomb
Uh
Keep calm
The wrath of retards
Is the fast recharge
The last unique form
The walls you put up
That had to be return
When I told Cheapshot to stab the begone

Verse 2 (Ryu)

Yo
You know it's on
You can check my grin
Every songs got bumps like infected skin'
I don't got big trucks with expensive rims
I got five bucks till my check comes in
I can show you real quick what offensive is
Touch my fat and beg till you suck my tits
In the front row pissing on a bunch of kids
You better damn well know who the fuck this is

Chorus
Oh no
No no no no
Roll out
Let's go
Got my smokes and my liquor
Don't think that we won't get you
One day real soon
You'll be looking around like who knew
Then we come out quick and boom boom
...
