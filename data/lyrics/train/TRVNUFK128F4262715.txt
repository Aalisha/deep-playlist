Hey baby
Well well well well
Hey yea
Well well well well
Hey

I was sitting here thinkin' 'bout my situation
Though I know you got reservations
I was thinkin' we could have it out
'Cause if we had it out, I knew that we could work things out
I know the girlies gotta watch their reputations
They like to know they got a man with dedication
To make a point they gotta put 'em out, but truly
Baby girl don't have to go out that route

So don't think I don't love you baby
Don't think I ain't been goin' crazy
Don't think for one minute
You ain't been on my mind
And don't think that I'm gone for good
Lord knows that I've been misunderstood
Won't give you up and baby I'll tell you why?

I ain't never been down
I ain't never been out, no
And I ain't never hit rock bottom
Till the day you put me out
And I know, I've done some wrong, yea
But I ain't never hit rock bottom
So baby don't count me out

I was thinkin' in the mornin' it'd be over when I wake up
But then reality had hit me and I jumped up
I had to get myself a dial tone
