Oh boy, you make me feel like
Oh boy, you make me feel like
No boy, can make me feel like you
I really really want you
Oh boy, you make me feel so
Oh boy, you really turn me
on boy, and I don't know what to do
I really really wanna

.be with you
like I was before
this distance
between us makes me want you more
and I do mean
you are the cutest boy I've ever seen
and you've got that something
something that I want, something that I need, a dirty little young girls dream

I said that, oh boy, you make me feel like
Oh boy, you make me feel like
No boy, can make me feel like you
I really really want you
Oh boy, you make me feel so
Oh boy, you really turn me
On boy, and I don't know what to do
...
