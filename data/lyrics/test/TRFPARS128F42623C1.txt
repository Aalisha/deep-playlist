In the world of man in the great rat race
Makes his speeches
Then he does what he please
Winners of the mosh impart their grace
As I wallow in the mush in a doggy daze

I live in a kennel smells like rotten cheese
Chums lots of flies but why should I mind
Then I get trashed by the ho thats my wife
Can't get enough of kickin my hiney

Life in the canine world
Cats to chase and a bone to bury
Full of doggy stench in this poo poo place
If I get a piece of tail
I don't want to get married
