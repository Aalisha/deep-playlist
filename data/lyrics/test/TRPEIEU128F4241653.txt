Who the fuck wants to live forever?
Remorse.
When you stab me in the back
With your dream
To keep this body sober
I show my life for all to see.
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
In a battle inside of my soul.
Always better a fashion show
Than no show at all
Driving me crazy
You're driving me, you're driving me
You're driving me crazy,
Your driving me insane
Be you, would it be you?
And when the runway rovers
Grease back their manes, for our own sake
...
