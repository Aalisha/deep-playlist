Talking: 
 what's that big baby? 
 You know what's sound dog 
 They gon' like this here ya heard me? 
 They go like you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Fuck 'em 
 
 Chorus: 
 From what I was told niggaz say I'm a hit No Limit like Pac 
 Hit Death Row and make some mon' now dance hoe 
 And blow up like the world trade 
 And be protected by No Limit tanks soldiers with K's and hand grenades 
 
 Could you recall a soulja that used to be crawlin' 
 Now I'm ballin', don't plan on fallin' 
 For the world 
 Left the furl in the dope man, on the set 
 Cause I got plans bigger then the desire projects 
 I run with steel object toes, niggaz that smoke coke 
 And watch 'em in they back scopin' 
 Outta all soldier haters 
 Quick Draw McGraw niggaz see ya later 
 Cradle to the grave ya 
 Ya daddy made ya? 
 Let's see if he can be ya savior 
 When I cave ya chest in with me murder weapon 
 They can't find out Smith and Wesson 
 Only glocks and street machines with infer beams 
 You know what I mean 
 Fully automatic things light up the scene 
 And break ham like Carl Lewis 
 Nothin but gun smoke is all ya smell 
 Niggaz lying dead on bullets and shells 
 My people dwells to Uptown 
 Where the shit goes down 
 Shot callers and big ballers, mothers know 
 And do-do brown, Beats By The Pound, somethin' you could smoke too 
...
