Through mysterious ages and places
Fights and tragedies play out
In front of us
With different meanings
Some fight to survive
Others to see a face
Which one is the cruelest
No one knows it
No one can say it

In this war
All your wounds will be mine
Your victory my salvation
For you I'm ready
To lose my mind
My death is your resurrection

I'm so eager to touch your skin
To see your eyes
To feel you that I kill
I kill
In this blood I can see
