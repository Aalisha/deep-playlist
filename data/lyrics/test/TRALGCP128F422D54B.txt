Outside It's Raining And You Still Feel The Cold
Your Heart Is Aching, A Memory You Have Washed Away, For Another Day.

In Your Reflection You Try To See Your Past
It's Your Rejection, That Brought You Sadness
It's Been There Forever, All I Know Is This Can't Last

But In Your Dreams You, Are Not Alone
There's Someone Out There, To Help You On Your Way
In Your Soul This, Bird Has Flown
Now Maybe You'll Find The Answer

You Need The Gentle Touch
