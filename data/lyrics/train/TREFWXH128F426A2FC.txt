Virgil Spencer's got a 19 inch Hitachi
And many demons lingering
Friday night, he pulled a gun to change the channel
Something that he picked up from the King

Shining like the Alabama moon
She's looking for the promised land
Out beyond the lights of Birmingham

It's 3 am and Virgil's passed out on the sofa
A fifth of Jim Beam on the floor
She's packed her bags, she slips the keys out of his pocket
She's careful not to slam the door
