You're always on the edge, but you can never find a thrill
Fame and fortune's left you hungry still
You win young innocence with sly seduction
Indulgence paves the road to your destruction

What do you believe in?
(What do you believe?)
And why do they believe in you?

You got a bad reputation, you're a wild sensation
Your ego's on the front line and your pride's on stage
You got a bad reputation with no hesitation
Will you take the young ones with you on your way down to the grave?

You're walkin' a thin line, but you take no advice
You got all the answers, you don't need no compromise
You sure convinced us all that you're a world class sinner
