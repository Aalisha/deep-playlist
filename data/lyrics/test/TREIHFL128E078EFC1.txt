Hey ho, hey ho (repeat throughout song)
Oh, oh, gidyup

All of these flowers
For this friend of ours, it's such a shame
All of these people
All of them equally feel the same
There's silence and weeping
Looks like he's sleeping, the children say
They say he was ready, I hope he was ready
Is the prayer I'm praying

When Gabriel begins to blow
Victory shall be mine
When the horses get ready to go
Angels won't leave me behind
