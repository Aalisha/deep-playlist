Woahhhhh woahhhhhhh
Shes got Brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her German car
Listening to the Beatles singing back in the USSR
yeah shes goin around the world tonight
but she ain't leavin here
shes just going to meet her boyfriend down at the street fair

It's a french kiss, italian ice
Spanish moths in the moonlight
just another American Saturday night
