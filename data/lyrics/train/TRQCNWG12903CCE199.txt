In the silence of a high street
In the wisper in the night
From the darkness of the empty hours
To the early morning light
From the hustle down on the Main Street
With all it's lights so bright
To the trucker on the highway
Pressing through the night

Chorus:
I can hear your heartbeat
I can hear your heartbeat
Girl the sound of you is so sweet to me
