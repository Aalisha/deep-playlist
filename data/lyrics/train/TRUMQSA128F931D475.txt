Time, where did you go?
Why did you leave me here alone?
Wait, don't go so fast
I'm missing the moments as they pass

Now I've looked in the mirror and the worlds getting clearer
So wait for me this time

I'm down,
I'm down on my knees
I'm begging for all your sympathy
But you, (I'm just an illusion) you don't seem to care (I wish that I could)
You humble people everywhere (I don't mean to hurt you)
