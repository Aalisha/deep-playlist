Dear John, I'm sorry I can't do this anymore
You're not the man I fell in love with
And I have to move on with my life, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye cool

You were the one who'd never leave
Beautiful eyes, you seemed so free
Touching your face I felt complete
Holding your hand my heart would weep

So everything that came out of your mouth was full of lies
You looked me right dead in the eyes
You'd call your girlfriends and tell them that I abused your trust
You did your best to demonize
...
