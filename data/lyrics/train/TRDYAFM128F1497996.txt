Well, the summer day make a white man lazy

Well, all I've ever known is poor
Owe my skin to the country store
Owns my walls, my roof, my door
But he tells me I'm free
But I fight the will to live
Hell might take but heaven gives
It's the only one so I'll forgive
And I ain't the one to grieve

And the summer day make a white man lazy
He sits on his porch killing time
I gotta work to feed my wife and baby
I work so god damn hard that it's a crime

Well, I went down to the polling place
The white men there just laughed in my face
Saying boy, this aint no nigger's race
You best get on your way
Sir, I believe I've got the right
Said you ain't got nothing if you ain't white
