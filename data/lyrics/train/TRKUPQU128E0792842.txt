Say a prayer for me, 'cause I can barely breathe
I'm suffering, and I can't take it
Because of me, no one will ever see this side of me
if I don't make it

It's like I can't wake up
it's like I cant get up
it's like I cant remember who I used to be
am I running from you or am I running from me?
It's like I can't wake up
it's like I cant get up
it's like I cant remember who I used to be
am I running from you or am I running from me?
