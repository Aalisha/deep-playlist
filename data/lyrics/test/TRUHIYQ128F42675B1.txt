I'm heavy handed, to say the least
My mother thinks I'll be an awful clutcher
'cause I spill things from stirring 'em too quickly
I'm far too loud
It's like as soon as I've got an opinion, it just has to come out
I laugh at stupid things just 'cause they tickle me

And, sometimes I wish, sometimes I wish I was like Mariella
She got some Pritt Stick and she glued her lips together
So she never had to speak, never had to speak, never had to speak
People used to say she's as quiet as a mouse, she just doesn't make a peep

She marched to her wardrobe and she threw away the colour
Because wearing black looks mysterious, but it didn't impress her mother
She wanted to dress her baby in patterns and flowers
But Mariella just crossed her arms and so she cried for hours

Mariella
