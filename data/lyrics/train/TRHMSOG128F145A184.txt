So at my show on Monday
I was hoping someday
You'd be on your way to better things

It's not about your make-up
Or how you try to shape up
To these tiresome paper dreams
Paper dreams, honey

So now you pour your heart out
You're telling me you're far out
Not about to lie down for your cause

But you don't pull my strings
'Cause I'm a better man
Moving on to better things

But uh oh, I love her because
She moves in her own way
But uh oh, she came to my show
Just to hear about my day
