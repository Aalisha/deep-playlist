She's a wild one
But she has her reasons
She can take you in
Or just leave you freezing
She'll drag you deeper than you ever thought you could go
You're helpless without her, but somehow inside you know

When she loves you
You'll do anything that she wants you to do
And when she comes to you
You can't deny when she looks in your eyes
She's the one thing you don't understand
But you can't live without
...
