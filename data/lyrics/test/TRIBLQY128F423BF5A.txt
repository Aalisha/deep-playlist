I waited for You today but You didn't show, no, no, no
I needed You today, so where did You go?
You told me to call, said, You'd be there
And though I haven't seen You are You still there?

I cried out with no reply and I can't feel You by my side
So I'll hold tight to what I know, You're here and I'm never alone
...
