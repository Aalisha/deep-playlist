Don't wanna know why you like me, I don't care
Don't wanna know why I walk by, and you stare
Don't wanna know why, just to wanna know why
Don't wanna know why, just to wanna know why

When I breathe in, breathe out
Carry on, carry out
Try to drive through your life
Breathe in, breathe out
Carry on, carry out
