I've been hanging around this town too long
And it seems like every woman done me wrong
She's in love when I'm in lust
Well the suitcases gatherin' dust
Baby, baby, baby, I'll see you some day

There ain't nothing good coming out of this situation
Well if this is any kind of indication
Well I won't even bother to pack
I'll leave you baby sugar honey never come back
Well baby, baby, baby, I'll see you some day
