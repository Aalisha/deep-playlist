I fall into the darkness and I can’t get out
Once again depressed, stressed and filled with doubt
Aint no solid evidence
Justificating the aggravating decision to choose a musicians existence
Shit is intense, losing confidence
Really wanna break through but I feel the fence
Defensive way of acting
The way I react when I feel this way
Man I’ma kill today
Hey, listen up normally I’m up
But when the down comes around ya’ll better shut up
I’m incaged by my own rage
My own resentment
This state of mind normally stays for a day
But hey, I really try to be the nicest guy
But sometimes my insecuruties slice me right?
