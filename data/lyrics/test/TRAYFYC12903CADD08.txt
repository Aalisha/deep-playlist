I see the future coming
I'll tell you what's to be
A life turns into another
But no more I can't see
And I hold your hand

You said you'd never leave him
But now you let him go
Someday he will forgive you
And stop to suffer so
A storm arrives with thunders
The end arrived with smiles
A life inside another
Has made its ways through cries
And I hold your hand
Yes, I hold your hand...
