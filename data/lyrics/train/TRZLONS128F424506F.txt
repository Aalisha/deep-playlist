Boiling deluge sweeps the landscape
Seething waters rush
Elegant wave of devastation
Erects the plunge upon life

We enshrine this glorious black deluge nights
Their pulse in fear is high
We arise, then flee back through the gates of hell
As tyrants we escape from sights

Bereft of air the earth trembles wide
Cracks all mountains high
Soaring demons now swarm the skies
In awe and heretic pride
...
