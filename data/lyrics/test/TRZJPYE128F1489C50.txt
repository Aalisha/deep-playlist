She won't come
Just when you want it

Ya see, I'm Irish but I'm not a leprechaun
You wanna fight then step up and we'll get it on
You gotta right to the grill, I'm white and I ill
A descendant of Dublin with Titanic skill

I ducked and I swing, next thing your jaw's broken
Punk I ain't jokin', you can bet you'll be chokin'
On a fist full a nothin', meanwhile I'll be puffin'
On a fat blunt, run punk, you don't know the half

Tryin' to talk shit, man, please don't make me laugh
These Irish eyes are smilin', I'm buckwildin'
The House of Pain is pumpin', start jumpin'
Freak it, funk it, back seat junk it

If you can't get with it, you'll wind up sweatin' it
Then you'll get a beatin' just like an egg
It's so hard to run when you've got a broken leg
But we can have a run off, the House of Pain'll come off

We got the cake that you're tryin' to get a crumb off
The Irish stylee, the Celtic jazz
No one has it, just us that's it
If you try to take it, I got a big shileighly

I don't have dreads 'cause I shave my head daily
You call me a skinhead, I call you a pin head
Yo, where you been man, just like the tin man
You got no heart, here comes the good part

I pick 'em, buck 'em, cut 'em up, and buck them down
