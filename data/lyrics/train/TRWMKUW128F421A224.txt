The back alley cat fight 
Made me get my water pistol from Chinatown out 
A pink dragon with light blue horns 
That shoots a stream of water from its mouth, like fire 

It worked on them, a toy like that 
I'm back in bed, just like that 
Now, it's 6 AM, my head is spinning, the neighbor's yelling 
He wants to know which cat was winning 

Cat fight 
Everyone loves a cat fight 
For the sick minds 
Don't give 'em what they want 

Well, it's just another night 
And another round of screaming cat fights 
What's the thing they're fighting over now 
And is it worth the ticket price? 

Animals of territory 
...
