Recently I've been thinkin about what I am and where my priorities lie
Gettin it together on some future plan, decidin what I need to get by
I tried workin and schoolin but there just not my plan, oh no
Can't ya see I'll always be a music man

Well I could be pickin bluegrass or singin the blues,
it doesn't really matter to me
As long as I'm playin the music I just can't lose,
and noones gonna tell me differently
Cause all I really care about is sittin right here in my hands,
oh yeah
Can't ya see I'll always be a music man
