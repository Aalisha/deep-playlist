I'm in a crisis.

I need help--
Come on mood shift, shift back to good again.
Come on mood shift, shift back to good again.

Come on be a friend.

Nina Twin is trying to help, and I
Really hope that she succeeds.
Though I picked the thorny path myself,
I'm afraid, afraid of where it leads.

Chemicals don't strangle my pen;
Chemicals don't make me sick again.
I'm always so dubious of your intent,
Like I can't afford to replace what you've spent.

Come on Chemica-a-als!
