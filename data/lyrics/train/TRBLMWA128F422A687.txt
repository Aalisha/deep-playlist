It doesn't matter
if you're wrong or if you're right.
It makes no difference
if you're black or if you're white.

All men are equal
till the victory is won.
No colour or religion
ever stopped the bullet from a gun.

Out in the fields.
The fighting has begun.
Out on the streets.
They're falling one by one.
Out from the skies.
A thousand more will die each day.
Death is just a heartbeat away.

It doesn't matter
if you're left or to the right.
Don't try to hide behind the cause,
they want to fight.
