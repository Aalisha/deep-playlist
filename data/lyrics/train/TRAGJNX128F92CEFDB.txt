I fall asleep by the telephone
It's two o'clock and I'm waiting up alone
Tell me where have you been
I found a note with another name
You blow a kiss but it just don't feel the same
Cause I can feel that you're gone
I can't bite my tongue forever
While you try to play it cool

You can hide behind your story
But don't take me for a fool
You can tell me that there's nobody else
(but I feel it)

You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(but I see it)
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But I know... I know...
Your love is just a lie! (Lie! Lie!)
