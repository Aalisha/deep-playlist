As a man, there's a time when you gotta man up
And you might even know how to say it
Well, all you gotta do is play her this

Tell her, sit down for minute, let me talk to you
Better yet say, baby, stand up
And let me get on one knee and explain

I broke hearts and I've had girlfriends
Varieties and even one night stands
I've played the field even thought I had Miss Right one time
But I guess it wasn't in the most high's plan

When you spoke I recognized your voice
And felt like dejavu this time
I'm prepared for you, the scrimmage is over
I'm a keep it real and true

Don't want no girlfriend
Don't want a two week love affair that just ends
Don't need no married
Not five, not three, just one

I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife
I want you to be my wife
My wife, my wife

I want you to be my wife
...
