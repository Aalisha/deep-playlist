so close to
no one that
you care for
cuz you dont care
it's not worth it
you can't think straight
so take your pill
and stop whining.

so close your eyes
and think of your life
behind the wall
of innocence lost
think of family
and think of your friends
think of memories
these thoughts will be gone when you're dead
... dead.

always feel
...
