Why is that I says that I can't do a thing
And it kills me that what I love I can't do [Incomprehensible]

Mind is smashed up
My life is smashed up
And I know it's right and I feel it's time to kill
Well, I'm in panic because I can't breathe
Well, I'm in panic 'cause I can't breathe
Well, I'm in panic 'cause I can't breathe
Well, I'm in panic
