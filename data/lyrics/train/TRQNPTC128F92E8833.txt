If I were a healer, I'd use my hands
I'd put a spell on you if I were a magic man
If I were Jesus, Buddha or a king
If I were a bluesman, oh Lord, I could sing

About how I wanna be your hoochie coochie man
You got me eatin' out of your hand

(Oh yeah)
Come on baby, tell me what you want
(Oh yeah)
Come on baby, tell me what you need
(Oh yeah)
There ain't nothin' I wouldn't do for you
Oh yeah

When I was a young man, I, I slept around
When I turned 30, tried to settle down
To be your doctor, preacher, teacher, that's the truth, hey
Operatin' on my knees, my soul is waterproof
