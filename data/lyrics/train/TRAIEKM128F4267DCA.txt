? Dead as dead can be?
The doctor tells me
But I just can't believe him
Ever the optimistic one
I'm sure of your ability
To become my perfect enemy

Wake up and face me
Don't play dead 'cause maybe
Someday, I'll walk away and say
? You disappoint me
Maybe you're better off this way?

Leanin' over you here
Cold and catatonic
I catch a brief reflection
Of what you could and might have been
It's your right and your ability
To become my perfect enemy

Wake up and face me
(Why can't you?)
(Come on now)
