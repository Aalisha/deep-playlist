Step outside and raise your hand
Set your mind to see where I stand
And show me my broken home

I'll sell my heart, I see no use
I can't explain the things I do
It's all I've ever known
So show me my broken home

There's blood on my sleeve
My knees are weak trying
So preach on you Jesus freaks
I'm inspired
