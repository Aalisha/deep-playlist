When I first saw you it was love, 
But now you went far away from me baby.
But now you're back and it's driving me crazy, 
I want to spend all my time with you.

You are so fun to hang around, 
And I hope you think the same of me baby.
But your cigarettes are probably going to kill me, 
But it's fine as long as you're on my side.

27 months ago I never thought I know, 
That you would be forever in my mind.
But it's getting hard to tell. the magic in your spell
And I don't wanna be just another guy.
