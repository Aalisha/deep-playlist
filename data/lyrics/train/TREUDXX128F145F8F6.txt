You know what I think heaven is, I think heaven is you
You know that a place where I can find happiness
A place close to your loveliness
Some where to rest my aching mind, al, al
Where there's no time, your love just divine

Heaven must be like this
It must be like this
Heaven must be like this
It must be like this
