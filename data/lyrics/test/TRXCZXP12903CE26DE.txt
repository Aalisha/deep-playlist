Worst case scenario becomes a reality and you don't see me laughing
I could never have predicted this fatality and now I'm dead, does it please you?

All my suffering was in vain, I can't blame anyone
Would you do it all again?

I hope I never see you again 'cos those days are over
This has to be the toughest thing that I've ever been through
I stood all alone, I couldn't have known this would happen
And had I had known, my belief wouldn't be so misshapen
