You sure know how to hurt a girl
Fewer hugs and no more kisses
Just water for your carburetor
And bearings for your pistons

Rev her engine for your pleasure
Caress and fondle her steering wheel
But when you moan and hug her gear shift
Stop! Think how it makes me feel

Oh, skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

Oh, skidmarks on my heart
You've got me in fifth
You're burning rubber like my love

Spend all your time and money
On that Pontiac GTO pile
...
