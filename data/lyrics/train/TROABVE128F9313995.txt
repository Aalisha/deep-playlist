Yeah, we gon crash the party
Niggas don't know? You better ask somebody
If I ain't on the list, you should add me probably
Shit ain't no joke, we ain't laughin hardly
Yeah, we up in this bitch
Lotta niggas in here look like they got chips
Lotta niggas in here lookin like they rich
They dressin like Pharrel but they ain't got the Clips(e)
Nope, so they sittin to get got
That billionaire boys club shit is type hot
You know about the BBC in this spot?
Them boys'll bash your chest, your chain go pop
Yup, shit'll get that real
These niggas'll break fast to get that meal
Ain't no need to scrap, but they gets that steel
To get that grill, cause shit's that trill
Nah nigga, don't get worried
But soft niggas that talk tough is unheard
