I'm afraid to go home, I'm afraid to go home
Worries on my mind, afraid of what I'll find
Will my family be gone? I'm afraid to go home

As I walk down this dusty road, got a heart with a heavy load
Ain't one thing that's the same, so much sorrow and pain
Headin' home in a single file, every inch is a quarter mile
