Wisdom, knowledge, science

You know that's always better, faster
This is the final end

A voice in the wilderness
Fights a futile war
Because the strong are deaf
More so than before

Massive disregard
Shows what to expect
Scars on top of scars
Racing toward a future we don't have

Fear is taking over me, there's nothing I can see

The future is as certain
As life will come to an end
When time feels like a burden
We struggle with our certain death

Wisdom, knowledge, science

Develops, always, better, faster

We have to guide ourselves
