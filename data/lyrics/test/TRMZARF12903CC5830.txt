Early on in my life I was confused
Took the path of someone else
Today I might be you

I can't get out
Second to none
I can't get out
Invisible sun
I'm sick, you're not
I might be you
Invisible sun

Early on in my life I made a choice
Someday I'd use a gun to stop the noise
(Stop the noise!)

Pray for love
We dance
