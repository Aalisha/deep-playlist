Violently passive consumer -- vital statistic
A gear in a machine spinning out of control and ever ready to explode
The cemetery will carry on -- with carrion, turned to ashes
The species will die the harder they try to control the masses

Itemized flesh -- scanned inventory
A New Testament in greed
Taking count -- humanity is the product
Ever expanding the marketplace, dissolving the commonwealth
Pandemic -- the damnation, epic
...
