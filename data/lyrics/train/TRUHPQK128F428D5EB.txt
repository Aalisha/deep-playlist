Sitting in a dark, cramped basement
Watchin' the sun go down behind the shades
And we all try to find a way out
Realizing there is much more to today

And would I make you confess?
Maybe then we'd slow down a bit
Relax this pace, relax this pace

When everything seems to go away
I can hear the silver call my name
Nothing happens when I pray, no
Nothing happens when I pray
No nothing gold ever stays
No no no

Folks finally seen the simple view
And I've seen a way out
