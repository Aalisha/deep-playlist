You left this morning on an early plane
You left your picture behind to haunt me
You left in a steady rain
You say you'll miss me, say you want me

I'm left this mornin with a world of doubt
I'm left this mornin indecently exposed
So much we never did talk about
And your kiss goodbye, said the case is closed

(chorus)
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose the best love that I've ever found
...
