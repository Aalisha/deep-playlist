We've got the energy we've got the balls
We have our enemies big and small
We've got the power we've got the might
Just what it takes to win this fight
If you hate your parents and hate school
Then party with us because there are no rules
We bit em off and spit em out
And ram our skateboards right down their throats

If you want more
We'll give it to you
If you want it all
We'll give it to you
If you want to rage
We'll give it to you
