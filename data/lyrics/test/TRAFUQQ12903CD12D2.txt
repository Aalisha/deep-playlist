What do you find in me?
Every word I wrote in silence
I'm invisible...
Who did I want to be?
If I've spoke my last sentence
Are thoughts indelible?

Let me go...
Make it better, work hard, leave your mark
Make it better, work hard, leave your mark
Let me go...
Make it better, work hard, leave your mark
...
