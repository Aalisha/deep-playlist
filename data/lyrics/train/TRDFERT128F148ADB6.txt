(Harley Allen/John Wiggins)

Sometimes this crazy world can make us all feel bad
I sit and watch the news and just get mad
We need to stop and smell the roses in the ground
So get out today
Spread a little love around

Talk to a neighbor
Volunteer a favor
Help out a stranger when his car's broke down
Take your wife a kissin'
When your kids talk - listen
