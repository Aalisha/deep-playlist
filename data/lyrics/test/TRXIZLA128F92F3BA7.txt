I walk along your street (along your street)And I try to meet
The folks that live close by you (live close by you)Maybe they know why you had to go away Baby if I knew (baby if I knew)I could face the truth
But they just say, "I'm sorry, (say I'm sorry)Really shouldn't worry, there'll be an other day" But a day without love
Is a view with emptiness
And your love brings me happiness
