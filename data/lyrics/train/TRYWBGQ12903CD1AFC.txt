Hey
She's the one who keeps me bored
I'm meaningless and uncensored
Baby, baby, drinks for free
I'll let you tumble down with me
So much to do, so much to say
So much to prove, so much to fake
I hate it when you frown this way
I hate you so much got to say
Baby, baby, masquerade
Baby I'll just masturbate
So much to do, so much to say
So much to prove, so much to fake
Hey, yeah
And I hope you like porn
Cause if you want to stick with me
Yeah you better like porn
The way I do
And it has to be real
It has to be real funky
Yeah you better like porn
