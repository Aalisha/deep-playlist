Come on Cherry Cherry you're still very young
And we've only just started having fun
I'm picking fruit and I choose you, you're so cool
No need to save yourself for someone else to come

So we went completely wild
Kicked over a city street light
Saint Thomas was vandalized
And I'm sorry but I'm not surprised

Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of
