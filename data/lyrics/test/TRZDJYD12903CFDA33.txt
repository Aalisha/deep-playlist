High upon a hillside,
A preacher tells a story to a crowd
He tells the same old story,
A thousand times he's read that story loud
He wants to give the answers but his words are only
Answers to nothing

Lying in my bedroom,
A man comes on my TV with a grin
He tells me to believe him,
He said that I should put my faith in him
He says he has the answers,
But his words are only
Answers to nothing

Oh, oh, oh, believed for the last time
Oh, oh, oh, deceived for the last time

Hear the chosen leaders
Say, we can't stay sitting on the fence
...
