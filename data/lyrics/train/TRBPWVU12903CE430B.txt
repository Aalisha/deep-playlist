Blooming black
flower wine,
slashed arms and new cut smiles.
Taller for the falling down,
stronger now without you 'round.

The prophecies were realized
when we gave them proper time.
All truths come to light
after lies have had their right.

You've grown more beautiful
since you took off.
What can I do? I'm in love with you
...
