The ancient parchment, unrolled before me
Hands of unseen pull in greed
Calmly, opened up before me
Nurturing a burning need
Once a dream I know the moment
Free for now, but fading fast
Unprepared I gaze upon that which brings forbidden sight

Blind my eyes, lights so bright
The penalty of fools who try
In vain to do what greater men have failed
