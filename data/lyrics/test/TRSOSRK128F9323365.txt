How much longer will I be waiting for you?
I've been thinking of what I'm gonna do
Knew when I saw you the look on your face
Hardly had to ask you over to my place

I've been waiting, anticipating you
You know it's just a waste of time
Hoping I would change my mind
What's this coming over me
I don't feel free anymore
