If only this bike was a motorcycle
I wouldn't be moving so slow
If only this bike was a motorcycle
I'd be over half way home
As I move down the street I'd be looking so good and

If only this bike was a motorcycle
If only this bike could fly

Sometimes when I'm riding along I forget where I'm going
I start a dream that this little old bike I'm sitting on
