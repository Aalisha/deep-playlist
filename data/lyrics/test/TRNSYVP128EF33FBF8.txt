In my mother's house
There's a photograph
Of a day gone past
Always makes me laugh

There's a little girl
Wary of the world
She got much to learn
Get her fingers burned

An infinity
Between you and me
'Coz we're family, yeah

Said that I'd be fine
Give me all your time
And I left your side
Like a butterfly

Shower me with your love
All of everyday
You make the milk of
Sunshine on me, yeah
