One more to tie to the whipping post
Papers that peddle the holy ghost
Once more the victim of circumstance pays

If paper plates serve the final feast
Sharpen your knives for a front page piece
Sitting safe in the front row seats

You make a big noise
Big fire
Big noise
You and the big boys are playin' with fire
