Easy places to get away to
Easy limbs languid all around you
All my time, yeah dirt on your hands
Fingers drifting down my spine, yeah

Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall
Soundtrack to Mary
Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall
Soundtrack to Mary

Many minds wandering from room to room
Many trees slain just to write it to you
