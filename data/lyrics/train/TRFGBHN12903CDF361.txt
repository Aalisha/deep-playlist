Breaking in and entering
My will is the law
I feel the scent of innocence
And I know it's all about to fall

Never repent or change
Never repent or change
Never submit or yield
Never submit

Trespassing holy ground
Reveal your secrets
Unlock these private boundaries
I'll grant you one more dream

Never repent or change
Never repent or change
Never submit or yield
Never submit

I have an urge to kill
I have an urge to rise above my victim
To see their life blood fade away
