It's too late to turn back now
There ain't no space back there
And how did I begin to lose my self control
How did I begin to lose my self control

There ain't a thing that you could give me
With the love forever with me
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul

I don't wanna be the one
