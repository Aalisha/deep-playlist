Precious, precious
Precious, precious
Precious baby, you're mine

Mmm, if you don't love me, I'm used to that
If you don't need me baby, I can adjust to that
If you don't want me honey, that's alright
If you ain't willin' baby, there sure won't be no fight
'Cause I'm still satisfied in loving you
And I'll be waiting 'round when you get through

Oh, you're precious honey
You're so precious
Precious baby, you're mine

You've been in and out of my life
And, ooh, baby that hurts, baby that hurts, yeah
You've been with every girl in this town
You've been dealin' in dirt, just wallowin' in dirt, yes you have
But I look at love as a two-way street
