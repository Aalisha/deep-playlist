I wrote a goodbye note
In lipstick on your arm when you passed out
I couldn't bring myself to call
Except to call it quits
Best friends

Ex-friends till the end
Better off as lovers
And not the other way around
Racing through the city

Windows down in the back of
Yellow-checkered cars
You're wrong
Are we all wrong?

You're wrong
Are we all wrong?
This city says
Come hell or high water

When I'm feeling hot and wet
...
