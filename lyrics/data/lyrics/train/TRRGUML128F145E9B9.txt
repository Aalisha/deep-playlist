Step on up!

What makes me think that,
It'll all work out in the end?
Afraid to feel bad,
Better off to try and pretend
I'm immortal,
Immune to all that is wrong
Just keep on wishing,
Crossing my fingers so long
Is this helping?
I'm growing weaker each day
Can't stop whining,
Still afraid of what I might say
Or reactions,
That control us one and all

It's mine,
And it's pure and,
As decent as I can make myself
Inside, we all know,
Only the strong survive
Why don't you think about that?
Why don't you think about that?
