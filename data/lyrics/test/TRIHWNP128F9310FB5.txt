(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, I can't go on without you)
I can't stop my tears from falling since you've been gone
Over and over your name I'm calling since you left me alone
There's an awful pain inside me 'cause you're breaking my heart
Slowly but surely, I can feel myself falling, falling apart
'Cause I know
I can't go on, I just can't make it
I can't go on without you
...
