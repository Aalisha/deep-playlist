Can you be a part of my life?
can you be a part of my life?

Oh it's easy to find someone to play with
and almmost anyone will do tt fill your idle time.
but that very special someone
you can share all your dreams with is so hare to find

And it use to be like me to settle for the physical
but these days it ain't too easy to make up my mind
cause apparently your body just to temporary to take up my precious time

See I've got to know that
that I can be free with you and
you've got to show that
that you're worthy of my time
can you stimulate my mind?

And I know that it looks good,
but can you be a part of my life
and I'm sure that it feels good
but can you be a part of my life
and it probably even tastes good
...
