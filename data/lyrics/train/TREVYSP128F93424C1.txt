I need somebody
I need somebody
I need somebody

I need somebody
I need somebody

Please don't leave me alone
I'm tired of being by myself
No, don't you leave me on this shelf

Please don't leave me alone
Help me find my dancin' shoes
Oh help me heal these black and blues

I live just down the way
You wont have to stay
Just small talk and Jasmine tea
