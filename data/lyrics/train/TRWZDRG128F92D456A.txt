I dunno nothing that I haven't been taught,
I dunno why I was born into the family I've got,
I dunno if I ever had an original thought,
maybe not, maybe so, maybe later, I dunno
I dunno how I can end a prayer, then turn on a friend,
I dunno what I was thinking when I just pressed send,
I dunno why I still criticize the things I dunno
I dunno, I dunno, I dunno, but this one thing I know

YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I'm just a broken machine
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, it's all a mindless routine
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I'm in another free fall
YOUR LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE
Without your love, I've got nothing at all

I dunno what goes down the moment we die
Do we get halos & harps? Do we sleep? Do we fly? I dunno
how, when and why this world will finally end,
Speculation's gonna grow, who knows best, I dunno
I dunno if I should push ahead or stop and grieve,
