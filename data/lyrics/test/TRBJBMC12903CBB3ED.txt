She gotta condition of the heart a heart condition
So as a kid she had to adapt to smarter livin'
Not much room to rebel because of health
No drugs no booze just kiss and tell
Well known on the scene jailbait queen
Had the first baby barely eighteen
Father of the child was after one thing
When the daughter came the dad was unseen
It don't matter he ain't got a job
So she had to go work
And leave the baby with her mom
Second shift 'til the neck is stiff
But she worked it and built her own nest to live
Soon after that baby's daddy/lazy bum with no cash
He wanna come over and crash
He wanna play his part
So she let him move into that garden level apartment
She knew better she did it anyways
Explain better when you're tryin' to see some better days
The sun's up catch those rays
Butterflies now who's got chase?

But she still dreams after she woke tight hold on that hope
Sometimes it can seem so cold do what you gotta do to cope (x2)
