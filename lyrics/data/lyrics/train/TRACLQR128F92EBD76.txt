You took the weight
Of my sin and my failures
On your shoulders
No I'm redeemed
From your love
That poured over
And over
And at your cross
I fall facedown
And at your feet

Holding nothing back
Here in this time with you
You gave me life
Through your cross
And I offer
All of my soul
Now I'm free
Through your love
That poured over
