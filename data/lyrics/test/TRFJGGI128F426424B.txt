I never knew that
You wanted me so bad
Feelings now convert to love

Can't look into your eyes
I'm too afraid to see
Where we might end up tonight

Maybe it won't be so bad
After all I've never had
Loving where one moment's all it took

Sometimes dancin'
Can make you fall in love
The way a body moves before your eyes

Fancy movements
Keep you dreamin' of
All the little games you play at night

Brownstone
Comin' straight to attack ya
B R O W N S T O N E
Brownstone

Got to be careful
We just might be too close
I don't know if that's so good
...
