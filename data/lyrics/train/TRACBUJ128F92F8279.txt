Hit me again, hurt me again
It's alright, alright
I'm used to this kind of pain
It's alright, alright
Sometimes I feel it's all I can do
It's alright, alright
To find confort in your twisted ways

Trying, failing, falling, crawling, dying
Pull the strings and I am born again
Sign my name, shake your hands
So gladly sold
