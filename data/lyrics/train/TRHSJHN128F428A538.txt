Oh, lay it on the line

I wanna know how you felt
'Cause I can take no more
You hurt me too many times
Like you did before

Now I'm changin' my ways
Time to let you go
Shedding too many tears
I'm gonna let my anger show

Gonna pull myself together
Ain't got much time
Gonna pull myself together
Lay it on, I lay it on the line
I lay it on the line

I must have been blind
