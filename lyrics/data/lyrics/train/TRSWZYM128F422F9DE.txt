Every day when the work is behind you
and the shop and the store put the lock on the door,
just get away where your worries won't find you.
If you like, well, I'll tell you more.

Don't let the day get the better of you.
When the evening comes, there's so much to do!
You'd better put on your best and wear a smile.
Come along with me a while
'cause I tell you

CHORUS:
I know a place
where the music is fine and the lights are always low!
I know a place
where we can go.
