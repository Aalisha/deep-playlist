Hopped a freight train out of Nashville, rode it up to Ohio.
Made my way to Detroit City where I stayed a week or so.
Hauled a ride to Chicago with a truck drivin' man.
An' I stayed there for the summer, singin' with a Country band.
Every time I hear a freight train lonesome whistle blow,
I think about the good man I got waitin' on me at home.

Yonder comes a freight train,
Movin' on down the line.
Yonder comes a freight train,
Listen to that engine whine.
I'm gettin' off that old train:
I'm goin' back to that good, good man of mine.
