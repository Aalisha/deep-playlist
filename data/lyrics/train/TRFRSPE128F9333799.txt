Say whatever you have to say
I'll stand by you
And do whatever you have to do
To get it out and not become
A reaction memory to hurt
The ones you love
I know you never meant to but you did
Oh yeah you did

Be whoever you have to be
I won't judge you
Sing whatever you have to sing
To get it out and not become a recluse
About your house, come out
I know you never meant to but you did
Oh but you did

Still I need your sway
