I come up hard baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playin' by the rules
I come up hard baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, movin' down the line
I come up hard baby, but that's okay
'Cause trouble man, don't get in my way
I come up hard baby, I've been for real
Gonna keep movin', gonna go to town
I come up hard baby, I'm gettin' down
There's only three things that for sure
Taxes, death and trouble

This I know, baby
This I know, sugar
...
