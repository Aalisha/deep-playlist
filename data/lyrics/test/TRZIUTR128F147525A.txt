I'm sitting in the window sill
That's where I get to know this feeling so well
But I can't help thinking
Will I find my baby in there

Everything looks so quiet from up here
Feels like I'm in a
black and white movie somewhere
And then I'm on the run,
and the city lights fade to black
and I don't know where I'm at
...
