You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you

You look like Jesus on a aeroplane
Ya head's against the window pane
You got opinions but you ain't got news
You got good laughs but when it suits you

You turn it on like a leaking tap
And dripping dropping people drop of a hat
You gotta mouth but you ain't got guts
That drunken mouth you should keep it shut

You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
You don't know what it's been like
Meeting someone like you
