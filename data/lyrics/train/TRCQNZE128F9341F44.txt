Why does it have to be so hard
Does it have to hurt so much
When I want you so bad
When are you every gonna realise
All the love I feel for you inside
And just won't go away

Maybe you don't know it
And maybe I don't show it
No one else will ever do
If you only knew
The love I have for you

(Chorus)
Is there something holding you from me
Is there sosmething I can't see
...
