Blue on blue, heartache on heartache
Blue on blue now that we are through
Blue on blue, heartache on heartache
And I find I can't get over losing you

I walk along the street we used to walk
Two by two, lovers pass
And as they're passing by, I could die
'Cause you're not here with me
Now the trees are bare
There's sadness in the air
And I'm as blue as I can be
...
