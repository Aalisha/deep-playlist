Nelly Furtado:
ohhh

Tricky:
The harder they come!

Nelly Furtado:
Maybe this love thing is not for me
Maybe lovers dream things
That i don't dream
Maybe oh, maybe

Maybe you were just a little boy
After gave you the pride and joy
Maybe i should set you free

Tricky:
The harder they come

Nelly Furtado:
The harder they come
The harder they fall
Baby i would rather not go there at all
