Feeling heavy, got this stone on my back
It's driving me insane
Like a levee that's beginning to crack
Holding back this river of pain

Desperation has captured my soul
My mind stricken with fear
Don't see why I should try to go on
The voice of reason's calling me
It's calling me, but I can't hear it
Oh, my hands are shaking
Rattled nerves on the verge of breaking
That blade is turning on me
