she struts up to me.
she whispers my name as if i know her
but i never knew her

she asks me the time
a quarter to one
we go for a drive
i just don't know her

on the coldest night
in the darkest room
i will sleep alone
cause it's better than you
yeah it's better than you

you can't play me like that, it's a matter of fact
your nothing more than a typical whore,
and i won't be your fool anymore.
