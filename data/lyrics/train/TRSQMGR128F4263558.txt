You've gotta be
Outta your mind
You've gotta be
The best thing ever in my life

So why would I be
Taking a chance
Of losing the one most important thing
That I can call mine

When you know that I love you so much
And I never could love you enough
Girl the one thing I know I won't do
I won't break your heart, I love you

You much be trippin' with an illusion
'Cause I don't sleep around, I don't sneak around
Girl stop your trippin' with your illusions
Gotta stop now 'cause I don't sneak around

Girl we should be
Havin' a time
We shouldn't be
...
