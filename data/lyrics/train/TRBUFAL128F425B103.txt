Hey, everybody out there in the real world
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?

Ain't no way to explain it
That thing they call the blues
We gotta get together people
If we're ever gonna make it through

So stop runnin'
Away from everything
Stop runnin'
It's a better day, yeah
