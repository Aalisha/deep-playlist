Listen up everyone,
I want you on the floor, on the floor!
When I say face the ground,
I mean on the floor, on the floor!

Yeah, this is a hold up
So listen up while I wave my gun
Yeah, this is a hold up
Be patient 'cause I'm really new at this.
Be patient, I'm just so sensitive.
What's the story?
I want the headlines.
What's the story?
I want the headlines.
I'll be on the news tonight.
