Yeah, there was a time I didn't like the love, I liked the climbers
I was no sister then, I was running out of time and one liners
And I was afraid, like you are when you're too young to know the time
And so I watch the way you take your fear and horde the horizon
You point, you have a word for every woman you can lay your eyes on
Like you own them, just because you bought the time
And you turn to me: you say you hope I'm not threatened

Oh, I'm not that petty
As cool as I am, I thought you'd know this already
I will not be afraid of women
I will not be afraid of women

So now we're at a club, you watch the woman dancing--she is drunk
She is smiling, and she's falling in a slow descending funk
