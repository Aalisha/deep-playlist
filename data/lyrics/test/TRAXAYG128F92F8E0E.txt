If you don't give my football back
I'm gonna get my dad on you Jim
I only kicked it over the fence
And broke a ceiling no more to Noir

Eanie Meany run away
Eanie Meany run away

If you don't give my football back Eanie
I'm gonna get my dad on you
I only kicked it over the fence Meany
And broke a ceiling no more to

Eanie Meany run away
...
