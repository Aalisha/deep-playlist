I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
Can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
