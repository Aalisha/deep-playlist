One o'clock in the morning; wet rails take me home
one in the morning; on a train in the rain
one in the morning; I'm sitting all alone
thinking and yawning, and what's to be done

Bloody noses, alcohol, and bastard drunks
blowing kisses to the girls who say too much
bloody noses, alcohol, and bastard drunks
blowing kisses to the girls who say too much

They're just showing you what's to be done
...
