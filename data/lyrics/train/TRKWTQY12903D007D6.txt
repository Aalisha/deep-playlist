Fox Boogie Brown is bad as hell
Battle anybody I don't care if you tell
I excel, they all fell
Suited in Chanel, Fox Brown will rock the bells

C'mon, uhh, rock bells, ill
The Firm, c'mon, ride along baby
Whattup Da Da, yo!

Me and my Firm benos, rhyme to the death
The mahogany Mami, and shine like Pledge
Wouldn't suggest you try me, verses like Guillani
What? I hurt it on purpose like Bonnie
From the bottom to the T-O, P we flow
C.O.D., Cash On Delivery
Foxy ery-body watch me now
Got these rap cats mad can't stop me now
See the slanted eyes rise when I knock thee down
I got one question for y'all, haha, Papi how?
We don't playa hate we regulate in this camp
Y'all do whatcha can, we do what y'all can't
Amazing like Luther once the beat's looped up
Rock the bi-dells and tore your whole group up
It's Ill like Na Na when it feel like drama
