Street Love
Street Love

Come here girl
Yeah
We don't even gotta talk
Just hold my hand
What'ch you mean why
I just got to know
How's it feel

I wanna know how it feels to be touched be an angel
Shawty come bless me
I wanna see how you feel can I touch you my angel
Shawty come sex me right there

It's where I'm a Kiss your body all night long, right there
It's were I belong and baby girl I hope you feel me
Oooh, oh you look so good uh huh, I thinkin that a player should uh huh
Gon and lock you down, if you don't mind, how did you
On my silk sheets, that's where you need to be
I wanna earn my wings so I can fly with you
