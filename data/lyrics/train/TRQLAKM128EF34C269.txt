That's it
I have had it with these motherfucking snakes
On this motherfucking plane

Times are strange
We got a free upgrade
For snakes on a plane
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Bought the cheap champagne
We're going down in flames, hey

Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it

Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it
Oh, I'm ready for it
Come on, bring it

So kiss me goodbye
Honey, I'm gonna make it out alive
So kiss me goodbye
I can see the venom in their eyes
Goodbye

It's time to fly
To make the stars align
With the turpentine
Lounging in their suits and ties
...
