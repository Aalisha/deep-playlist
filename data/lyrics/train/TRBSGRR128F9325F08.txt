Midnight I watch you as you're sleeping
You don't know that I'm leaving
My bag is packed to go
oh, no, no, no it hurts me,
hurts me so to leave you
Leaving for someone who
I hardly even know
But time is come to say good-bye
To spread my wings and fly
To feel the need I feel inside

But I keep feeling these love pains
Hurting me through and through
Caught between a lover or two
Oh will I ever be free from these love pains
...
