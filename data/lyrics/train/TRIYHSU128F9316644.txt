High On You
I Feel Love Again
There's No Pretending Here
It's Long Ago Since I've Had A Reason
So Strong And True
It's All Because Of You Girl

I Used To Be A Bird Of Prey
Crying To Be Heard
A Heavy Heart
Carrying The Weight Of Sorrow

Talking About It
You Were There Saving Me From Darkness
Life Has Never Been - Ever Seemed So Bright
Ooh On The Day You Came To Me
