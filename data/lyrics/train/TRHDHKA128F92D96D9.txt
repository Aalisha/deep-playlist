I'd take you down another two-year stretch
To shake it out of you like Etch-A-Sketch
It's not so hard if we stay in the shade
Out in the yard where we can learn a trade

And on the eigth day man created God
'Cos no-one else would ever take that job
Me and my friends, we're sitting in the sun
Sweating buckets getting nothing done

How do you feel about that?
It's just me and my friends

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
