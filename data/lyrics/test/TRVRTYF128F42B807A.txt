Creep, creep, creep,
Creep, creep, creep,

Baby's got another girl,
'Cross town by the tracks,
Baby likes to sleep around,
Well I guess I shoulda asked,
Lipstick on your collar baby,
Y'all know that's not my shade,
My phone's been ringing off the hook,
And I got hang-up calls for days.

Please don't stand so close to me,
I know you're lying,
Please don't kiss my neck baby,
I know you're cheating,
Please don't say another word,
I can't hear ya,
Your voice'll make me sleep with the enemy,
The way you talk silky soft,
Your touch'll make me sleep with the enemy,
I can't resist when we kiss,
Your hands'll make me sleep with the enemy,
In other words it's a shame,
Be careful not to sleep with the enemy,
Sometimes I just don't know my name.

Baby's like a sex machine,
...
