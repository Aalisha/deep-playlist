If you're in the battle for the Lord and right
Just keep on the firing line
If you win the battle, surely you must fight
(Brother) keep on the firing line 

(Brother) keep on the firing line
Keep on the firing line
Time is getting short
Jesus coming soon
(Brother) keep on the firing line 

There are many dangers everyone must face
If you die fighting, there is no disgrace
