Reject
Need you like a drug

Shoot it up

You got a halo hanging over your head
Nothing can touch you
Nothing can hurt you


You take the world out of my eyes
You suck the words outta my mouth
When we kiss

Need you like a drug
Need you like a drug
Can't make it stop
Keep fucking it up
Need you like a drug
Need you like a drug
Can't make it stop
Keep fucking it up
Need you like a drug

Don't ever want to be like you
You have your friends
Calling you to stay
