I can remember a lot of moments with you
Talking and talking again
Dreaming on music
Becoming famous, playing with our idols
Joking about Nicolas car

So I can't understand yet
And I start to feel very cold
In this bath that is getting empty
Just like me

I'm speaking alone
Can't you realise?
Can't you realise?
