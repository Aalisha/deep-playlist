It's not easy to be happy
sometimes it's more comfortable to be sad
that's why i like this song
mmm...
Come on baby
let the good times roll
come on baby
let me thrill your soul
mmm...
Came on baby
let the good times roll.
roll on and on
come on baby
Let me hold you tight
tell me everything is right tonight
come on baby
let the good times roll
...
