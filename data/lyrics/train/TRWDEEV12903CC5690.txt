and I will never see the truth,
this is not a matter of my youth.
I do not need anybody else,
bonds would put my mind into cells.

and I will never know I was wrong,
never listen to those truly strong.
I do not fear anything that's not me,
ignorance is the ultimate key.

but I wouldn't want to live like this forever.
but change myself? never, never!
the very thought sends shivers down my spine.
I'm sure everything, everything will be fine.

I am the one who cries out at night,
for somebody to change my very core.
not sure why I live in endless fright,
doomed to love only myself forevermore.

I am the one who has no real friends,
shallow people flocking to my banner.
