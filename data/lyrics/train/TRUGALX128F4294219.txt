Vibes are all around
Can't you see it in my face
If you feel it raining down
Then you should find
A better place
Never seek to cause no trouble
But to understand instead
Not to burst another's bubble
Or to occupy their bed

It's raining down
Never suffer silent violence
Like needles to the head
'Cos the consciousness is
Altered by the things you've
Heard and done and said
So break into the brainspace
Take chances with the heart
It takes a lot of soul to never
...
