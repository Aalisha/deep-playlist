Something I must tell you,
Must believe it's true,
There is nothing in the world
as beautiful as you

Oh little girl, misunderstood,
The finest wine and the finest food,
I'll build you your own Hollywood,
Do it all for you
Do it all for you

Got something I must tell you,
Must believe it's true,
There is nothing in this world,
I wouldn't do for you
...
