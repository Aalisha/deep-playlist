What can I do?
What wish can I make come true?
Because you mean so much to me
The love I have for you is so strong
This is where I belong
My arms are open wide, so let me hold you

I will be the rock for you
The rain for you
The sun that lights the way across the dark
No matter where you are
I'm never very far away
Night and day my love will lead you through
Look into your heart I'll be lookin back at you
