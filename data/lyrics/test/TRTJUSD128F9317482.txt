Step up here to me
Am I dumb enough to believe
When somebody says jump on this
Would you follow them on your knees?
Am I wrong or right
To be dancing with you tonight?
Said I'm done with his fantasies
What I got is my sanity
My baby knows what I want
He's gettin' me in my thing
He better take what I got
Or he won't see me again
'Coz there's been too many guys
Just making moves on the floor
My baby's reading my mind
He knows that I'm needing more
I left my heart in Tokyo
Down by the river, don't you know?
I had to let it go
Nobody know, know, knows
That I left my heart in Tokyo
Down by the river, don't you know?
I had let it go
Nobody now can bring it home
(Nobody now can bring it home)
(Nobody now can bring it home)
Seventeen and dumb
