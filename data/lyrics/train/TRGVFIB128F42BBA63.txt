The kids need education
And the streets are never clean
I've seen a certain disposition
Prevailing in the wind

Sweet change, if anybody's listening?
Emergency on planet earth
Is that life that I am witnessing
Or just another wasted birth?

Now we got emergency
Emergency on planet earth
Now we got emergency
We got emergency on planet earth, just a head up

Think we're standing for injustice
