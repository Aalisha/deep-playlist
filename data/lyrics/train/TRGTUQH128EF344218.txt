Verse 1

If I'm here all alone, if I'm left behind.
If they spit in my face, if they hate my kind.
I will rise above, I will live for love, I will answer to the call.
For the bond between, for the depth unseen,
For my God forsake it all.

Chorus:

'Cause I'm a fire, I'm a flood, I'm a revolution(revolution)
I am a war,
already won
I'm a revolution (revolution) yeah...
yeah yeah yeah

Verse 2

When, the world is at war, when the grace is gone,
when the hungry lay dead, while the rich live on,
I will rise above, I will live for love, I will answer to the call.
