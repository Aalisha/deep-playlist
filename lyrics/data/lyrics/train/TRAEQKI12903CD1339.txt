You'll need some kind of saint to pull those
Impure thoughts right out your head
Love the poor complexity
You wouldn't want it any other way

Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more

Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more, a little bit

Just beating during the sun
Defibrillated hearts with every pulse
Without your own defiling
You'd backwards circle right above our heads

Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more

Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more, a little bit

Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more
Climbin' on, climb on aboard
Giving it a little bit more

Climbin' on, climb on aboard
...
