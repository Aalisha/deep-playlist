Butterflies

All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls
When I'm trying to get through, keep me wondering why
When all I can do is sigh, I just wanna touch you

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflys inside, inside and I

All I gotta say is that, I must be dreaming can't be real
