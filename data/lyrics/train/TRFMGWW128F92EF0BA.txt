It's not found in throwing roses on a grave
Or in the cursed bottom of a bottled plague
It wasn't in the torment that will never fade
But I see the truth now
This was my hell living without you here
Even heaven is hell if somehow you were not there
If you were not there
It wasn't in the flames that won't stop burning
...
