The thought of this is killing me, it's been on my mind
Can't believe it's been right here after all this time
And even though I love you I can't seem to find someone who cares the way you do
You know, I love the way we've always been nothing more than friends
So why do I give every man the stand up
Thought I was over this but once again I'm comparing you to him
And I find that there's no you in him that matters

Boy even though your my best friend
I can't help it whenever I compare you to him
It's like I always do this
With every single man
And I hate that I can't find someone who's worth my time
Just like my best friend
