There is danger in the fields of rape
Not too far from where you walk
There is danger on the path you take
Too late, you've gone too far

There's meaning in these words of hate
Hidden, yet to find
There's children behind an iron gate
Hiding swollen eyes

Change these fields of rape
Wash them away like the morning rain on your face
We gotta change these fields of rape
Take me away from the burning pain of this place

There is hunting in the fields of rape
...
