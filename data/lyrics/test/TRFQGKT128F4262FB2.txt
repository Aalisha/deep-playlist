Let me take you on a trip around the world and back
And you won't have to move, you just sit still
Now let your mind do the walking and let my body do the talking
Let me show you the world in my eyes
I'll take you to the highest mountain to the depths of the deepest sea
And we won't need a map, believe me
Now let my body do the moving and let my hands do the soothing
Let me show you the world in my eyes
