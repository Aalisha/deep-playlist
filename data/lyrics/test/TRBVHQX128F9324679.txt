I can't forgive you
This distance shorter as
The embering flames
Show retraction to your malice
With my false judgement
I can't fathom this commitment
You were lost in a time
Which I forgot
And I'm backwards
And you didn't think of me
You're beautiful I have never seen
Dangerous hands leave incisions
...
