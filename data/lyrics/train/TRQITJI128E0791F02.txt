When you're on... I swear, you're on
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
I think the whole room can hear me clear my throat
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
If you still care at all, don't go tell me now
If you love me at all...
Don't call

Then out of no where,
You put me right back there
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
And we know what happens
When we get to your house
...
