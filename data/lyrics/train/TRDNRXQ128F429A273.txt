La la la song
There is no substitution 
For the way I feel 
Didn't know this could be real 
Don't want no explanation 
For what is on my mind 
Cause I'm doing fine 
If it's a dream then let me sleep 
Only wake me when 
you're in my arms again 
I've been waiting for a while 
Now you gave me the reason why 
I was holding on singing lalala 
If it's an illusion let it flow 
Right or wrong I don't wanna know 
Keep it coming baby lalala
