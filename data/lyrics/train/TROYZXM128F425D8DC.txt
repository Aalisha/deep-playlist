We'll go down in history
Me lovin' you, you lovin' me, yeah

There's something about the way you kiss
It's in the stars, baby, we can't miss, no
Before you came along my heart was down
Then you walked right in and turned my world around

The best year of my life
Is the year that just went by since I met you

The best year of my life
Is the year that you made all my dreams come true
