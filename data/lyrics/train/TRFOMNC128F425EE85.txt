It's so stupid
[ok before I start anything I have to say
I have to say that I am undercover
and I am not to appear anywhere ok
It's between you and me]

I have to smile
I have to show
I have to be nice all the time
I have to say hello baby
I have to wake up everyday

I have to write
I have to shout
I have to play records all night
I am in a loop
I am the loop
I have to make up dress up show up
