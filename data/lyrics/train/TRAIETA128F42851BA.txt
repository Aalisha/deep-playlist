I come to you with honour
I come to you in vain
I've come to you my true love
In the greenwood you were slain

I do as much for my love
As any young man may
I'll sit and mourn her memory
For twelve months and a day

The sound of a drum
Is beating all around
Like a shadow on the run
Caught in the dark
And lover lay down
She lay down
...
