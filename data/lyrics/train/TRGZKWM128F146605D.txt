Heaven haunts me
Kill for a cigarette
Heaven is all that I got

My god left me
Without one word of warning
My god left me
Waiting is all that I got

I've seen your face before
I've seen your anger crashing down
All my life
I've seen your babies crashing to the ground

Needle brought me
Comfort to keep me stable
