Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna sing like you
The whole day through
Oh little bird why can't I be like you?

Oh little bird
Oh little bird I wanna be that brave
And never save
My loving for some other rainy day

You fly away
When it's cold and you can't find another way
But you will sing and you will love until you find a place
