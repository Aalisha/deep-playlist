I never felt this way about anyone before
My heart is racing, I need you more and more
Need your smile, need your face, need your touch on my skin
I don? t want this to end
I believe we can be something more then a dream
Forever you and me

Breathe, let me sink inside you soul
Trust me, I will be, here for you

Breathe, let me sink inside you soul
Trust me, I will be, here for you
