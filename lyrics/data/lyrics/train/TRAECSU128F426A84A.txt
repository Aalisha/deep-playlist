Do you remember, that there was a time
We were laughing at conventional guise
Long time ago we thought we were so cool
Rebels who fight for their set own of rules

Once you had idols,
Once you had drive
Master of treason
But you didn't survive
Insanity

Once you had idols,
Once you had drive
Master of treason
But you didn't survive

Greed twists your personality
