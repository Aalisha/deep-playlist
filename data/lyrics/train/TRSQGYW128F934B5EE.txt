A dark force is calling me, the black sun enlightens the scenery.
The horizon is filled with clouds so pride,
In a time when silence is not only a word or a feeling.

I'm on my way to march the fields of disbelief,
A certain thought, my senses disappear.
To see will never again be to believe
I'm dying for the chance to be!

I'm gonna be the one who tells his son
Not to do what I have done.
A time to mourn, a time to pray,
