Eleanor, put those boots back on
Kick the heels into the Brooklyn dirt

I know it isn't dignified to run
But if you run, you can run
To the Coney Island roller coaster
Ride to the highest point
And leap across the filthy water
Leap until the Gulf Stream's brought you down
Oh oh ohhhhh
I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land
...
