Sleepy rhythms were lulling us
Trolling down a long canal
Onto savage shores and gilded floors
Of coliseums through the load-in door

Certain of this one thing

My tongue was numb and I was feeling tired
Crying out in a wordless howl
Screeching off to the underground

Certain of this one thing (of this one thing)
Certain of this one thing (of this one thing)
Certain of this one thing (of this one thing)
That super slow motion got the upper hand on me
