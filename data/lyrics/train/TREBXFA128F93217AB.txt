A, a, a, aih
(Oh why, oh why)
My, my, my, my
(Tami deh pon yuh mind)
Why, oh why, oh why
(Why)
Hy, hy, hy, hy, hyperventilating

See your smile's, got me high
And I'm begging to be part of your sky
I will fly, seven four seven, twenty-four seven
What am I saying, hyperventilating
Want it to be the game that you been playing

A, a, a, aih
(All over sexy)
My, my, my, my
(You haffi wuk it, baby)
Why, oh why, oh why
(Keep me waiting)
Hy, hy, hy, hy, hyperventilating

Tek yuh time, join deh line fi knock me door
Rock mi body, till u can rock it no more
An if yu ready, yu fi really mek me soar
Like a bird in the sweet summer shore

And if yuh never know sey dat me waan yu do
Step aside 'cuz some'in muss do you
You either will or you won't, you do or yuh don't
Better play me right in every note
