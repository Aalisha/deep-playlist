You're my knight in shining armour

chase the devil and the dragons away.
From manana to manana do I am love you
yes I do do.
Storm or sun - you're the only one
and this is how I feel.

Rain or shine - you'll always be one in a million

my fantasy come true.
Rain or shine - it's you and me

cut me a heart on a tree and say
It's for ever
not a year and a day.
