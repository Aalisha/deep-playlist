Like a disease eating away at me
Your just another drug I'm an addict of
I can't play your fucked up guessing game
Jealous and out of my head

I know why you want me around
You've got someone to push around
And when I'm free, you're nothing but a memory
And when I'm free, you're nothing but a memory
And when I'm free, you're nothing but a memory
