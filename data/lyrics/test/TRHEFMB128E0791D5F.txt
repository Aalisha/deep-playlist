I've played the game of love before
Too young to know how hard the fall could be
I never thought I'd try again
Somehow you brought the gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high we'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holding says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feeling
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changing
And I know it's 'cause I'm falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
Falling in love
...
