I read all the philosophies
The theory ideologies
They leave me cold I sit around at tables talking
Long into the night and when we're walking home
You take me by the hand
You say you understand
And this is all the light I need

I know we've had our ups and downs
I play the fool I play the clown
Just like a man
I think it wouldn't be so bad
If only you believed I had some kind of plan
But as the evening fades
You say you're going to stay

And this is all the light I need
...
