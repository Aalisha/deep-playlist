Conversation fading all the while
Only resting my ears
In the nation was that token smile
Words been frozen for years

I won't ever find love anywhere
I won't ever find love here
I won't ever find love anywhere
I won't even find love here

I'll go
And join the silent world
Events blinded by pain
Spite now
Has its flag unfurled
Friendship drowned by the rain

I won't ever find love anywhere
I won't ever find love here
I won't ever find love anywhere
I won't even find love here
Laughing
