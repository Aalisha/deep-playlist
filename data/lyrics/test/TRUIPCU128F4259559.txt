Fashion weighs you down
Colors flash faces all around
Someone in control
Glad to be there in your hole
Live thru taken life
Comfort in the dimming light

Fight the war to make your mind
Drowing in the fear you cry
Untrue words are all you find
Where'd you learn to live the lie
Time again to touch inside
Sew the sight eye for eye
Why the pleasure as your guide
When you learn to live the lie
