I got a feeling I been dreaming
I been here before
She believes that I’ve been knocking
On another door
I don’t know who’s been talking
Someone’s out of order for sure

I know a lady needs attention
But there comes a time
When someone’s got to mention
That she’s out of line
Enough is enough
Her heart’s losing out to her mind

She’s packed her bags again
Says she’s going away
Think she’s gonna go far
But it won’t be today

She got a midnight reservation
On the nine o’clock train
