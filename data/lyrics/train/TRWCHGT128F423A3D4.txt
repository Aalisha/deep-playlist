See the stars from a million places
Porcelain skin puts our faces entwined in time
Never lost my way for you
Felt it all around me
Never gonna stop
Never stop anything at all
Repeat all that we do
Never gonna stop
Never stop anything at all
Let's start from the beginning

The times we've lost can be repaired
So be prepared
