I was an August baby
Conceived by the Christmas lights
I came into the world by the setting sun
On a humid summer night
When my grandmother held me for the very first time
She thanked God I looked like my daddy
And I never quite knew just what she meant
But I knew she was a little too happy
And now I see
You can't change a stubborn mind
You can't see the world if your eyes are blind
What does it matter anyway
In our darkest hour we're all just shades of grey

They got married in a tiny chapel
