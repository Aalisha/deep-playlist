There's a war going on inside no one is safe from
You can never run, hide, or escape from
The nature of beast with papers laced with deceit
I watch the wolves lead the wolf's leash in a nation of sheep
What the fuck you think they want? Is it hatred or peace?
Who designed the bombs or terrorists that made the disease?
They made you believe there's no one really crazy as me
As if I am the polluter who made it too hazy to see
Open up your eyes it's horrifying, it lays in your sleep
You eat the bullshit seven days of the week
If you could look past your block you would be raising your piece
At the police, instead the beef just stays in the streets
And the government still controls the ways we can speak
The apple don't fall far from the atheist tree
We should cry for the children who breathe
They going to bleed, there's a big difference in what we believe
I can't breathe

It's a spectacular terrorist event
Nuclear medicinemen smacking Dog with the six-finger Devil's hand
Blood Money's the only money there really is
Whether you bang on the block or boardroom for billions

It's such a hard grind trying to stay divine
The problem with the Devil is the bitch is so damn fine
