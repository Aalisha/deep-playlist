You have to have a party
When you're in a state like this
You can really move it all
You have to vote and change

You have to get right out of it
Like out of all this mess
You'll say yeah to anything
If you believe all this but

Don't cry, don't do anything
No lies, back in the government
No tears, party time is here again
President gas is up for president

Line up, put your kisses down
Say yeah, say yes again
Stand up, there's a head count
...
