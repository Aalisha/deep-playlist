Breathing in and out with tide
Leaving the mantra of a world outside
Faces bathed by moonbeams
All the sleepers send you their dreams

Rising from a wave of helping hands
A woman holds a statue till he becomes a man
Captured in her eyes he's finally complete
All the sleepers send you their dreams

Night terrors make you scream
