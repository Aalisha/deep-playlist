Confidential as a church at twilight (confidential)
sentimental as a rose in the moonlight (i love you)
my love for you will always be (confidential)
confidential to me (ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Confidential as a mother's prayer (confidential)
too beautiful for other hearts to share (it's a secret)
my love for you will always be (confidential)
