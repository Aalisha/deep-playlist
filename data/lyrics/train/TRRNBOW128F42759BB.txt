Oh, to get ahead in this world,
Takes a lot of kind words,
And ruthless damning actions,
And I hope, I never have to hurt you,
Though I gladly will do, my friend.

And I'll be reading in the kitchen,
Sipping lazy cups of tea,
I won't be brooding in my bedroom,
With the shutters down on me,

And this song is not cathartic,
Because I've done nothing wrong,
It's just a song,
It's just a song.
