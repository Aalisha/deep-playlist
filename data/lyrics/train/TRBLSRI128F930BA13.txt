In this supermarket city
Among the native smiles
You have to pay for attention
And do the best you can
There's a raging silence
And it's charged with action
Got no time for weakness
'cause I'm a bad bad man

Down the streets of darkness
Where they know my name
Lies a force of evil
And a destructive plan
There's no time for questions
When you run into danger
...
