Well boy meets girl and it's a good bet
Girls gonna play a little hard to get
But they both got the same thing on their mind
Ain't that the way that the world goes round
Don't it get you up get you down
It gets you walking around with a flashlight trying to find
Love

Oooh gotta getcha some gotta getcha some
Gotta getcha some Oooh gotta getcha some Love!

Then boy sees girl with another guy
What he wouldn't give just to catch her eye cause man
