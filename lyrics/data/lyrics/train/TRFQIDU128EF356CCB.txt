They're singing secular songs in the churches
And there's not a of word of God
It's all Schubert and Beethoven
Oh and lots of French love songs
So let's go down on Sunday morning
To hear that Jacob sermon read
Everybody dressed in their finest church apparel, baby
Listening to the preacher eulogies

Then we'll pray
Pray
Pray
Yeah we'll pray
Our souls will rise upon that day
Pray
Pray
