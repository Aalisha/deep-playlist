Now you think that you're so bright
running smooth when thing are right
Now you think you've payed the dues
soon you're down to sing the blues
So you think that you're so cool
well in my eyes a dancing fool
Now you think you've got it made
what's really you when stars fade

You, you stupid girl, you hit the sky, you own the world
