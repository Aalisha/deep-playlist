Can no longer stand the pain
Life and death both chains
Try to climb the human walls
Tear them down and see what remains
Emptied of the embattled false
Will to resist disappears
Emptied of half truths taught from birth
With the dawn of emptiness

Overjoyed with our pain
Fall asleep another thousand years
I hope we find eternal rest in the bed that we've made

All around is the sutra
All phenomena empty
With no beginning and no end
...
