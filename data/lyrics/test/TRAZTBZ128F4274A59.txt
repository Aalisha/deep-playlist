A thousand times I've seen you standing
Gravity like lunar landing
You make me want to run 'til I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you're all I hear
As everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I
Had any more to give
You're pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

I find a place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz sounds just like a 'fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
...
