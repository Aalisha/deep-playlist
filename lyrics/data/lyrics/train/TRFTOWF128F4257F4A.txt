Tell me what you're trying to say
I ask you man to man
Troubled visions, fucked up thoughts
Which I can't understand

So, you're a part of the master race
And plant the seeds of hate
You talk, the bullshit lies
It makes me nauseous

Be color blind and see the truth
Free your mind the problem is you
Problems that occur to yourself
Beyond your control

Fault of those who come to our land
...
