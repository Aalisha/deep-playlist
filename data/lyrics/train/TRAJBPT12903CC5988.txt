I'm gonna do this on my own
I've got to face this beast alone
I can see the shimmering of the scales
Somewhere in the deepest part of the lake
You won't be bothering my village no more
You won't be keeping us awake
You won't pollute the skies with sulphur and smoke
'Cause I got just what it takes, oh yeah...

I may seem like a child
But I carry a mark of the righteous
I may seem like a joke to you
...
