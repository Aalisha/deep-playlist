If it's hate that you speak
(Go to hell!)
And if you prey upon the weak
(Go to hell!)
Spreadin' lies and deciets
(Go to hell!)
Eternal flames, feel the heats
(Go to hell!)
And if you cannot make amends
(Go to hell!)
And if you follow every trend
(Go to hell!)
And if you back stab your friends
(Go to hell!)
If you ain't down 'til the end
(Go to hell!)

The chosen one, the wicked son, they call Hitchcock
Talk some shit and I'ma hit you with this quick block
Body parts are scattered and sealed up in ziplocks
With my steel cats get ill'd up to six blocks
You can try to run away but you won't get far
They call me Prozak, BITCH!, the knight of Templar
I'll open up your brain like the Deathstar
And lyrics come to me like ghosts from the graveyard

Since my birth I've been obsessed with the dead
