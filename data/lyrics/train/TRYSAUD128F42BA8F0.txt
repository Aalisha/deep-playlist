Yeah, Yeah
Yeah
I don't miss you
I'm a dismiss you
I'm a kiss you, next time I see you
It's true

[Chorus:]
Give all your lovin', give all your war
I don't need much of that
No, no, I'm a be alright, I'm a be alright

Seventeen, hero beauty queen introduced to me
She in the Hollywood scene
Moved to Cali from NYC
It's been eight months and she ain't happy
A couple shots of Patron, she eased the pain
Chased it with some Jack just to smile again
The everyday routine
Of a broken teen who left her heart close to where she left her dreams
Hidden tucked away so far now they missing
I took her hand and said baby listen
For every moment you waste, there's another right behind it to take it's place
Cause life goes on when it ain't so sweet
Don't give up on it
Get back on your feet
