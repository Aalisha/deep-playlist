(HELLO)
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
Hung by his pretty white neck
Some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
And I missed my bed
And I soon came home
They said: "There's too much caffeine
In your blood stream
And a lack of real spice in your life"
I said: "Leave me alone
Because I'm alright, dad
Surprised to still be on my own."
Oh but don't mention love
...
