Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling
I could love someone, I could trust someone

I say that never let nobody near my heart again, darling
I say, I'd never let nobody in but

If you asked me to, I'd just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to, I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to, if you asked me to

Somehow ever since I've been around you
Can't go back to being on my own
(On my own)
