Well its been awhile since i did something i could get arrested for
all the girls i ran around with dont run around no more
those days of racing cars and closing down bars are winding down i feel like the only cowboy left here in this town

cuz i raised enough hell for my next fifty years, dodgin work, chasin skirts and shotgun'n beers
i need to act my age so i've been told, but man this growing up is getting old
