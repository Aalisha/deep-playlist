How many times
Are you gonna take it 
Look in my eyes
Help me make this make sense 

Night after night 
You sat up n cried
Wondering when you're gonna see things clearer
You don't even realise
That at this very moment 
You're talking to yourself in the mirror

It's true 
So you think I'm strong but you're feelin that you're weak
Baby I'm you 
But we're one in the same so you're just as strong as me
Baby I'm you 
And we deserve better its time for us to leave
You know what to do
Cause I'm not a fool
So neither are you
Baby I'm you 

Oh you're not crazy
