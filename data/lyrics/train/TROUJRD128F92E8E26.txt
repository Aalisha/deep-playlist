Kill me if you dare, hold my head up everywhere
Keep myself right on this train
I'm the underdog, live my life on a lullaby
Keep myself riding on this train
Keep myself riding on this train

Love in Technicolor sprayed out on walls
Well, I've been pounding at the pavement till there's nothing at all
I got my cloak and dagger in a bar room brawl
See the local loves a fighter, loves a winner to fall

Feels like I'm lost in a moment
I'm always losing to win
Can't get away from the moment
