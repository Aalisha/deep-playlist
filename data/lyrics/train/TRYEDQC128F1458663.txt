Make me a deal and make it straight
All signed and sealed, I'll take it
To Robert E. Lee I'll show it
I hope and pray he don't blow it 'cause
We've been around a long time just try try try tryin' to
Make the big time...
Take me on a roller coaster
Take me for an airplane ride
Take me for a six days wonder
But don't you, don't you throw my pride aside, besides
