Uh, uh, yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yo, I ain't got no reason to trick or spend
Mami, I'm the reason the chicks begin cheesein' and snickerin'
Playa like me, every season these chicks have been
Talkin' how I came through the P's in a sicker Benz
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends
Jewels so icey, I need freezers to sitck 'em in
I be's in the keys wit a click of friends
Trees and a liquor blend, I be too queezy and sick to grin

I dont care if a skeezer is thick or thin
It's gon' look like she havin' a seizure I stick it in
Skeos say "Can I get the keys to ya six again?"
After I nut, that's when amnesia be kickin' in
Most broads I done met, ain't see a guy
Who spend a G on Gucci T's, five for sweats
I'm what chicks strive to get, I stay in the P.J's
You thinkin', I'm talkin' pivate jets, uh

I need the cash in my palm, the ice in my charm, ma' be easy
(Watch it, please)
Wanna lean to the side while I cruise in your ride, ma' be easy
(Put down that cheese)
Gotta have a broad wantin' and let me hold somethin', ma' be easy
(You get nothin' from me)
