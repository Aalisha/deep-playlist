Thou art God, all the evidence I ever need
Never shake my faith, I know, I know what it means
No books, no magic words, we don't need a ritual
Absolute truth, it's so personal

Now I understand
Now I know it's true
Now I know it's me
Now I know it's you

You are
You're my religion now
You're my religion

You and I remain, we're one in the same
No flesh, no blood can change
No more doubt or fear, your mouth to my ear

Use me, flow through me, I am listening
Sing through me, let the song be pure
I know why I'm here, I've been here before
I know how it ends, it never ends

Now I understand
 (Heaven and hell)
Now I know it's true
 (Heaven and hell)
