One day while I was eating beans at Smokey Joe's Cafe
Just sittin diggin'all the scenes at Smokey Joes's Cafe
A chick came walkin through the door
That I had never seen before
At least I never saw her down at Smokey Joe's Cafe
And I started shakin'when she sat right down next to me

Her knees were almost touching mine at Smokey Joe's Cafe
A chill was running down my spine at Smokey Joe's Cafe
I could smell her sweet perfume
