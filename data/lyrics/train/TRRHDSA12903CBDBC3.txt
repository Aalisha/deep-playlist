Lord You know that I'm no saint
But there is alot of things A aint.
I Aint the smartest guy around
Or the toughest guy in town.
I'm just the way that I was made
There maybe more that I could be
But I am proud of being me.
I know the worth of an honest day
Give him the Glory when I pray.
Thats all he ask I do believe

I've got people that I love
