Blue and you lean on me
You know that you're crushing me
You're sulking and I can not breathe
You're sitted in the clouds
You're building a well cross the light
An unusual nightmare for me

Collecting dead rainbows
From puddles on my hills
Taken home to warm by the fire
The flower's in bloom
It will never expire
It's just coming round again

I'm tearing my heart from the seams
I keep tearing my heart on the seams
