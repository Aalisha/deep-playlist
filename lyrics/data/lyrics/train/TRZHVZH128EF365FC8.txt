Break down the government walls
speak in tongues, power is money
I see our interest fall well behind their curtain
break down the government walls
infiltrate our television
Break down the government walls
trying to be outspoken

I can hear the sound of falling masonry
as they try to plug that leak
I am tempted by their cloak of secrecy
to find out what their games are about

Ask a question and they'll talk
of secret services
secrets from the people they should serve
and they can hide their crimes
in a legal disguise
truth will not be seen or heard

Break down the government walls
bring them down within my lifetime
let's see the curtain drawn
see what they're concealing
Break down the government walls
secrecy suggests deception
Break down the government walls
Trying to be outspoken
