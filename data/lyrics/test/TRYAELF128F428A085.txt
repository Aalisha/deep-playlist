There's a little girl in our neighborhood
Her name is Charlotte Johnson and she's really lookin' good
I had to go and see her, so I called her on the phone
I walked over to her house and this was going on

Her brother was on the sofa, eatin' chocolate pie
Her Mama was in the kitchen cuttin' chicken up to fry
Her daddy was in the backyard rollin' up a garden hose
I was on the porch with Charlotte, feelin' love down to my toes

And we were swingin', yes we were swingin'
