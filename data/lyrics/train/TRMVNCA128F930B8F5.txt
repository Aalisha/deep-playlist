At the end of all creation
The world is standing still
Eternal damnation
For all who have sinned

Hear the clash up in the atmosphere
There's silence everywhere
We're daring not to move or breathe
There's tension in the air

We obey the light
And it's blazing rays of might
Believe

Take the eyes of the world and fly
To the land where all the angels cry
...
