We sing 1 an a 2 and a 3 and 4!
Born Jamericans
About your door!

Well Jamaica is an island me seh under the the sun
ah na dessa mi born
but mi heritage from
Washington where we livin' ah the heart of Babylon
No one elese can sing the yardcore song (sing along)

Yardcore de people want more
A nuttin less an' a nuttin more
Yardcore

Y-a-r-d c-o-r-e de people want more!
Y-a-r-d c-o-r-e yardcore de people want more!

North and the west
And they wantin' more
People of the world want more yardcore
People of the world you know i'm talkin' to you
So, here we see that light of day
We'll always pave the way
For the chorus to remain the same
Even thought it might not happen right now
But we know that it won't be long
Cuz our vibes are just too strong
We will endure for sure
People of the world want more yardcore

Not an accident
