I'd rather be with you, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you

I'd rather be with you until I'm through, oh yes, I do
I'd rather be with you until the day we fly away
I just love to see a smiling face in the early sun
And if I can't have you to myself, then life's no fun

I'd rather be with you, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you, yeah
