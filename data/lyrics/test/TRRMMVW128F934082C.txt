Folks here's a story 'bout Minnie the Moocher
She was a red hot hoochie coocher
She was the roughest, toughest frail
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale.

Ho-dee, ho-dee, ho
Ho-dee, ho-dee, ho
Hi-dee, hi-dee, hi-dee, hi
Hi-dee, hi-dee, hi-dee, hi
Hey-dee, hey, hey-dee, hey
Whoah, whoah

She messed around with a bloke named Smokey.
She loved him though was cokie
He took her down to Chinatown
