Rockin' little angel
Come down from the sky
Down from the sky
Come on down from the sky
Rockin' little angel
Come down from the sky
Come on down and stop a-teasing me
(Come on down, stop teasing me}

(Stop teasing little angel)
(Stop teasing little angel)

Rockin' little angel, I love you so
I love you so, I love you so
Rockin' little angel
I love you so
I want the whole wide world to know
(I want the whole wide world to know}

Rock (rock) rock (rock}
Little angel
