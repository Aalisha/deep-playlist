Deformed living hemorrhage knotted into flesh
Betrayal lives within hosts
Anchored in bones
Surviving on secrets told

All screams are but whispers
In the realm of the barely living
Unravelled in the arms that carried
If it’s still worth loving it’s still worth letting go

One last nail
In the coffin of all your trust
Where there once was love now lives total disgust
...
