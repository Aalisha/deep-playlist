Hey baby, let's jump in your truck
We'll ride and watch for lightning bugs
We'll ride with the windows let down
There's nowhere else I'd rather be right now

'Cause there ain't nothing like the sound of a cooler slushing
On the bed of your truck
And ain't nothing like the sound of real country music
C'mon, turn it up
And I love to hear the whippoorwill sing any night
And the crickets out in the woods
Ooh, and don't it feel so right
Don't it sound so good
