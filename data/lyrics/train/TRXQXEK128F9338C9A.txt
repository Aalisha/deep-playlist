Who's the lovin' daddy with the beautiful eyes
what a pair o' lips, i'd like to try 'em for size
i'll just tell him, "baby, won't you swing it with me"
hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
so, i said politely "darlin' may i intrude"
he said "don't keep me waitin' when i'm in the mood"
First i held him lightly and we started to dance
then i held him tightly what a dreamy romance
and i said "hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
there's a mess of moonlight, won't-cha share it with me"
"well" he answered "baby, don't-cha know that it's rude
to keep my two lips waitin' when they're in the mood"
In the mood, that's what he told me
