Watching inhabitions
Falling to the floor
Notice how you locked the door
What would you love to do?

Here in this hotel room
Together and alone
I want you to put on a show
What would you love to do?
What you love to say?
What would you love?

Princess,
I just wanna witness
Watch you severing the velvet
I won't say the word - say the word

Princess,
I just wanna witness
Watch you severing the velvet
