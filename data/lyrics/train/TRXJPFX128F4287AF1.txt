Take this weight from off this chest.
Crush and kill all that is left.
Bend your will unto the task.
The hammer falls, it falls.
To forge a man that's free from fear.
Clothed in hate that's seared for years.
I will be the one to outrun fate.
And I will die upon my feet.

All I need is a good mistake.
One more look at the devil's face.

Beaten, broken, bruised and blind.
One more twisted hulking rhyme.
