A Hundred Thousand Years
A Hundred Thousand Miles Of Track
A Hundred Thousand Tears
Hundred Thousand Souls
You Can't Give Back

When The Dark Subsides
An Eternity Goes By
On The Fault Line
Between Then And Now

When The Truth Hides
An Eternity Goes By
On The Fault Line
Between Then And Now

Grace To Grace
Immaculate Vision
Of What Should Have Been

Face To Face
Eloquent Stories
Of What Could Have Been
...
