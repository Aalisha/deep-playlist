You kiss me, kill me, push me, pull me, leave me wanting more
You keep your promises back behind the bedroom door
You hit me harder than I ever have been hit before
I don't know why

Baby, baby, long before I met you I was
Crazy, crazy to forget you but just
Maybe, what you see is what you get for sure
Can't take this anymore

If you can feel it when it comes down
And you can see it coming around and around
If you believe this is a moment, control it
You feel it getting better, back where we belong

We keep on playing games and reaching out for something new
