Centralize come center in your fool
Centralize centrifugal in your fool

our modernized a thinking
when I ancient babylon, aye[ ]??

instead a stop and get a scheme for things

to them representing a must of how great them art
to be so pompous and unforgiving

to survive, the tings man do and did
would a surely, done dead long time, and suffer whole
blind
drop your food, foolish of de mouth and you fe keep
stay put
