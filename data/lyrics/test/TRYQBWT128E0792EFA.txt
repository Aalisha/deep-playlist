Well, we've been here once before
And we've stuck it out for more
When we come around
We'll settle down the cracks below the floor

Has it been eleven years
Since I've stood here with my peers
And we started out to conquer doubt and Frisbee

I should've been a whole lot farther
I'm never going back to college
For just one good day job

You're not missing much for sure
