Always told to take more care
But touch that skin and you'd be there
A voice so clear but far away
Picking up on every word I say

To tell the truth I can't even lie
No politician or a secret spy
I give to you
I give to you

No one else can make me
You pick me up and take me
You got it, you got it

My soul, it lies
My heart, it tries
My mind is spent
My love...

You can take it all
At your beck and call
...
