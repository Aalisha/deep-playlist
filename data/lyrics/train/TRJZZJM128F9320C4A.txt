When I die won't you please feed me
To the lions of the Kalahari?
I don't care if they eat my bones
? Cause I know I won't be goin? home

Oh, it's never far away from me
Oh, it's never far away from me

Rubber on dust as the wheels go round
I had never heard a sweeter sound
Till the day that I heard my baby cry
These things I shall carry until I die
