I've been down this road once or twice before;
Through the open door;
I come falling through it.
There's a sign post up ahead;
Like a watershed;
And it opens my eyes!
Ways! ways, for me to begin;
to be born again;
And knowing for the first time!
Ways! ways, all so differently;
Shine for me to see;
The better man that I am!

I've been places in my Head!
Behind me worse than what's ahead;
And on my path just like a Dream!
Takes me from the inbetween;
From out of nowhere you came strong as Stone!
And now I'll never have to be Alone!
what it is I know;

You have always been my safe Home!
