1: I'm gonna build a mountain, from a little hill.
I'm gonna build a mountain, least I hope I will.
I'm gonna build a mountain, I'm gonna build it high.
I don't know how I'm gonna do it, only know I'm gonna try.

I'm gonna push the daydream, up that mountain slope.
I'm gonna build a daydream, woah, I'm gonna see it through.
Gonna build a mountain and a daydream,
Gonna make 'em both come true.
3: I'm gonna build a heaven, as a will someday,
