Poisonous Mandrake, you danerous root
One of the three fates, when a man's time has come

You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the Devil might take you for a man

White Mandragora, with you root so thick, you are the male
Black as the night on the outside, inside you're like a moon

You look so human, so different from any other plant
Youlook so human, that the Devil might take you for a man

Your leaves spread out... so close to the ground
Mandrake root, your berries are just like the sun
Mandrake root, as a female your root will be forked
Your juice has been known, to take away lives
...
