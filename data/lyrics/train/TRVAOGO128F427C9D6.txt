Trapped inside of your eyes,
gleam like stars above, emptiness inside.
Caught inside of your arms, warmer than the sun,
emptiness so full.

Although I can see, time is not running out,
I still run behind everything.
I don't understand, I embrace every thought,
everyword... everything

You're watching, my heart being, so close to you,
your bleeding thoughts.
Open wounds still breathing
...
