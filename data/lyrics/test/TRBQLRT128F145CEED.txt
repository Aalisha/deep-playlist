All my life I've tried to please
Disregarding my own needs
Now it's time for me to be free!

And if you don't like it
You can do what you wanna do
And if you don't invite it
It ain got to have nothing to do with you

Lemme be what I want to
Can I be me?
I need to be what I want to be
I'm an individual, I'm into individuality
I'm an individual, I'm into individuality
