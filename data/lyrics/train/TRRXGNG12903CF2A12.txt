Jesus said here I stand
Won't you please let me in
And you said I will tomorrow

Jesus said I am He
Who supplies all your needs
And you said I know but tomorrow
Ooh, tomorrow

I'll give my life tomorrow
I thought about today
But it's so much easier to say

Tomorrow, who promised you tomorrow
Better choose the Lord today
For tomorrow very well might be today
