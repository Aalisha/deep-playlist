Reality is a game you cannot win, so you feel betrayed, so fool again
Nothing is real, nothing is true, and the way seems to be so hard

Right here, right now, see the scorn behind your perfect slave design

Take the red pill, feel the blast flowing in your mouth
Fatalistic comatose, necrosis is feeding the patterns of lies x2
