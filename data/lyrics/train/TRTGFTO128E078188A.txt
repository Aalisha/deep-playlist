I'm looking 'bout and I'm listenin' good
I used to dance and now I stand
Can't recall if I changed
The fact remains, things ain't the same

Look up about and listen good
They take your bunce and that's not all
The more they scratch, the more you'll itch
It's a condition that we'll have to cure

DJVD, DJVD

It won't get me, originality deficiency
Take your decks and swivel, swing
Don't you try to tell me, how to live my life
Don't you try to tell me, what's honey and what is spice

DJ pull the plug on that

Standing in a bar, feet on the floor
Chilling out and digging the scene
