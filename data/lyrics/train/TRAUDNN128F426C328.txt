If time itself was his demeanor
There'd be no sunlight or a glimmer
Of sunlight landing on the street
Sunsuit girls must be discreet

Sunsuit girls must be discreet
Nursing their fathers locked inside
They masqueraded as his bride

I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
I might like you better
If we slept together
But there's something
In your eyes that says
Maybe that's never
Never say never

The slump by the courthouse
With windburn skin
That man could give a fuck
About the grin on your face
As you walk by, randy as a goat
He's sleeping on papers
But he'd be warm in your coat

I might like you better
...
