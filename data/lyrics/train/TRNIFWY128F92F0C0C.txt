I know a man
He was born to be a poor
It made him so complain now (?)
He decided to settle the score
He hit a bank
Said he'd like taking care of my child (?)
He will leave him high on the hole (?)
But he only left for a little while
Knock at his door
Who could it be
Noone (?) but the Law
And then he put his gun yeah
And he shot the first men he saw
He killed them dead
You know the other men shot back
...
