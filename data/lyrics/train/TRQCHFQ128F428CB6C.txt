Her mother used to hit her
To an uncontrolled consumption of an absolute solution
Experience with drug abuse
Taking this drug of peace
Slowly taking it's toll

Never question, love thru addiction
Collecting this emptiness
Recollect a calm self-centered guess
Every broken promise
To bleed the soul free
Faith is not the answer
A promise that must end

Left her standing to face her own way
