Voice your choice
Voice your choice

Voice your choice
Tell me who do you love
Am I the one, oh... oh... 
That you're thinkin' of

You know you look so good
Oh, oh, it's really a crime
For just one girl
Yeah, to be so fine

You've got all the boys
Standing in line
Tell me who do you love
Girl, make up your mind
...
