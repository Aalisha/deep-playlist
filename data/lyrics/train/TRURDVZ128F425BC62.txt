Hey, I'm Rikki Dee, I work at the W.C.
From time to time, I groove just to earn my key
Meet all the skums, punks and berries, both sharp and small
Some of them stink, and there's some you don't notice at all
No no no no...
Chorus:
Rikki Dee, I'm the one at the W.C (Rikki Dee)
Work all night just to earn my key (Rikki Dee)
