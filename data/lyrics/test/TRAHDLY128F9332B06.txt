Fly covered flesh
On rotting bones
The stench of blood
Agonizing smell of death

Endless time of silence
Energy been lost
Covered in pestilence
Making up the final plot

A forgotten question
Does nothing but fill my mind
All the words that weren't said
Put me on that ride
Too scarred to tell
Rejected heaven for hell
Just another loser astray
In the cycle of decay
