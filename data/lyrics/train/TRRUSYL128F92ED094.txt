Window walkin' downtown, feelin' mighty good
and I noticed from the corner how all alone she stood
Underneath the lamplight, an angel in disguise
Lonely little runaway with teardrops in her eyes

Crazy little ragdoll, her hair was wild and tossed
and I put my arm around her, 'cause I knew that she was lost
She didn't seem to notice that anyone was near
'till suddenly she turned to me and whispered in my ear

Point me in the direction of Albuquerque
I want to go home, and help me get home
...
