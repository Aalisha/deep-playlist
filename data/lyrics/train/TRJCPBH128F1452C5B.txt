Yeah
This is a message from the mother
Let's go girl
She told me to tell my brother she loves you and I do too
Yes yes
'Cuz you're my superstar
You're my superstar
You're superstar
Yeah
Come on

It's a pretty day let's go outside and enjoy it
If you got something else in mind then I'm all for it
I will take the chance I will take your hand
Then we'll go there, go there

Love isn't something that you earn, it's deserved
Love is something I can give 'cuz I'm worth it
You amaze me I am taken in
You're so lovely, I can

I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar
I can see you tell me what you wanna do
I know who you are, you're my superstar

My man said heaven is a day away
