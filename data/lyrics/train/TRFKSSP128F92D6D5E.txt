I'm just a fool for you, baby
I'm just a fool for your love
You take me half the way to heaven
And you know it's not enough
I'm just a fool for your love.

You've got me wanting to be near you
You know I want this love to grow
You say you like to keep things simple
And you don't want any ties
But I see a different story in your eyes.
