Loving you, gives me something new
I've never felt
Your eyes and your smile and your casual style
Are rock up the new

I thought that I was playing
Trying to keep on saying
That I have you, baby
Yes I do
I've tried to keep from filling
All the things I'm felling
But I love you, Oh girl
Yes I do, Oh baby

Girl I love you more
That I dare to say
That love cannot hide
