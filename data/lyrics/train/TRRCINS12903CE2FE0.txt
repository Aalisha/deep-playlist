I've had big dreams come true and I believe in
Angels although I can't see them
They're watching over everything I do

Ain't no easy street around the bend on my road
No pot of gold at the end of my rainbow
But I don't mind 'cause, baby, I got you

The rain keeps the flowers from dyin'
The sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket
Of stars and the moon and, baby, I got you
