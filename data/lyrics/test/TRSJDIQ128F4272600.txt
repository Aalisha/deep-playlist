I wake and I miss the sea
What can I miss of the ether?
I sleep and I wish for not a thing at all.
But the rest of the rest that will take me
The rest of the rest that will take me,
Breathe air.

Now, which of these things, mother,
Will give the dust less age?
For none of them was or will be,
But they're all given, find me.
