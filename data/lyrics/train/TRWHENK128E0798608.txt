Fourty-nine percent
One percent short of half
And less than half
Ain't really much of nothing
Fourty-nine percent
One percent short of half
And less than half
Ain't really much of nothing
I won't try to dent you right
Or stop your flight
I've known our plight
You know I'm right
I know about your little fling
How you hide your ring
You senseless thing
I'll cut this string
The heat has simmered for a while
It's not my style
So versatile and with a smile
At anytime, I could explode
When you kissed your toad
You kissed your princely episode
Fourty-nine percent
One percent short of half
And less than half
Ain't really much of nothing
Fourty-nine percent
One percent short of half
And less than half
Ain't really much of nothing
Bit off more than one could bite
And the taste is slight
It leaves this dullish appetite
