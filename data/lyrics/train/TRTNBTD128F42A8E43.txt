Crashing down on consensus. It's the vice that kills defenses.
Piercing through sort of feeling. It only hurts if I let it take
control of me. Won't let the world weigh me down. Cause I'm
coming alive. What's the deal with life lessons? If you can't
forget regret them. Taught to fold under pressure. Failure
doesn't mean you have to die. Won't let the world weigh me down.
