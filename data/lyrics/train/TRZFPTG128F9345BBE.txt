Stone love, she kneels before the grave
A brave son, who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love, a boy and girl they talking
New words, that only they can share in
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep, through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
...
