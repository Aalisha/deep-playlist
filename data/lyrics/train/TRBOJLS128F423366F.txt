Feels like clouds today
The sky is gray
The sun been hiding for a while

People walk by the window of his car
Look in, lock eyes
Betray their thoughts with a smile

'Cause you know your gaze is cold and distant
Your stare could chill in an instant
This January air

But why refuse an old friend's offer
For a warm ride in a car
From here to there
