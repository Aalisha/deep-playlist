Ooh, sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

In and out my life [(In and out my life)]
You come and you go [(You come and you go)]
Leaving just your picture behind [(Ooh)]
And I've kissed it a thousand times [(Ooh)]

When you snap your finger or wink your eye
I come a-running to you
I'm tied to your apron strings
And there's nothing that I can do, ooh

I can't help myself
No, I can't help myself
...
