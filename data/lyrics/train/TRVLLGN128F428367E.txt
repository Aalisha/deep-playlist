Shut this thing off, I can't take, anymore
The weight is gone, still I can't, let it go

I can't take anymore
Is this all we are (all we are)
Can you help me sleep again

My body's numb, and what I touch, turns to stone
(oh) The more I learn, (oh) the less I know, (oh) the more I'm lost

I can't take anymore
Is this all we are (all we are)
...
