She blew into this old one horse town
Like something we ain't never seen
And old Bill hired her at the Sundown Grill
She tied that apron 'round her jeans

I started hanging out there every night
Just to hear her talk and laugh
I couldn't help but fall in love with her
I should've known it wouldn't last

She always talked about Mexico
I never thought that she would really go
I felt my love could make her settle down
I guess I know better now
