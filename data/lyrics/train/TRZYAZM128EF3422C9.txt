Ask me all about rejection
Ask me all about disgrace
Ask me all about repression
I won't blink though it's in my face

Ask me when I learned to hide
And just how I got to keep it all inside
Ask me why I built a wall
'Cause I've got no choice
I have to swallow it all

For you
I'm losing my faith
I'm choosing my fate
It's so late now
I can't bear the weight

I'm losing my faith
I'm choosing my fate
It's so late now
I can't bear the weight

I'm losing my faith
I can't bear the weight

Tell me all about forgiveness
