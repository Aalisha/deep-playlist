baby, oh yeah
baby, oh yeah

You don't ever bring no drama to the game
and my drama don't be scaring you away
you dont ever talk to much
exactly just enough
you know how and when and where and what to say

it aint like i gotta tell you your so fine (your so fine)
you been gettin complements since you was nine (damn)
its like your perfect (...)
a dimond in the rough
I knows you give me nothin else but love (love)

You are such a mad sexy cool girl
how does someone turn into you girl
how do you explain
what you do
what you say
how you be
how you play
how you love
everyday
how your constantly the same
how you give
never hate
and you dont ever change
be consistantly that way
your a mad sexy cool girl, and i love you that way
baby, oohhhhh

you be ruling with a certain shade of cool (shade of cool)
i dont know no body half as fresh as you
i be checkin your behaviour
oh baby you got so much flavour
sometimes i wanna call you juicy fruit (juicy)
