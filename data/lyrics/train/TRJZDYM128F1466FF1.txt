Moving out, can you see that shine
Feel the change as you roll on down the line
Where the shore fires burn out on a new frontier
Where the past don't haunt you and there's
Nothing else to fear

Baby don't you hold out too long
they might not let you be

(CHORUS)
Movin' out feel the wind in your hair
Where the sun shines at night, I can take you there
To the land of the midnight sun,
Ragged Ass Road
