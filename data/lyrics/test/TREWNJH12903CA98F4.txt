You just walked in through the door
And you're home late again
Now you're acting strange
And you won't tell me where you've been

You can look me in the eyes
Imagine every alibi
Think you've got it made but boy
There's something you don't know

When you left your room
You shouldn't have forgot your phone
I just heard your messages
And this is where it ends

Been getting away with the [Incomprehensible] so long
Boy you're at the point you don't know right from wrong

You're never gonna change
You're feeling me, you're feeling me
You hear what I'm saying
You're feeling me, you're feeling me

All I know is
No I don't forgive ya, no tears left to cry
The door is shut, I give up, boy I'm empty
Gave you second chances at least a hundred times
You're not the one, I am done in fact you offend me
