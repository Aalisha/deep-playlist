No way, no way, no way

When I leave your door, when we say goodnight
It hurts me more and more
'Cause, girl, it just ain't right
To end the day like this

With no more than a kiss
And spend the night
Just dreaming of the things
We're gonna miss

If I have my way
Girl, we'd be together more
And more each day
We'd go on forever

Lovers, hand in hand
Can't you understand
Girl, you've got to be my woman
I've got to be your man
