Feel my heart awake
Each time I call your name
Oh darling, I can't help it
I'm walking on the moon
Never ending story
Woman meeting man
I'm losing concentration
What's happening to me?
Hey, you pull the wires
Of my love, in every way
Hey, my desire
Is your love, right away
You pull the wires
(Moving me, baby)
Of love's desire
(Loving you)
You pull the wires
