So the story begins:

City dweller, successful fella
Thought to himself
"Oops, I've got a lot of money"
Caught in a rat race terminally

I'm a professional cynic
but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit 
Caught in the century's anxiety
Yes it preys on him (preys on him)

He's getting thin (getting thin) {tricycle life}

He lives in a house, 
a very big house in the country
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills
and piles up analyst bills in the country
Oh, it's like an animal farm,
lots of rural charm in the country

He's got morning glory 
...
