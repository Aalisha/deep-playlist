I guess he's working late again
I don't need to wonder where he is
But I do
He oughta know that by now

I know his job takes a lot of him
There's not much left for him to give
But I need more
He oughta know that by now

It's not like he's gotta read my mind to know what I'm feelin' after all this time
It's just too hard to hold on to what's never around
He oughta know that by now
