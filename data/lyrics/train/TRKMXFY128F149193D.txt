You answer questions like a natural disaster
Voices in the wind- you let em call her out
The whole foundation just went flying past her
She puts her heart into it - and you just yank it out

You pulled her love out through the window pane
Thats what she gets for loving a hurricane

She could have rode off with some Texas tornado
Some mister twister she could kick up her boot heels with
Could have rode him on down to Laredo
But you flew in from the gulf like a hot wet kiss
