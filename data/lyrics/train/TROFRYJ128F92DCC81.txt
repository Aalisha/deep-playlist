I'm a lady's man, oh yes siree, 
I like the gals and the gals like me
Can I make 'em swoon, oh yes I can
Don't know what it is about me they love
But what it is I got plenty of
Make way for me, I'm a lovin' lady's man.

I'm a lady's man and that's no crime
I like 'em round me all of the time
I've got a line of talk they understand
Now you may like a baseball game
But as for me that's much too tame
I get my thrill just bein' a lady's man.
