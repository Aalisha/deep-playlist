On some nights you'll find me falling.
I am formless, I am shapeless.
And on some nights i am better left alone.
You take it all in from some severed state of stasis.
You scream "wake up!" inside your own body
But you're buried... or suffocating... or worse.
Tonight it's worse. Tonight the screaming hurts.

Chorus
Tonight I'm wrapped up in her.
We find each other under blankets as warm as summer.
We are inseperable.
