Walk away when you're angry
Brace yourself, there's nothing to gain
Old enough to know the outcome
More blood, it's always the same.

Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For facing death we run head-on
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For God we search for something so long
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For facing death we run head-on.

Do what they say
Or they take it away
I'd rather be dead than carry on
...
