Look at me who's your daddy now
Bringing your candy satisfaction guaranteed
There's war that's what we men are built for
I am entertainment I bring the battle to your door

Old machines marching through your streets
Sound of steel tearing through your body
How does it feel now that I am in control?
How does it feel now that I am you?

I never wanted
I never needed
Anything like this before
I never wanted
I never needed
Anything like this before

Look at me who's your daddy now
Bringing your candy satisfaction guaranteed
There's war that's what we men are built for
I am entertainment I bring the battle to your door

I love your guns uhuh
