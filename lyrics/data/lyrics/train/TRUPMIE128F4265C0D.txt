People all over the world are the same everywhere I go
I give in to this, I give in to that
Every day it bothers me so

Am I in a bad situation
People taking me to the exteme
Am I being used
I just need a clue
I don't know which way to go

So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out, he don't know
Took it to a palm reader so she could
Read my hand, she don't know
Five minutes later I started to understand
I started screaming, shouting, acting mad
No one could help me but myself
