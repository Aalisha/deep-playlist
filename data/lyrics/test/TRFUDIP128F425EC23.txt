You got my attention at hello
We had this connection that wouldn’t let go
There was something sexy ‘bout your voice
Anything you say makes a beautiful noise

And now we break up to make up right away
Just an excuse to lay in bed all day
I know that this thing we have wont ever change
And that’s why I have the confidence to say

A lot of girls are sexy but you know how to use it
You can keep me up on the phone all night
We say let's hang up on 3 but we don’t ever do it
Ain't it crazy how after all this time

We got that you hang up, no you hang up kinda love
We got that you hang up, no you hang up kinda love
