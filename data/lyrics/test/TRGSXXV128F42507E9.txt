"We yearn for the battle and the glory... but my heart doesn't stray from home...
We're joined by the dwarves of the underworld, the elves of
the deepest forests, the highland barbarians and the knights of the most
radiant orders...
Together we will defend this world...
And victorious we shall be
Ride on..."

We ride into the sunset
And race towards the dawn
We carry on beyond the horizon
Past the night to see the sun again

For the glory, for the splendour
...
