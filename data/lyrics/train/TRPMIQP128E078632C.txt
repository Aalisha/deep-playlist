Tell me something I don't know
'Cause we've been there ten times before
Make it up as we go along
In so deep it can't be wrong
It's obvious that

This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
It's time for us to redefine
So fix your eyes, fix your eyes
This is modern mafia
They're scared of us; they're scared of us
I don't want to be on my own
I need a home, I need a home
