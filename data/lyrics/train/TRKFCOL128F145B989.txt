Talking...
Well there's Always Been Groups Of People
that never could see eye to eye.
and I always thought if they ever had a
chance to sit down and talk face to face.
They Might Realize they got a lot in common

Well I was sittin in a coffe shop,
just having a cup to pass the time,
Swappin Rodeo stories,
with this ol' Cowboy friend of mine

When some motorcycle riders startin snickerin in the back.
They started pokin fun at my friends hat.

One ol' boy said "Hey Tex, where'd ya park your Horse?"
My friend just pulled his hat down low,
But they couldnt be ignored.

One husky fella said
"I think I'll rip that hat right off yer head."
Thats when my friend turned around,
and this is what he said.
