Slow down, slow down
You'll only get burned out
Calm down, calm down
You're getting so worn out

They're trying to make you compromise
This fire burning in your eyes

Darling, you're slowly drifting out of reach
I'm slowly drifting out of reach
We're slowly drifting out of reach

You're slowly falling out of reach
I'm slowly falling out of reach
We're slowly falling out of reach

Out of reach

So home is just a word now
You don't see it anymore
The child's eyes are vacant now
...
