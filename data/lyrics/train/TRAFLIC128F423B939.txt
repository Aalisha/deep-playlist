The prophets of God have left you solaced indeed
A zombie of Jesus insane with his belief
Is all that you know
And all you take as you go
You’re one with the rich and only take from the poor

Nailed to the cross by your hands and your feet
Your washed up religion is now worthless and weak
Tenacious conviction has caught up with your soul
There’s no place for mercy in the myths of your lord

Little lamb of sacrifice
Full of Bible hymns
Hiding in the house of God
From his suffering
Pray the son will come and call just to make us dead
Bring upon the end of times…worship if you dare

Wiping out masses just for shits and a grin
Is all an illusion of the spell that you’re in
