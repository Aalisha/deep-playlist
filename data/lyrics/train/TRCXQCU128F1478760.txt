Long, black, curly locks
Dressed so fancy, smiles a lot
She's a foxy lady, gonna be my baby
In time if I want her

Freaks by candlelight
In my mind she's dynamite
She's a kinky lady, gonna be my baby
In time if I want her

Ms. Got-The-Body
(Like sweet cold wine)
Ms. Got-The-Body

Ms. Got-The-Body
(Sheâ€™s a pretty little sexy lady)
Ms. Got-The-Body for love

On a Friday night
To all the fellows sheer delight
She'll make a clean undertakin' of hearts

She's the finest thing around
Love's gonna hit me, she's the one to get me
And her name I'll be callin'
