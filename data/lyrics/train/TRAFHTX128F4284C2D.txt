Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
Honey I know you'll be there to relieve me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the things you're dealing ohh
I can tell you, darling, that it's sexual healing
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
Baby I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
