I don't wanna be the one girl you keep giving excuses to
I just want it to be us girl, now and forever
And I don't know if you realize what you doing to me
If you say you love me then you say you don't
Girl, you're driving me crazy

I don't know if you're leaving today baby
I don't know if you're going to stay
I don't know if you've made up your mind
You keep saying, "Bye bye"

I don't understand, I thought you were happy here
You keep acting like you wanna go
What can I do to make you stay
To keep you from saying, "Bye bye"
