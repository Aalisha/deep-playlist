Jam Up and Jelly Tight
My, my, my, my, baby, now you're outta sight
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
You look a little naughty but you're so polite
Jam Up and Jelly Tight
You won't say you will, but there's a chance that you might
I said; the first day I met you
Someday, I'm gonna pet you
Now you're here and baby I love it
