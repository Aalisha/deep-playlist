Who puts the green in the grass?
Who put the cream in the calf?
Who put the clean in the bath?

Who puts the dies in the dust?
Who puts the lies in the lust?
Who put the flies in the fudge?

There’s a man in the larder, he’s a barber.
He’s got pallor like powder in water.
He’s hoping he’ll introduce himself to your daughter.
He's making water. He's making water.
