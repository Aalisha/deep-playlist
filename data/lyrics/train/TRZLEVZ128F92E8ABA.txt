I serve my perdition
in this private hell
a thousand angers
have kept me alive
carve a hole in your distorted soul
i'm here to bang it
yea
The blessing is a curse
seduction and thirst
feeds the hunger
Take a little caution
when you look my way
see the emptiness in my eyes
and the evil thing
that i bring
soulless light
...
