Did you really think you could call the shots?
I wouldn't figure it out or connect the dots
In so many lies, what's the meaning?

Did you really think you could cause me pain?
Stepped on the track right in front of the train
Now it's only shame that you're feeling

So unexpected, the tables have turned
I'm laughing now because the joke is on you
And it's so unexpected that you're getting burned
Now I can smile 'cause all my pain is removed
So unexpected, unexpected

I was always a few steps ahead
Now I'm moving on 'cause you've made your bed
...
