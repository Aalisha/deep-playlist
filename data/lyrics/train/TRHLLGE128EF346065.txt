The winds of darkness blow again...
Ridden by the mares of night.
They beckon me in dreams and visions.
From far beyond creations light they sing to me...
Wrathful beast of Satan's fire.
They urge me further on my path.
Now soaked in froth and dark desire,
at the threshold of the inverted womb I stand.

Surrounded by darkness...

Amidst its blackened clearness
there is naught to veil my sight.
I can behold as they ascend,
the malformed horrors of the night,
and feel the crosses turn...
...
