Dear martyr
The tears you shed in life
No one is listening
The cross you carry is showing

Dear virgin
With innocence he stole that night
No one is listening
Your hymen is broken

Dear orphan
Who sits alone waiting
No one is listening to his cries at night

Abandoned
This world is a cold dead place
No one is listening
