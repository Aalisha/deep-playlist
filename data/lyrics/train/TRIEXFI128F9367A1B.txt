She would meet me in the morning
On my way down to the river
Waiting patient by the chinaberry tree
With her feet already dusty
From the pathway to the levee
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees

I'd pay her no attention
As she tagged along beside me
Trying hard to copy everything I did
But I couldn't keep from smiling
When I'd hear somebody saying
Looky yonder there goes Jody and the kid
