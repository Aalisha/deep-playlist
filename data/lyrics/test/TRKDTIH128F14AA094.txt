We used to be so very happy and we used to have so much fun
And we used to spend our time together, we were as close as anyone
I used to feel your every feeling, I was a part of your every dream
I'm not saying that you've thrown me aside, but oh that's just the way that it seems
So if I've done anything that I shouldn't have done,
Wanna say I'm sorry, darling, I'm so sorry
And if I said anything that I shouldn't have said, I'm sorry, sorry, yeah
Now we're just getting used to a brand new situation
