Fell asleep in a boring fountain
Woke up with an unkind word in my mouth
Too late, but I kept counting
Every bump in the highway as I headed down south

Are we losing something now?
A house divided a golden cow
Are we losing something now?

By the way, I feel nothing
By the way, I feel sorry for you
