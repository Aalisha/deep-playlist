I can see you're hurting
You wear it like a coat of amour
You closed your eyes
And chose your battleground

And there's no way through you
'Cause I'm still over here
And you're still over there

You're pulling me to you
Where I wanna be

You're twisting the chain
And I'm right there with you
I can match your pain

You're twisting the chain
Do I run back to you
Or run away again?

You think it doesn't matter
You're gonna hurt yourself before I do
You're aiming at me
...
