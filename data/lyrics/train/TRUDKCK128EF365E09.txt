Through devotion
Blessed are the children
Praise the teacher
That brings true love to many

Your devotion
Opens all life's treasures, yeah
And deliverance
From the fruits of evil

So our mission
To bring a melody
Ringin' voices, woo hoo
Sing sweet harmony

For you here's a song
To make your day brighter
One that will last you long
