My taste's a little strange
I've been told
You're the kind of person
I want to hold
You'll never be a picture
I don't care
I've been looking out for you
Everywhere
Be my lover now
Be my lover now
You make me feel so hot
I want you so
Will I always love you?
I don't know
There may be no tomorrow
Anyway
Let's forget the future
And live today
...
