Ooh, somebody's daughter

Give me room to breathe
There are times when I feel
I could drown without water
Give me time to see
Just one dream that is mine

I feel the wind and the water
I see the sun and the rain
Forgive the sins of your daughter
And she'll pray for you

I'm breaking the frame, each day's the same
You should be somebody's daughter
Day after day of feeling this way
I am somebody's daughter

Please, say I can leave
Try to ease this pain
