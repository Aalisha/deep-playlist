Closed mouth catches no flies
Burning bridges as you're crossing is not very wise
When analysed
Be tongue-tied
Play snakes and ladders
But not suicide
Like casting pearl before swine

Talking to you is a waste of time
You burned the bridges you've been crossing
Go crawl back into your dustbin

Crawl back in your own dustbin

From you expect this lack of respect
To be sly
Not one of a kind
Pretty picture
Bad frame of mind
Like casting pearl before swine
...
