The common road seems just like a dream
It's a mystery to me
Fills me within when we're together
Oh, baby, can't you see?

I, I'd like to feel the passion
To the point of no return
I will be in full reaction
I'm gonna take you in my arms

CHORUS:
You're taking me to the point of no return, oh oh oh
...
