You are my everything
My head, my heart, my mind, my wing
I could give all again
I'm never short of anything with you

The jokes, the laugh, the teardrops too
The games, the fun, the travels too
Yes I'll go through it all with you*
All good things now come from you

I hope you feel the way I do
...
