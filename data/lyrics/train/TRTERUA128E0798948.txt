You walk this earth without a heart
You tear the innocents soul apart
You shovel your conscience into the grave
You walk this earth without a heart
Your uniform couldn't be taken off
A tattoo burned into your flesh
Your mind, your voice
These are your instruments of death
How could you dare to be so bold
You only did as you were told
Marionettes dancing in time
To the apologetic lines
For all the monsters of our time
Who is evil, who is blind?
In the name of who you'll find
A city of souls dying for peace
Welcome to the belly of the beast
One mind, one voice
Welcome to the belly of the beast
Who hears, your voice?
Millions, never, never again
Madness, never, never again
