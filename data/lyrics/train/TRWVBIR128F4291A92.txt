Compelled to eternal hate, censure of the mob, submit to them
Pressured from the outside, prevailing herd mentality, fearing deviation
Traumatized, retreat and submit, habitual failure, they no longer attempt
Resist all efforts at change, practice the routine

Fake courage to impress the other sheep
All cowards in their own pointless, twisted fate

Constant friction, voicings of new converts, don't know shit
Arbitrary changes visit ownership upon me

Do I look like I need you to rearrange my realm?
