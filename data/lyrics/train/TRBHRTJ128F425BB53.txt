Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward.
Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both.

Invoke the Siren's song and sign the death warrant.
This is what has been wrought for thirty pieces of silver.
The tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved

Betrayer.
