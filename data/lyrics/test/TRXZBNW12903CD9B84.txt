Sometimes I'm
Afraid of the water
Mostly when
I can't see the bottom
It's just an irrational feeling
Picked up as a kid

Now when I go swimming alone
or with friends like that week
at Mount Eerie when there was a group of us
I think I felt betrayed

You should go you should go
Berry Lake Berry Lake yeah
And you're not gonna know
...
