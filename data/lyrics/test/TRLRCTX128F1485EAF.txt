Never stray far away
Never stray far away
Do you hear someone calling?
Do you hear someone calling?

Never stray far away
Never stray far away
Do you hear someone calling, calling?

A thousand memories will play
And the sun will rise to greet another day
Somehow this emptiness won't stay
Somehow there's hope not far away

Never stray far away
...
