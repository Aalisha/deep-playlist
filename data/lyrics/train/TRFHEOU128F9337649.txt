There's a lot of things I want
A lot of things that I'd like to be
But girl I don't forsee a rags to riches story for me
It's just one little thing I got to make come true
It's just one round I've got to win
I can't be a loser with you

Baby baby just once in my life
I'm gonna get what I want girl don't let me down
Just once in my life let me hold on to
The good thing I found don't let me down
Baby say that you'd be staying

Cause I couldn't face the day if you weren't here by my side
And if you went away then I'd be left without any pride
I've given up on schemes cause everyone fell through
