Feeling so close
I've a lump in my throat
My jacket wasn't meant to be touched
So don't touch it
It didn't happen that way, did it?
Tell me did it happen that way?

Sweat, sweat on lips, on lips, on lips, 
On sweat on back
Tell me she didn't look me in the eye
Please tell me she didn't look me in the eye

And the sweat surrounds us all
Still we stand closer together
I always do but I shouldn't bother
...
