"I love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me" --> KRS-One
(repeat 2X, then 2X with 'Common' at the end of each line)
Check it out
Good morning... be at calm, I'm back
HUH! It's me again
Is it me you're looking for? (Yup)
For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique
I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle
*attempt at whistling* Psss, I'm only buggin
While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose
and picked a rhyme any rhyme I don't have any time
to waste, I'm hip... don't even trip
to an easy travel agent now we fly for free
I can be fly for free, you want some flyer to read
then buy from me
I got the flame like U-I-C but I be, U-A-C
Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see
in your life if you get one
Rappers are like jobs to me (why?) because they get done
Here it comes I'm as Abel as Cain to get raw
That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dickses
not da bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with pros
hoes who wheeze, the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters, high rollers and rollers
Players with plat studs with stocking caps I be rocking raps
til I collapse
Niggaz play my tape about as much as they do craps
...
