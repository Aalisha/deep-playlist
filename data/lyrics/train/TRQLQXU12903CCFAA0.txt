I can't remember which movie taught me purpose
I can't remember which movie taught me pain
I would've been the one baptized in all your water
I would've been the one submerged under your reign

This is not how I want to be forgotten
This is not how I want to leave remains

I'll give you everything that you need
And if you want my blood, let me bleed
...
