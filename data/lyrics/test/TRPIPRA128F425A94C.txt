Sylvia is missing
Dark stars tatooed
Across her face...
Tiny bruises
Black & blue
The dedication on her arm
Reads " Love & Hate"
Yea Yea

Passing through the underground
Sylvia is coming down
The Queen has lost her crown
To-day

She wants to fall
Into a deep deep sleep
So she can forget herself
...
