I'm travelin' down the road,
I'm flirtin' with disaster.
I've got the pedal to the floor,
My life is runnin' faster.
I'm out of money, I'm out of hope,
It looks like self destruction.
Well how much more can we take,
With all of this corruption.

Been flirtin' with disaster,
Ya'll know what I mean.
And the way we run our lives,
It makes no sense to me.
I don't know about yourself
Or what you want to be, yeah!
When we gamble with our time,
We choose our destiny.

I'm travelin' down that lonesome road.
Feel like I'm draggin' a heavy load.
