Every day when school got out
I'd get off the bus and I'd run down
That old dirt road where you were waiting for me
On the front porch in that blue swing
You'd be smiling and we would sing
'Amazing Grace' and 'Jesus Loves Me'

You were like my mother
You were my best friend
You were everything I want to be
And all the good inside of me
There's never been
Never been another
That loved me like you did
...
