Say girl (whoa), every night you ask me to come over
And I came (you better believe it), every time you called (cause I wanted be there)
As a matter a fact I was probably waiting by the phone

If I would've known what I know now
Would've left when I had the chance
We were two weeks in it'll never last
If I would've known what you were thinking
Would've ran for the hills and hid
I would've stayed low key
Till you're over it, till you're over it (oh oh)
Till you're over it, till you're over it (oh oh)
Till you're over it

Uh huh, uh huh
We're doing it
Way too well
Uh huh, uh huh
We're doing it
...
