On a dark and cold and windy night
A man left from his home
Said I'm going to find my fortune father,
Leave well enough alone.

He took off on a silver steed.
Ain't never gonna look on back
Slept down by the water's edge
By a railroad track.

{chorus}

Never let 'em go, never get away
Never let 'em go, never get away -
This I share with you.
Never let 'em go, never get away
Never let 'em go, never get away.
