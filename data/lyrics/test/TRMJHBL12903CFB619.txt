This is not a circus, this is for real
In the eyes of the tiger, our own fear we feel
Looking out the window, a rainstorm rolling in
It turns into a wide-screen, of hatred, anger and screams

This is not a real clown, this man is made of steel
From the bottom of his cold eyes, a timebomb can be seen
He's acting like a father, but behaving like a boy
He leads us to destruction, and it brings him power and joy

We don't wanna watch these stunts
Bouncing through the air
Dancing on our square
Perform another turn

This is not a fair game; it's getting out of hand
He's sending out our children, to fight in a foreign land
