(SOM)
Last night!

(A-Plus)
Was incredible, unforgetable
Seen some ass MC's
Had to let'em know

Last night!

(Tajai)
Had put my thang down
Got my thang on
Did my thug thang
It wasn't a thang wrong

Last night!

(Opio)
I thought it was just my mic level
I can't hear myself & Plus turn up the echo

Last night!

(Phesto Dee)
I took a five hour plane flight
Spittin' at my homegirl via satellite

Last night!

(A-Plus)
Idea was top the secret
And you wouldn't belive it unless you peeped it
She was off the chain, all-terrain
All insane alcohol stalled her brain
Last night I caught the right weed
Had my body slow-mo but thoughts at light speed (last night!)
Was a long one I was on one, a strong one
Smoke it 'til it's all done

Last night!

(Opio)
We out we out we out
Forty miles over the speed limit
On target like a bullet to the knees
From the SWAT team when I'm
Shootin' these in 'em
Trigger kamikaze but two shots are hidden then
Step into the station (Pass A-Plea the venom)
So we can take a sip and let the poison get in 'em
Ink off the mic like a vortex without a bitch or a Lex
I get more affection
Payin' no attention cause I learned my lesson
Cold hearted bitterness so I never sweat them (last night!)
Starstruck the Hollywood hoes in action
Master your high watch out they backstabbin'

Last night!

(Phesto Dee)
Chillin' where the city lights flash bright
Burning rubber in a riddle livin' in the fast life
...
