Day after day
All I saw was you
And the sky came a tumblin' down
Smoke in the air
All I want is truth
I am a light that's aglow, that's alive
That's a warm place in your heart
You kept turning me on and off
'Til I went out and you were standing shivering in the dark

Open your eyes
And see me leaving
Closing the door
I won't think twice
When you come pleaing
Not ANYMORE

Hope was a dream that I had of you
In the soft warm slumber of dawn
I must keep in mind
That reality can be painful if neglected too long
I am aware
That I will soon be released
