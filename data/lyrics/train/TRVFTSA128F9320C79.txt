Your daughter… she's a dancer
Living in Buenos Aires
Sleeping on a mattress on the floor
Yes, sleeping on a mattress on the floor

Did you ever ask her how she feels?

Electricity through her body
That one thing that can make one happy
Like electricity through a body

Your father… he's a rich man
And he's got many questions
