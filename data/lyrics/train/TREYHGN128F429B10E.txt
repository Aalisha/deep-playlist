The wolves are coming out tonight
Don't say you heard this coming
The wolves are coming out tonight
Oh boy, you best be running

They say they saw her on the streets
They say they saw her on her knees
I hear there's been more to offer
Then the scent under her dress

We've been sharing lovers for far too long
This isn't a last goodnight
And we'll be sleeping
'Til our bodies have run cold again
But you're just that suitable

For most to lay their hands upon
But you've made this just so simple
...
