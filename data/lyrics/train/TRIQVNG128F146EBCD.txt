Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me

J'ai les glands with your theatrics, your acting's a drag
It's okay on TV 'cause you can turn it off but don't try me
Yes, your marriage is a tragedy but it's not my concern
I'm very superficial I hate anything official

Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
Your private life drama, baby, leave me out
