Call me a thief
Of your heart
Call me anything
That you want
I'm over the sentiment
That was here
In this body of mine
Years ago

So give us the pieces
Give us the part
Put it together
Make a new start
Come out of the corners
Out of the dark
Light up a new one
Light up a new spark

And I could be happy
If I had a friend
Who loved all of me
All the way to the end
All the way from A to Z
When you're down and out
As low as you can be
...
