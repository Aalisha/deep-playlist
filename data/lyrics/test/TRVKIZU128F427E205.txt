To the summer of love, from the winter of fear
Seasons change us around, the reasons not clear
So turn the page
Their innocence can't be saved
Beginning again

Like the motions you make, the wave of your hand
Like the time that it takes to know that you can
Standing by
To try and make you feel alright
