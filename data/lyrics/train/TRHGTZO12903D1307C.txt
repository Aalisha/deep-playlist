If you think you're sinking, you probably are
Only you can know, only you can know
If you think you're falling, you probably will
You've got to lose yourself, and not let go

I think we'll be alright
I think we will survive
Everybody gets a little scared like this sometimes
I think we'll be alright
I think we will survive
You've got to fall apart
And Put It Back Together again

I never said I loved you quite enough
I hope it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
I've got this one fresh second, one fresh minute, one fresh hour of my day
To pray it's not too late, I hope it's not too late
