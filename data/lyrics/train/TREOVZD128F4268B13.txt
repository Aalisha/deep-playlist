Born into this life a child in the world of doubt
Rejected as an orphan boy torn from his mothers side
Dogma thrown in his way obstacles from which to pass
The pain his soul endured
Has scarred his body fast
Defiant in an angry heart stubborn in his ways
Determined to reach his goals
Though numbered are his days

Lost within his mind 
emotionally disturbed
Abused throughout childhood
Wounded deeply by words
Submerged in hate and fear
Neglected by those around
Affliction was all we had 
lost and never found
...
