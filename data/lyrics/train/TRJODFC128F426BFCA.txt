I said, "I know a shrimp boat captain out of Galveston"
I've been thinkin' I'd go down and work for a spell
Oh, you never can tell it just might suit me fine
Spend some time out on the bay
But then there's always cowboy work in Colorado
And I was thinkin' that that just might be the thing
Make a little pocket change I figure what the heck
Ain't nothin' standin' in my way
But then she smiled at me
Looked a while at me

[Chorus]
And that changes everything
That's a whole 'nother deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rollin' wheel
