I see your red door, I wanna paint it black
No colours any more, I want them to turn black
I seen girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see your lines of colours and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
...
