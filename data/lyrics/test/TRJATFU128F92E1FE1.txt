I'm creeping my way out so you can see me
I'm crawling my way around a thousand cities
You all stop and stare
I don't need your pity
I'm living my life in this hell

Now I'm crawling away 'cause the stress has killed me
I feel like I fell from a ten story building
you best run and hide before the devil starts her bidding
I'm living my life in this hell

I'm not one for the crowd to see
It's just me
It's just

Just a little more, c'mon and satisfy me
Just a little more, c'mon and terrify me
Just a little more and I'll be done with it
Take my life and then I'll feel okay

Cut it out of my mouth
put my tongue on a pole
I won't sing anymore
I'm losing control
Cut it out of my mouth
...
