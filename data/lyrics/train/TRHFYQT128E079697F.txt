I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
You ain't the same when Jay-Z's around
I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
You scream and holler when Eminem's in town

I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
Snoop put me up on how the hoes get down
I know you like Nelly, like Kelly, Ludacris
Try to run game on me you punk bitch
I know you don't love me

Gators and ostrich, you know we in power
You could see my outfit on the Discovery Channel
I'm a stunner, my bitches train like robots
They sniff coke, deep throat, and they hold out glocks

It's the brick-copper, the L-sharper
645 NASCAR driver that's known to spit lava
I'm in Cancun, with a model in the bedroom
Her pussy tight like an airplane bathroom

Talk out your mouth piece, baby pah
The baby A R will make it hot like South Beach
I move like, Bin Laden armed with them hammers
In that new Jag wagon, with James Bond vagrant

Medina all red, mira give me head
Bad bitch, look like Eva Mendes
I'm a gangsta, general, comrade nigga
Drug money, blood money in a brown bag nigga

I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
You ain't the same whenever Bank's around
I know you don't love me, I know you don't love me
