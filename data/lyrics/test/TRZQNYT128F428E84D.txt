From this day on,
I will be there for you.
From this day on,
The crosses that I'll bear,
I will now bear for you.

From this day on,
The choices that I'll make,
Are the choices for our unborn children's lives.
Oh, Oh, Oh... for the day has come,
When our hearts will beat as one.

From this day on,
My life will never part,
From what I see in you.
From this day on,
Vows taken from the heart,
...
