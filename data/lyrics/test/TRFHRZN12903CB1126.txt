If you don't get what you want
You scream and you shout
I'm not the only one who said it, if you don't get it
You gotta let it out, yeah

If you don't get what you need
You're picking on me
I'm tired of giving in on every single whim
You gotta let me be

If you don't get what you want
If you don't get what you need
If you don't get what you ask for
You gotta, you gotta let me be

You're lying on my bed
You light a cigarette
Is this some kinda joke, I asked you not to smoke
You laugh at me instead
