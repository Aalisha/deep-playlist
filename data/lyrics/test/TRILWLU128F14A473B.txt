(Heartbreak, baby)
I can see the heartbreak that he puts you through
And I've seen enough to know he's not in love with you
And I understand your feelings girl, I really do
Baby I've been through it
Go ahead and do it
Baby get out, get out, get out now
get out
He doesn't love you baby
Get out, get out, get out now
get out
My love is more than maybe
Can't you see you future girl is looking dim
