By the time you read these lines
I know I'll be gone like the novel "Dear John"
By the time you read these lines
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I know that I will love you more I know I should love
By the time you read these lines
By the time you read this
By the time you read this
And here it goes

It's a little bit of runaway, I still believe in yesterday
Why you did not try to simplify, find the answer?
It's a little bit of runaway, I still believe in yesterday
I really don't care of what they say
I still believe in yesterday
I really don't care of what I'll say
What I'll say
