What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain’t afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin’ man

We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

I was raised on beans and cornbread
And I like my chicken fried
Yes, I drive a pickup truck
And I’m full of American pride

I keep a Bible on my table
I got a flag out on my lawn
And I don’t believe in mindin’
Nobody's business but my own

And I love them Rambo movies
I think they make a lot of sense
And it’s a shame ole John Wayne
