We were born to sin, we were born to sin
We don't think we're special, sir, we know everybody is
We've built too many walls, yeah, we've built too many walls
And now we gotta run, a giant fist is out to crush us

We run in the dark, we run in the dark
We don't carry dead weight long, we send them along to heaven
I carry my baby, I carry my baby
