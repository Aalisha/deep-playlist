Yeah, Choke!
I feel your breath upon my neck
You're bleeding
Desperate to see you in my rage
Love, hate, lust
It's all the same
When you go down

I wanna...
I wanna...
I wanna...
CHOKE YOU!

Choke, choke, I choke you

Angry grip around your neck
You feel black and blue
Angry grip around your neck
...
