As I reach out my hands to the sky
It's in this moment that I've come to realise I've played my part
For all of those who said it could never be done
This is for you
Tormented by my every undying devotion for you

I have destroyed myself
This time it was all or nothing
I struck the match and turned away
Torch the fields and pray for rain
