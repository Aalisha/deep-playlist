My eyes are
So bleary
I guess I'm young, but I feel so weary

I've tried to express it, but I think it's all a bore
It's at the heart of me
A very part of me

Speak slowly, I can't hear you
My mind keeps spinning closer and closer
To the rain on the roof
And the rain in my head
And the things that you said
...
