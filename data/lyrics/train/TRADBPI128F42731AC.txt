Well you better not see me when you come back
I could be sharing someone else's pillow
And my love for you is better than diamonds
To you, everything I bestow

And tomorrow, I'll be dancin' on my own
And I'll need a kiss for my head that's achin'
And I'll be a hungry dog without a bone
Hoping my place with you's not taken

Kiss me and tell me it's not broken
Kiss me and kiss me 'til I'm dead
See, I give you the stars from the bruised evening sky
And a crown of jewels for your head now
For your head now
For your head now
For your head

One last night in bed for a time
And two more wishes and both are for thine
...
