I found you
I turned you in to America
I believe in you
Telling you

The kind of mind
Running wild
I will do it with you
I will do it without you

Oh my, my, my come dry your eyes
So only one kind of mind who can truly satisfy
Love is the key, love is the key
I will sacrifice my soul to free you from misery

Love is the key, love is the key
Love is the key, love is the key
Love is the key, love is the key
Love is the key, love is the key

Come feed me
