Maybe its been a little too long,
Holding it in
Tryin' to be strong

It's funny the things we bottle up
Come streamin' out when you feel enough

There is a trust the cautious will lack,
Now that we touched there's no holdin back.

CHORUS:
I want to call out for love until I can't breathe
I want to stare at the truth til I can't see
...
