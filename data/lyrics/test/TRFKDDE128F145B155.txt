Turn down the bedroom lights
and warm my soul
Let all your inhibitions go we'll reach the kinda heights
That we've never known.
Laid back and easy take it slow-slow-slow
But wait
are your intentions what you think they are?
Well if so
then won't you hand me back the keys to my car.

Well I guess I never knew I bit off more than I could chew
...
