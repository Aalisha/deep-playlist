Bass (Uh)
Hi hat (Uh)
808 (Uh)
Jay? (Uh-huh.)
Ready? (Uh-huh.)
Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh. C'mon.)
I used to run base like Juan Pierre

Now I run the bass, hi hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B (Boy you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me whippin' curtains back
Me and B, she about to sting

Stand back

Baby, seems like everywhere I go
I see you, from your eyes, your smile
It's like I breathe you, helplessly I reminisce
Don't want to compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself
But I'm out of control

Your sexiness is so appealing

I can't let it go
Oh
Know that I can't get over you

'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
...
