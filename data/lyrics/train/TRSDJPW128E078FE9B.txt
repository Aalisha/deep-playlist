Walking down the road
With no blade in your hand
Johnny you're too bad, that's what they say
Walking down the road
With a blade in your waist
Oh Johnny you're too bad, Johnny you're too bad
With your blade come flicking, You're licking, and sticking
Too bad
With your running, and shooting, looting and tooting
You're too bad.

Cos one of these days
You're going to make your woman cry
Ooh, Johnny too bad
One of these days
You're going to make your woman cry
Cos Johnny, you're so bad
Ooh, That's what they tell me about you
With you licking and sticking
Switchblade a picking
