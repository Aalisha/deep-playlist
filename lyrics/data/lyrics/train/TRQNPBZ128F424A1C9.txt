In deh, in deh all o' you in deh, in deh already
In deh, in deh long time, you in deh, oh yeah

I sing and shout of the glory of Jah Rastafari
When you tell them of the Almighty
Some of them would want to try stay one side and fight me
But the hotter get the battle, it's the sweeter Jah victory
Don't fight against your culture
History can tell of Jah mystery
So you in deh, you in deh, all o' you in deh
