For all the faceless walking dead across the land
I will go to a place that you don't understand
I put a razor to my wrist and spread it wide
And as the blood drips from the walls I slowly
Close my eyes

This was not meant for your eyes
This is the end of the hour
There's no use wasting precious time
This is the end of the hour

Hours I have wasted sitting here, wet dripping pain
At last my eyes roll back, the visions start again
