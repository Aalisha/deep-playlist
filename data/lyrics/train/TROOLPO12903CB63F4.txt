We were going through the harbor going faster than the wind
A perfect match between the man and the machine
Underneath the surface, love's as cold and blue
And you're saying this town is not made for you

Starts getting closer, going through the night
No one can reach us when we're out of sight
Time's running faster, please let us through
Going in any direction will do
And you said to me, you said what it was all about and I said no
