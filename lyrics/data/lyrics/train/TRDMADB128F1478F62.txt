I had everything I wanted but you wanted more
I had everything I needed but you needed more

Songs for your father, maybe your brother
Or your sister, right at your mother
Fools on the water, springs in the quarter
You know I saw you

We play the same songs in your town
As we play in ours
We play the same God in your town
As we play in ours
