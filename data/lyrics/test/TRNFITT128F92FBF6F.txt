Oh, Benny Mart, now
It's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave, my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some lines
That keeps you in the back roads, by the rivers of my memory
And keeps you ever gentle on my mind
Oh, Sam, Sammy Bush
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that binds me
...
