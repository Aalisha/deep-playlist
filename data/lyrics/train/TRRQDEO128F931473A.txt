What's so wrong about daydreaming
And what's so bad about feeling optimistic
There's no use trying to hide, it's right there in your eyes
Well, I can feel it when my heart beats
We'd be fools not to jump in both feet

Because His love's comin' over me
And His love's comin' over you
Well, it's what we were made for
All I have prayed for, comin' to set us free
Yeah, His love's comin' over you and me

Tears, they got no business here no, no
And heartaches gonna lose its place in line
Yeah, the feeling's mutual, there's no doubt in my soul
If there were my dreams got shot down
I know He'd steady my shaky ground
