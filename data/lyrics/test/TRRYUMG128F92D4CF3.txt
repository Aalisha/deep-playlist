[ Chorus]
Every little things gonna be alright
Weeping can only last one night
Ya gotta endure till' the morning sun
Ya gonna win the race but you have to run
Trouble can never last always
It looks like I can see a brighter day
My brother if you can jus hold on
The lord's gonna make a way i know
Every little thing is gonna be alright

[Verse 1]
The GOD that we serve is Lord of all as the big as well as the small
And yes He's in love with everyone no matter how many times we fall
Every detail that entails your life He's already worked it out
