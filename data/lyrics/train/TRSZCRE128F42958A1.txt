Talk to her, that's right
It could mean more than you think
Talk to her, that's right
And you don't have to lose a thing
Leave the boots and saddle outside
You could make her happy again
Laugh about the time
She threw the dinner at you

And in the coconut grove
You can imagine the scene
Another bus unloads
We're still waiting to leave

Talk to her, that's nice
Or you could make a murder begin
...
