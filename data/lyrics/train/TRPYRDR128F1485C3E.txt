i stumbled on your grave site
what a sight it was
i want a chip off the old block
i want a girl who i can talk to
stumblin' through your neighborhood
defacing walls just like i should

ooh, i wanted to be you, dirty like the skies
you live in space, your life's a waste like mine
so let's just stop, before we die
i know you don't care at all
