Ah, yih

Do, do do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do do, do do do
Do, do do do do do, do do do

She came from a world that is so far out
Rollerskating into my life I never had no doubt [Do, do do do do do, do do do]
She said, "Where'd you get that velvet-colored hair?"
I said, "I got lots more somewhere if you touch my big "

[Do, do do do do do, do do do]

She said, "I come from a world that is so far out" [Do, do do do do do, do do do]
And I said, "So do I"
And she may not be the world's solution
But she's a world-class revolution

Technicolor lover
Take my heart
Technicolor lover
Take my heart
Technicolor lover
Take my heart now
