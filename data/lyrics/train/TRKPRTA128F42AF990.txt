Bloodshot eyes - metal skin
Serpents tongue - dagger claws
Dragon wings - crooked horns
K.I.N.G

Beholding the might
In its dawn of grace
In its beauty and light
In its pride and glory
Rushing torrent - time and space
Elder lords - crack the soil
Gone or dead - you've never been
Kingdom come - hear the roar
Climbing down to rule the earth
