When you were just a young girl and still in school
How come you never learned the golden rule?
Don't talk to strange men, don't be a fool
I'm hearing stories; I don't think that's cool

Why dont'cha tell me someone isn't lovin' you?
'Cause you're my girl, some say it's no longer true
You're seeing some slick continental dude
I'm beggin' you, please

(Don't talk to strangers)
Baby, dont'cha talk
(Don't talk to strangers)
You know he'll only use you up
(Don't talk, don't talk)
Don't talk
(Don't talk, don't talk to him)
Nobody, nobody ever told you

Now tell me, how's life in the big city?
I hear the competition's tough; baby, that's a pity
