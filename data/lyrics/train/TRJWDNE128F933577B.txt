There's a whole mess of trouble up on Choctaw Hill
You're sister couldn't make it but I bet you will
Knockin' back a jelly jar of watermelon wine
I ain't never seen a place where the sun can't...

Wash off all your make up with a garden hose
Watch the freckles sparkle down the ridge of your nose
With you lemon yellow ribbons and your bleach blonde hair
Blendin' in the sun untill you're barely there
Blendin' in the sun untill you're barely there

We'll be off the radar, off the map
Stretched out in the tall green grass
It's only green, against the blue
It's only me, against you
...
