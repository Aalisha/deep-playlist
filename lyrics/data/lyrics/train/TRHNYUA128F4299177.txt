Last night I had a desperate dream, I was standing in the winter rain
Footsteps close behind me, somebody called out my name, ohhh

No magic mirrors can erase, these lines of living on my face
Lessons learned and last, ohhh, ohhh

Take this life - into my own hands, make this world - into my own land
Take this life - I'll take my stand, take this world - into my own hands
Take this life - into my own hands, I'll take my stand
