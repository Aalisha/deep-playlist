In my time
That's the way I usually go
But, then when I feel fine
Tthat's when I'll be letting you know

If I try, try, (taking it slow, taking it slow)
Feel like I can't sustain it (letting it go, letting it go, so easily)
So I try as best as I can to break my fall
But, you about to set me baby, you about to set me off

I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna go
I don't wanna but my fuses are about to blow
My alarm is going, I'm on high alert
Baby it's enough, just set me off, just set me off
Set me off, just set me off

Be aware, I am not your everyday babe
