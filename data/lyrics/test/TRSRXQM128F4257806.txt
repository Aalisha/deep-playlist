I believes my old lady she done, drive my black bone
You know I made my old lady she done, drive my black cat bone
I got a funny feeling right here, something's going all wrong

She don't shoot in the morning, she walk the streets till late at night
She don't shoot in the morning, she walk the streets till late at night
Well she come home in the evening, doggone baby fight

Gonna call up the operator, right around the town
