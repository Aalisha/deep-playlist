Some times it's simple things that make it hard
Spoiled baby tee's with credit cards
Overtime always on my mind
Could-have-beens eat away inside now

Praise God and pass the bottle of Beam
'Cause tonight I can't seem to say what I mean
Don't know if I would even if I could, Amen.
Somehow this seems like borrowed time
Pay no mind, everything is fine
But sometimes I'd rather hear laughter while this whole place died

A Johnny Jump-Up is a lovely thing
