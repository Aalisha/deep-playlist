Yeah, a little song we gotta call striving
We gotta keep moving
No matter what the obstacle, no matter what the test
We gotta push through it, here to help you

Every day of the week when I'm sleep
He's got His angels watching over me
Interceding for me, looking out for me
Now tell me how good is He

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, never give up
Keep on striving
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, never give up
Keep on, keep on striving

Sitting here all alone, I'm in the zone on the phone
Trying to find the dial tone
Looking for some healing, not a fake feeling
Tell me do you feel me

I didn't know who to call, no friends at all
'Til I heard a voice in my head
It said keep pressing on and keep striving, striving on

Every day of the week when I'm sleep
He's got His angels watching over me
...
