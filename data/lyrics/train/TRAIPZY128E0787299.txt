Nothing Blooms
In A Loveless Room
You've Got To Want It
You've Got To Want It

Who's The Fool
Where Apathy Rules
You've Got To Want It
You've Got To Want It

If You Don't Want It
It Remains The Same
It's A Heart Of Darkness
That Wants To Play That Game
If There's No Defiance
It Remains Insane
If It's All Compliance
It's A Runaway Train

Nothing So Cruel
