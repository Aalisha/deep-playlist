Everything I do... everything I do is bad for me
Everything I do... everything I do is bad for me (alright)
All my nasty habits ... just won't let me be

I like to drink... and I like to smoke
They say it's going to kill me ... that ain't no joke
I said hey ... hey ... hey ... everything I do is bad for me 
(I can't help myself)
All my nasty habits ... just won't let me be
...
