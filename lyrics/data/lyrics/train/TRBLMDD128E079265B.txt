Yo, I've been needing to tell you something tonight
I guess, I was just waiting for the right time, you know
So why don't you sit down?

As we step from across the room
Starting to ponder what we've been going through
What does my kiss mean to you?
Are we just friends or is this more to you?

But if we label this, just picture what we might lose, yes
That unexpected kiss
The whole feeling that brought me to you
Meanwhile my feelings grow, yeah
Grow, feelings grow, grow

But if we label this, just picture what we might lose
That unexpected kiss, that feeling that brought me to you, yes
...
