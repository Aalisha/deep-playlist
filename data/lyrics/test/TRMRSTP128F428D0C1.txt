(Ronnie Dunn)

I'm dead headin' down from Tulsa
Goin' back to San Antone
My baby called me up this morning
Begging me to come back home
Haulin' high hopes and thin air
Losin' money by the mile
I'll get there a poor man
She'll make it worth my while

I was a white line casanova
A love bandit of the road
I got the one I can't get over
I miss her more with every load
I got these eighteen wheels
Singin' home sweet home
I been too long gone
Oh I'm comin' home to ya
