Sirens sound
And the rain coming down
On my head
Blaming a town
That has left me down
And I breathe again

Does anybody care where I've been
Where I seem to go now
Does anybody care
Anymore

And if I could fly
Then I would fly
Away from here
Away from all these things
And if I would rise
Then I would fly
Away from all the things I fear
Tell me, where should I go
Can anyone show me how,
How I can fly away from here
