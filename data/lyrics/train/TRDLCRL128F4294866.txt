I never thought I was strong enough
To handle raising my own son
You'll always feel what you've never done
I hope he'll know me when I come home

Nothing's gonna change my love for you
I love my child
He's got his mother's smile
I'm so fortunate
So fortunate

Life can get tired
But I will make it right
I'm so fortunate
So fortunate
