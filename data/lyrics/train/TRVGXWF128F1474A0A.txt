Hot sun goin' down,
Heatin' up this little town
The cows are fed and the plowin's all been done
Moonlight, fireflies,
Beer on the bank by the riverside
We're gonna have ourselves a little fun.

Dancin' on the tailgates
And raisin' a little cane
Rockin' in the pastures
And rollin' in the hay.

It's the life I love
And I'm gonna live it 'til they bury me
I can't get enough of
Dirt roads and dusty fields and the simple things
And I take pride
In everything I've got
'Cause I'm American-born
...
