There's something stirring in the neighbourhood
Ugly but it's looking good
East coast to the west
And they play my favourite song yeah
I lie awake all night on aeroplanes
I got static on my brain
Waiting for the day when I will be back with you

Here comes the sound of Amerca
Here comes the sound of America
This is the sound of America
Look out kid I'm coming to get you
Here comes the sound of Amerca
Here comes the sound of America
This is the sound of America
From an English who loves you
