Chorus:
Black Monday
That's what this joint is all about
Black Monday
A million men strong without a doubt
Black Monday
It's not just a role that one plays
Black Monday
So we can have justice one day
Black Monday
Black, Black Monday
Hey Yo, B - I thougt we conquered the world
When a million men came and shined like a
 black pearl
This time there was no black on black crime
'Cause everybody was thinkin' of ways that pays for
 the black mind
One & equal
Not thinkin' of wealth
but knowledge of self
So the past won't repeat like a sequel
Visions of unity
Strong in the community
The same song sung for diplomatic immunity
Is soon to be reality
...
