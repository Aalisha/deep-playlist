I swear I never watched you sleeping
Well honey, I'm an honest man
I guess it always gets me drinking
She makes me sad

Sweet, sweet and cold
Clean up the mess and sleep the day away
When you call
I might be here, I might be gone

But here at the sound of the bells you cry
You've lost your mind
But dear, don't be sad
It's just a dream you dreamt you had
But I ain't seen you look so good
So honey

I guess it always gets me drinking
Well Holly, she makes me sad
