Woman, what's your name?
I know you from somewhere
Vixen, playing games
Make me think that you care
I know what you're thinking
Thinking that you're too cool
And you know what I'm thinking
Just another poor fool

Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Show me you're a mover
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Dancing all alone
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
Come a little closer
Slow dance, slow dance, slow dance
You drive us all crazy
But I'd rather drive you home

Woman, orgasmatron
