Live The Dream That Makes Life Worth Living
Live The Dream That Makes Dreamers Keep Dreaming
If I Had To Give It Up Today, Would I Be Able To Just Walk Away? 

I Have The Strenght Of A Hundred Men
Have The Mind Of A God Damn Genius
Have A Heart The Never Leaves Me Cold, 
It Would Break If I Were Left Alone

You Are My Friends, You Are My Family
You're [More Than In This], You Are My Everything
