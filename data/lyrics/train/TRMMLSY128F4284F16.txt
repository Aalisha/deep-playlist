"You wanna feel/you're never walking
You see your feet/from off the ground
and when you leave/there's no one talking
you slowly breathe/and look around

I know/you're the lonliest person I know
just a flag in the wind that wont blow
just a tear rolling down the window

You cut your lip/and now you're freaking
Another friend/becomes a foe
You try to leave/but they offer candy
Another time/you wont say no
