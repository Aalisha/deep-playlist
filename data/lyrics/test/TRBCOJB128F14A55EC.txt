Get down, get down, get down
Get down (are you listening?)
Get down, get down, get down
Get down (listen to this)

When I start I master the art of getting down to the heart
And set apart to spark emotion a the slightest sound
It's probably one of the realest topics ever spoke upon
Speech that God will impeach
Swallow the chunks which you choke upon
I'm gifted I know it
Still I was wandering in the path
They tell me boy you're a star, Sign me your autograph
This can't be it though, mind gone staring into space
Sorry, where was I? Thoughts gone without a trace
Was the love of my life, hip-hop guided my life
A combination of the three that would probably me nice
After doing suffice I break the ice with device
And take advice that comes with the price of rolling the dice
