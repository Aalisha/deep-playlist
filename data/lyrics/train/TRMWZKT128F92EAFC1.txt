If you could run where would you run to now?
Where would you hide now that the truth is out?
And I know the fear you feel and I know that this is real

But please don't run from me 'cause everyone needs somebody
Please don't run from me now, oh
I won't leave you, you're never alone wherever you go
Please don't run from me now 'cause I'm not gonna let you down, oh

This is the hope that you've been longing to know
God is alive and He's never left you alone
