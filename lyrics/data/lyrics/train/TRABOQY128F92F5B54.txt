Looking in the sky
I see the birds passing by
Do they follow you
Cause I"m willing to

Do whatever you want me to
So that I can see ya face to face
See ya face one day

Because
So far, So high
So high
You went bye bye
Bye bye
Just like a real life superman
You flew in the sky
Alone, not I
Because I realize

On a rainy day
I hear the notes hit the ground
As you start to play
A love song for me

Lord you make me smile
You know you do
And as you play
I'll sing for you

I like your style
You play so cool
Just like that
I feel brand new

I remember the first time you called me
...
