I was running from the reaper, but I found I could not hide
I was stranded in the desert 'til I cought myself a ride
I was scrounging, I was starving - the bread I tasted satisfied
I used to see with tunel vision, then my horizon opende wide
My horizon opende wide

Chorus:
I'm not getting any older
I'm not getting any older
Cuz I died not long ago
I'm not getting any older
Now I'm only getting younger
Now forever's all I know

I was shaking, I was sweating, then I drank of the sweet new wine
...
