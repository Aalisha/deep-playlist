Yeah, yo, B-Ross Dean

You ready, nigga? Check

Hey, Slick-Pulla
You ran through that change, nigga, check
Okay, let's get it then, nigga, fo real

Now see this is what the fuck I've been telling you 'bout, homie
I don't care what hood you represent, homie
How you get it, man, you getting money, homie, this you're song, nigga
U.S.D.A., nigga, let's get it

You got that money
Check
It's in the bags
Check
You in the rental with them outta state tags
Check

You brought the choppers
Check
Them rubber bands
Check
And when you wrap it, ay, it's gotta be seran
Check

You brought the work
Check
It's in the bags
Check
You in the rental with them outta state tags
Check

You brought them choppers
Check
Them rubber bands
Check
And when you wrap it, ay, it's gotta be seran

28 times, 36, yeah, I'm talking birdies nests
Know some niggas tripping on a half still selling 50' Cents
Hard heart for the loaf but the soft might cost ya
Careful how I move 'cuz them niggas might cross ya

There be yams 'cross the street over there in the bushes
Holla at your boy if you really want 'em cookies
Met 'em at the Amico four way in the mena
Jumped out, grab the cash hopped back in my beemer

Then I turn up my Alpine, yeah, you know I'm feeling that
Look there go Iesha, ya, you know I'm killing that
Certified trap star, ya, you know I'm hood, bitch
Catch me in a fast car and I'm smoking good, bitch
