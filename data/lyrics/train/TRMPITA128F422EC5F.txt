Are you the food? No we are the hunters!
Our names won't be remembered, If we die like tramples flowers
I refuse to be forgotten
Written off as less than worthless
Scream and cry but none will hear you
Plead and beg but none will help you
You no longer live as cattle
Will you rise and join the battle?
There are beings that live off our fear
And their words are like knives as they play with our lives
They'll try to control you as if they own you
Will you let them steal your freedom?
Channel the anger swelling inside you
Fight the boundries till you break through
...
