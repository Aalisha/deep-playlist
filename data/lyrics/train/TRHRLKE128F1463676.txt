Hopes drift in higher places, it's easier above the gloom
Among the hollow of faces I know you're there, it must be soon
And I must straighten up, review my disposition
Pour the hope back in my eyes I thought I'd lost so long ago

Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom, oh

Always a love and beauty, a lover's sighs content too soon
Somewhere behind her heartbeat, a breath of kindness hints of gloom
So I must straighten up, review my disposition
Pour the hope back in my eyes I thought I'd lost so long ago

Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
...
