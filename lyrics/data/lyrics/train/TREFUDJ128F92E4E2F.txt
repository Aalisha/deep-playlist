Like a stranger in the waiting
Her arrogance a sure foot in
Could blow her cover
If I warned them
Letting them know
She's not who she pretends

My stomach in knots
A relentless force
Consumed with these thoughts
That kept on playing over
I sway back and forth
My face it contorts
Interpret obscene
Oblivious I seem
It never will end
Look at what I am
I have no more pride
It ditched my ride
I'm useless
It happened so quick
It makes me feel sick
A sheer heart attack
I guess I got my wish

Now - Where are you now
Now - Where are you now

So you think that you can handle her
