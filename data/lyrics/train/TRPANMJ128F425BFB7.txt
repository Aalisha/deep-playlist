[ verse one ]
It's high now
So low it's high
Like this, check it out yo

Took a trip on a bus that I didn't know
Met a girl sellin' drinks at the disco
Said truth comes back when you let it go
Seems complicated cause it's really so simple
Walkin' down Yonge Street on a Friday
Can't follow them, gotta do it my way
No fast lane, still on a highway
Movin' in and out, no doubt there's a brighter day

[ chorus [ repeat 2x ]
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
No time to get down cause I'm moving up
Ahh, haaâ€¦ check out the crabs in the bucket
