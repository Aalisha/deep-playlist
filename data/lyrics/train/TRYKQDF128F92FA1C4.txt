The good girls put on on pretty dresses
Smile twice as nice
The good girls talk to strangers
And always be polite
The good girls look both ways
Before they cross the road
The good girls go to bed early
And do what they're told

'Cause one day i may cross the line...

I wanna be bad sometimes
I wanna be bad
I wanna be bad sometimes
'Cause feeling bad sure sounds good to me...
