I've been a gypsy for a thousand years
A victim of circumstance
I go wherever my destiny calls
I'm caught in a game of chance

I stand on the outside looking at love
I wanna get inside
I stand on the outside looking at love
Just trying to get inside

No fame or fortune, no luck of the draw
When I dance with the Queen of Hearts
A jack of all trades, a loser in love
...
