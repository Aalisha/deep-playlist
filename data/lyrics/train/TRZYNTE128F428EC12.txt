When will I find a way
To cure your wicked ways?
When will I find a way
To cure your wicked ways?
When will I find a way
To cure your wicked ways?
When will I find a way
To cure your, to cure your
Wicked ways?
I can't see the sense in this
Will we ever find happiness now?
And when I see her turn to sorrow
I try to tell here wait until tomorrow
When will I find a way
To cure your wicked ways?
When will I find a way
To cure your wicked ways?
I love you more each day
But I live with this memory
