Niggas love you when you up north sendin em flicks. Hate you when you home and you chillin in whips. The same ones who say "son I feel your shit", be like "fuck that nigga he aint givin me shit." Niggas be sick, literally stress is bad for you. Envious shits really weak man, is you hearin me? Man up, where many niggas truth fulfill their needs. Stand up, stop sleepin, live your dreams. Only a weak nigga tries to live off strength. And when faced wit heavy burden, can't take the weight. When niggas know your secrets, it's a chance you take. And if your man hold it down, that's real, be thankful. Real recognize real, that aint always true. A lot of people thrive while they mans eat steak food. Outta sight, outta mind, a few will remain true. it's not a game especially when they play you.
