Come on Mama, give me a break
Me and the boys are gonna stay out late
I can't help it, it's in my bones
We'll be jammin' all night long

Gonna play up a storm
Ooh, yeah sure am

We're gonna have us a champagne jam
We're gonna have us a champagne jam
Ooh hoo,

Break out the guitars and let's play some blues
Don't want no whiskey gimme some high class booze
Pour us some champagne
...
