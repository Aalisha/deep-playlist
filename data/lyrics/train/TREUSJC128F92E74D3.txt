All you want from me
Are three little words
But you just get me laughing
A quiet sound
I know I'm with you now
But this all might end
So save all the 'I love you's
And let's not pretend

Cause you won't hear it now
And you won't hear it then
I love you, no
Those three words that begin
With three words always end

You can be a little full-on
Cause I know what you need
That really doesn't mean
You'll get it from me
Lying to yourself
Doesn't make it easier
'Save us both the time
Let's be together
We'll be fine'
You say, but

Cause you won't hear it now
...
