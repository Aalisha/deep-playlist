I come to you with everything
And I wish that there was more to bring
Have I really given my all?
It's a struggle with priorities
I get lost in all the lesser things in life
And hope starts to fall
Oh, I know you understand
Oh, you hold the world in your hands

You are, you are, you're above all else
...
