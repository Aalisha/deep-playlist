There is nothing for
Which I'm responsible
Just this baggage I keep carrying on
As if I had someone
Ok, maybe there is a woman somewhere
Who's still thinking of me
Or a girl with coal black hair
Who's haunted in her dreams
But what they've seen
Well, it wasn't me
It was just some lie
They slept beside
Yeah, I kept this from them
