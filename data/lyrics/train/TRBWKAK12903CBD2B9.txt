[Refrain:]
Gringo said I'm Jah Jah gringo
said I'm Jah Jah gringo seh seh seh seh

I am a gringo of the army of the one ya name Jah
I am a soldier on the frontline and I talk 'bout love
I man rebel in the morning and a fox in the night
I wanna reach them blue true higher skies

I am a student, read the Bible and I read the Qur'an
I read the Gita, know that Sufis know the peaceful Islam
they never wanna fight me or you
so respect is due to what the monks do and Voodoo

Come around the people and a holding you tight tonight night
with thousand sells and hocus pocus and with heavenly might
we gonna listen to this mother nature
giving us the light of life Jah

Tell me who knows what is the truth
tell me who of them's not confused
...
