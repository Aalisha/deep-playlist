I can't believe what is in front of me
The water's rising up to my knees
And i can't figure out
How the hell i wound up here
Everything seemed okay when i started out the other day
Then the rain came pouring down
And now im drowning in my fears
And as i watch the setting sun
I wonder if im the only one

(Chorus)
Cause everyobody tries to put some love on the line
And everybody feels a broken heart sometimes
And even when i'm scared i have to try to fly
Sometimes i fall
But ive seen it done before
