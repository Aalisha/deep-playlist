This scent you left oh, in my bed
Is helping me forget everything you said
Ask yourself what's left when your heart goes dead
'Cause my love has fled without sentiment

Stand on your feet now
Your willingness to be ignorant is what's wearing me down
I detached my heart from you long ago

I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Don't wait for me I'm no saint, you'll see
But if I do, I bet I'll never fall for you, not for you
I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Don't wait for me I'm no saint, you'll see
But if I do, I bet I'll never fall for you, fall for you
