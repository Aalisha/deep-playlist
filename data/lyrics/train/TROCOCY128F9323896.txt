You see these red wine lips?
I didn’t dream up this
Out on suburban curbs
I’m always restless first

But when the truth is told;
We’re all dreamers you know
I’ve always wanted more
than I could ever hold

And I know that it’s a fine line
But I know that I’ve got time

Oh, how could a steeple made of ceiling wax
Ever need fall down?

Remember we had it all
Every belle and ball
...
