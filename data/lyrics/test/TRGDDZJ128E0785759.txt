When we meet again
Just refer to me as "back then"
Or pretend not to recall
Ever knowing me at all
Or hanging round my door
Begging for more

When you begin
Playing to win
That's when the losers rush in

I got better than you
At jumping the queue
To get closer to seeing who's who

A man without a home
Is never alone
...
