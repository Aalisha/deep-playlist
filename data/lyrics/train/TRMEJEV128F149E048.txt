I know the name, I know the game
Humiliation, segregation, discrimination
A cross held high up in the air
You don't like me, you despise me
I am the victim of racial hate
I am the sin, evil within, the social bin
The human soul, she lost control, lost track of time
Because of lies, we threw the dice
And wait for better days, we wait in disgrace
...
