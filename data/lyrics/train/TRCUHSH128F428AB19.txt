(phil vassar, charlie black)

Joe and rosalita, look'em up in the year book
Even then they had that wild-in-love crazy look
Joe's car on friday night, after the ball game
Steam so thick on the windows
They could write their names
They'd fight like cats and dogs outside of homeroom
See'em hangin' all over each other that same afternoon

Joe and rosalita
Ball-cap, good-ole boy and brown-eyed senorita
Rocked this town like no one's ever done
