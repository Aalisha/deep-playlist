It's a song to myself
It's a song to myself
You don't have to listen babe
It's just a song for myself

But since I fell in love with you
It brought some thoughts to mind
If we're gonna raise us a couple of kids
I've got to worry 'bout the future time

Do I believe that the answer is still blowing in the wind?
Do I believe that there are good times rolling babe, just around the bend?
Do I believe that with a little more love now all our troubles end?

Here I am trying to believe in myself
And be a little good, be a little good
Be a little good to my friends

It's just a thought that was in my mind
It's just a thought that's in my mind
You don't have to think it babe
It's just a thought that was in my mind
