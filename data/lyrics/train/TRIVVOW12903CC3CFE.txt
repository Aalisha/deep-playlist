You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
Feels heaven to touch
Oh, I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
