How many roads did I travel
before I walked down one that led me to You?
And how many dreams did unravel
before I believed in a hope that was true?
And how long? How far?
What was meant to fulfill only emptied me still
And all you ever wanted...

Only me, on my knees
Singing holy, holy
And somehow all that matters now is
You are holy, holy

How many deaths did I die
...
