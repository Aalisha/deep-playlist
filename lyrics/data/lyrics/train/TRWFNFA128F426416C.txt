Lost in the shuffle the hustle and bustle of the city
Just a sweet young girl in a knockdown world, such a pity
Well she never worried, growin' up in a hurry
No one showed her the right
She met a man, he took her hand one night

Out on the street all the people you meet
Wanna use you for your innocent ways
Running around you're the talk of the town today
You were so cool you played by the rules
You thought you had it in the palm of your hand
You're on your way to the top and
They won't let you stop 'til you're there
...
