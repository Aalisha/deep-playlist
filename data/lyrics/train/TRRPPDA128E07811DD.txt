Meet this girl right here with her own money,
I got a Benz in my garage,
House with my name up on the lease,
I don't need to ask for yours,
I got my own it feels so sweet,
Knowing that I worked so hard to make my dreams reality

It's whatever 'cuz forever I stay on my grind all day and nite,
Can't be mad at me for anything,
'Cuz I hustle hard just so I can eat,
Got bills to pay, Tryna make my way,
...
