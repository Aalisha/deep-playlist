got the city pon lock
misteeq no how fi rock

keep you bubbling everyday and every night
we don't wanna see you argue, fuss and fight
all we wanna do is dance and feel the vibe
make you feel nice

DJ take back this track
hit them again the reaction if phat
hit them again are you feeling that
music is life its a natural fact
the people with the power they make you feel poor
i wanna see the people on the dancefloor
so here i come again
with a lyric hardcore
i know im still raw
but findin rhymes on deadine is law
taste entertainment you know you want more
with vibing galore
upon the dancefloor
