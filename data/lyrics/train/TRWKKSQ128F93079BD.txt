People of the future will remember
Her fate is something she brought upon herself
Writes a suicide note into the movie
"I love you all too much to carry on"
Everyone will think back to what they were wearing
Or who they were dating when the bones were found
People of the future won't remember names
But their betrayal smells the same
Rain is falling through the floor
Rain is coming rain is coming
Rain is falling through the floor
