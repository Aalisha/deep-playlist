Doujah Raze... Let's see who the craziest is!
See the day turn into night
See the blackness, where's the white?
Through the darkness there's the light
Full moon, you're consumed, now you're terrified
Hear the cries from the castle
Cold stones ache and the moans start to grab you
You can feel ‘em shake, you can feel ‘em bash you
Bones start to break and your heart starts to craaaaaaaaaaaaash
Will it be your last breath?
