Into this brave new world,
I hope i see you in the other side
of this changing world.
Baby when my ship pulls in
i try to believe in anyone,
look at the state I'm in

But for now
I'm just sitted at the table
admiring songs, wishing i was able
stable,

na na na na naranana (3)
I hope i see you at the other side
na na na na naranana
