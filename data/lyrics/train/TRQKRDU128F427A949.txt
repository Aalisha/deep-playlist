So you got the blues
The evening wore out your shoes
To a shufflin' beat
It's a colorful crowd

Spraycan information
Cover the lonely station
A checkpoint for the state of the nation

So you got the blues
And we sleep in hope
The evening wore out your shoes

On the mission-beat beat
The radio drug
Wayward destination
Secondhand sensation
