If I can make it I know that you can you can,
If I can take it I know that you can you can (help me say)

If I can make it I know that you can you can,
If I can take it I know that you can you can

Oooo seen alot of trouble but suddenly it doubles though.(say it aint so)
After all the pain ti is given all that I can give
Confusion and mess fustration and stress test after test after test after test whoo
But I am still here.
