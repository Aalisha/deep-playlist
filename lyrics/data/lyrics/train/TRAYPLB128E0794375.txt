You'd like to show me all around
Thank you girl but I know this town
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
Don't you know they're all the same
Only difference is the name
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
Three motels, dusty cars
A movie show and a dozen bars
It's alright, hey lawdy mama, it's alright
Only thing that I can say
Is we'll be here for just one day
