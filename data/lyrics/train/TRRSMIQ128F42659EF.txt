Coco don't try with gentle persuassion 
to light conversation could be very nice
I hear your voice as soft as the night dear 
but Coco it's not fair it's too high a price
I said no don't Coco don't
don't start something or we'll both be sorry
don't Coco don't Coco don't go 
Coco our love there's nobody watching
