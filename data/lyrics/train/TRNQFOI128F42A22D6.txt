Like a foggy mirror
Where receptions blurred
And things could stand to be clearer
Sometimes it's hard to look you in the eye

If I could be the man on your shoulder
A guide as you grow older
I'd sleep so much easier tonight
Close your eyes they'll tell a story of happy endings

Close your eyes re-write the story a new beginning
And it's not what they said and it's not what we read
And all the promises they made us
Are left shattered on the ground

And your defense
You've done no wrong
And live life in innocence
So how could they have looked you in the eye?
