Tell me you love me
That I don't know how much you mean it
Every time you look in my eyes
You make sure that I can see it
I can't recall if I ever felt this way before
And if I did, wouldn't want those feelings hanging
Around here anymore

Just so you know
You got me
Nothing in the whole wide world could ever
Stop me
If you got love, got love to give
Just keep giving it up and someone will
Let you in
And just, so you know
You got me

Everyday you write it down
