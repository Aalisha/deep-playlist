Don't it make life just a little more special
Knowin' you've got someone who cares
You won't ever have to be lonely
Always has somebody there

Don't it make everything a little bit easier
Knowin' you have someone like me
A hand to take you to the light
When it gets a little bit too dark to see
That's when I like to stop and remind you

You've got me to hold on to, baby
 (You've got me to hold on to, you've got me)
Oh, you've got me to hold on to
 (You've got me to hold on to, you've got me)
