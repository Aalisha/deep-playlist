Brilliant bright, our salvation
Took the fall to hold us up
All the weight of our condition
Lifted away from us

Blessed love, falling under
Sacredness taking hold
Split the air the sound of thunder
Heaven begins to unfold

And the nearness of there
Feels more near
To here

We can feel the breath of the angels
See the walls bend and shake
The sky's in a tremble
Let the dead wake
To sing the songs of the heavens
See the dawn start to break
...
