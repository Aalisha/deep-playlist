In the playground
children sing their songs and skin their knees
play, little monsters, play
i remember doing just the same so many years ago
and the things they'd say

i could handle sticks and stones
but those words still break my bones

chorus
little monsters that rule the world
you don't know what you're really saying
stop before someone ends up getting hurt
...
