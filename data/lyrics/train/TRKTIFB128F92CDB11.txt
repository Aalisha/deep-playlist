I don't mess with the monkey
Let him roll right off my back
I fly like a bee to the honies
Turn a bar to an all out love shack
Can I get an amen, a hallelujah
A little splash of the Coke in my Black Jack
Don't let this black-tie fool ya
I'm a down home groover, a midnight mover

Chorus:
Give me and my bulldog
Sitting on the front porch
Old man Willie be banging on the G-chord
Little girlfriend cooking up a chicken
Sipping on the liquor, everybody listening
