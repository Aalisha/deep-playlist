You said you wanted my love
To be a part of your game
But when I came from above
I looked around, but you turned away

But now you're scratching and crawling
Your way up from the grave
You should have stayed in the dirt, girl
It's like I told you

It's like I told you, I came from outer space
That's how I know your name
It's like I told you, I came from outer space
I want to take you away

You took a drink of my sweet love
And then the poison took
You hooked me up to your sick machine
And then I blew you up
