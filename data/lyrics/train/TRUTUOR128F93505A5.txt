Girl, you know, you got my sympathy
You destroy yourself so easily
Words that start like mandolin refrains
Ending up like bagpipe hurricanes

But it's alright, it's gonna hurt sometimes
Everybody bleeds, even when the sun shines

You got to see yourself like I do
See yourself from my point of view
No one else can get through
Until you see yourself like somebody that loves you

You can bang your head against the wall, yeah
You can build a wall around your head
