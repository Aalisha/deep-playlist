Come on, my baby, don't say a word
Everybody knows it, everybody heard
You're giving it up to me just like I knew you would
Now you will never know what was never good

And I feel it coming down
'Cause I feel it now lighting me up again
Yeah, I feel it now, out of myself again
And I feel it now I'm on my way
And it's taking me back again
