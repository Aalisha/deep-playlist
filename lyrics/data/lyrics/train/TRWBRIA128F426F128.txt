He’s a drug store truck drivin' man
He’s a head of the Ku Klux Klan
When summer rolls around
He’ll be lucky if he’s not in town

Well he’s got him a house on the hill
He plays country records till you've had your fill
He’s a fireman’s friend, he’s an all night DJ
But he sure does think different from the records he plays

He’s a drug store truck drivin' man
He’s a head of the Ku Klux Klan
