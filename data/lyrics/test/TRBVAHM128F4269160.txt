Too black, too strong
Too black, too strong

Flavor Flav:
Yo, Chuck
These alley trippers are still frontin' on us
Show 'em that we can do this
'Cause we always knew this, ha ha
Yeah, boy!

Chuck D.:
Bass! How low can you go?
Death row, what a brother know
Once again, back is the incredible
rhyme animal, the incredible

D, Public Enemy number one
"Five-O" said, "Freeze!" and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?
But it's the wax that the Terminator X spun

Now they got me in a cell
'Cause my records, they sell
'Cause a brother like me said, Well
Farrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you" What you ought to do

Is follow for now, power of the people, say,
"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, We're gonna win
Check it out

Flavor Flav:
Yeah, y'all, c'mon

Chuck D.:
Here we go again

Turn it up! Bring the noise!
Turn it up! Bring the noise!

Flavor Flav:
Hey yo, Chuck, they're sayin' we too black, man
Yo, I don't understand what they're saying
But little do they know they can get a smack for that, man
