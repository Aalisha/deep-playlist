Thugline guess who's back?
(Da thugs)
Tell 'em who the real niggaz is, man?
(Da thugs)

Who the fuck ya come to see?
(Da thugs)
The only niggaz down with me is
(Da thugs)

Who the niggaz straight up off the double glock?
(Da thugs)
Who them niggaz brought you thug love with Pac
(Bone)
 (Da thugs)

Who the niggaz mixin' Hennessey and gin?
(Da thugs)
Let's start this shit up, baby

Niggaz guessin' it is my thug nature
That motivates me to chase me some paper
'Cause bein' broke sure 'nuff wasn't the plans when we made 'em
Straight up, you barely get up off your ass wake up, wake up
Nigga, how long you think this shit gonna last? Yeah
(Thugs)

Get up, get up got to keep your hustle
Got to fight the struggle if ya wanna survive the jungle
You know I'm a thug for life, I'm knowin' you already knowin' that
Don't need to be showin' that
Until it's time to let niggaz knowin that, that's what I'm doin'
 (Thugs)

Gonna go platinum outta the box the tracks out, the raps out
And nigga don't act shocked
You fuckin' with Kray, leatherface sawed off slim
Ghetto cowboy
Whatever you got to say you say it loud, speak up
(Thugs)

No need for flashin' my jewelry to get a broad, hell no
Ain't got no game but nigga my real is raw
You feel me, kill me that's been the discussion of some bustas
I heard them motherfuckas tryin' to do the thuggish ruggish
(Thugs)

Bring it on, we about war, world war
Meet us in the streets or bring it to the show
We can rap, bust caps, make 'em know it
While I strangle this bastard with my microphone cord
 (Da thugs)

Who them motherfuckas wanna be like?
(Da thugs)
