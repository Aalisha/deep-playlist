(Sky Saxon/Daryl Hooper/Jan Savage)
In a land across the seaa
Ruled by dragons known only to me
My lady Ashley waits for me
Holding out her hand
Holding out her hand
A magic carpet couldn't take you there
'Cause its locked inside your head
And you travel all the way
Travel first class
Travel with your mind
