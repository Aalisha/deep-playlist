Tell you like it is with a kiss
Baby when it drips from your lips
Tell you like it is, it's like this
Don't be such a slave to your brother
Baby get shaky after school
Oh, there you oh, there you
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Oh, there you go, there you go
Go, go, go, go
Oh oh, there you go
Go, go, go, go
Oh oh, there you go
Baby get shaky after school
Oh, there you oh, there you
Baby go crazy, break the rules
Oh, there you go, there you go
Go, go, go, go
Oh oh, there you go
