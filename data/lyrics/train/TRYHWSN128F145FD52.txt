well, i guess i could have walked away
but somehow i just had to stay
been down this trail so many times before
but now there's nothing left to leave me astray

yeah, i'm done with all of them lies
even though i know i threw that dice
no second chance to look the other way
as i was caught by those decieving eyes

we all got something up our sleeves
but (now ) i d0n't know what to hide
as i ride on my own
