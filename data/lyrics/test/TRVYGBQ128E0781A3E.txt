Black and white boy
Black and white boy
You're so extreme
You're so confused
Color me in whatever mood I'm in
I could be still in touch with you
And you're full of the wonder of spring
It's all sweetness and lightness you bring
And a room full of people fall to your infinite charm
But when darkness should quickly descend
You go quietly, my miserable friend
To the depths of despair you will crawl
Black and white boy
