Aaaah aaah yeah
I keep fallin' [in and out of love]
I keep fallin' [in and out of love]
I keep fallin' [in and out of love]
In and out of love

Hey love, look what you've done to me
You chained me with hostility
So I could never see
You know the nightmares I've been havin'
about you and me definitely gonna come through
[Here today gone tomorrow] tomorrow
So much hurt, tears and sorrow

[in and out of love] I keep fallin'
[in and out of love] I keep fallin'
[in and out of love] in and out of love
[in and out of love] I keep fallin'
[in and out of love] I keep fallin'
[in and out of love] in and out of love
