Lyrics-Ron

Face to face
Proposition is made
Surrender
All your rights
As a human
With no risk
At all
Hard facts
His word is
His bond
Rebirth
A hot sweaty
Grip of fear
Her cruelty
Can't be controlled
She's your mistress
Body and soul
You signed
A contract to die
She took you
In hand
The spin of her
Web began
...
