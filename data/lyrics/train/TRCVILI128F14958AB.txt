It's getting late, while are you still here, girl
Have you made up your mind, you wanna make love tonight
I want you to hold me, I want to be for real, girl
Please tonight

Don't want you to go, 'cause I don't feel like bein' lonely, no
Not tonight, honey, not tonight
You're so scared, 'cause I can feel your heartbeat
It's so fast

Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Girl, tonight
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
