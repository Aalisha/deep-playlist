Time goes by so fast, and days they seem to dance
Into the distance till they're gone
If I had a map, to lead you down life's path
I'm give it to you but I don't
So go on

CHORUS ONE
Cry hard, laugh loud
Be humble, stand proud
And don't be afraid of your fears
Let love break your heart
Just be who you are
...
