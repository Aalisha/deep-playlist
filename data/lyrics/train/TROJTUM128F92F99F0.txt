No wonder I'm scared
To look in your eyes,
You've turned me away
So many times,
You can take it away
At any given moment,
It's hard to believe
While you're in this disguise

So will you hold me please,
I'm trying hard to breathe
I'm just surviving
So will you hold me please,
I'm trying hard to breathe
Stop me from crying
