I've been to heaven before
But I must have been too young to realize
I would? ve stayed there
If I had known about my paradise

What a time to believe
I could make it on my own
What a lesson to learn
Widen up, you're all alone

I tried to run away but I just
Keep comin' back to you
I keep comin' back to you
No one ever really loved me
Not the way that you do
I keep comin' back to you

There was a time in my life
When everything was all about change
I'm not ashamed to admit
There's one thing that still remains the same
