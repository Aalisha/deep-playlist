Simple, simple lessons, simple...
Sound to be where, make you want to scream.
Always left without, saying hello.
I've seen chains the bear less, snap and fall long before you let go.
Times run over your sink onto my floor,
It's okay, we've cleaned them many times before.
Simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple lessons are, simple...

Sounds might be where, yeah I want to cry
...
