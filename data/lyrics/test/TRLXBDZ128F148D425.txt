[pmd] manslaughter (repeat 4x)

Verse one: erick sermon

Code name e-d, check on the one two three
Black male hard mc
Rap record slave, a brother on the scene
With a machine gun and one magazine
Wanted, a half a million for the body alone
Two million for the microphone
If you see him, dial 5 dash slayer
A hotline to the governor and mayor
He's armed wit ammo, a weapon that's mine
All black in rap, strap tech nine
Silencer clipped, check the rip on the sneak tip
The boy's about ta flip

Manslaughter (repeat 2x)
They call him manslaughter
Manslaughter

Verse two: pmd

Code name md, rappin fanatic
No short taken, black asiatic
Hit man, keeps my belt unbuckled
Book a look on my grill with no signs of a chuckle
Or laughter, cause my name ain't casper
The friendly ghost, but I smoke an mc if I have to
