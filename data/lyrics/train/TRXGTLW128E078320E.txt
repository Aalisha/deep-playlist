I'm so rushed off my feet
Looking for Gordon Street
So much I need to say
I'm sorry that it's on her wedding day

Cos she's so right for me
Her daddy disagrees
He's always hated me
Because I never got a J-O-B

Cos she's mine

And I'm glad I crashed the wedding
It's better than regretting
I could have been a loser kid
Who ran away and hid But it's the best thing that I ever did

True love lasts forever
And now we're back together
Its as if he never met her
So we came back
I'm glad I crashed the wedding
