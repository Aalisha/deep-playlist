I waltzed this whole town
Through every nook and corner
And cranny, and bar
I know you're out there somewhere
Wherever you are

Maybe the sun will rise
I saw it go down and scattered
Its golden light across the ground
I held you in the alley

My hand on your waist
And your eyes were like diamonds
...
