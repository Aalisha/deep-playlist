You came and turned and looked my way
what else can i say
love was in my eyes
You came and made my life complete
with your love so sweet
you gave your love to me
(you gave your love to me)
Chorus: (2x)
take me
take me in your arms
and don't you let me go
i need you more and more
(i need you more and more)
Your love is all i ever need
you're my destiny
this love was meant to be
We'll find a paradise for two
