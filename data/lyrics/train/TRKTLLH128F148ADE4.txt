I have never had an easy life
But I'm not complaining
It has taught me how to stand and fight
For what I believe in
I guess that's just how I was raised
I find it hard to walk away

I will not back down
When you push me to the wall
Expecting me to fall
I will not give in
I am not afraid to fight
For what I know is right

I can only take so much
And when I've had enough
It's not in my blood to just lay down
I will hold my ground
...
