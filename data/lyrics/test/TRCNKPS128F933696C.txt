Make money, make money
Make money, aii
But don't bow fi it, no, never
Wa ha'm to dem

Money don't change we
We a money changer
But if you diss we a danger
We work hard for de paper
'Cause we want big van, an we want sky scraper

Ghetto youth
Don't bow, don't fuck no batty
Ai, trust in a father God
Nd wk 'cause you will happy
Ai, nuh sell your soul, fi change a gillopy
Chase see a man ah run

Inna one car well flashy
(Who)
Nuff bow long time fi versace
An a wear tight pants an trace like mumma lashy
Luv people tings say dem rear dem go dashy
But my dream come true so me rich an me happy

Money don't change we
We a money changer
