You tell me how you've been hurting
You tell me you've stopped believing
Well let me tell you that I've been hurting - too
But let me tell you I still believe in me and you

And now you say - we're trapped in a one way love affair
And so you say - the only one way is going down

When love goes down in flames
There ain't nothing you can do about it
When love's shot down in flames
When love goes down in flames
There ain't nothing you can do about it
When love's shot down in flames
