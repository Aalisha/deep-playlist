You can't erase what's deep inside of me
I know I'm not a sight to see
but baby I'm alive.

I cherish the love and I cherish the life that's inside of me
I know I'm not a sight to see
but baby I'm alive.

Won't you come and rescue me
seperate myself from me
maybe I'm to blind to see
save my life - and rescue me.

I lie awake, it takes it's toll on me
and now my broken heart it bleeds
but baby I'm alive.
