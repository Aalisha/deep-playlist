I need you now
I'm fine don't believe it
You know me enough to know that's a lie
I'm close hard as it is to say
To total this as I barely holding on

I need you now I need you now don't turn away
I need you now oh please don't turn me away
I need you now I need you now

Out here where I've been spinning
It's nearly impossible to slow down
One night of your company
Might be the only thing to keep me sane
