She cant say all the things she wanna say

cause there is always something in her way,

she cant do all the things she wanna do, cause there is someone there like you, holding her down and pushing her back
and yeah you
yooouuuu, have to
let her go, let her grow

she is scared, scared of that -- hand, which means that is everyday, the bloody hand is always there in her way
and she knows, she's nothing but a little toy, only that it be disspoyed, yeah ---
