Save yourself while you can
Watch your back because I'm coming
Wanna listen to me cry, I'm gonna try
I'm back, one back for you to turn on
Just face it
What you're thinking about is impossible
I can't take anymore listen to me
Come to my room, in my bed
But the whore inside you never goes away
In the end it's o.k.
But the hole inside you really shows
Come with me before
Now you're regretting what you're doing
Wanna listen to me cry?
I'm gonna try
One slap in the face was all I needed to face it
