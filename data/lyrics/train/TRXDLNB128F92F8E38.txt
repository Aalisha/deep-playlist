You Know that bitch baby
he's talking shit about our clique but he don't Crazy
You see the writing on my dick
You know that trick, Tracy
yeah, she's making me sick
living that life
we used to do the same shit
shit gets drastic some kids need help
some need there ass kicked
and some would never learn
to earn there own way living of their daddy
had he not been rich
they'd be broker than a joke and forced to switch
you gotta change your tune or change your pitch
because life ain't easy man
life's a bitch
shit is harder than hard about as hard can get
keep on going were you're headed
you's alive to regret it
yes it hurts
to face the truth and
realize that the worlds got your neck in a noose
if things ain't like they ought to be
you 've got to think fast
the aftermath
of your actions whiplash.

I know you all tired of these wannabe thugs
