Well I swear that's you and god we've been down this road before
That the guilt's no good and it only shames us more
And the truths that we all tried to hide
Are so much clearer when it's not our lives, we don't face the blame

Won't you (GET ON YOUR KNEES)
Believe (HAVE FAITH)
In this lie with us all

Now my body's on the floor
And i am calling
Well i'm calling out to you
Can you hear me now?

Well it's not a rebellion when you're selling out
To another fashion salesman
Our promising lives are full of empty promises
Temptation's falling and calling you home again
...
