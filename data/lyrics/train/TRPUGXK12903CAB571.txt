[Killah Priest]
Even Kings die, thrones rust
Skeleton bones turn to dust memories are blown in the gust
It's about how you live when you were here
How you celebrated those years were you a follower? Did you try elevating your peers?
Were you sincere when you gave the prophets your ears?
But soon as trouble come you disappear
Listen here were you real? Did you show love that people could feel?
Did you have jealousy but keep it concealed?
Did you smile at your man's face?
But all awhile wanted to take your man's place
Moving around like a snake
I know you hate that term, don't call it that
Seen that lately that's why the Priest been falling back
'Cause when the Revolution start
All those cliques that fall apart will soon be the Devil's mark
And none the adversary will have a heart
The letter for Priest, my freedom of speech
Y'all read 'em and weep
The demons that keep you from the path just laugh
That's my ink pad looks like Stained Glass
A collage of art, that show scenes from the Nazarene's past

[Killah Priest]
From my connections with 60 Second
The Art of Walter in the city - signed to Geffen
For five-percent lessons, Israelite tribal dressing
Disciple Armageddons, that 'B.I.B.L.E.' record
To Sunz of Man to damn near becoming one of the Clan
Members I remember, in Brooklyn, GZA and Masta Killa
To my last chapters with the RZA
