Look into my eyes, don't you trust me
yr so good you could go far
I'll put you in a movie, don't you wanna
you could be a star
you could go far
you've got twistability
you fly hard, don't you wanna
you've got kissability
you could be a star, it ain't hard

yr driving me crazy, you smell so sick
yr driving me crazy, give us a kiss
