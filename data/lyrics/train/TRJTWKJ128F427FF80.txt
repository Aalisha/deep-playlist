There's a girl waiting for me in Austin
She knows I'm coming through today
She's waiting to see if I'll stop by
Waits to see what I have to say

There's a strong wind blowing in Austin
Strange for this time of year
So I wonder if it's not a message of sorts
Something that I should hear
A message I'm supposed to hear
My head says keep on blowing
My heart says you're out of your mind
Enoughs enough you're only just so tough
You need to learn to read the signs
Of a road that's going nowhere
