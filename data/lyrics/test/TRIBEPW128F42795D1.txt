Stop.
Don´t talk to me.
Loser, Lame-o, wanna-be Like oh, totally.
T-t-totally.

Stop.
Don´t talk to me.
Loser, Lame-o, wanna-be Like oh, totally.
T-t-totally.

Hold up, why you gotta say that.?

You know i like you So im askin where the bae at.

She like, so i´ll say it again.
Cause to me she´s so amazing but to her i´m just a friend.

She drop it down like a earthquake.
The way she movin i´m just wondering the worst way.
But i know she´ll come swerve to me.
Cause these other dudes got money and their love aint free Gotta show i can put it down.
Heart beatin like an 808, you can hear the sound.

Bout to make a move as she turns around.
