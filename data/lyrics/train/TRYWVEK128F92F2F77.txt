In the streets it's getting hot
And the youths them a get so co-o-oold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap, whoo-o

In the streets it's getting hot
And the youths them a get so co-o-oold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap

As generation comes and grows
You gotta make preparation for the youths them a grow
It's what you reap it's what you sow
The youths them have a life in the future so when thats then you know
If education is the key
Then tell me why the people have to make it so expensive for we
Give them the key, oh set them free eeeeeeeeee

In the streets it's getting hot
And the youths them a get so co-o-oold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap, whoo-o
