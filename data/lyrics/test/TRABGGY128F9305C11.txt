You chase in the rat-race
And you always feel so hollow
You marry because it's expected of you
And it only makes you feel more lonely

But still you look down on the teenage dad on
On his estate
He's happy so leave him alone
With his baby
And his modest home
He's happy so leave him alone
With his Jensen Interceptor
It's just a runaround
