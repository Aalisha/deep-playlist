"i want to kill this man
but he turned around ran.
I'll kill him with karate that i learned in japan.
He wouldn't see my face, i wouldn't leave a trace
I would'nt use a bullet cause i bullet's a discrace.

Aw, mom, i never though that i was a murdering man
but tonight i'm on my way.

There's this drawer that i know in a house up the road
that's full of things that are easily sold.
When they go out of town i could go and snoop around
and make myself rich off the things i'd found

aw, mom i never thought that i was a stealing man
