More love
let it fall all down like rain
More love
let it fall all on the human race

You wake up in the morning
And don't know what to do
You wonder so hard
Who is gonna see you through
Struggle through the day
And till the night has come
Who do you think
That could really
Make you be so strong?

More love
let it fall all down like rain
More love
...
