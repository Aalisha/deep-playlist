I'd rather be liberated, I find myself captivated
Stop doing what you keep doing it to
I'd rather stay bold and lonely, I dream I'm your one and only
Stop doing what you keep doing it to

Things are getting strange, I'm starting to worry
This could be a case for Mulder and Scully
Things are getting strange, now I can't sleep alone

I'd rather be jumping ship, I find myself jumping straight in
Stop doing what you keep doing it to
Forever be dozy and dim, I wake myself thinking of him
Stop doing what you keep doing it to
