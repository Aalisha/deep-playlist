in a pressurised cabin i will write
letters blue and white
deputies of hope and honesty
i will stare outside
and photograph the flight
trace the swimming lights
a collision course for continents and me

although the air is thin
you know it rushes by
but it's a home for us
oh the pleasure is all mine
and all the images
are running through my head
...
