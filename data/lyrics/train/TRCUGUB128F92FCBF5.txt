AW SHIT!
Now I got you tremble'n for the battle to begin
I'm not gonna leave this place with no sad face
Cuz I'm gonna win
The battle everybody in the world just came to see
Golden Arms, (ah!) take out these cornwalled ass MC's
All y'all corns - walk out the door (ah!)
You run the same rhyme that the crowd don't wanna hear no more
Gun blastin this and flashin that, reality now actually
You better listen, you better listen carefully
We came here (we came here), to dull the bass (ha, ha, ha)
