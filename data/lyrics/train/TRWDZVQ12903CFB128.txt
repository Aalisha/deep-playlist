Know how it came to this
The hit on me his kiss
Stripped of all dignity - The Man

I set him up - He brought me in
Portrayed the goon to trust - Befriend
Fed the machine - And lived the lie
Concealed the truth to stay alive

Two faced - Can't trace
Convinced what they see

Thick skinned - I'm in
Can't risk - Transparency

Rehearsed - well versed
Who I'm supposed to be
My nerves - I mask - Silence
The fear in me

This plan had better work
Their tapped I'm wired research
No swear I'll blend right in - Right in

Set them up - Knock em dead
Hesitate it's me instead

Lose my nerve - I'll take it all
And I pray he takes the fall
...
