Lover's moon a forgotten road
Two lonely strangers a thousand miles from home
Two hearts just trying to find their way

Like skipping stones in a desperate flight
We caught the wind and sailed across that great divide
Thrown to the night we let passion guide our way
And I can still hear them say

Meet me on the other side
Let's not forget what we shared tonight
That lonely river's running deep and wide
Say you'll meet me on the other side
