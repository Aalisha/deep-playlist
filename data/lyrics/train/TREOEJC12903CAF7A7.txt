Let the games begin
Let the games begin

Passed out, all my friends went
and passed out
So much for the night
Last round for a.m. lovers
that's how I come alive

I'm gonna be a people
person in a room of people people Imma keep on running this shit
Let the games begin
A people person in a room of people people
Imma be the kid for the win
Let the games begin

Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
...
