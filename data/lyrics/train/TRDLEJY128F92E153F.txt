Can you feel the tension?
Have you heard the voices of the lost?
Churning up the fire
To reach the dark side of you

When the walls decide to close in
And the floor disappears beneath you
Just hang on to our last words and

Resolve

Touch your hands to water
Place them on the fire
Have faith
The flame will lose it's strength
Just touch your hands to water
...
