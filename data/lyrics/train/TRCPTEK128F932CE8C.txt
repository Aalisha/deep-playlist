Why are you in so much hurry
Is it really worth the worry
Look around
Then slow down

What's it like inside the bubble
Does your head ever give you trouble
It's no sin
Trade it in

Hang on, help is on its way
I'll be there as fast as I can
Hang on, a tiny voice did say
From somewhere deep inside the inner man

Are you always in confusion
Surrounded by illusion
Sort it out
