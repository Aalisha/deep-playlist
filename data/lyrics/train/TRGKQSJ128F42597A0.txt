Africa Bambaataa
Feel the rhythm of the Africa Bambaataa
Are you ready for the new age?
They are setting the stage

For the renegades
To control your mind
They planned it yesterday, free
Zulu Nation here to stay

Let's get electrified, let's get electrified
Let's get electrified, let's get electrified
Let's get electrified, let's get electrified
Let's get electrified, let's get electrified

Pump it, rockin' it, stickin' it, funkin' it Africa
Pump it, rockin' it, stickin' it, funkin' it Zulu Nation
