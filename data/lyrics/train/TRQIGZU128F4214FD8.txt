I said, how did I get here?
What song did I sing, yeah?
And just what have I done

I've been persecuted like a dying man

The spirit provides me
In a show, no mean martyr days, yeah
The spirit it gives
But it also can take away

You say, I heard all that before
So won't you give it up, baby
And stop using me, boy
I've heard all that before
