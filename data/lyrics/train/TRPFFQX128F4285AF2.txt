Summon the devil and he will come
Summon the devil make your heart numb
Rise of the fallen he'll be there
There for the callin' anytime anywhere

Silent winds begin to blow
Summer rains turn to snow
Night to day then night once more
We bow our heads at of evil's door

Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and caldron bubble
By the pricking of my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
