Ooh yeah, there's so much I wanna say to you, yeah
Whoa, slow it down so I can say what I wanna say
Shouldn't have to tell you how I feel
You know my loving is real
From the crown of my head to the sole of my feet
What is this that I feel, taking control of me
My body's in trouble, it's you that I need
This is how you walk
This is how you talk or this is how you smile
That makes me come alive
I wanna know what it is about you
'Cause every little thing that I've been searching for
Girl, I see it in you, you're my dream come true
Every single day, in every little way
Every single night I pray, that you'll be there for me
'Cause I'll be there for you
This is how you walk
