I'm goin' to Louisiana, and get me a mojo hand
I'm goin' to Louisiana, and get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna fix my woman so she can't have no other man

Cold ground was my bed last night, rocks was my pillow too
Cold ground was my bed last night, rocks was my pillow too
I woke up this morning,
I'm wondering, What in the world am I gonna do?
