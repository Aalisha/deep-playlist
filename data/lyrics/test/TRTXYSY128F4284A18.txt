See when I didn't start
That was because of my shoes
Yeah the shoes that I wore
They would have gave me a bruise
As I follow my dreams
Realise all my dreams
See when I didn't start
That was because of my fear
I had another idea
It almost brought me a tear
As I follow my dreams
Realise all my dreams
The sun will rise
Even if you don't happen to be there
The sun will rise
Even if you don't happen to be there
They came from over
The world and further
To see the race that would change the world
And I stopped...
