There's a little girl on my mind
Little girl all the time
Little girl there's always one
Little girl look what shes done

She drank the tear from my eye
You know I sure hate to lie
Why can't you stay here
You know it's so beautiful
Man how come all girls think there fat?

Hey hey hey she's so pretty
