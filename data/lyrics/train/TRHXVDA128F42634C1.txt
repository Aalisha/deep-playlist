Can we be tight again?
Cause you wanna know something
(Can we? Can we? Can we? ooh)
JE y'all

Can we be tight?
Can we be tight again?
Can we be tight?

I can't go one more day without your love, I'm giving up
Got all my niggas sayin' I'm a punk, and I don't wanna
Feel like I'm chasing, wasting time on you
If you're really through that's cool
Don't hang up the phone as I pour my soul
It's been about two years, had fears
But girl I had to call you
I had to stop my drinking, smoking
Even stopped my balling
I heard that y'all broke up
Hope that you ain't too choked up
One day I just woke on up
Baby can we be tight...

Can we be tight?
I wanna be there for you all I can
Can we be tight again?
I know you just got over your man
Can we be tight?
I tried to ask you time and time again
Can we be tight again?
Again, again
