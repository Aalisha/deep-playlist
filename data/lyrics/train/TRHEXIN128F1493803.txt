Do you feel like you wake up everyday
To watch your life slide right by
Is it slipping away
Does the question call to your mind
Are you just doing time
Could there be a better way
I say yes
You say maybe
But you got know
Do you wanna know love tonight
Isn't it itime you had tree love
Would you like a little peace in your life
Well, wouldn't you
Are you gonna know love tonight
Will you stand in the corner again
