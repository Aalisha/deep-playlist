She says, “It's not you, it's me
I need a little time, a little space
A place to find myself again, you know”
Oh yeah, I know a goodbye when I hear it
She smiles but her heart's already out there
Walking down the street

She says
“I don't want nobody else, I love you”
She's lying
“There won't be somebody else and that's true”
She's lying
“Say you'll always be my friend, sweet darling”
Why does she pretend?

Ain't no doubt, it' plain to see
A woman like you's no good for me
Your heart beating at another door
I'm a damned fool for to ask for more

She says, “It's like in a song, remember
If you love someone, set them free”
