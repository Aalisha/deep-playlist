You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more
You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more

Friday night, it's 10: 15
You're working late, am I naive
To believe that it's true
Finally I've realized
Your lies have opened up my eyes
This love affair, now it's over, over

You've been wrong for so long
And I can't take the pain you bring me
No more
You've been wrong for so long
...
