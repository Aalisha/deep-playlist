She was in love with you
You knew it from the first day
Thought it was cute the way you played
Your little pimp game
And now it's different
'Cause she just won't leave you alone, yeah

You've got to understand
That women don't like to play
She just can't cut off her emotions
In the same way
Don't be surprised when she's blowin' you up
On the phone, yeah

Stop playin' games with her heart
You know it's a shame
The way you treated her
Stop playin' games with her heart
Grow up and be a man

You think that just because
You told her from the get go
