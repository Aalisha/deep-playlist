Keep your elbows off the table
Look before you cross
Buckle up your seat belt
Parental discretion advised

Said, keeping off the grass
Beware of the dog
A restricted area
Police will take notice

Oh, no, don't wanna know
My ass from my elbow
No, no don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
Don't wanna know

Where there's smoke There's fire
Don't be playin' ball in the street
Where there's smoke There's fire
What you sow is what you will reap

Slippery when wet
