Just when I'm saying whatever
Clean slate we're back and together
We're just now, see boy now I know better oh oh oh...

Then we go losing our temper
I'm outro saying forget you
But I can't keep it moving and let you go oh oh oh...

(chorus)
I.I.I... I can't walk away from you when i say we're through
Don't how you do me the way you do
i wish that i never met u
Cus i cant walk away from you when i say were thru
Don't know how i'm so damn in love wit u
i cant walk away from you

How many times did you say sorry
just to turn around and say you don't want me
Flip it back, back and spend a night callin oh oh oh...
