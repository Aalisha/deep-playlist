Days pass me by just like moments
They're here and then
They're gone for good, for good
I work so hard at where I'm going
I wonder what I've missed?

I can't remember the last time
I picked up the phone just
To talk for hours on end
Or sent a birthday card unbelated
Maybe I should slow down

Life doesn't wait for us to get it right
Day after night
It just goes on when it goes wrong
It goes and then it's gone

So, I'm gonna do my best
To make the most of it, avoid regret, yeah
Take a breath, realize, time is irreversible
