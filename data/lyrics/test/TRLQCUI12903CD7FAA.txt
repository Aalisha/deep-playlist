Hey (hey), what's the matter with your head, yeah
Hey (hey), what's the matter with your mind and your sign and a, oh oh oha
Hey (hey), nothing the matter with your head baby, find it, come on and find it
Hey, with it baby 'cause you're fine and you're mine and you, look so divine

Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love
Come and get your love

Hey (hey), what's the matter with you, feel right, don't you feel right baby
Hey (hey), oh yeah, get it from the main vine, all right
