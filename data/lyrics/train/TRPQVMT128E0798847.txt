We are "cop rock" we are screech
We are z. cavaricci
We are laser removed
Tasmanian devil tattoos

We are third string we are puck
We are special people's club
We are the half shirts with
Irreverent spring break top ten lists

We are munsoned we are squat
We are flashing twelve o'clock
We are spread out butt cheeks
Pulled apart so just the air leaks

We are "ishtar" we are tab
We are no right turn on red
We are the moustaches
