(feat. 5 Ela, Jay Dee)

All of y'all, is on our diiiiiiiiiicks
Stop ridiiiin, you might get penetrated
And I'd sho' hate it, if you end up impregnated

Well at least 4 out of 5 niggaz in the place know whattup's or what
Be yellin peaceful cause I got the piece put up
In a box with the rock in the back of the, Lex it protects
I done told 'em that I'm usin my ex

Romancin the lady
Bitches come to take a chance on my meat
I see that you can't wait to get into my pants
Come and dance on my lap, all real we can get buck
Hoochies on the dance show

Sh-sh-sho' nuff, s-s-slow up, shut up
Shut the fuck and start workin me off
Bitch you pressin yo' luck, who says we're fuckin you up
Shh-shh-sluh, suh-slow the fuck up

We got that boom, bip, ni-gga don't slip
Talkin that punk shit, will definitely get yo' punk split
Your major malfunction, make me set trip
Now we dumpin, on yo' bitch, so don't ask me for nuttin

Aiyyo hold up a second fella, the Ela
