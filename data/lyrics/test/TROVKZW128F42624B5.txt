you look me in my eyes, and i could not see your disguise
i followed every caution that i knew, but now it's no surprise
that you can only talk the talk and now there's nothing left for me to do

i will never hold my breath cause I will only suffocate
and while i'm waiting, time is wasting
and i can only do my best to put another to the test
and while im waiting, you're just fading away
