A lot of trucks lined up down by the lake
Drinkin beer on the back of the tailgate
Boys from the valley wanna start a fire
Hey baby what you wanna do tonight
The only fear a rebel heart knows
Nothing to do and anything goes

Looking back on those days of thunder
Shake my head and I have to wonder
How we ever made it through that
Every night your taking me back
Desert road and a restless wind
Ain't it good to feel that way again
Here we are the way we were
...
