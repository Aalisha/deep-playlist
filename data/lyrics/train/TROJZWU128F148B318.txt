I've taken in all you being
An ever moving stream of dramatic evolution
And I've taken in what's happening
And poisoned the well you drink from
With an experienced solution

And I'm not responsible (not responsible)
For what happens when you are gone

You're breathing in all you've seen
An imaginary comfort to create intoxication
And if you only knew what thoughts I had inside
And so good I am to hide your heart
Would hurt and turn to stone just like mine
...
