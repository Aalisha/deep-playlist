O where are you now my love of mine
I've had every drop of my brandy and wine
Until I am safe within your arms
My tears fill all of my days
O say that you won't leave me and say you won't deceive me.
It's a fine man you are, my god you have my heart.
Baby come to my uncle’s wake with me
At your brothers parlour up the street
And I’ll take you away for a drink with me
And I will hold you close to me
Do you remember the first time we met my love
I was stunned at how pretty you are
I couldn't believe you would talk to me
I hung on every word.
Wine comes in at the mouth
Love comes in at the eye
I lift my glass to my mouth
