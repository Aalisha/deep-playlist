You know it's time
You know it's time
You know it's time
You know it's time

Nothing's ever easy
It's always such a fight
Hands are locked and ready
A channel for your might
Another world collides
With your heart

You know it's time to give up, boy
You know it's time to give up, boy
You're mine
You're mine

I know that you feel love
I know that you feel lazy
...
