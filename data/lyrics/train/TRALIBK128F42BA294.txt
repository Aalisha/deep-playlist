Where is your shelter when the roof falls in
What will you drink when the well dries up on you
Who clots the blood when the cut sets in
If a man can't talk, how can he sing

What use is getting if you can't give back
Who'll keep you warm if the sun won't shine on you
Where is your home, on the rock or the sand
Who do you serve, money and man
