Let's get moving into action
Let's get moving into action
If your life's too slow, no satisfaction
Find something out there, there's an attraction
If you hesitate now, that's a subtraction
So, let's get moving girl into action

We take the 43 bus, we got no plans
The girl in the miniskirt, her name's Suzanne, right
The one with in high heel boots is Sharon
And Karen is the one with the blonde wig on
And with a bullet, man, we're going number one
And we don't need any money to have any fun

Let's get moving into action
Let's get moving into action
If your life's too slow, no satisfaction
Find something out there, there's an attraction
