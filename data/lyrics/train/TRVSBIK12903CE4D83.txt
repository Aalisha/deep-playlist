I don't know why, I made you cry
I'm sorry sweetheart and yet
Though you shouldn't be lenient with me
I hope you'll forgive and forget

What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
