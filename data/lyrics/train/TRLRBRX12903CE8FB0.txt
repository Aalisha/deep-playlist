Entwine with despair like a lover
Bleak obsession takes its toll
Burnt souls in the wake
Embers at the stake
The cycle internal unfolds

Ancient wounds fester and bleed
Empty food from which they feed
Sustain the wealth
Subliminate the self
Create the suffering we need

Slow crawl
Timeless call
Watch it burn
...
