I fell into a black hole
The ones I used to know
Had been leaving me alone

When I've got to stop the way we used to see the times we had
I won`t be be the same anymore

You and I were always between
The things I never saw
The stranger isn`t me...

When I've got to stop the way we used to see the times we had
I won`t be be the same anymore
