I got a letter from my love
It said exactly what I'm thinking of
No words can say
Well, darling I'll find away

You see your diamond ring
Here to say that doesn't mean a thing
Without your love
If that's all we really got then take it off, tear it off

Swear your love, say you don't need no diamond, baby
If some piece of papers keepin' us together I ain't buyin' it, baby
Swear your love, all your really got after it's said and done
Is what you tell each other when it's one on one
Darlin', won't you swear your love?
