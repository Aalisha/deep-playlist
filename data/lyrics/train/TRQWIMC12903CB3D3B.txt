You ask me if we can live together
Marriage doesn't fit your way of life
And you say that you'll be with me forever
Well if that's true, please make me your wife

'Cause if I'm good enough to be your woman, good enough to share your life
Good enough to live together, I'm good enough to be your wife
Good enough to have your children, good enough to give 'em life
Good enough to do your cooking, I'm good enough to be your wife
