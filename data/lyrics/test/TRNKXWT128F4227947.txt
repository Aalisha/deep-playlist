time to drive out to nowhere special
just to believe you're thinking straight
soothed by the blurred and interstitial
happy to ruminate on hate
slurring the words to half a love song
shamed like the amateur on stage
mouthful of coins for penny candy
dreaming there's nothing more at stake

it's so sweet
taste fuel for faking
love and dread
...
