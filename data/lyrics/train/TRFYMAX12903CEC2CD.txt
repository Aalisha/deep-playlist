Vessels sink, men go under
I don't wanna die, it feels like cancer
A bridge-collapse, a train that flies
I'm scared of the screams that fill the skies
You're not gonna die, he says, he lies
Feel hell underfeet, I feel how it fries
Second by second I sink underneath
Second by second I sink underneath
