Daz Dillinger (Kurupt)]
Nigga what you gon' do? (Nigga what you gon' do?)
I'ma bang on these bustas (I'ma bang on 'em too)
I'ma ride through the Beach (I'ma roll through South Central)
Hey, there them niggaz go (C'mon homie, where's the pistol?)
(Ridin') Bangin' (Dumpin')
Niggaz ain't really sayin' nothin' that we can't make somethin'
D.P.G. is the letters of the gang
(Daz and Kurupt dippin' on them gold thangs)

You know I'm hittin' on the switches
From back to back, it's me and my nigga
Like Snoop and Dre we dippin' and we '6-4 bouncin'
You know it's Dogg Pound Gangstas, you know that we loungin'
We back up in the house tearin' down the roof
You know the dogg is in the house when we yell out 'woof!'
You know we give it to you all night long with the shit that we got
Me and my nigga, yeah we burnin' hot

You want the gauge or glock? I got both
And I'ma give it to you whether you like it or not
As long as the 'four can hop I'ma scrape curbs block to block
I got all the ladies off that do-it fluid
Like Bigg Snoop said "Ya gots to do it"
I thought you knew it, I'm cool as coolin'
Dippin' bangin' that Dogg Pound Gangsta music

And this ain't for you suckers who ain't used to it

Dippin' like what it 'bout, tell these niggaz one more time
Can't even look a real nigga in his eyes
