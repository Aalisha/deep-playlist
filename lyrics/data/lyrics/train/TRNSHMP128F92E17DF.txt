(Eddie Howell, David Dundas)
Come to me I am woman
I can ease all the pain
Baby, take my love I am woman
Let me show you the way
I can do it naturally
Com'on baby take my hand
Everybody needs a friend to understand
Nothing could be so good (nothing could be so good)
Nothing could be so easy
Baby, just call my name
It's all you have to do
And I'll take care of you
So, come to me I am woman
I can ease all the pain
