Turn your head
If it don't feel good
Turn your head

Turn your head
If it don't feel good
Turn your head

Think about the good things
That I did to you
And think about the bad things
That I didn't do, that I didn't do
That I didn't do, that I didn't do

Turn your head
If it don't feel good
Turn your head
If you don't wanna take it

Turn your head
If it don't feel good
Turn your head
If you don't wanna take it

Turn your head
