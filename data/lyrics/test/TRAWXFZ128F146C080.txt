Ever since I was young
I've been hanging around
Like a curious boy
In a cellar full of noise

When my baby found a way
Ooh to stay out late
Well we'd cruise until dawn
With just the radio on

Now all I've got is the music
To remind me of the times we had
All I've got is the music
It goes on and on and on and on
