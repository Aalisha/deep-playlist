I've got a fetish for you
A fetish for me
A fetish for coffee
I've got a fetish for tea
I've got a fetish for Brando
A fetish for cats
A fetish for ladies in Christian Dior hats

I've got a fetish and that means I'm sick
I've got a fetish and that means I'm sick
So very sick
(No go, Tibbs)

Any more for the Christian D'or?
Any more for the Christian D'or?
Any more for the Christian D'or?
Christian D'or?
Christian D'or?
Christian D'or?

Got a fetish for black
A fetish for green
A fetish for those arty magazines
I've got a fetish for blondes
A fetish for blondes
A fetish for blondes
A fetish for blonde haired girls

I've got a fetish and that means I'm sick
