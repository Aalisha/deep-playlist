When I was just a boy
We lived on the side of a mountain
Right near the vale of a waterfall
When I was just a boy
We lived in a one-room cabin
One room full of love and that was all
That was all

Way back up on Soapstone Mountain
Way up high where the spirits run free
Way back up on Soapstone Mountain
What a wonderful place to raise a little family
