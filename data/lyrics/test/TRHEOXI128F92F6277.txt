"I do not feel obliged to believe
that the same God who has endowed us
with sadness, reason and intellect
has intended us to forgo their use"

So all the stars
Will guide us on our way
The Sextant as a leader
Has duration for all days

Look at the amazing skies
In long and profund discoveries
With a strong and a clear mind he's encrypting
More secrets of astronomy

In endless nights
He entirely observes the skies
His publications will change the world

Galileo Galilei
