Barri-Sloan

You can change the mask you wear
But not the way you feel inside
Go bury your head into the sand
But you can never hide

Your mind it is a battleground
Your brain's a raging storm

Chorus:

Here's where you belong
[2-4, 6: Baby] Here's where you belong
Don't let your fantasies take you away from me
Here's where you belong
...
