You said you would have but u couldn't let go
You said you should have but you needed some more
I know you would have, if you could have it all
You said you would have, but you needed, needed some more

You need a way, to leave yourself behind
To burry your name
To fade across the line

You said you should have but you wouldn't let go
You said you could have but you needed some more
I know you would have if you could have it all
