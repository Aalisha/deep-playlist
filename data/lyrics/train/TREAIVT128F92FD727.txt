Everybody's looking
Over your shoulder
Seems they can't wait
To hear what's next
Everybody's saying
She's lookin' older
Could it be there
Is a cruel subtext to

All this endless adulation
All this reckless infatuation
And

I will stay
With you tonight in
Case this corset
Gets too tight and
I will keep you
Company cause
That's what
A sister should be
