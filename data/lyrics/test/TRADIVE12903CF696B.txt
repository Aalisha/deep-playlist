There's flies buzzing 'round me, I'm begging for a breeze
The grass that surrounds me is so high that I can't see
There's something out there watching me and I can't find no peace
If it catches up with me, its gonna kill me by degrees
Stand up, Wake up
The sun is sinking fast now and the night is moving in
