All alone, a rainy night, no one around
But I feel someone's watching me
I look around, the street is bare, nobody there
I wonder what it could be

As I turned to walk away, suddenly I saw his face
Never minding that we were alone
Didn't care about the time
At the moment I was feeling fine

I was looking into stranger's eyes
(He caught me by surprise)
They looked right through me
(He looked into my eyes)

Never knew
(Never, ever thought that love could be)
That's when he came
(He came and captured me)

Like a scene out of a dream, I can't believe it
Kind of strange and familiar
But in his eyes I get a sign, I get a feelin'
I get the feelin' he knows me
