Birthday Party, The
Miscellaneous
Deep In The Woods
Mmmmmmmmmm...

The woods eats the woman and dumps her honey-body in the mud
Her dress floats down the well and it assumes the shape of the body of a
Little girl

Yeah i recognize that girl
She stumbled in some time last loneliness
But i could not stand to touch her now
My one and onlyness.

Deep in the woods
Deep in the woods
