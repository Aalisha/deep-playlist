And this is the way it's going to be
I gave him away and now I'm free
But he was the life I meant to lead
There's nothing left of me but
This is my melody

And why must the night crawl by like this
And why do we dwell on what we'll miss
I've got to be careful what I wish
My happiness was his
But this is my goodbye kiss

He got me down
And now I'm only singing for my health
Got me down and now I can't get up myself
Got me down oh turn around
...
