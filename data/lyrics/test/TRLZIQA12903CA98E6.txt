I know it's been a little tough lately,
You've been looking kind of worried baby,
Like you don't know what's going on with us,
You get lost and then I get sadder, we forget about the things that matter,
We should have a little faith in us for once,
It can't always be perfect, gets better then gets worse then,
Just proves that we're still learning, baby I know

It gets so hard,
Sometimes we aren't quite like we used to be you and me
But we've got no scars and it's been so long my love is strong,
Strong as it used to be, you and me, we still belong,
(We used to be, you and me baby)
(We used to be, you and me baby)

There's nothing more important to me,
