Sometimes we wish for the better
When we have it good as it gets
Sometimes the grass isn't greener
As soon as we find out, we forget
Sometimes a fool he's doesn't know he's a fool
Sometimes a dog, he don't know he's a dog
Sometimes I do stupid things to you
When I really don't mean it at all

Sometimes a man is gon' be a man
Its not an excuse, its just how it is
Sometimes a wrong, don't know that they wrong
Sometimes the strong, ain't always so strong
Sometimes a girl is gon' be a girl
She don't want to deal with all the drama in your world
God knows I don't mean to give it to you
So girl, I'm sorry for the stupid things
I wish I didn't do but I do

Oh
Oh no
Oh
...
