you hear the rumblings at the fest
rowdy boys in ancient dress
but nae a one will near confess
what lurks beneath the tartan

you see the swagger and the sway
imagination runs away
could there be cloth or is there nay
behind the pleated curtain

finnich inarra finnich aneeah
finnich a feileadh mor
a trophy or two and a ribbon of blue
what's up yours?

when Irish eyes are smiling
what do you think they're smiling for?
it's a nod and a wink to me lucky charms
what's up yours?

we stand here proud before the king
we love to pipe, we love to sing
...
