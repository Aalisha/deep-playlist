Hypnotic tango
Tango
Tango!
Stock in my seat can't move no way the other guys knows the game to play
I'm watchin' her
I'm watchin' me

Take him apart say listen to me.
Look on the floor and all is spinning round

Someone told me this was just a dance

And take a chance ain't met before
Do you think i really have a chance?
