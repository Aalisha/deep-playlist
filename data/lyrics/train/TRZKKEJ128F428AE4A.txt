Everything will soon turn black, so here's my letter
To get it off my chest
Promise father, don't look back, it's not for the better
I know you tried your best

Everybody seems so happy like they all share
Something I haven't felt for years
For long, I've tried to just hold on but now I don't care
I'm closing down my thoughts and fears

Forgive me, life is cruel
I'm leaving you

Hear you, little brother, me, you know I'm sorry
For every high hand
Give my love to mother, please, tell her not to worry
...
