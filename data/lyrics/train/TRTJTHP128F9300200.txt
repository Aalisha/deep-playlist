You're the one and the every one
I got a list of the things that you've done
Life's dirty and you know that it's true
Take a look at what is coming out of you

You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight
You love me, you love me, you love me
My lamb, hovering in the moonlight

Little cheap and it's never untrue
...
