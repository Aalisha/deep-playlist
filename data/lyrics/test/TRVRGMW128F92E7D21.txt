All the bottles and the ashes blanket the ground
The sluts stagger out with their skirts hiked up, right on time now
I think it's time to go home, do you want to go home?
The disco ball is swinging low

I found my lover on the radio
She sang me songs from a long time ago

Blackout, shout it out loud
The devil's keeping time on the brake pad now
It's the music on the radio
That's taking me home

When the crowd gets to spinning, I can barely hold on
The liquid junk pumps through my veins and I scream the wrong song
