Two Ships go down off the coast too far
Almost drown off the coast too far
Shaky shoreline keeps you near and far
At the same time, don't know where you are

Sellin' souls and skin while we undress
Beauty of the swim what we do best
That's not why I'm here; to kiss your eyes
Simply to be near; I miss your eyes
