When i see that girl go walking by
i know a boy shouldn't cry
here it comes again, that feeling
here it comes again
When i see her look into his eyes
no matter how i try
here it comes again, that feeling
here it comes again
I find i'm cry-y-y-y-in over you
i know it's nothing to do-o-o-o-
now i'm on my own, i walk alone
