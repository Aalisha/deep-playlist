In this life there are many disappointments
The problems we have is there an end?
Is there an answer to the sorrow and pain?

There is a love you should know
The love of God is an everlasting love
The love of God is an everlasting love

Now that you know that the Lord is so mindful
And He surely cares about your every need, yeah
And He said He's never gonna leave
