Look around, look around. There's no affection only infection.
Suit yourself, suit yourself. Can I depend on you to surrender?

[Verse 1]:
And we will storm their shores, by suffocating all they see
Fixating all the *word*
And we'll soon be dust and there will be no riots
No memory or history, only an unrelenting burst
Side by side we'll comb the earth and sweep it clean
Constant feat unified
The hands of man is no match for, our war-less army

[Chorus]:
Please tell me that this is the end of the world,
it's time to re-erase history, without a trace or a memory
(And we will strike with the hands of god and leave nothing in our wake)
(And we will strike with the hands of god and with a word we'll see fate)
Please tell me that this is the end of the world,
it's time to re-erase history, without a trace or a memory
