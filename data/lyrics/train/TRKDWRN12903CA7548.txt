It take a whole lotta lovin'
Just to keep my baby happy
It take a whole lotta kissin'
And a whole lotta holdin' her hand
It take a whole lotta lovin'
Just to keep my baby happy
Coz she's a whole lotta woman
And she gotta have a whole lotta man

Well when she love me
She love me so hard
She almost make-a-me mad
And when she kiss me
If she don't miss me
...
