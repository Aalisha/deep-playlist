Learnt me to rock and I learnt me to roll
You got to use it, baby, to keep your soul
Go down to town get some reaction
Got to go down 'cause I need a distraction

I've been trying it on with everyone in sight
Dhe's been waiting so long for me to come tonight

Baby's on fire and I'm burning up
Sparks been flying, she can't get enough
Can't get enough but she's got what it takes
Baby's on fire and I got the shakes

There ain't no cure and there ain't no time
You got to have it and have it fine
Don't say a word about her affections
I'm going to come from another direction
