Back up buddy, don't you come any closer
I know you want her but the answer is 'No sir'
Back up buddy don't you come any closer, she's mine all mine

Oh buddy, I've seen you winking your eyes at the dolly I've got with me
I'll whittle you down to a punier size if you don't let her be
She's pretty and cute as a doll could be, she's a-loving and a-cuddling too
But her cuddlesome charms are only for me and not for the likes of you

Back up buddy, don't you come any closer
