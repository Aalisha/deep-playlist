Trace back fingertips of lonely men, and you will discover a certain pinch.
Realize empty bottles and empty help a better man die slow. Trigger thoughts
break the silence, and ancient hearts cry alone. I tried to warn you, let's
put this all to an end. This is war... This is war... Fractions make violins
...
