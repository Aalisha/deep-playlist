In this fair town we laid them down in 1643,
It was poor King Charles who travelled for miles, in the heart of a civil dream.
As fierce young men we took a mighty stand, and waited for the call.
We were the first ones over the wall.

These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom.
These four walls.

A shot rang out from behind the hill, as we marched along the bank.
We were stuck in fast between a heavy marsh, and our clothes were torn and damp.
"So steady your guns until the last man comes", our captain he did cry,
I was the last man to see him alive.

These four walls are at the heart of the kingdom.
These four walls.
