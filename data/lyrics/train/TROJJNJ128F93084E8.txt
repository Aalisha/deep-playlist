When dark of night changes brightness of day
And I forget of the pain
I see the Spirit of Love
Fly above the ground and bright light shine around
It turns out Â– it's nothing but a dream,
Keep it out!

I feel every day and every night
That time of our life is limited
The road we go along leads always right
