Something has stuck in
Underneath my skin
Eyes all looking in
For something within
Somewhere in here

Now everything I say
Gives this all away
Senses deadened again

Careful what you're feeling
On the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?

Felt that I belonged
