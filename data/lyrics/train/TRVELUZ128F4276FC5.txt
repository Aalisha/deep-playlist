Mary pretends she's so insane
So insane, so insane
Mary pretends she's so insane
So insane, so insane

She just sits back and laughs at the pain
Laughs at the pain, laughs at the pain
Mary pretends she's so insane
So insane, so insane

Falling down of her mind
Gives her everything she's wanted from the world
Close her eyes, drift inside, so alive

She's gotta know what it feels like
