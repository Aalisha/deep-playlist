You've got your plans to do things right.
I've got my mind it's all made up.
We have our time,
but now it's running out of space.
You know my life is just a speck,
and your heart is all the same,
see I've been staring too long at the screen.
Oh God, my mind is such a mess,
but there's these things I got to do.
you were my friend,
but now you're taking off your clothes.
I tried to look, but close my eyes.
I took a breath and made you mine.
You had your arms all tangled up in the moon.

Whats say,
that night you took away a little more than just my breath.
I swear to God that I was thinking about the summer,
or the words that I wrote on the walls that saved my life.
I don't care if I will ever be the same,
but everything just keeps reminding me of winter.
