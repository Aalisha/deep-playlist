Reach on out and touch me
Give me thrills like I never had
Reach on out and touch me
You got something that is driving me mad

My head is reeling
Nobody ever had me feeling this way

ooooooh

Reach on out and touch me
Well I'm having a bad time waiting for your love
Reach on out and touch me
Keep it movin' 'til I tell ya I've had enough
