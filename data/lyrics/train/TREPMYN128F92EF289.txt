[Robot voice]: We are intent only on our own gain.

Tune in and avert your eyes to the blank telescreen.
GO!
They're watching you sleep.
Telling you to eat, for it could be soylent green.

Now, now, now, look away and go back to bed.
They will get what they need.
Will we sleep, work, and play?
When we consume and obey.

Cuz we are all born into a control mindset.
God/money makes a death threat on ethics.
Governed by greed and a fail routine.
Can we just justify the means if we're plugged in (to now(?))?
We all to wake up cuz we've been detached for too long.
We need to deprogram from
shifting with the public eye.
We have a right to question why.
See through the lies.
Re-sensitize. And look closer.

Kids, school. Get married and beyond.
