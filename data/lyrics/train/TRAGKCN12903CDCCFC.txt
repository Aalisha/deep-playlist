To all my listners out there
This your boy, Kut Calhoun
And this song here, is about my life
It can be about your life
What people have to say about, won't let you live your life
Here's what I think

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
My pants is saggin' braided hair
People stare but I don't care
It's the life that I choose to lead
I'm who I choose to be
And who are you to be abusing me?
With your hypocritical, stereotypical slanders
"Oh! he's a thug he must sell drugs at random"
Just because I'm a young black brother I gotta slang dope
And disrespect black mothers, Nah!
I'm a king for a queen, on a quest to ball
I'm the spleen in a man, an threat to yo'll
I'm black, strapped and packed with intellect and all
I'm what you call your worst nightmareÂ ?
Cause I don't walk around with a happy face
I got a face stressed, and feed mouths, I ain't livin' in Happy Days
So you can say what you wanna
I'ma still gonna be the same ol me in the mornin'
(know why?)

[Chorus]
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
It's my life (life)
Here's my chance to make you feel
What I feel
If it's real
Move on
And god bless the child that can hold his own

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Now everybody got something to say
About who I be fuckin
...
