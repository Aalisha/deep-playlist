I'll play you out like PSP, Nintendo Wii and Sega 3 or 4 or 5
What have you... Why would you even try to get above me?
You're too ugly, ugly

I'm like TV, you see me, hear me like CD
But clearly we be on different degree levels, whatever
No you can't me touch me
T-T-Touch me, touch me

Ladies and Gentlemen you're welcome to the freakshow
It's official and you're seated in the front row
Don't you blink cause you're about to see some heads roll
Live and direct - Full on effect
