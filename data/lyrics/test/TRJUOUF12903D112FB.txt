You're on the go
You're always wanna go
You want to go somewhere
Where you don't know

And when you run
And when I try to run
You leave me bent over
With a stitch in the road

You are a maze
A complex sum
I've counted all my fingers
And I'm on to my thumb

You are a storm
You are my little storm
I watch the wind change
To find out where you've been blown

Pull it up
And steer it up
...
