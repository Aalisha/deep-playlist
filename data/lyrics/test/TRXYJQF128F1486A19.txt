Late at night you called on a phone,
We talked about the day,
When you found out he was cheating.
You tell that it hurts to the bone,
To trust someone that way.
To find that he was deceving,
And I know I've always just been your friend,
But if you look my way,
I'll make sure you'll never hurt again.

Do you know I exist, just to promise you this,
Endlessly to be true to you,
And if you answer my prayer,
I cross my heart and I'd swear
Endlessly to be true to you,
