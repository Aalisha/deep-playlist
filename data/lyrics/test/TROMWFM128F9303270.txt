Lights are flashing down the alleys
The reaper has arrived
The medieval brutality is still alive
The death machines of one
Hundred countries are ready to strike

No remorse no mercy only hate is in their eyes
Satan and his legions will be their guides
He'll make the world a slave to his hellish might

Reaching out for your life
The world is prepared to die
Death will fall from the sky
And the reaper will arrive

Open your eyes if you can
...
