In my eyes you see the pain
With each lie I take the blame
With each sigh I slowly fall away

You are there when I need you
You sew me up when I bleed through
The endless cloth of lies surrounding me

Everything that I am you have given me
The lessons that I've learned are bringing me home
It's everything that I need
It's all the truth that I believe
Right where I need to be
Just bring me home
