You tried to spit at the sun, put it out like a burning ember.
She has a porcelain soul.
As you crawl under the moon.
Make this bed and sleep forever.
She has a porcelain soul 'cause the life you live is less than alive.
As they scream, "let them burn," you know she'll burn at the hands of your kin.
As they scream, "let them burn," you know you won't forgive them
She crawls through the dirt like a four legged spider.
