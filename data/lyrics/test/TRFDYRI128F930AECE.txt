ROBERT SOETERBOEK:
He's a stranger,
I don't know where he's coming from.
Is he a danger to me?
Or just another man?
He knows magic,
Or maybe he's a charlatan...
Is it a sly trick he plays?
Does he have a plan?

From the depths of my mind...
He said he'd burn like star and disappear,
But leave his spirit behind...
