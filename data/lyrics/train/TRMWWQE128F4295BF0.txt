Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy?
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's goin' down

Cover up with make-up in the mirror
Tell yourself it's never gonna happen again
You cry alone and then he swears he loves you

Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world will bear a consequence
