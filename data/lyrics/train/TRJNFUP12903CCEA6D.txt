[Spoken]
Whats that glare in your eyes,
Evil marks in the sky
Your gonna die
your gonna die...

[Sang]
You look for an answer inside of a balloon,
not even blown up.
A one way detour no return, downhill fall,
Never going up.
You thinks its ok, that you have everything in control,
Handling just fine.
Well thats not the truth you see its not the truth at all,
You're falling behind.
I can see that...
