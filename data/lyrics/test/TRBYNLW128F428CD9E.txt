Last night it came upon me
Got the blues upon sunrise
As I reached to touch your shoulder,
I was struck by the surprise

You packed up your belongings
Stole away into the night
Nary a sign is left of you here
Guess I'll lay back down and cry

*chorus*
Why do they always leave me?
Happens just about every time
And I can feel you haunting
through the back pitch of my mind

There's never been any reason
