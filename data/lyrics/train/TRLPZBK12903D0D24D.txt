I am going to play for you our first tune tonight it s going to be about four tunes
And the first tune, here it goes
1, 2, 3

[Chiddy Bang-Verse 1]
Now When them fights go down
Them lights go down
In villas and the village people might be round
THey say that all the people gonna like me now
Becausse I talk about the issues in this life we found
All through the country people getting slain
Piority religion disobey get hanged
I know some little kids quick to get militant
Just give them packs of the gun
They really feel the clips
They told me not to worry bout the struggle
And they don't gotta worry cause it's suttle
Tell em about the government taking away the light
Aviation is ruined they say when you take a flight
Say when you take the continent from the white man threw
White man colonize wealth can't do
They fly g5 but they gotta land too
We explode like the landmines thatthey ran through

[Hook]
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO
Oooooo, OOooooo OOooo OOOO
