I could write a letter
That'd take too long
I don't want to upset her
Soon I'll be gone

I could settle down
I could be that way
Let go the sound
Price that you pay

The wheels go round
But all I see is
My inspiration getting further from me

The wheels go round
The road gets longer
The more that I'm away the more my love gets stronger

Kiss me there
...
