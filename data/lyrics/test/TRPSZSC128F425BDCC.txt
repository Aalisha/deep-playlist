Break it, bop it, niggas beat box it

I do what I do like I do it for TV
I guess what I'm doing I'm doing to keep the
Shoes on my feet sweeter than sweet pea
So you sucka MCs really can't outstep me
I grab em like I rock em from nine to five
Self-employed, kickin? is my hobby and job
Easy rock beats with bass, ladies callin me Rob
Bass, bass, bass, bass
I'm on my '88 shit
Cuban link chains and Gezel frame lens
Guess Jeans, stone-washed
Rockin' top 10 beats
Flickin' on my fit
I got my foot lookin like a '88 draft pick
Is that sick? It gets sicker than the flu
And sir, you came to pretend I'm you
Attain you a class on how to be cool
And in fact, I'm the superintendent of the school
Uh, yeah and I'm back on my job
I press and twist knobs
Just to make your head nod
All you wack rappers need to keep your day job
And my work here is done, I'm a take the day off

Do the smurf, do the wop, baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringin '88 back
Do the smurf, do the wop, baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringin '88 back
(Smurf it, wop it, at the bus stop and)
(Break it, bop it, niggas beat-boxin)
Do the smurf, do the wop, baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringin '88 back
(Smurf it, wop it, at the bus stop and)
(Break it, bop it, niggas beat-boxin)
Do the smurf, do the wop, baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringin '88 back
