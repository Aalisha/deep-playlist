Long black Limousine
Shiniest car I've ever seen
The back seat is nice and clean
She rides as quiet as a dream

Someone dug a hole six long feet in the ground
I said goodbye to you and I threw my roses down
Ain't nothing left at all in the end of being proud
With me riding in this car, and you flying through them clouds

I've had some time to think about you
And watch the sun set like a stone
I've had some time to think about you
On the long ride home
...
