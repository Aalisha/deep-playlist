Enter my dream, baby,
Enter my dream.

Jung river won't you stop for me awhile,
Hold me like a sleepy child,
And take me where I'm bound to be.

I'm walkin' on the wings of make-believe,
I'm livin' out the fantasy,
That I know well,
I've been visitin' there all my life.

'Cause you see,
Happiness finds me sleepin',
There I know I go beyond reality.
It'll be effortless and easy,
Somebody take me there.
