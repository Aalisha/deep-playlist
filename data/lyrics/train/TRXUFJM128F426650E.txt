Take a good look at yourself
You're probably singing along
Lying alone in your room
Or cruisin' down an empty road

Or maybe you're on your feet
In a crowd of strangers and friends
The spotlight's on someone else
But you feel like you're part of the show

What's the magic in the music
And why does it bring us together like this?
We all have a longing inside
And it keeps us singing song after song after song

We're all waiting for the best song ever
It's somewhere out there and everyone can feel it
