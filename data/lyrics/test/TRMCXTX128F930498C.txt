Entering the sacred world of might
To where the stormy kingdoms home
Here naked winds blow cold and free
All black and dead on frozen ground

Pass the gate to Blashyrkh worlds
An everburning fire swirls
Here shadows hold a grimly sight
Dark must the eyes that see it be

Elder visions rise - the legends and myths
