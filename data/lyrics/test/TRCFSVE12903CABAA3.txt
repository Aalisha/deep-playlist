If there was nothing that i could say
turned your back and you just walked away
leaves me numb inside i think of you
together is all i knew
We moved too fast, but i had no sign
i would try to turn the hands of time
i looked to you for a reason why
the love we had passed me by
And as the sun would set you would rise
fall from the sky into paradise
is there no light in your heart for me
you've closed your eyes you don't longer see
There were no lies between me and you
you said nothing of what you knew
but there was still something in your eyes
left me helpless and paralysed
