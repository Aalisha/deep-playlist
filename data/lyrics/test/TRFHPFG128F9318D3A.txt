You mean I've been dancin' on the floor darlin'
And I feel like I need some more and I
Feel your body close to mine and I
Move on love it's about that time
Make me feel - mighty real
Make me feel - mighty real

You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

When we get home darlin' and it's
Nice and dark and the music's in Vienna
Still your hot and you kiss me back and it
...
