I don't believe in anything
They tell me's set in stone
They say that were together
But I'm sat here on my own
In the company of strangers
This trigger happy scene
Well if a heart do like a hind
Then there is nothing in-between
Oh no, no I don't mind
Oh no, no I don't mind
Cause I can call someone to bring the fight on
(the doctors and the dealers)
Get someone to shed some light on
(miracle cure, soul stealers)
Crack pot quacks with cracked up egos
(prescribing old placebos)
Collecting junk that we dont need, no
I see them now and then
Still spitting out those lies
Strange it doesn't bother me
...
