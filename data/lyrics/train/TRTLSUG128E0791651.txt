Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh
Oooooh
The name: All Saints
Year: 2000
Good or bad?
Saints or Sinners?

Fast? Slow?
Stop? Go?

I got the strangest feelin'
I refuse to believe in
I got the strangest feelin'
Feeling you remindin' me
Deeper down you're desirin' me

I'll befriend you, (I'll befriend you)
I'll try to pretend to (Try to pretend to)
Have your interests at heart
Promise to take you far
Open up your mind
Are you ready for the ride?

Do you wanna go fast?
Do you wanna go slow?
Do you wanna stop?
Do you wanna go?
Are you ready?
Do you wanna taste me?
You cant waste me, love me, hate me

You can go up, but you gotta come down.
Aint no joke,
I aint foolin' around
Things some to test you,
I'm about to let you
Make you have a good time,
Make you lose your mind

Baby you can run,
But you know you cant hide
Are you a saint,
Or a sinner inside
