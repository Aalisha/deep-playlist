You know the niggas that fall
When he got hit with that thang
Bend yo' knees until your hips go
D4L, bend your knees until your hips go
Make ya get real low, bounce on your toes hit after hit
Make ya get real low, bounce on your toes
Bend your knees until yo' hips go oh
I make ya get real low, bounce on yo toes
Bend ya knees until yo' hips go oh
Make ya get real low, bounce on your toes
Ben your knees until yo' hips go oh
I'm still in the club, so fresh on the clip
On the flo', do my dance like this
Don't get dash and flick
Fuck with us, you really get your ass hit
State playa, betta watch your bitch
Everything we make is a hit
Much love to the DJ, represent
We don't worry 'bout suckas hating on it
We got on lock, you can ask yo' kids
State to state, they know 'bout it
Original with a simple twist
Project nigga with lyrics
Hood to hood thugs beating out shit
Strippers in the club make 'em pay for this
Dope boys Renasay and Chris
D4L, we just hit a lick
Make ya get real low, bounce on your toes
Bend yo' knees until your hips go oh
I make ya get real low, bounce on your toes
Bend ya knees until ya hips go oh
I make ya get real low, bounce on ya toes
Bend ya knees until your hips go oh
Make ya get real low, bounce on your toes
Bend yo' knees until your hips go oh
Make ya get real low, bounce on your toes
Bend yo' knees until your hips go oh
I make ya get real low, bounce on your toes
