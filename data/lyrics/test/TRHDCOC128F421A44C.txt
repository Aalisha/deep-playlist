I hope I never have to use the word "friend" again,
It's the same old slap in the face set in motion,
Ah fuck this place,

Again I've met the end don't tell me what is left
There's nothing but a box of pictures I refuse to open
They may cause resent

You know I really don't miss a thing
You know I really don't miss a thing

It's no struggle to confront now 'cause what's said is said
And what's done is done
A crude emotion set in forward pace
Get this message straight now 'cause I'm sick as shit
...
