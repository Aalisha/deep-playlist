i am tired and confused, i don't know what to do.
i can't stomach this pain any longer, life is at a crossroad.
which way do i go? i can't make a decision for the life of me.
losing my bout with this life, no doubt.
or am i really... just succeeding?
i'm a afraid of getting older,
i feel it getting colder just please don't give me eternity.
follow me on my wasted journey,
i got two ways i can bring you down.
one's for leaving, two's for staying, either way.
