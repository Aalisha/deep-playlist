Everybody looks so spaced out there

Busy blowing to the priests of noise.
Turn it up and make it drown out the warning

Bad news for the girls and boys.
Everybody looks so romantic

Acting like it's nothing at all.
Looking out for number one

Working for the week and living to the beat.

Dance this world away - dance this world away -
Dance this world away - dance this world away.
