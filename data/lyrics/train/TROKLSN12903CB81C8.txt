Every day is a gamble, if you really want to make it through
When you live on the side of the mountain, and the babies all need food
I was the youngest one among us, I got sick and would not eat
Daddy prayed accept his fate, but Mommy would not heed

Carry me across the mountain, before it is too late
Heal my broken my body, death not be my fate
Carry me across the mountain, don't give up on me
I am but a helpless child, whose life depends on thee
