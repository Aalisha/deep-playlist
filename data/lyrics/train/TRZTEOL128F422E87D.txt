Chorus:
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic
It's automatic

Girl I can see right through your false defenses
You act as if you can ignore the sound
My force detectors tell me your pretending
All of your systems are about to go down
No need to panic, I know you feel it
If you can stand it, just dance
I'm your mechanic, I know you feel it
This automatic romance

Chorus

I know the secrets to your circuitry girl
To your diskette I have to access code
Don't try to fight this electricity girl
From all this power you might overload
...
