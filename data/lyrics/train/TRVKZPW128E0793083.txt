Well you keep on talkin' bout it
till you're stone cold blue in the face
but there ain't nothing darling
that true love can't replace
Yah, you're right, right back
tryin' to pretend
yah, you're right back, right back,
doin' the same old thangs again
Well you're money hungry
and your heart is full of greed
tellin' everybody you get everything you need
So you say
You're right, right back
doin' the same old thang again
Yah for me it's the same old movie
