A part of me wants to leave you alone
A part of me wants for you to come home
A part of me says I'm living a lie
(And I'm better off without you)

A part of me says to think it through
A part of me says I'm over you
A part of me wants to say goodbye
A part of me is asking why?

A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And every time I think that we're over and done
You do something to get me back loving you
And you got me just torn

Torn in between the two
(Oh yeah)
'Cause I really wanna be with you
But something's telling me

I should leave you alone
(I really want to be with you)
Leave you alone, leave you alone

And you got me just torn in between the two
(In between the two)
'Cause I really wanna be with you
(Be with you)

But something's telling me
I should leave you alone
(You alone)
Leave you alone, leave you alone

There were no issues when we started out
It was cool, it was everything that love's about
But something happened, plus I feel it's over now
('Cause I can't understand you now)
Now, oh
(I just can't understand you now)

A part of me says it's all my fault
A part of me says he ain't what you want
A part of me says to get my bags
A part of me says I can't do that

A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And every time I think that it's over and done
You make me fall back in love
You got me just torn

Torn in between the two
(between the two)
