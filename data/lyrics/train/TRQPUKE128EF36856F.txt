Just staring off into space again
What am i looking for
Maybe a cigarette might
Calm me down or keep me warm
Maybe a drink might be able
To tell me that i might be able
To do this alone
Theyre probably both wrong

Why should i wait
(I hate this feeling)
For my mistakes
(Theyre tearing me up inside)
