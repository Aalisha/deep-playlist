You just walk in, I make you smile
It's cool but you don't even know me
You take an inch, I run a mile
Can't win, you're always right behind me

And we know that you could go and find some other
Take or leave it or just don't even bother
Caught in a craze, it's just a faze
Or will this be around forever?

Don't you know it's going too fast?
Racing so hard you know it won't last
Don't you know, why can't you see?
Slow it down, read the sign so you know
Just where you are going

Stop right now, thank you very much
I need somebody with the human touch
Hey you, always on the run
Gotta slow it down baby, gotta have some fun
