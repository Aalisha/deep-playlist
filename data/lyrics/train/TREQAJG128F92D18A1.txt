As I lay here next to you
Holding you in my arms, baby
I get a thought here in my mind
It says, "Take your time"
I don't wanna move too fast, I don't wanna move too fast
So if I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
If I'm gonna be yours and you're gonna be mine
We gotta take our time and do it
Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Easy, easy, got to take it easy
Ooh, this feelin' is cool
But I can't get too excited, no
