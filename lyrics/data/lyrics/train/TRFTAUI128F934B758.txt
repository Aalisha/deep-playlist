Good bye scissor fuck
Idol paper doll
Stenciled into shape
Loneliness escape
Lies tab fold dress
Decorate your mess
with sparkling fools gold

Heart pit-patter skips
Paper cut my lips to kiss salt

Fuck me, my fake

Your soul spins on axis self centered like a whoring tornado
Your soul spins on axis self centered like a whoring tornado
Tornado
