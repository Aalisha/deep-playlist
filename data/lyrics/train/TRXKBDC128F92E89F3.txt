Oh yeah!...you know what?
I'm envisioning,
Pretty women, Rims spinning
All my homies dressed
In expensive Linnen

It ain't a dream
That's the life we're livin
Mov'in up to a new position

People used to look
And be like, I ain't
never gonna be shit
That's until I gotta
6 Hundred, v dozen full y equipped whip
And I never stop stacking chips
Fool, got bling in the chain
Got bling on the wrist
And this type of life is priceless
Cause ain't nothing
on earth like this
What you know

Bridge

When it's hot it gets crazy,
we pop Krystal on a daily
Just me and my ladies, we
know how to make you move
your feet to the beat
Can you feel the heat tell
me sisters do you feel me
brothers roll with me

Chorus
