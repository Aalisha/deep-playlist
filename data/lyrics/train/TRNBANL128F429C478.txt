The gods and the saints preserve you,
Cos nobody here deserves you,
I'm living my life in flashback,
Since I lost my card or cashback,
And I've gone to wrack and ruin,
Since I don't know what you're doing,
There's no clear or present danger
That I see in any stranger.

Someone, somewhere said to me,
Will someone somewhere set me free,
Wont hurry up or harry me,
...
