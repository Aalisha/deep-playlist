My idiot mind melts in a dizzying swirl
The sickening symptom of a dying world
Where human greed grows from national pride
No hope for the future, no choice to decide
The wealthy bribing pawns for their patriot games and
Religion serves this purpose much in the same way
That we fight over trivial shit and
A hatred is born with people dying from it

Don't think, just take a look and see
our genocidal tendencies
will get you in the end
you'll be killing your best friend
you think that you're immune
but you will change your tune
it's buried deep inside
your thirst for genocide

It's "us" against "them" or it's "them" against "us"
...
