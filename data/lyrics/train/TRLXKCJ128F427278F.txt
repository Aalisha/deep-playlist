Well, I never felt more like singin' the blues
'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose
Your love dear, why'd you do me this way?

Well, I never felt more like crying all night
'Cause everything's wrong and nothing ain't right
Without you, you got me singing the blues

The moon and stars no longer shine
The dream is gone I thought was mine
There's nothing left for me to do
