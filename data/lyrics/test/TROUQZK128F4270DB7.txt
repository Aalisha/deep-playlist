Livin' without you never could be so wrong
Don't need to say it, I never waited so long
Thinking about you in everthing I do
Love is for giving
You know I'm just livin' for you
And I, I never needed to lie
Can't you see I believe in my heart when I'm saying
It's love that you see
You're just the one for me
I'm praying

Maybe I'm dreaming, don't want to wake up now
