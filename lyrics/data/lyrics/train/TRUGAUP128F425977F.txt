Spring in the air (filled with love)
There's magic ev'rywhere
When you're young and in love

Life seems to be (just a dream)
A world of fantasy
When you're young and in love

Each night seems just like the Fourth of July
When stars spangle the sky

The moon at night (shines so bright)
Seems to shine twice as bright
