"Captain's Log - supplemental. Their entire race was counting on them to wipe out
the menace that had held their culture locked in a standstill for centuries.
And now they had the help of a starship..." {Phasers armed and ready general?}
(Armed and ready sir)

[Kool Keith:]
Universe... galaxy... the world, the circumfrence
{The counterattack will begin... NOW~!}
Deltron Major Nelson, cling-on like falcon
Norelco Gillette
Step to bat like a Met, Mike Piazza
I'm poppin a lot of blase-blasah
My students come to me and say yes so I am the king of big words
Scientific father, transportin Delco batteries
Accessories, ingredients for minerals and oil
I collect the coil
Turn worth, 50 G's
My chest can burn off a hundred degrees
Flammable mass, when overcast
All nucleus is us
