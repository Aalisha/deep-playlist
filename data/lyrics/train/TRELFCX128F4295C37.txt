The word went round in no dream town
They shut us up and the shutters down
The planes flew in and laid the ground
We built upon and spun around
God's one miracle, lost in circles

On the march
Berlin to Bombers Bay
Traveling dark
On the roads to Mandalay

Cannon fire came to call
Stood us up and watched us fall
The way we were and now outworn
Our costumes changed to uniforms
Black, black days, here to stay
