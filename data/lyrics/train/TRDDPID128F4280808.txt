(Russell Lee)

Ooooooh-oooh, keep living your life
And everything will be alright

(Dougie D)

I ain't even fin to be the one to sell it to ya
I'ma tell it the way it is, the way it's gon be and the way that I'ma give it to ya
Time rolls by, friends turn into foes and some jump fly
While you been looking for love, in the wrong damn spots
If I said it then I meant it, if I did it then I did it now fuck it bring on defeating
I'm trying to live my life, peeping reality smoking ooh la la
Knowing that everything's gonna be alright, thugging all through the night
And the other way I can, having my whole mind dying
Best believe that I'ma mash for it, cause that's what I do
And I'ma continue to do it, until my time expires for it

(Hook: Russell Lee)

Keep living your life
And everything will be alright
Thugging through the night
We watching time roll on bye

(Tony Montana)
