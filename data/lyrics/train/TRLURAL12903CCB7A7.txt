Yo kid. I'm from your block yo. I took yodr chain. I took your moms out twice. I put the g in the game its been like Tangiers. I put the grease in the gears left your dad in tears. When i boxed his ears i'm reppin avenue c. Where the wack catch a slap i keep my cretin's crackin and the meatpackers mackin puttin things in relief so baby sit in the seat never touch the levels. Just bump the beat
