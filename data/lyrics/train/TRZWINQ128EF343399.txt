A thousand years, a thousand more
A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs, to a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a milllion breaths
A million names but only one truth to face
(I still love you)

A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs
...
