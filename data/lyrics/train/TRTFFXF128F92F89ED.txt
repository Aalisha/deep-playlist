Brothers, I can take it
If I know I'll see my brother
And just step back when I'm dancing with
My brother is dancing with me

Brothers, I would give my life
For my brothers
When we're driving and it's late
With my brother sat next to me

It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have
It's a wild love I have
It's a wild love that I have
For my brothers, for my brother

Brothers, I can play X box
With my brother
It's not about who won or lost
...
