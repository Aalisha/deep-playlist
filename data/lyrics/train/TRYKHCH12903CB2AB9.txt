[Madrox:]
Sweet silence will bestow upon me soon
Alone, I sit, readiness in my bedroom
Candles flicker as the wind blows steady
With shaky hands my heart weighs heavy

Run it over in my mind and tell myself that
I'm ready to unbreak the situation from calm to deadly
Grab the blade and put it to my neck
Start to push it in, nope, not ready yet

Need another second to deliberate another way to go
Something way more artistic and a lot more painful
Sleeping pills, no that's wack
They can pump your stomach and you'll come right back

Have you sitting in a group with other suicidalists
Reminiscing every minute and brush with death's kiss
Not for me, I'ma never go back
You will see a blast of light as I fade to black

Now that you know that it's time to go (die)
Whatcha gonna write in your death note (suicide)
If you tell me how the story unfolds (die)
Tell me what's to cause your let go (and they say)

You never learned nothing
I never learned a thing
You never learned nothing
I never learned a thing
