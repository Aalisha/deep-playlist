You must try to believe
That I will be coming through
I have burnt every bridge that I've crossed
There's no bridge from here to you

So I row to your isle
All that distance reconciled
Should my arms, shoulders fail
Put my trust in wind and sail

I need you to believe
That I will be coming through
I have carried my cross at each step
Apon my neck for you
