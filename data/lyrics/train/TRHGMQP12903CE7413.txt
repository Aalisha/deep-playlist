OOOOH... 
Where Am I?
Ohhhhh... 
Where Am I?
Is this the land of no return?
So very far from my home
Won't Someone show I the way?
Out of this modern hope
Sometimes I slight an evenning cry
While notice in the hard ships around me
The pressure of time's quite a few
In this strange land of disunity
Ohhhh... 
Where Am I?
...
