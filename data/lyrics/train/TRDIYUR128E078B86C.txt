Stuck in the 90's (Clem)

(Jian w/ Dave on certain harmonies)
Clem had a daydream, daydream from heaven
Picked up the headline, his country was made up of singers
And no more right-wingers

He wakes up to "Homeless are stupid, welfare is stupid
Private investment efficiency, cool fiscal plannin'"
Sounds like more Pat Buchanan

Back in his day job this afternoon
Unlikely he'll move down to Cuba soon

Reluctant to find he's stuck in the 90's again

Clem reads of the old days, twenty years goes a long ways
"Challenge the system!" Relating is easy on a demo...
(Mike)
Did I meet you on that demo?
(Jian)
Now they'll send it by memo
(Mike)
Fax me a memo
