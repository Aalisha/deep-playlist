Deep Purple -:- Perfect strangers

Can you remember? Remember my name?
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Oh... And cold. Cold spirits of ice
Ah., Ah., All my life
I am the echo of your past...

I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known...
...
