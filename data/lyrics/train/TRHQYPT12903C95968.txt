It feels like a dream
How did things all get so crazy?
I'm remembering
Before, when I felt so clean

Alone in my room
It feels like the walls are closing in
I'm thinking of you
'Cause I know what'll happen soon

I'm spinning out of control
Not knowing which way to go
Feelin' out in the cold
I just wanna let go of it all
And climb up over the wall
I need some help
To get back on my feet
If you're out there, comfort me!

You thought you could come and take
It all without hurting me
That was your biggest mistake
Should have known
When you saw me break!
