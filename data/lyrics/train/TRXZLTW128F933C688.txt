He's the one, the one that you love and he's a friend of mine
And the two of you are happy together as long as the sun shines
But I'm always here to lend you a shoulder when it rains again

'Cause I'm not the kind you want for your boyfriend
But I'll be your man's best friend

Well, I guess it's no secret to any of us, how I feel about you
