My baby likes this music good and loud
With words coming straight from the heart
Man, woman or child can tell this story
Just as long as it's a soulful start
All the better to make you glad
That your life has taken a different path
At the same time wondering
How you can get on a train
To this town

My baby don't like rock and roll
Not hip hop or pop
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
My baby's just into the blues
