I woke up and you made me see
You and I we can never be
All the things that we wanted to
So I set you free

Here we are, point of no return
Never thought it would crash and burn
Started out with the best of intentions
I never learn

What is it that I never find
I just want a little piece of mind
Am I back on the endless road to nowhere

Why is it that I never find
All the things that I left behind
Am I back on the endless road to nowhere

Why did you leave me standing there
in the rain
You said we would last forever
Was everything I said to you all in vain?
I just tried to make you see

Why did you leave me standing there
in the rain
