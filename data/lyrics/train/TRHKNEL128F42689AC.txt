How come you're blaming me about
The things that I have never done
It's such a shame
Well, it's your weekness that you hide
So, don't tell me how to live my life
'Cause you're so lame

You may steal my wings tonight
But I'll pay you back for your surprise
(you know where you all belong)
You may feed my rage to fight
And I'll tear you down with my device
...
