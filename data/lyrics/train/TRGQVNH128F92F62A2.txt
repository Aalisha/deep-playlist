Every week's the same
Stuck in school's so lame
My parents say that I'm lazy
Gettin' up at 8am it's crazy
Tired of being told what to do
So unfair, so uncool
The day's too long

And I'm holding on
Til I hear the bell ring
'Cause that's the time when we're gonna breakout
Let the party start

We're gonna stay out
Gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance
Til the dance floor falls apart
Uh, oh, all over again
We're gonna wake up

Everyone we know
We're gonna have some fun
Gonna lose control
It feels so good
To let go, oh, oh

Hanging out's just something we like to do
