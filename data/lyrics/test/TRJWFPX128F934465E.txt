I hear you calling, calling me on your telephone, yeah!
Saying you don't want to sleep alone...
'Cause you're so scared in the middle of the night...
all night...
I hear you dreaming, dreaming that I will be leaving,
but that ain't what I believe in
It's just a distant, that's growing near, in near
It's just the magic in your eyes...
. Keeps me awake all night...
I've been sailing down the tears for so many years
ain't that enough to prove that I care...
You know I need you, and I'm aware of that you need me too...
...
