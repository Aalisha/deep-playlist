Talk tougher than james cagney
Act smarter than charlie chan
Love longer than valentino
Or you never will be a man

I saw him down at the drive-in saturday
A forty five to blow away anyone who happens to disagree
With such panache and style, he wins the game
When all the while, i'm sitting here thinking that it could be me

Suddenly, in walks a criminologist
With too much knowledge to resist and plenty of answers
For the good at heart
No fear, no pain, no sweat, the teardrop on the serviette,
Oh i could be a hero if i was that smart
...
