Me and my heart
Lying so still in the dark
Oh I could reach out and touch you
Feel the warmth of your skin
But it's enough just to know where you are

So what do I do
Knowing a dream can come true
Oh now I'm holding my breath
Don't want to open my eyes
Don't want to wake up again without you

So I whisper a prayer tonight
Whisper you name
And hope that you hear me
