Angel, paint my world in gold
Justify the world behold
Stand by me and make me smile
Make us wonder for a while
Angel, paint my world in green
Open up a world unseen
Lay me down on wonder weeds
So love is all we really need?

The world is falling apart,
But I'm still falling in love
Sisters, they've have fallen from grace,
Now shaken, confused and dazed
