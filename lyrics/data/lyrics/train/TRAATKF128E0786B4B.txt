Late night
Party time
All around me
The room is jumping
This feeling I can't contain it
Got me reeling
Our bodies pumping
Your eyes move
Like on my body
And the headlights
The heat is rising

Nothing that I can do
Can't stop me from wanting you
I'm losing my self control

If I lose my mind
Touching you tonight
I can't help myself
Gotta satisfy my desire
