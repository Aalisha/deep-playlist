Gotta be careful how you play this game
one false move could leave your heart in pain
I'm no stranger to this fate you know it's true
and baby I really wanna be with you
Falling in love can be dangerous make you anxious playing love roulette
falling in love can be dangerous make you crazy playing love roulette
When love starts rolling it can thrill you to the bone
