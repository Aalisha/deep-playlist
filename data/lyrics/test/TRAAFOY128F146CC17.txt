Astair your glare is killing me
Astair in skies of blue
The signs you wear are making me
So confused

But the mountains and the trees
Are they just what you need
Or are they less than what
You'd expect to see

And if you're leaving well come
Give me reason why I let you down
Before you turn around now now
