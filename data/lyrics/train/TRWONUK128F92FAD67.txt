The touch, the rush, oh
The touch, the rush, oh
The touch, the rush, oh

You turn around and make we wanna make you think I'm in to you
An easy catch, the perfect guy with perfect lines, it's nothing new
I guess I'll let you have a little taste 'cause I have nothing here to lose
And if nothing's better than this then I guess that's better than nothing
What'cha think I'll do?

The more you play hard to get
The more I think I could get in to you
The way you dance and walk away
I can't believe you're getting me confused

You make me feel so
You make, you make, you make
You make me feel so
Let's go, you know, take it slow, uh, uh
