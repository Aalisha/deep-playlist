The ragged clothes you wore
Made you look like a hobo, ten to four
The neighbors pound the floor
We're cracking up until we couldn't take no more

From you, the wine, the heater glow
Warming up under icy Midwest skies
And I would have left here long ago
But knowing you means there's always some surprise

We're done with keeping score
