A train crashed
And everything slows down
I was wishing I could get out of this town
These dreams we've had
Have never made you cry
And I am not a twinkle in your eye
But I've got to get out of here
Cuz you drive me up the wall
I've got to get out of here
Cuz I can't stand to fall

And If I die
see you won't be so close to me
And I won't be the one
Who sticks around
If I'm awake
see you won't go to sleep, I promise
And I won't be the one
Who lets you down

Tailgates, long talks
And your superficial friends
...
