We'll be together in the springtime...

She goes away today
He gives her a photo to help her remember
History of Art BA
It's alright cos she's back in late November

But he knows not of who she's mixing
By christmas she's lying no calling she tricks him

So he goes up to stay
He don't like her friends, and he hadn't heard of Nietzsche
She's seems so far away
And the distance is further each time he meets her

Who's the bloke on the wall next to Ringo and Paul?
It's Che she says have you seen him before?
