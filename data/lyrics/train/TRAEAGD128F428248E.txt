Whatever you put in my hands
Is my life savings, is my main man
I got a box fit for a king on Queens Street
Tell me that's not irony

Money can't buy happiness
Man, I think the opposite
If I had just one chance
I'd buy romance

I wanna know the things you're thinking
I wanna be the place you are
Under the city lights, I'm sinking
Is anybody out there, anybody out there?

All alone in the strange city
Every other face is a blank to me
But I'm gone, gone, gone
...
