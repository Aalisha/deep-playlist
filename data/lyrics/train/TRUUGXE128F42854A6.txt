My life is likened to a bargain store
And I may have just what you're looking for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
With a little mending it could be as good as new

Why you take for instance this old broken heart
If you will just replace the missing part
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did
