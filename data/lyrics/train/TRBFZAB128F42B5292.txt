The simple cost of loving you is a better picture
There is not a sound coming from my voice
You want to listen to the kids - banging on
They're halos soon to be divorced
And you're a poor young factory boy blowing on your trumpet
With a home on the back of your horse

Oh! this is a separation
I can't believe this is the end
I don't want to talk about it
Go tell it to your friend...
