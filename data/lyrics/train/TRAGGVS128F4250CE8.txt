Surface of permanent street forms
Lost moments get impaled my presence fades away
Oblivious surface obscures my eyes
Strong with the desire of hate
As reality and vision united
Communion enlarge my darkness
With multitude of light
The still uncolored circle of seven senses
The visionary wheel of drifting desired shadows

Affections of remained rites
