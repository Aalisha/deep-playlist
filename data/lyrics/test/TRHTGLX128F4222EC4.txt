General, general, general penitentiary, general penitentiary
General, general, general penitentiary, general penitentiary

Down in the dump cell, where I can't take no smell
It's like a oven baking for 2 thousand years
When the morning comes, I & I would run to get some tea
Here comes the boss with his baton
Say dreadlocks you don't come here
To drink pea soup and fatten ooh oh
