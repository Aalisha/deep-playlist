HEY YOU... get of my mountain
HEY YOU... get of my cloud
HEY YOU... get off my mountain

Your just trying too
Bring me down

And you laugh in my face
Make me feel like a clown
Baby I think I better put you in your place
That kind of action I don't need (that kind of action)
That kind of heartache I can't use (that kind of heartache)
And that kind of lovin I can do without
