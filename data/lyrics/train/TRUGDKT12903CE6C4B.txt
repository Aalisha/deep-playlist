Just wake up

Stop living like there is no hope
We know what you're going through, we've been there before
I never thought that I would see you like this all alone covering up yourself

You think that there is no one left
Who can get you out of your mess
But I will be right here until the bitter end

Step back and take a look around
You are the only one that can change where you're at
Just make the best of every moment or you will get left behind
