From beyond this bed of mine I see,
Ceiling fans with you on top of me,
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun,
And all your secret fantasies thy will be done (done),
And inside of your walls there will dwell a capricorn,
That will feast your body all night,
And if keep this up then our love child will be born,
All because of the greatest,

The greatest you, the greatest me,
We have found, the greatest chemistry,
The greatest touch, the greatest kiss,
...
