Star people
Counting your money until your soul turns green
Star people
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen

I do not count myself among you
I may have been living in a dream
It's just there seem so many of you
Can't help but hope there's a difference between

And if I live to be a hundred and one
I will never understand what you are, honey?

I'm looking for sympathy
Just get me on NBC
And where's the hell's my dumb ass PR?

I said maybe your mama gave you up boy
(it's the same old same old)
I said maybe your daddy didn't love you enough girl
(how much is enough)

Star people
Never forget your secret's safe with me
Just look at all the wonderful people
Trying to forget just who and what they have been
