Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady

Cruisin' to a bar on the shore
Her picture graced a grime on the door
She a long lost love at first sight
Baby, maybe you're wrong but you know it's all right that's right

Back stage we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody says
'Forgive me if I seem out of line'
Then she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away

Dude looks like a lady
Dude looks like a lady
