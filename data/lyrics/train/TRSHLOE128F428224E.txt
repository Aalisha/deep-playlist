I stand in this place and lift
Up my eyes to see
The glory of Your face

My God, how wonderful You are
How beautiful Your name
It calms the raging seas

With open arms I run into Your courts
I'll dance before You King of all the earth

I stand in this place and lift
Up my eyes to see
The glory of Your face

My God, how wonderful You are
