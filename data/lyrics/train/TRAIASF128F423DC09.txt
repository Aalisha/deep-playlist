Like a prima ballerina
I tiptoe, tiptoe around you constantly
I hear the water running
Will it wash your tears or leak through the ceiling?

Make my way up a spiral staircase
Hope to God you had a good day

When you're furious
When you start to freeze
When you can't be touched
I feel everything

And when you despair
When you cannot breathe
When you wouldn't dare
I feel everything

When you're in ecstasy
But you're not with me
I feel everything

On a tightrope, on a wire
...
