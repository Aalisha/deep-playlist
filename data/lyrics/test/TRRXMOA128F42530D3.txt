(Johnny Gioeli, Joey Gioeli, Neal Schon)
Mama said you was a bad girl since I set my eyes on you
And who would think that I would sink in something that you would do
Baby, baby you had a way to cover up your lies
Put me down for the crown, but I never saw it in your eyes
And now my love is cold, it's my heart you sold
And every night you're haunted 'til you gotta let go
Takin' me down, girl you're takin' me, takin' me
Takin' me down, girl, way down
Takin' me down, girl you're takin' me, takin' me
Girl you're takin' me
