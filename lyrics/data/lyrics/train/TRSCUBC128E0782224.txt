So you think,
of what it could've been.
when time was all you lost,
it keeps burning through your head.
now you fall asleep standin'
lie up in your bed.
watch the clock drag on,
and think of what you should've said.
(woah)
it's for the better,
your better halfs gone.
it's ok, you didn't need her anyway.
and i don't wanna hear ya say
nobody could take her place.
