Are you waiting for me?
At the end of the airport
I'm off buying our tickets
Auteur in hibernation
But I'm feeling impatient
We were late for departure

And the smell of pajamas
Is what makes me feel frivol
There are minutes for sleeping
But we didn't have minutes to spare

So you're feeling sleepy
Sympathize with the retard
Being held by his mother
She's got spit in her napkin
And she's pushing him that way
