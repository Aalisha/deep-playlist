To make a mountain of your life
Is just a choice
But I never learned enough
To listen to the voice that told me
Always love
Hate will get you every time
Always love
Don't wait til the finish line

Slow demands come 'round
Squeeze the air and keep the rest out
It helps to write it down
Even when you then cross it out

But Always Love
Hate will get you every time
Always Love
Even when you wanna fight
