I love it when you just don't care
I love it when you dance like there's nobody there
so when it gets hard don't be afraid
we don't care what them people say

I love it when you don't take no
I love it when you do what you want cause you just said so
let them all go home we out late
we don't care what them people say

we don't have to be ordainary
make your best mistakes
cause we don't have the time to be sorry
so baby be the life of the party

I'm telling you to take your shot
it might be scary
hearts are gunna break
cause we don't have the time to be sorry
