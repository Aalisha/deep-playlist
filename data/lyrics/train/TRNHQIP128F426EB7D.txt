I've had girls and I've had women
But I've never had a lady before
I been high and I been flyin'
But I've never been this crazy before

Saying sweet things that I really wanna hear
And it's coming as no surprise
Whatever we got is oh, so hard to find
I realize too that a something like you
Doesn't come along everyday
And I'm turning over part of my mind to you, now

I been loved, been befriended
But I never really bled before
I've seen brains and I've seen brilliance
But I never got 'em through my head before

Could've been a week or it could've been an hour
...
