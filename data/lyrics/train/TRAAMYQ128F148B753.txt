Johnny loves me
He just told me so last night (Johnny loves her)
Now each star I see belongs to me
And they're all shining twice as bright (Johnny loves her)

Johnny loves me
Johnny's heart is really mine (Johnny loves her)
Love is everywhere and I could swear
The world's a great big valentine

I feel so pretty, I'm all aglow
