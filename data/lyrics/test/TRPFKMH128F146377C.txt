Intense

Put your socks on and pull 'em up
We got a long ride and a velvet chair to sit on
E-mail junkies press your buttons now
The rocket fuel will last us till we push the boat out

And everybody wants to know
Is what we're given what we get
I guess the answer is we don't know yet

Intense
 (I know you're feelin' it)
 (But what's it comin' to when we wanna)
(Get a rocket ship outta here?)

Intense
 (I know you're feelin' it)
 (But what's it comin' to when we wanna)
(Get a rocket ship outta here?)

I just got to tell you
Yell it to ya girls and boys
We're gettin' hotter
You feel it too? Gotcha

Intense

Put your smile on and keep it sweet
You got your ammunition on your back but you can't use it
Are you a good soul or a bad egg?
