[Verse 1]
We have to go on, have to find a way
It's not the first time, you should know
We've been through hard times and worries before
But in the end we always find a way to go
I don't follow, I don't understand
You use to be so strong and sure but suddenly...

[Bridge 1]
Heaven comes falling down on you
Dark clouds surrounding us
The light seems so far away
But still I believe it's not too late

[Chorus]
So don't lose the spirit
Without it we're standing small
So keep up the spirit
This is our time in life to take all the chances
before we throw it all away...
