[Featuring: Good Brotha, Kali, Reks & Termanology]

[Intro - Good Brotha - talking]
Fakin hate yes men
Yes, yo, yeah
I hate fake love
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1 - Reks]
Yes, I confess, I seen a lot of love
But I seen a lot of fake I, seen a lot of frauds
Seen a lot of "I want" plus a lot of "can I have?"
Can you please tell me why these rappers is gassed?
Your whole team and you front like you got his back
But frontin is a hab', I mean stuntin (is a habit)
You would say he nice when he really ain't have it
He was just alright but you would say he smashed it
You would do his ad libs
All in the picture, get ya palms in the mixture, callin all his shit classic
You a broad, you a bastard
You a faggot for lettin him pursue a career of rap shit
I hate the average, MySpace friend request
Because the average MySpace friend request
Is ass rappers or producers who ass backwards
Think I'm a pay for whackness? (please)
