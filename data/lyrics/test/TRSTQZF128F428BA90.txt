I've been dreaming under unfamiliar skies
and talking to strangers lossed in nights passed in disguise
why am i so long?
why can't i say it all in song
we come up empty face to face
words i wish i could erase

I've been hiding under unfamiliar skies
and talking to strangers lossed in nights passed in disguise
take this heart and put it with my bones (woahhh)
and put them in a box
...
