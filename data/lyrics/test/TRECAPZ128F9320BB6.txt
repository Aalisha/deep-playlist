We have gathered here tonight to spend some time
With our demons, those evil beings in your minds
We have found The Cure for all our troubles
So free your mind and let it go

Take a step to the other side of divinity
Get closer to feel the infinity
Let the poison fill you with it's equity
Soon all will change to what it should always be

Twisted faces all within me
Constant laughter that no one hears
Secret places waiting for me
...
