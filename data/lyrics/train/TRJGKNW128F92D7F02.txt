Get me off your small town mattress
And find a rut that's rough with catches
It was easier defined as legend
To find a what that's less imagined

Your lies and laws and doors with latches
They hide the flaws of all the masses
We said, that film was poorly acted
You tasted good but I'm still distracted

By your face, it's light to a lens
You could hang me by a thread
Yeah, you should wake
Up all your friends

'Cause they're all lazybones
And no, you're never gonna get me home
We're always alone
And we'll always be here

Lazybones
And no, you're never gonna get me home
Come on, change your tone
...
