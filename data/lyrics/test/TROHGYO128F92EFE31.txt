To my surprise one hundred stories high
People getting loose now, getting down on the roof
I tell ya, the folks were screaming
They was, they was out of control
Oh, it was so entertaining
When the boogie starts to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) Burn the mother down
(Burn baby burn) Disco Inferno
(Burn baby burn) Burn the mother down

Satisfaction, you came in a chain reaction
Yeah, I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct
I tell ya, the heat was on, it was rising to the top
Well now, now everybody is going strong
