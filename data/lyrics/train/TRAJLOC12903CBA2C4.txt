I'm in the mood for lovin'
We'll be touchin, We'll be huggin
I'm in the mood for lovin'
We'll get into..

It's in the morning I wanna touch
It's in the morning I wanna love you
It's in the morning no interruptions
It's in the morning, Sex in the morning
It's in the morning I wanna touch
It's in the morning I wanna love you
It's in the morning no interruptions
Sex in the morning, Sex in the morning

You know I love it first thing
Cuz you just let it marinate, let it marinate
I'll wait for you to open your eyes
Look at me and smile
You know what I want do
You slowly pull down the sheets to reveal what you keeping wide
I can't push sleeping anymore and you got the hottest body
I got the hottest hottie
Let me put some cream in your coffee
