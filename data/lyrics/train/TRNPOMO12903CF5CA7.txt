I can't wash the taste of stone away
Red in tooth and claw
We live the same way
Mementos kept this real
Kept home for me somehow
Forgotten years and cares
Memories reflect, repent, relive
Relinquish all we know,
those same mistakes again

Disengage ascent
Transmissions were lost when satellites collide

Europa is waiting with her iron core tonight
...
