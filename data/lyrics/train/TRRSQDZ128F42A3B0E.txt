Red lipstick on my blue collar.
An' her number in Maybelline black eye liner.
Written on a napkin in my back pocket.
She found it right there right before she washed it.
Well, I started back-steppin', stumblin', stutterin',
Tellin' her where I'd been an' how she was just a friend.
She said: "You know I know that ain't the truth,
"But if that's the story you're stickin' to."

Well, you can stick it where the sun don't shine,
Gonna take her advice an' hitch me a ride.
We'll drive back to that waterin' hole,
Where the cold beer flows an' the Cuervo's gold...
Suck a little salt 'n lime, (Suck a little salt 'n lime.)
Under that neon light.
Gonna take my sorry behind,
An stick it where the sun don't shine.
Have me a good time.

Got a call from Woodrow.
"Hey, bro, you're wardrobe's throwed all over the lawn."
"There's a lot of black smoke comin' from your bass boat,
"An' your ol' lady's cussin' an' a-carryin' on."
So I told Woodrow: "Put her on the cell 'phone."
He said: "I can't bro, she's got me in a choke hold.
"Doin' that tie, bro, I think she broke my elbow."
"Hello? Woodrow? Hello?
"Oh, is that you, baby? Do what?"
