"Don't ever grow up kid", That's what my grandpa told me, right before they checked him in and cataloged his clothing. cause when you are a little child then crazy is creative.

Then you reach a certain age and the world will deem you dangerous, but I would never hurt a fly unless it sold my secrets to a spider on the wall, whose eight eyes are contagious.

I wanna tell you all these things before I see the doctor, cause I don't know what I'll remember one they start to shock me

Yes the world will be cold, yes, the world will be cruel

Sometimes the only thing that you or I could do is:
Laugh about it
Cry about it
Dance around it
Like another fool

Cause we're all fools

I guess it started back right at my daddy's funeral
