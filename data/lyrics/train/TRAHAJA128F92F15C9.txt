I don't like waiting for a knock on the door
I don't like wondering why
I got no mercy for a man and his tears
He's just living a lie
I got a feeling like I'm losing my cool
That's no way to be
You got me crying, got me playing the fool
That's what you're doing to me

Ohhh, you gotta come back baby
I don't want to say how long it's been
Five days and I gotta know now
Come back baby
