Imagine if we never lied
Imagine if we never tried
To be something we're not
We forgot how it feels
To be tight
To be close
To be real

And I miss you
And I wish you were here
I stopped breathing
When you said you don't care anymore

You're caught up in your plastic life
Changing right before my eyes
A chameleon
I used to know you like the back of my mind
Did that part of you die
...
