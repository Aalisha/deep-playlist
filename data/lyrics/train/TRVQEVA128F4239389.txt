Hey, hey I could run away.
Run away from everything I know.
I know I shouldn't feel this way.
Because really, I gotta get away from me.

Is there any hope for a boy like me?
Is there any, any hope for me?

There's gotta be.

And yeah, well I can hear you say,
"Anything is possible."
But my life is such a mess.
And we've already been through this.
And though we've been here before.
Anything is possible.
So many years all alone in the dark.
Well it's time to get out.
It's time to get out.
