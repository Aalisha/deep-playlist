The world seems out of touch now
I don't get out so much
I don't feel the same
In these bones anymore
My heels are all worn down
My loyalties are torn
I'm finding different paths now
I never saw before
And it hurts less every day
The paths lead me away
Lead me away from those
Blood Thirsty Bastards
Making plans for no one
But themselves
In this world of disaster
I just need someone
For myself
All the sycophants and vampires
Well I packed them off to hell
...
