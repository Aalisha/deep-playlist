Gordon

I wanna take some dirty pictures of you
I wanna take some dirty pictures of you
As I’m peering through the shutter
I can feel my heart a-flutter
The lens is getting steamy
As the reel is getting seamy
Watch out for my reflex
As I’m giving you the bird

Chorus
Dirty pictures turn me on
They give me strictures
