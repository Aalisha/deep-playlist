Everything seems ok
He's playing the perfect game
Everything's black and white
Leave him for a while

The silence is beautiful
At the centre of his own world
No one is welcome in
The place is alone

When you feel the light surround you
Don't push the chance away

Close your eyes and say you'll come with me
Realise that maybe you're not alone in this
You won't know until you
Hold on tight and begin to see
Realise this world won't wait for you and me
...
