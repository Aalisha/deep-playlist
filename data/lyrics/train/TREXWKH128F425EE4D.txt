As you travel down the trail
of life there'll be dangers
you'll encounter
Many rivers you will have
to cross in a lost territory

There'll be mountains high
and valleys low
But wherever you go
I wanna ride shotgun
be by your side

Down the road of life,
come rain or shine
I wanna be someone
who's always there by you

To protect your heart
with a love that's true
Until the journey's done,
I wanna ride shotgun

There'll be deserts
...
