All this talk of blood and iron
Is the cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
Is the cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
Is the cause of all my shaking

All this talk about blood and iron
It's the cause of all my shaking
The fatherland's no place to die for
It makes me want to run out shaking

I hear some talk of guns and butter
That's something we can do without
