Body like a, baby
You ridin' like a vet trucker, hold up, what you say?
I'll be pleasin' you, you'll be pleasin' me
Promise me you'll stay here and never leave me

But hold up, let me say some, pretty mamma thing
Why am I gonna tell you somethin' that I don't mean?
'Cause we in the heat of the moment, givin' you the biz
Before I came to the house, I told you don't be catchin' feelings

I can tell you ain't never had
A *** this young put it on you
Askin' why I won't stay the night and hold you
I can tell you ain't never had, really had it, had it

I can tell you ain't never had
A young *** take the cat from you
Then say I can't stay, got something else to tend to
I can tell you ain't never had, really had it, had it
...
