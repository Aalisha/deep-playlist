(Verse)
Most Holy Lord, you have my attention.
You know my thoughts and all my intentions.
I want to honor you in every way

(Chorus)
And I pour my love on you.
My whole life belongs to you.
I worship you completely unashamed.
I give you my heart unrestrained.

(Verse 2/ With Choir)
Almighty God, you have my devotion.
With all my mind and all my emotion,
I want to know you more, got to know you more
everyway.
