The hands are reaching for the three and the twelve
But the limbs in the light aren't fading
Tangled figures dream they stay just to spite
The secret life she's parading

Silent sin can speak can sing you the ways
A cabaret where secondhand hearts can play
The classic dance between the fringe and the fray
Where the hips can play
(She's gonna get it, she's gonna get it)

Romance in a slow dance
At the scene of the scar laces lovers and hearts
Silhouettes, (she's gonna get it)
Take a chance (she's gonna get it)
Make the heat in the sheets like no one can
