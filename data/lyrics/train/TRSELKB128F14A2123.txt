My empathy, my empathies still makes me feel alive
The suffering, the suffering is always on my mind
My empathy, my empathies still makes me feel alive
So who’s the leader, I’m the leader falling far behind

I take it easy, take it easy wasting all my time
'Cause I’m so lazy, I’m so lazy after all this time
I took it easy, took it easy wasting all my time

So who’s the leader, I’m the leader falling deeper and deeper
So tell me the reason for living, forgiving, perfecting my freedom
The pieces we’re keeping the start out at the end
It’s deeper and deeper and deeper

Please don’t stop, keep pretending,
Don’t look back the world keeps changing
