Sometimes when you're lying beside me
In your eyes I see
I don't know, but it's something it's something
And it's tripping me up again
It's like you're here, but you're not here
I need to know where
But you won't let me go there
Always telling me it's nothing, it's nothing

Well I had a vision
Of a lover in my best friend
It's not like me to question

Something always gets in between
It twists and it turns
You know that it seems to me, lately
I'm so unsure
I can't put my finger on it, on it
Strange feeling ripping at the seams
And I've never heard
The sound of my heart breaking
Like this before
Before there was always something
Something, yeah
