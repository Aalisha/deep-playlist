(She's tall)
Like the Eiffel tower
(Fast)
New York to Paris in half an hour
(She's lean)
She's a love machine
Probably take on the whole football team

(Strong)
As the day is long
Think you got her figured out
You find out you were wrong
(She's long)
As a limousine
Take your body places
That you've never, never seen

Hi ho away we go
Let's build a fire from coast to coast

Baby's on top, she's on a roll
Gonna burn me down to my soul
I'm as high as a circus wire
Getting hot like a bonfire
Like a bonfire
Like a bonfire, yea ooh
