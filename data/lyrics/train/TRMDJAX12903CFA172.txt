Winged Disciples Of The Nocturn Dream 
Descend Upon The Fortress Of The Tyrants Creed 
In Their Search For Midas, How Many More Must Bleed? 
Father Supernature - Grant The Final Deed, Please Yeah

In Tombstone Rulers Burning Land 
Love Shall Send Them To The Gallows 
Retribution Is At Hand

Immortal Rotation In A Wordless Hearse 
Cosmic Funeral, Of Mothers Afterbirth
