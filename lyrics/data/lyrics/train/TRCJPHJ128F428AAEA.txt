Today I changed
Too late, cause everyone stayed the same
I'm gone so long break out cause I'm better off on my own

Today I changed
But too late cause every town feels the same
I'm different and your distant
Add it up and it makes no difference

Everybody's talking bout blowin' up the neighborhood
Everybody's gonna break it up today
Everybody's talking bout blowin' up the neighborhood
Runnin' just to get away

Stuck in America
Stuck in America
I'm lost in America
