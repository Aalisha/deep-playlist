Maybe your fault
Maybe unfair
Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I care

Maybe we're through
Falling in love
Maybe we're lost
But I, I can't go on

What am I to do without you?
'Cause, baby, I'm a fool without you
But a fool in love with you

Maybe I'm wrong
Maybe unfair
Maybe I'm gone
Maybe I'm there
Where do I go?
How did I get so confused?

When the morning comes
I'll still be with you
But when tomorrow is through
Are we? Maybe

Maybe I'm fine
Maybe I'm not
Maybe I'm sad
Or maybe I'm lost
