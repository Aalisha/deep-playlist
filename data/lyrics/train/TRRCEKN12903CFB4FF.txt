Mama said before I'm grown
I'll find somebody I can call my own
So when the stars are shining bright
I dream about the boy who's gonna hold me tight

And I wonder, wonder who he'll be
Oh I wonder, wonder who he'll be
Will he be good to me
Wonder, wonder who he'll be
Wonder if he'll love me forever and ever
