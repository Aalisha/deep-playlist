Well I've been burned in my prime
Simple things in life seem so hard to learn sometimes
And it takes so long, catch it while you can
Too late tomorrow, everyone

Said we all know what comes of that, we know what comes of that
Living in your pockets and talking through your hat
But it don't take long to turn your head around
Too late tomorrow, everyone

Needs you, love of the common man
As he turn the world around
