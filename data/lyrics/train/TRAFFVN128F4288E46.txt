Aint nothing like
A pair of fresh all white air force ones.
And I said to myself. I got to have.

Got to have her like nikes fresh out the box.

(verse 1)
Everybody want to know her name
Its like she walked right out a dream
A fantasy unreal
Dear god sent me an angel
Shes like no one I ever seen
no one I ever met
Someone I'll never forget.
Looking at her is good for my health.
She got me singing to myself.

(chorus)
I see her
I want her
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
Im fining
Day dreaming
Got to have her like (Nikes fresh out the box)
I wont scuff her up. I'll lace her up right.
Treat her real good like a pair of fresh white hi top or low tops.
I got to have them white nikes fresh out the box

(Bridge)
ay yay ay yay (ay yay ay yay)
ay yay ay yay (ay yay ay yay)
ay yay ay yay ay yay (ay yay ay yay ay yay)
