There you go baby, and here am I,
Well you left me here so I could sit and cry.
Golly gee, what have you done to me?

How you held me tight, each and every night?
Oh baby, how you drove me crazy,
But I guess it doesn't matter anymore.

There is no use in me a-crying,
I've done everything now, I'm sick of trying,
