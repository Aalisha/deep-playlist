I felt it
The wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter
I never saw it coming
I started to black out and
Then someone said good morning
I took it as a warning
I should have seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on
This thing we may have started
Intentional or not I
Don't think we saw it coming
It's all adding up to something
That asks for some involvement
That asks for a commitment
I think I see it coming
If we step out on that limb

My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me
I'm trying to handle all this unpredictability
In all probability

It's a long shot and I say why not
If I say forget it I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat this odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take there's no chance
But you're the best I've got
...
