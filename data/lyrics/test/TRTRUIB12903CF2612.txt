Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
and if I die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take.
Jamie it´s time to tell my people the truth.
It´s time to tell them the revelation of my second coming
have them understand, relate?
Now ride me baby.
Baby,
I love you,
fool,
Baby wants to ride, so high
Baby want to ride
Baby wants to ride so high
Baby want to ride - for love, here we go
Baby wants to ride
Oh, For love
She took me to the sky, for love
oh how she took me,
For love
Stripped me down and watch me
For love, she made me scream,
Deep for love
Baby rides - for love
Relate?
She brought me to my knees,
Oh for love
Made me beg please, oh for love
Remember,
Oh,
Remember?
Baby' Oh.
Baby rides for love,
Relate?
Remembering the yesterdays of us we spent together
Visions of you and me in my mind,
Oh how our body's intertwined with each other,
We made so many positions, some I cannot even find in a book you know?
Baby rides for love,
Relate?
Ooh, make me scream baby, please
You know the way I felt, when you undressed,
and when you put your hand on my arh em,
you know what I´m talking about baby, dig.
Dig,
relate,
...
