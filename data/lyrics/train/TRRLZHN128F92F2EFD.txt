Last time I heard it from you
You seemed so far away
Words as cold as ice
You said "this isn't yesterday"

You know what I sent to you
Was breakthrough from my heart

Now, The Time have's turn,
On what you might,
We'll fall apart

Longer than we need
The memory is so long
(Pictures from the past)
Pictures from the past
will stay where they belong

Don't pretend to know
What love is
Don't say you care
Don't pretend to know
What love is
When I really needed you there

I spend the endless nights
Talking to myself
How am I suppose to feel
...
