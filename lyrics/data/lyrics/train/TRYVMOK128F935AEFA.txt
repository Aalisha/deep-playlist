"At the end of this long and lonely path,
All misery will be gone"

Down this long and twining road
I walk with heavy feet
My head sunk down below
I have made up my mind
It's time to end this life
Then peace I will find

Walking down to my funeral
The mortal sin...
Some might be sad
I'll die with a grin
Walking down to my funeral
It's time to die
When I leave this pathetic world
I will hold my head high

Angels are watching from above
...
