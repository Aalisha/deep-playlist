You're a big fish in a small pond
Everyone knows your name, so you claim
Out for fortune and for the fame,
Though you play your life like it's just a game
I'd rather be fabulous than famous
Live my life steady than nervous
Always looking over my shoulder
Never knowing what's coming round the corner

Look at yourself
Look at yourself
