I opened up my eyes, swear I saw the light.
Don't you know the truth, it's so very hard to find.

Tell me, does it feel good?
Tell me does it feel right?
I'm singing (singing),
I'm singing (singing),
I'm singing, singing a simple song.

Some things die, to stay alive.
The teares we cry, we'll drink them sometime.

Yeah, I'm happy to feel this way.
Don't know another way.
I'm happy to feel alright.
Oh, it's the only thing that gets me through the night.
I'm not scared, 'coz I know I will survive.
