In crypts of eternal; catastrophic butcherings
Decrepit formations arise... structures of creations,
Fall to ruin upon this unblessed salvation...

The altars so holy; now begins to decompose
Mutilating breed arise, beneath the infamy
Bodies descend in swarms, prey to be consumed in the
Putrid cavers below purifying the cavities of the... exiled... existence
...
