My skins no shelter
Emoticons lie and I'm exposed
My tears are all out
And dry eyes always hurt the most
I can't lead my own life
There's no love, no love left here
Master of the skies
I've been in your sky but you weren't there

A motorcycle man
and Jesus was his name
Hes out on his ride
Believe in him and never die

Disappear in to sad
To have made him live a life of shame
But pockets of humanity
Made them embrace the long haired man
And I envy them

But I wont follow rules
Made up thousands of years ago
and change my hands of men
According to some current trend

So leave here why you can
Or answer to The Man!
You know he's everywhere
Isn't that a scare?

I know that I wont change and your faith is blind so you can't see
