(Defari:)
It's just so many things in this life that I can't understand
I'll never be able to understand cause there's no answer for 'em
The vultures be out though, know that
And they always gon' be out
Cause they're savages...
His arteries are punctured, they can't save his body
He got shot standin' outside the party
He was only pickin' up his son, he wasn't parkin'
Niggaz drove by and let the shotgun bark at him
He died the same way as Malcolm and Martin
Just tryin' to help people, instead of harm them
Mr. Youngblood, I know your soul hear me now I know you sittin' on a throne,
I know you hear me now I stood at King Hospital with emotion
I'm doin' music now, Pat still coachin'
Say hello to John...
I always thought that what happened to you was dead wrong
It doesn't figure out, it doesn't figure in
A good bottle and I still don't understand
But that's how life goes, some bigger master plan
We'll really never know, until the very end
(Chorus:)
The vultures are out, the gun shots fly
Loved ones die, loved ones cry
The vultures are out, the gun shots fly
Loved ones die, loved ones cry
