I had to compete
In the concrete, in the jungle
Had to kick and scratch
Stab some backs, in the jungle
At first I had a honest dream
Then the dike broke through
The scheme I had so gently planned
Soon that fell through
Now I'm back, back (back, back, back on the streets again)
I'm back, (back, back, back on the street again)
It's a gold plated world
When you ain't got a dime for a phone call, in the jungle
Makes me feel so bad
To be standin' in the welfare line
