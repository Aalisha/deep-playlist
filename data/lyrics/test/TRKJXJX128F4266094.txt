La, la la, la la laa, la

La, la la laa la
La, la la, la la laa, la
Story of my life
Well high school seemed like such a blur

I didn't have much interest in sports or school elections
And in class I dreamed all day 'bout a rock 'n' roll weekend
And the girl at the front of the room
So close yet so far you know she never seemed to notice

That this silly schoolboy crush wasn't just pretend
Life goes by so fast
You only wanna do what you think is right
Close your eyes and it's past

Story of my life
