Burn
It's time to die
Glued to the screen, ambition's grown tired
Mesmerized by gossip in a world expired

Good evening America. Tonight we feature
Anorexic beauty queens
Serial killer documentaries
Million dollar action scenes
Dry humping teenage magazines
Preaching pervert hypocrisy
Prescription drugs. Plastic Surgery
High school drama killing sprees
Arabian-Redneck conspiracies

There's never been a better time to die
...
