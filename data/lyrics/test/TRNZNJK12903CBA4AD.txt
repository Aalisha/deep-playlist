It's so hot in here, oh

I'm in over my head
Fire fills me, hot and red
Raging like a blood red sun
Fire fuelled by deeds undone
Burning and I just can't wait to give a helping hand to fate
Change this crazy world around, first we gotta cool down

Take me dancing naked in the rain
Feel it washing over me, oh oh
Join me dancing naked in the rain
Cover me in ecstasy, oh

Oh oh
