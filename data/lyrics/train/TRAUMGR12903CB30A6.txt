Sophisticated lady
Sophisticated lady
Sophisticated lady
Sophisticated lady
Everybody knows how she got her name, yeah, yeah
She's a different lady with a different style
She stands tall and ready like the Eiffel Tower
She is hip to politics, but loves her jazz
She's got lots of rhythm, she's got lots of class
Everybody knows how she got her name, yeah, yeah
Oh, huh
She wears knee-length dresses with her high-high steppers
She's not no back stabber, but she's sure a pleaser
She talks quiet and gentle, she acts very cool
She sticks close to her lover, she obeys God's rule
(Whoa)
