Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my momma and me

And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Then up the stairs, he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love, love, love to dance with my father again
