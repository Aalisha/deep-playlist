He's chasing you down the alleys of death
Where many have died, and where you will breathe your final breath
Your pulse starts to quicken, blood runs to your head
You start to feel sick by the thought of becomin dead

Scream murder, he's coming for you
Blade in his hand, he knows what to do, yeah
Scream murder, what can you do?
No one to help, it's just him and you
