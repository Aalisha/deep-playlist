Down in the valley where the river flows
There's a man with a long black coat
Clouds that are black and rain that is falling
On the coffin that tries to float

Children they cry
When they look eye to eye
Stay in your home
When the undertaker roams
Your town

The Funeral director is a busy man
He must do the job on time
Tape measures, nails and a clawhammer beckon
