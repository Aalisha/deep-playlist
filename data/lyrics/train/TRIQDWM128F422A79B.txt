We all seem so meaningless within our lives
We all seem so meaningless within our truth
I wanted you to be a part of me but now
We all want to be something
You all want to be something
But you're lost

We'll never take it back cause our souls are lost
Decreasing of the nation
We'll never have them back cause their souls are lost
Decreasing of the nation

Pocketful of empty promises
I know you know the way to drag us down in nothingness
Spending your time in raising the masterpiece of lies
That suits us fine
I wanted you to be a part of me but now
