Too much ice on the outside
Too much time, to get out
There vacant sways
Become angry, nothing faced
Nothing followed

It's a vice of disciples
Lapse of faith
No act of grace

Moving steals, in as much as we reveal
No encounter, no attachment to
Anything less than we corrupt

It's a life but at least
It is contained
No act of grace

It's the fall of a morning
You wake in before
...
