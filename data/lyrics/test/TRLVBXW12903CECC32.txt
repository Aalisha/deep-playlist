The obstacles we build for ourselves, my love!
Creating decisions to make, my love!
When really, it could be this easy:
you and me, and house, and food.

Your roots are stuck in the dirt of this land,
my questions all answered in the firmness of your hand,
I buried some hatred in the snow on the porch,
and when it comes undone, I will understand.

And the wind in the trees are like: sch-uuung, sch-uuung.
And the trains that pass by are like: sch-du-dung, sch-du-dung.
And you and me are like: come on, let's go out for a walk.
