Say you try
But you just can't help your self
Wanna feel special
Man wanna make you feel like everybody else
Take away your freedom
Strip away your pride
Say you know you weren't born
With the blue blood son
So tak eyour place in line

Where's my mule?
Where's my forty acres
Where's my dream
Mr Emancipator
Live this way
