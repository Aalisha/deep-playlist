I've been dreamin' 'bout city lights
And the sounds that have yet to come.
And I've been fighting the good fight,
Losing battle after battle 'til my day is done.
Well, I don't mind walkin' in the rain tonight.
May this water cleanse my body and my mind;
Absolve of things that I've done wrong,
So when I wake up in the morning I feel fine.
I feel fine, yeah.
I feel fine.
And I feel fine, da ho yeah.
I feel fa-ee-oh-oh-ine.
