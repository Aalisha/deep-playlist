Smooth
(Smooth)
Beyond the
(Beyond the)

Automatic, systematic
(Automatic)
Complex
(Just ease it in)

The feelings right
The music is tight
 (The music? s tight)

Departin? out of Crooklyn, type Saturday night
The Gear, The God, was rockin? type, way out of sight
Limpin' past the market scene, my man, aight

Steelo type fat, solar type facts
Later for milk and honey
Get the money out this piece, relax
(Relax)
I handle streets, all type slick
Just like a seven no lash

She got moist? cause I got? s the platinum voice
Like syrup, for delf roamin', the New York Boroughs
As they temp our perms, plus I ride the iron worms
Uptown across down, from the boogie with no fake
Ghetto to my marrow then ease on back to Crooklyn

Hold it, has loot in my timbs and army suits
Parlayin? where Malcolm stood, now brother? s plus they blow out
A slicker nigga pig, dig me picking my fuckin'? fro out
Limpin' up the one tree fives, the P jects, the eject these herbs
That? s word to green herb, not the curbs

I play that like, primo supreme hustler
Nappy hair, oil slick, loyal to kick and dirty snare, little panther
Answers to the nom de plum butter
Nice, preciser, rubber, slicer and cutter

In a freshly dip state, I contemplate
Who? s avenue be makin' the most bacon
My honey gets the loot out
We? re shaking?

We gettin' live
Dreamin? bein? in the Central Ave. bus stop
Then I call bust out, wassup?
Seems that the dream teams me
Mecca, The God and Sulaiman

If their beats is phatty
And it? s on then I? m gone
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
