To what end

To what end do we proceed so boldly
If all we are is chemical reactions
Yeah and what world have you, so deftly sold me

If you reduce me
If I have no soul to touch
No heart to love
No evil to rise up above
No angels and no ghosts
No real victories to toast
If I believe that this is true
Then I must ask
To what end do you proceed?

No fire in our eyes
No steel in our hearts
