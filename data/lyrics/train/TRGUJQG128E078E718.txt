Take a look around and tell me what you see
I guess that all depend on exaclty what you want it to be
Is your cup half-full? Is your cup half-empty?>br> How can you get what you need in the land of plenty?
Everybody gets carried away
Everybody's trying everyday to remind you
(Ooo) Leave it behind you
What's it take to see?
What's it take to believe right from wrong?
Never knowing where you belong
Walk On
Walk On
