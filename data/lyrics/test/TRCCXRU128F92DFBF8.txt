You must have lost a long time standing still
You did not try to persist but you will
Growing obsession while you're at the door
One step more and it's yours

Day after day you've been diddling the truth
You think you're living but live's living you
What do you feel when you're daughter is near
Are you held up by her fear

What did you lose in your life against your will
I see no value in what your head fills
What would you lose when that value would die
No one who cares
You're outside
