Your heartless compassion just tears through my flesh
Like burning red flaming blades of steel
You got it all but there's always one more pound
Cutting with precision you know what you want
Don't devide me from myself what you say fucks my mind
Got me in a tight grip but still you clutch harder
Sucking me dry by just looking at me with your eyes
Disengage me from this constant pain

Our worlds keep on colliding
We're heading for the total collapse
So why do we bother trying?
