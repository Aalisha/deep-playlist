I want someone that makes me happy
I want someone that I make smile
I want someone with things in common
I want someone to bear my child

And I want someone that I can cry to
I want someone to cry for me
And I want someone without the drama
See I want someone to love me deep, if you

If you want rain or shine
If you got love you can have mine
You want heart, you want time
If you got love you can have mine

I want someone who loves my bad days, yeah
I want someone who's spiritual, yeah yeah
And I want someone to keep my secrets
