Ah! Backstreet
I could tell when I stepped in the room
And I saw you standing there
And I thought by the way that you move
I couldn't help the way I stared
There was some mysterious force

Leading me here to you, lead me to you
So I stood there watching
And I was hypnotized
By the rythum of your body
And the music in your eyes

And I was lost inside your world with you
Hey Mr. DJ keep playin' this song for me
Out on the floor in my arms she's gotta be
Let's get it on, jam all night long

Mr. DJ, Mr. DJ please play it for me
Now it feels like it could be romance
As we dance across the floor
