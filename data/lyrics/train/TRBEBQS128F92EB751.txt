I am here and now because of you
you're the reason I do what I do
like a phantom when you call me I'll be there
any time that I'm around you shouldn't fear

because of you
that's what I do
because of you
I'm a true believer

I'm a true believer
I'm with you through the night
You're my inspiration in life
I'm a true believer
