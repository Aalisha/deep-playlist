[Hook]
My mistakes are made by me
Your mistakes are made by you
What ever you do you gotta make it through
What ever you say you gotta mean it too
Don't bother say if it ain't true
That goes for me and that goes for you
My mistakes are made by me
Your mistakes are made by you

[Verse1]
My mistakes were made by me
Your mistakes were made by you
You can't learn from one mistake you'll make two then three
It don't stop, the future looks bright but it's not
About' Wot Wot Wot
You've lost it ya might as well Stop Stop Stop
But one mistake I made is the reason why it took long for me to get up to the top
So, now I'm here I'm thinking about me
For what I'm worth I could make so much P
Sometimes I think that I shoulda stayed with the same manager
That I had back in 03, simply cos' Cage knows me
But I'm glad that I left now I got a whole tree of family emcees in the
G-R-I-M-E
Wiley that's me, Dun' know!
