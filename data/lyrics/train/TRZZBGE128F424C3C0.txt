Flash my face
No intro needed
My self-awareness
Has not been mistreated
Ten times the fire
On a blackened sky
I won't break my in
A selfish try just to
Create my ideal picture
Sex is free and
My check's nine figures
The gold on my teeth
Draw the attention
Away from my suit
Pure velvet body suspension

You know who I am

Jack's the name
Style in a frame
