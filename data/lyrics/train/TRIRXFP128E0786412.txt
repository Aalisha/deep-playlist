Wind me up, put me down
Start me off and watch me go
I'll be runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
A little off center, and I'm out of tune
Just kickin' this can along the avenue
But I'm all right

'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done
You can't stop now, it's already begun
You feel it runnin' through your bones
And you jerk it out
And you jerk it out
