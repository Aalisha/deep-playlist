I see you standin? helpless
Afraid to face a little sadness
If I follow your direction
Where would I be?

I don? t have to wonder, I know definitely
That it? s just not for me

And someday you? ll wake up to find that
You? ve been waiting around
For something you? ll never see

So I don? t have to wonder, I know definitely
That it? s just not for me
