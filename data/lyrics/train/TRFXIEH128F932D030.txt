My dark rose
Don't go despairing, no
Don't you know I am a friend of the devil, and you're a friend of mine?
Got a feeling you'll be fine

You said you want it? Well, you can have it
You said you need it? Well, go and grab it
And I'll be by your side
Wrecking shop tonight

Get your ass up on your feet now, baby
Don't take it all to heart
Get your ass up on your feet now, baby
Tear the place apart
