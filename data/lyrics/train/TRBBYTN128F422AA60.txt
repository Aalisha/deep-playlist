Ooh
When all the world's gone to bed I'm in this stillness where I can't go on
With these pictures in my head of a world that's gone mad
I know that's not the way the cards should fall
And
Oh
You turn your head towards the sun
You're feeling warm
But you're waving goodbye to the people in line for the movies you've seen
Repeating the words stuck in your mind
Hey
There's too much in your head
Now turn off your eyes to the world
There's too much in your mind
And all you saw with two eyes
The colours flash and your time just rolls by
You woke up alone but you know I was there
