Sitting here and reading your thoughts, my heart sinks once again
'Cause I caught you in another lie, find no truth in what you said
You say that you'll hurt my feelings
You say I won't understand
I say you're just a coward
Just a counterfeit friend

And all the times I've been there, they didn't mean a thing
At least not to you, but I know they meant something to me
And I wish that I could give up, is that what you want from me?
Because I'm still your friend even if you don't want me to be
