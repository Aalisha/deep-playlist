Suffering she bears, yet tender remains
Soul of woman, with wisdom and grace
Willow tree that weeps, sad but not unloved
Cruelest winds of age,
working their worst where she stands
So much baggage, so much guilt
and the past seems so distant
I forgot how selfless you brought me life
And into your world
And of all the things I could sing of,
cannot express whats inside of me
The heart of your son is not so cold
Its never forgotten your love

Hold on mother earth
Now its my turn to tend to your needs
Now I comprehend
All the things I hold dear, you gave to me
Hold on mother earth
To see your beautiful face smiling at me
