circles
circles, circles
i spin around in circles
world's turning upside down, i spin in
circles, circles
i spin around in circles
boy - my heart was lost and found, oh...
i've been through - many situations
even though - i know how love works
nothing ever goes as planned
better forget it!
told myself "never fall again, no!"
told myself "better keep control"
now i'm scared of my own words
should i regret it?
now you made my mind blow (that's what you did!)
tell me, was i asking you to do so?(i never said that!)
i can see my boarders disappearin' (aha...)
is it love i'm fearin'
circles, circles
i spin around in circles
