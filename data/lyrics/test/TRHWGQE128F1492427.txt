Verse 1
God, please push me in the right direction
God, I'm hoping that you'll understand
God, I'm trying to make amends now
God, I'm asking for your guiding hand
Everybody's got the wrong opinion
Everybody says what's on their mind
Everybody's got the wrong tradition
Everybody prays you the man
God
God
