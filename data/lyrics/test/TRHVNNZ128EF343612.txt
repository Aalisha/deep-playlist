[Verse 1]
I can't continue to act like
I don't wanna be here
When I know I do
Cause I'm really feelin' you (Feelin' you)
And you ain't tha type to sleep around town
Let niggas get down
And come up with this lame excuse (Excuse)
And I really love tha way you warm me up
Your.

[Chorus Pt1]
Your necessary like coats in tha Winter
Right here like cold in December (Outside)
And I need you like
Need you like Mo-Town need its slow beat
Somethin like oh baby baby
Oh baby baby

[Pt2]
Where I wanna be is with you
Wanna take you from tha things you used to
Cause only time I'm me is with you
And this feelin' ain't gonna change (No)
(Where I wanna be) Where I wanna be is with you (Where I)
Wanna take you from the things you used to
Cause only time I'm me is with you
And this feelin' ain't gonna change (no)
I'm gon' stay with you

[Talking]
