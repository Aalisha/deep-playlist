Well, I really hate to flatter you
But I used to wait by the lamplight
For your vaudeville smile
But you go to extremes, you're a liability

This is the last time I'm leaving
Last time I'm believing that you've changed
And I'm so tired of grieving
The death of something we never had

You in a red storm with summer skin
You were tap dancing, shape shifting
Your purple symphony
Our hearts were like nectarines
...
