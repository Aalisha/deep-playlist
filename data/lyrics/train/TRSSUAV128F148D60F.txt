She came through the front door
Lookin' fast as a big train bookin' down the line
And she was lookin' fine
Long and lean and dressed to kill
Stacked up high with perfect wheels
And there ain't no chance
That girl would ever dance with me
She got all those city boys out pushin' and shovin'
A country boy like me don't ever get no uptown lovin'

She's sweet
She's got 'em melting in her hand
Whoever gets a taste of that cup of sugar
Sure is a lucky man
She's sweet
I'm tellin you boys, she's babe-a-licious
...
