Another time, another space
Mark my words, I can't fake another day of sadness
My heart's been taken whole
And this dream is getting old
Yet I'm searching every part of me, baby


The tables' turned, that's for sure
Guilt and honor have crossed into what's left for holding on
You know things are getting hard
When we see them as they are
Can these qualities remain the same? 


Woman, feeling good about the choice I made
In so deep there aint no judgment day
If there was I think I'd be okay
