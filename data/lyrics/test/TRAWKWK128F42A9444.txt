a lover collecting ladies
a poet connecting raindrops
a rock'n'roll star, a gambler's seven
a saint on a train to heaven
if you don't like your number
trying to get out from under
providence comes and offers sweetly
swallow the dream you like

some buy a dream crutch to survive
somebody says, "don't sell me lies" ...

so providence kindhearted lady
sent round all her salesmen
...
