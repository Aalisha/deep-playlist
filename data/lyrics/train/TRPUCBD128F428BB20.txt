Yes I've been without, been down and out,
Out on a limb with nowhere to go,
I was told it would be one less thing on my mind,

Not to worry about, all the paying out,
The piles of bills and final demands,
They'd all be sorted when I die.

I was going off the rails, no matter how I tried,
If all else fails failed and part of me just died,
And nothing ever changes, forever stuck on my tune,
Baby I was born to lose,

Then my luck came in, I got a lucky win,
Hundreds of thousands and thousands of friends,
Had no more worries for a time,
