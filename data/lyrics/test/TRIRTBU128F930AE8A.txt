Love and kisses, I don't want 'em
Love and kisses, not from you
You can keep your love and kisses
Till you show me you'll be true

You could sweet talk just right
Make me think black was white
Make me think day was night
But all along you did me wrong
All the others, you see
Got the same old routine
