sometimes he calls me on the phone
just to tell me he loves me
more than anyone else in the whole wide world
and when he gets me all alone
oh, he kisses and he hugs me
and he lets me know that i'm his only girl
he works me like a full time job y'all
but i love it when he takes me there
he's so out of this world
it's hard to believe
that he loves a girl
and that girl is me
...
