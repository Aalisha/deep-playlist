She's so fine, fine, fine
She's a dime, dime, dime
She's so fine, fine, fine
She's all mine, mine, mine

She can make you lose control, but I'm a keep it on the low
Just to see her pretty face makes you want her (want her)
Can't explain the way it feels, but I know the feelings real
I can't wait to get her home so I can love her

She's so fine, fine, fine
She's a dime, dime, dime
She's so fine, fine, fine
She's all mine, mine, mine
...
