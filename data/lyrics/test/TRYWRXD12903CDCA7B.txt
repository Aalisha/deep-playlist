Ahh the outdoors, the fresh outdoors
Word up, it's a beautiful day
Bout to go poli' right now that's my WORD
Aiyyo

Aiyyo call me a cab it's the Razor Sharp kid
Dipped everyday my style is po-lit'
I'm out to the Mansion I gots to catch Ghost
I'm headed to the club tonight, we need toast
For that wack ass MC, talkin all the shit
I know we can't wait just to get his wig split
It's war with the Gods this year, represent
The bitch-ass niggaz keep tryin to repent
But we still lickin off, we wild like two cent
Park Hill Projects, say it witcha lungs
Fuck y'all cats, we always got guns
But just in case, we get drunk and can't drive
We gotta fuck somethin up, dead or alive
Y'all comin with us, we live on the other side
Of the chart, where your mother met Poppa Wu

Black boyyyeee, in the ghetto streets
Black boyyeeee, no more suffering
Black boyyeeee, shine the light for we
Continue, black boy, black boy, black boy, black boy
