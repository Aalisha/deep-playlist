You don't need a special invitation
To come to the blow out party of a nation
The big one's been set up for tonight
Wreak a little havoc till the place is a sight
No more reason to be pleasin'
Rocket blast, rock it down, rock on ten
Tomorrow might never come again

(Let's have a wrecking ball)
Really tear it up
(Let's have a wrecking ball)
A little rough and tough
This is it
(Last call)
Let's raise hell until the walls fall
Let's have a wrecking ball

Abandon all morality, anything goes
Got nothin' to lose but your sanity
The finger's on the button, this is your last ride
It's an E ticket with the devil by your side
Missiles burning, sky is turning
