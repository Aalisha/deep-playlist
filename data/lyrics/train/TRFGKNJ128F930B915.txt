Only silence fills the air, as the dust slowly fades away
Suddenly I hear the screams of victory, oh brothers can this be true
This bloody war at last it's history, as I wished nightly in my dreams

Heading to home

Some say they escape away from here, faraway into the night.
The reason for that, no one can tell, as long as they keep out of sight

Oh, How I see how the birds are flying, in the sky
We are walking home from this battlefield, and we sing

Signs of life, in the night
The time when our new life can start
...
