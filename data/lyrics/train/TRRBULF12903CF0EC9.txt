Whoo! What time is it?
Ooh, I got to hurry up and get on this red dress.
The one that fit real tight.
I got to put my wig on, my high-heeled shoes
'Cause I got to be lookin' good, honey,
For that blues party tonight.

Tell B.B. King, don't forget to bring Lucille
People wanna hear him sing, all the hits he made down through the years
It's gonna be all right
At the blues party tonight.

Somebody call Little Milton, you'll find him down at Annie Mae's cafe
Tell him the band is already set up
Just waitin' on him to play
It's gonna be all right
At the blues party tonight.

Bobby Blanton's gonna be there (oh! ), Johnny Tella's gonna sing "Good Love"
Madame O gonna straighten it out (straighten it out), Bob Rush is gonna
Bring his suit (suit's got a gun)
It's gonna be all right
