Well there's the rockabilly cats with their pomps real high
Wearing black drape coats, all real gone guys
The cool skinheads with roll up jeans
Looking real tough and mighty mean


There's a rumble in Brighton tonight
Ringside seats for the neighborhood fight,
There ain't a Godddamn thing that the cops can do,
There's a rumble in Brighton tonight.


They sew fish hooks under their colars,
Got razors in their shoes
"Go cat go" is their battle cry
World War Three is starting to brew
