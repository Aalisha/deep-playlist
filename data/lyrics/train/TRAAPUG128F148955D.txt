Do you kiss your lover when you leave the house?
Is this the last time that you'll see him?
Are you sitting comfortable are you feeling proud?
Are you turning heads when you shout?

All my sorrows I give to you,
All my pain and wasted years,
I'm feeling tired so I'll have to go.
It's a beautiful dynasty.
