Wait dear, a white horse is walking down my street here
Your words are creeping at my feet
I fear, sunrise will come to soon and you'll disappear
Into the haze of this city and go south

Look out, they're coming after us with big guns
They're only gonna tell you all the bad things I've done
Even if they words they say aren't true they've won
Now I'm left here dying in the sun
