[Intro: Ray Luv]
Yiddo, Yiddo, ha ha ha ha, this yo' nigga Young Ray Luv
Back in yo' motherfucking face, you know?
Ha ha ha ha, the Lynk Crew, no more trouble, just trying to bubble
And this goes out to my son - Baby IE, wassup boy?

I was a hustlin-ass nigga straight lovin' the game
Always meant to be a playa put the Luv in my name
Who put the hustle in this youngster? I guess my daddy's to blame
Cause if it made skrilla, there wasn't no shame in his game
Another young playa, caught up in the fortune and fame
Nigga when I'm gone, will they still remember my name?
Straight soldier, stayed at this here 'till it's over
Old folks laughing, telling my daddy that I'm never sober
Why don't you understand I'm just trying to feed my baby?
I'm going crazy, none of y'all fools can fade me
You trying to save me? Sometimes I feel the love is gone
There I go, out the door to get my hustle on
Dreams of platinum, rap after rap I'm writing back to back
While I hustle stack for stack
I'm caught in the cross, the game twist me into trouble
Forever hustle, I'mma struggle 'till I bubble

Gotta make my money double
Struggle out of trouble, all good
I'mma hustle till I bubble
Gotta make my money triple
Hennessy not ripple
(Big Eddie Spaghetti you gone pop like a pimple)

BG turned OG, gone off that oldie
Went from Zenith's and Vogue's to Lexus I's and gold D's
In love with the game, will I fold G's?
Ain't no tears just beer poured for my homies
A ghetto star, every hood in church know me
Haters want me but trick them suckers long as the set got love for me
I'm Lynked up to the fullest
So you better think nine times before you come at me with some bullshit
The Feds is crackin' down like bullwhips
And niggas' gunnin' for me so when I smoke I keep a full clip
I just wanna get richer
