The guts it's taken you
Just to say what you mean
Let's do this right tonight
'cause there's no in-between

The self deprecation of what you put your faith in
Has brought you to your knees
You're waiting at the starting line
What if the gun is empty?

Run
Leave it all and run
Just run
It's all in your hands all in your hands
...
