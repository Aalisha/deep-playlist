I tried to find myself
For a very long time
Somewhere I lost myself
It's so hard to find my way back home
My body's roaming all day long
Feels like a real bad dream
I try so hard to break free yeah
And even though I try
Something else is got a hold on me
Will I ever be in control of me
When will I wake up
Escape from this crazy dream
