Hey, don? t wanna run no more
Hey, must find an open door
Hey, ask him to step inside
Hey, I'm tired from this life

I don? t wanna waste away
Like I saw myself fading yesterday
I don? t wanna feel the shame
I don? t wanna waste away
Like I saw myself fading yesterday
I don? t wanna feel the pain
I don? t wanna waste away

Hey, walk on but don? t come forth
Hey, find what I lost before
Hey, must change the shape I? m in
Hey, never go back again
