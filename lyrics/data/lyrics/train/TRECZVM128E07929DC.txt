(written by: Slash / Eric Dover)
Come on down to our house
All the neighbors are away
We're invitin' everyone
We got take out and everything
The local P.D.'s been around
That's one right over there
And the chick that's sittin' on his face
Is glad that he is here

There isn't a time frame
Been doing it all week long
So come on by babe
And bring your friends along

Don't know what you're missing
Having a hell of a time
...
