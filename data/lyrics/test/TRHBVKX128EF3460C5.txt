She was only twenty-one
But so much older than she's now
Now she passed the twenty-four
I guess it's time to say goodbye

Here's the new, here's the real
Here's the life you like to live

Taking on the world tonight

When we met, she smelled like honey
When we kissed she tasted tears
Then for fourteen thousand seconds
We made love behind old fears

Here's the new, here's the real
