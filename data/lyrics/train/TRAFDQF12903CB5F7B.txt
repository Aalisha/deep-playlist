I should know by now, 
I should see some how
How to bring her 'round, 
How to breathe.

I don't make a sound, 
Splinters hit the ground, 
Silence screams so loud
As see leaves.

As the torch light shines
Through the heavy skies
Autumn waves her hand
Straight at me.

See her world fall down
As the trees turn brown
As she drifts away
...
