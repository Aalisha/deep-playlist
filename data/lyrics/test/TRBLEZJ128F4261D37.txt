I mistook the warnings for wisdom
from so-called friends quick to advise
though your touch was telling me otherwise
Somehow I saw you as a weakness
I thought I had to be strong
Oh but I was just young I was scared

I don't dream of wandering through the home that might have been
I listened to my pride when my heart cried out for you
Now everyday I wake again
In a house that might've been
A home
