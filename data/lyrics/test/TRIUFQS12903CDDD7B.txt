Remembering me
Discover and see -
All over the world
She's known as a girl.
To those who are free
The mind shall be key.
Forgotten as the past
'Cause history will last...

God is a girl
Wherever you are
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?
God is a girl
Whatever you say
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?
God is a girl
However you live
Do you believe it?
Can you receive it?
God is a girl
She's only a girl

Do you believe it?

Can you receive it?

She wants to shine
Forever in time
She is so driven
