I love you completely
I guess I'm kinda mad about you
I love you, I love you I do
Love overcomes all of my senses
Lowers all of my defenses, yeah
And all of your faults vanish to a blind daze
Your bitterness erased by my sense of taste
And harsh words are deafened by love

I love you completely
I couldn't be madder about you
I love you, I love you I do
