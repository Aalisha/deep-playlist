Oh baby, we're all alone.
Nowhere to go, no telephone.
Just you and me and this big old bed.
You ain't got nowhere to go.
You might as well stop being so cool.
Honey, baby, break down.

Oh baby, take off your clothes.
Do it over by the window.
Feel the wind blow.
That's the atmosphere.
Ooh baby, come here.
