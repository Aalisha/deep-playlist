Walk out not thinking twice
One fist full of money and the other lies
Just one reason why you had to run
So let's just say you had enough
Of this torture built up inside
A mixed up youth and an awkward smile
You carried your whole life
And now you're gone into the night
You said oh where do we go to find you
Not only that but hide you from giving it up
