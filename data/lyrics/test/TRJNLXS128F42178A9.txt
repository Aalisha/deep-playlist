The handwriting was on the wall, but I refused to read it
Our end always hung in the balance, apparent to both me and you
But now you're looking for the coward's way out, and that's unbelievable
To back out on someone when they're down is totally unforgivable

(Chorus:)
Cutdown on the 12th, You picked a great day to think of your self
Cutdown on the 12th, on a day where I scream for your help
