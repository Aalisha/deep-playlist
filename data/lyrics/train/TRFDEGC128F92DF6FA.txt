And when a feeling comes around
Let it sparkle and let it shine
Let it lift you off the ground
Make it last, baby make it mine

You are the sun that rises
You are the moon that lights the night
You are what paralyses me (paralyses me)

Everytime you need me
You know I will be there
You know I really care
Say you will, say you dare
