You take my money
You think you're great
You think it's funny
And I hate your face
You got your Jesus
And I got my space
You got your reasons
And I got my case
Just gotta sit yourself down
To contemplate
You get yourself a nice cold beer
And drink yourself away
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay
You're celebrating nothing
And you feel a-okay
You think you're precious
And I think you're shit
And I'd kill your father
