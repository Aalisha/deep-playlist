You use my love
To quench your desire
You play with me
You're playing with fire
I give my heart to take you higher
This is my only one desire
We can't get along
You won't come home

Yesterday I found you in his arms
Seducing him with all your charms
You know you really hurt me so
I need you
And I won't let go

Can't get away, babe
Can't get along, mama
Can't get away, babe
Though you hurt me so

Ooh ooh, babe

You got me cryin' in my sleep
I close my eyes
It's you I see
You might be somewhere else, I know
