It all starts tonight
Tonight's the night I guess
So let's go take some drugs
And let's go have some sex

The first time it's alright
The future starts tonight
And you cannot make everything alright
But you could stop being wrong tonight

Tonight
Tonight

And someone's getting born
And someone's getting killed
...
