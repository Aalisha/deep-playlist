I dream about you all the time, yes I do
And I can't sleep at night
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
I dream about makin' you mine, yes I do
And of holding you tight
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)

I've never been sure 'bout a boy before
But I want you to know
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
Given you my heart and my soul and my love
'Cause I trust you so
(Heaven only knows, mm hmm)
...
