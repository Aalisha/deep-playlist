So you walk away from an open door
With no sympathy from a man who knows
Somebody's lost somebody cries
Where were you standing, how could you fall for all the lies?
Looking back in time do you see the truth?
It's so easy to find
Somebody's weak somebody's strong, thought that I'd stumble
You got it all wrong

Look back in anger look back in shame
Somebody told you somebody's losing out again

Inside outside love
Inside outside love

All the feelings gone, you're just a face in the crowd
And I wonder why, you don't walk so proud
Somebody's lost, somebody's found
