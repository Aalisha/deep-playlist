Up until now my ideas have been latent
The cycling world will never be the same
But come first light I'll be taking out a patent
And from that day
If a bike be found lying on the ground again

What joy it'll bring, piece of metal and a spring
Bolted down by the back wheel, activated by the heel
What joy it'll bring, piece of metal and a spring

What chicken laid the egg from whence inside an idea hatches?
From prototype to production lines to the first one hundred batches
