First you said that you would never leave me
Merry were my days
Then you told me life is never easy
And left without a trace

But how come I want you
Like the soil yearns for the rain

Let my soul breathe
Tell me wrong tell me right
You're my mind cage
Like a mountain far away
You were always there
Dressed in summer white
