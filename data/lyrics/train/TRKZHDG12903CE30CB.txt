The corner cafe, 
She scrapes some quarters off the table, 
Says thanks yeah now maybe I'll be able,
To get that black Mercedes,
I've been saving for, 
The other girls say, 
You outta undue a couple buttons,
Start showing off a little something, 
She says naw you go ahead, 
Think I'd rather stay poor,
See I'm just making rent, 
She said this ain't where my road ends

Chorus
