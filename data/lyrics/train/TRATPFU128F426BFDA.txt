Daily grind is stealin' me away again
When I just wanna lay back down
Another night gone and don't know where it went
What I need more than anything right now is

Time with you, more time with you
To laugh and talk and play and make more love to you
Oh, there's nothing in this world I'd rather do
Than spend time with you
