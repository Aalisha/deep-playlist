Put your hands to my hands
Put your knees to my knees
Put your eyes to my eyes
Come on baby complement me

'Cause I don't think that we
Should ever feel the need to worry
Ever get ourselves in a hurry
You know I love you
I know you love me

So time will go
And we may be
Far apart I know
But as far as I can see
This is so good
There's no need for change
It's alright with me
It's as simple as it should be
Simple as it should be
...
