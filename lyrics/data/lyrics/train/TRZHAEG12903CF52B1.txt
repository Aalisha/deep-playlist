I'm making restrictions and placing convictions
upon my rough decision you comply
cause my job applies when two sides collide
just respect those binding contracts live or die

It's cause some lessons can't be taught
and some might say that realism and favors can be bought
(open your eyes)
and that's why objective as i am i might just take it away

I know you won't budge but i'm just like a judge
and i hope that both defendants understand
what i say is binding so stop all the whining
