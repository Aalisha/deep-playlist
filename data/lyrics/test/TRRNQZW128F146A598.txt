Zig it out tings a do good again
Zig it out man a roots and dem match di stem
Zig it out zing zagga zu zang
Hear di music clique talk again and announce
Ziggy zag, zing zagga zu zu zang
Zig it out, zung zagga zu zu deh
Zig it out, zing zagga zagga hey cool
And I man sing seh dat
Have you ever lost your drive
Sick of working 9 til 5
If you have you will understand why I'm frowning
Zagga zagga zeh
Have you been working all day
Does your bills take all your pay
Can you feel me when I say feel like I'm drowning
Well mi tired of stealing
Sick and tired of di pain I'm feeling
Tired of di hate and di war I'm living in
Prophecy revealing
I say guide and protect me Lord
Cah di millions I'm reeling in
Bring a lot a friend but I'm just not feeling him
Claim to be my dawg but I still don't believe in him
Sound too deceiving
And I learn not to trust no man
Cah last sunday evening
Niggas drove by then janice stop breathing
Ain't nothing new it just di bobbing and weaving
Now mama grieving
Lawd know I can take no more
Cah ma woman conceiving
Ain't no place for my kids I'm living in
House with a pool on di hill I'm dreaming in
