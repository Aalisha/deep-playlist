Whatcha wanna talk 'bout can we talk about it
And handle this maturely? Don't nobody love you baby?
Nobody begging baby, after troubles that we've seen

I don't know your tired of walking, tired of digging up the sand
Using common cause, baby just like I'm tired of
Rice and beans and collard greens but remember this

When the bill collectors they come a knocking
There won't be no stopping when I'm deep inside your love
And when the telephone bill won't get paid, baby don't worry

You can reminisce about the love you gave and when
There won't be no anger, as long as I got you, when I'm hang girl
I'll just fuss and scream at you, just as long as I got you boo so

If you tell me what's on your mind, we can join hands
And find a place from where we both can climb
And stop struggling, struggling, yeah

And if you're telling me how you feel
I can let you know the real and then we can both
Just build and make this thing much better, baby
