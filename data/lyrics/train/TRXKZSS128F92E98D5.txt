Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

Make me shine just a little bit, just a little bit
It's in my mind just a little bit, just a little bit
Keep me high, baby just a little bit, just a little bit
Can we spend some time?
 (Can we spend some time?)

Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

Just a touch of love, just a touch of love
Just a touch of love, just a touch of
Just a touch of love, just a touch of love
Just a touch of love, just a touch of

Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

Need it now just a little bit, just a little bit
Send fire through my spine just a little bit
Just a little bit

Just a little touch of love is what I need
