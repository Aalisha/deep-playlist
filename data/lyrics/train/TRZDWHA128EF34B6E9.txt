Holy shamoly said the priest to the girl
As he wrapped his arms around her
And his guts became her world
She said I can't take any more
No I can't take any more
And she could taste the christ
Breath the church
Smell the crucifixion
Of another fallen angel hooked up on false religion
She's gotta hole for a soul
She's gotta sad sad tale to tell
...
