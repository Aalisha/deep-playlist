You called it down
A bloody wrath
A finger points to the distant horizon
You try to scream
With bulging eyes
Your feet are frozen in your steady barren hole
A blinding light
A flash of heat
Those who are there disintegrated immediately
Melted masses with an idiots faith you fall

Let it burn down
All hallowed ground
...
