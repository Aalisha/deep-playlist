When your path's gone astray and you think you've gone mad
Maybe tired from washing all the blood from your hands
Do you feel that you have the world's weight on your shoulders
Not getting any younger and feeling kinda slower

Now is the time we leave it all behind
To sit with a glass and think of memories passed
Now's a time for fun not for quarrels and fears
I just needed to get out so
POUR ME A BEER!

So cheers for the beers and hail to the ale
Hey chin up brother!
