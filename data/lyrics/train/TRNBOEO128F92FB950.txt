I've been vindicated
I've been loved and hated
I've been pulled aside and told that life was overrated
No, I don't believe it
I just can't conceive it
I can write all night but in the morning I can't read it

Oh no, don't know what's the matter
Stuck up on a ladder, scared of coming down
If I don't get what I want
And there ain't enough to go around
...
