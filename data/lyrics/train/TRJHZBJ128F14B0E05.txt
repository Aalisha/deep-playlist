I'm coming out like a 45
Spinning like a Wurlitzer on overdrive
Feeling like electroglide
Touchdown satellite, feel alright
Tonight return of love
Return, return of the singer

So twist me up and watch me turn
Just like a falling star about to burn
Sending down an outward thrust
The curtains up baby, it's all or bust
Tonight return of the love you get
Return, return of the singer
