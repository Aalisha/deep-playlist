Shouting words at a mirror,
Trying to find the hero.
I don't want to let any of you down.

I see me on the floor of a room inside
My own house with a set of darker eyes.
Distortion shows row to open doors
I closed for good reasons years before.

Growing up, I was told one too many times
I'd never be good enough, never be alright.
See, I'm an equal like you with fears,
I'm not above or below. My only home is here.
Want you to know I sometimes let go.

Shouting words at a mirror,
Trying to find the hero
They all say I am.
The voice behind these verses
Is still so far from perfect.
I don't want to let any of you down.
