Words, they don't mean nothing
So tell me why they hurt so much
I meant to tell you something
It was on the tip of my tongue

Words rush by so quickly
And it's too late to take them back
I tried to say I'm sorry
And that goodbye was just an act

But all my words got in the way
And all the things I meant to say
Were not the things you heard
...
