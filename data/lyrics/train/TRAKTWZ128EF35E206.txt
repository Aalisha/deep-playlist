Ooh baby, anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do, to calm it
Is just think of you
'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love
I just get more attached to you when
You hold me in your arms, and squeeze me

And you leave me making me blue
'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love
So in love
(So in love)
Ooh
(So in love)
With you
