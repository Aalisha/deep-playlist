I got a girlfriend
Only she don't know it yet
Got a six string best friend
Who sleeps with a broken neck
I want to make my mark
Change the world, with this flow
But, all this doubt in my head
It won't let me go

Can't you see I want to lock my door and shut out all
The world surrounding me
Safe from the problems and the pressures caused by
insecurities

Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll!
Get up! Get up!
Take my heart and my soul!
Get up! Get up!
Let the good times roll
On and on and on.

Feel like everybody else just needs to see through different eyes
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives
Come on and let me go
and just like everyone else
I feel the pain each time I try
But I'll fight the bitter end
To shout the anthem
The anthem of our lives
Oh-woah-oh
The anthem of our lives
...
