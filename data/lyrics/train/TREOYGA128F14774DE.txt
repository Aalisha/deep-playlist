After it all
It's a pain in the gut
Cos we often get up
For a war with each other and now
I've won the last word 
Don't know if I can take it back

Oh it pains me to say
I've buried it away
With my pride, oh baby, it's time
To stop you're sobbing
I am not worth it at all

I won't say sorry

I can't say sorry to you baby
If you just look into my eyes you'll see
That I can't say sorry to you babe
I'm a heartbreaker
It just comes easily

I won't say sorry to you baby
So you can put the blame on me
I can't say sorry to you babe
I'm a heartbreaker
It's just so easy for me
