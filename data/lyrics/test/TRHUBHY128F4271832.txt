Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to you
Santa must be Polish he's jolly as can be,
Riding on his sleigh with gifts for you and me.
Santa Must Be Polish all dressed in red and white,
Slipping down the chimney, while you're asleep at night.

Wesolych Swiat Bozego Narodzenia
Means happy holidays to everyone of you
