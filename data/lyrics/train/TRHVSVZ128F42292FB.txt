You really let the family down
You almost ruined their name
Your father's so disappointed
Your sister feels the same

and now the neighbors are talking
eyes down underneath their breathe
your mother I swear you've done this
She says she's got nothing left

Why can't you just be normal
Another link in the chain
I pull you away like your father
Not likely were not the same
