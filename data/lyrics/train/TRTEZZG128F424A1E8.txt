Each and everyone a shout hip hip hooray
Survival is the program now,
Jah must come my way
Now you might a wonder why I feef so merry
But I fe me country and me feel irie
So we ha fe dance a yard before we dance abroad
Naw follow foolish people talk 'bout times so hard '
No bother fret no time to skylark
Who laugh last said a him have de laugh
Every thing have it's season
Each and every thing have it's time
Production is the key to survival, universally
