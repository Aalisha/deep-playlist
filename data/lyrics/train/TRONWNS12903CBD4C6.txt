Fan Tan, Fan Tan, Tan Tan

Cruisin' Sunset's quite a trip
Whiskey's magic for the hip
But a strange thing I did find
Leaving trails of rainbow wrappers behind
I couldn't get her from my mind

Fan Tan in my I hand
You understand I do prefer
Once you try it you will find
The original perfume flavor

Fan Tan, Fan Tan, Fan Tan
