You got to leave me now, you got to go alone
You got to chase the dream, one that's all your own
Before it slips away

When you're flyin' high, take my heart along
I'll be the harmony to every lonely song
That you learn to play

When you're soarin' through the air, I'll be your solid ground
Take every chance you dare, I'll still be there
When you come back down, when you come back down

I'll keep lookin' up, awaitin' your return
...
