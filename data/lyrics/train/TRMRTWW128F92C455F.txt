Grown up
She just turned 16
Stuck in the moment
Dead at the scene
And it's on tonight
This is the life that you wanted, right?
So turn off all the lights
Dressed up just like a movie star
At all the parties
They'll know who you are
Wouldn't it be great
To be fashionably late?
So why don't you wait
Till you're sedated

Don't it feel like something's not right in his kiss tonight?

Yeah what I'm saying is do you
Do you want to lose it all?
Cause this is more than just a dance hall drug
You can't wait to fall in love
All I'm saying is do you
Do you want to learn to fly?
Then you should pack it up and say goodbye
