The biggest lie I ever told was when I said
"I don't love you no more"
The biggest fake you'll ever know
Sometimes I feel it's everything I don't show

And I'm always thinking 'bout relationships
Wanna let the rhythm flow and feel the bassline slip.
Leaving all that fussing and a fighting to them crazy, crazy fools.
But it's time I told you something I think you should know.
All about why I ran away and why I let this go.
Guess I got tired of always feeling like my heart just broke.
