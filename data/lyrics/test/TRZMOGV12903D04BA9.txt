Everyone knows she's a ramblin' rose
she's a beauty growin' wild!
Birds in their nest seem to whistle their best
for mother nature's favourite child!

She's got the kind of affection
that just winds around your heart!
You better run for protection
or she might upset your flower cart!

I hate to disclose that ma ramblin' rose
is gonna meet her Waterloo!
I let her play but she can't get away
...
