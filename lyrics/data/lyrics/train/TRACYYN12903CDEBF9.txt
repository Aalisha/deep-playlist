All trees are oaks
And all birds are blue
In the mountains of a magnet 
Are the mountains of you

I'm proud of my genius just like a painter 
and dumb like a poet I think I can, I think I can
Just say it, From the throats, From the throats of our wrists
With full sets of teeth, Vanilla almond teeth
From vanilla almond tea 
Spent afternoons, Spent afternoons, Measuring time in spoons

Where forget-me-nots and marigolds and other things
That don't get old, Just don't get old
But between one June and September you're all I rememember
But I'm a lantern, my head a moon
