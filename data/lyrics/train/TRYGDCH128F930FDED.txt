I... I got somethin' baby on my mind
It's tearin' me up inside
and i got to let loose tonight baby now
I know you, can see what im goin through
everybody telling me what to do,
well i need somebody to talk to
well im different i can feel the changes
but i cant turn back the pages
and our hearts are all we have to save us
come on save me tonight
we're gonna ride the night away
yeah babe we're gonna ride the night away
well there aint no time left to borrow
I guess i'll have to think about it tomorrow
