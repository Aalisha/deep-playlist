Forced to kill without a cause
Into death's cold gaping jaws
The code is red, missiles fly
Shot out of the sky
Savage tribes locked in the past
Die where you stand, asphyxiating gas
Hostiles surround, soon to be dead
When dread command comes
It leaves with your head

Left here to die you're alone
...
