My friend's a computer hacker
But in school everybody said he was a slacker
He writes science fiction novels
He builds whole towns and villages from cola bottles

He does equations just for fun
Eats low carb ice cream with his Mum
Sews Cub Scout badges on his sweater

He's just a feeling you ignore
A dumb computer hacker
Trash can on the floor
A pitiful disaster
Cried to sleep at night
When he never got it right
Cos he never realised
It doesn't even matter
Later on in life
He's drowning in his laughter
Three kids and a wife
He's happy ever after
Stoked to be alive
With his dream job up at Nasa
Loving everyday
Well, I guess it really pays to be a slacker

He stays up all night playing Tetris
Asteroids, Pacman written on his 'games to get' list
