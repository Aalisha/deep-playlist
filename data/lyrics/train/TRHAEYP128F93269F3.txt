I've made it, my dear face it,
I still kiss the darkness
What I've wasted, I still taste it,
I'm sickened and hardened
I'm gonna tear, I'm gonna tear your walls down
I'm gonna tear, I'm gonna tear your walls down

I stole into your hideout

I walked with you, I talked with you,
I still can't help thinking
...
