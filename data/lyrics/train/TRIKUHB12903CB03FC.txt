This is all
Closure draws near
It's become your worst and darkest fear
Armada - Beast of many heads

Marching trails of shadows from the black
A call to power
A call to arms
Come death - open the mouth of Hell

The nameless
The wings
The crown
The flame

The serpent
Of war
Of sin
Of hate
Crowned king of the dead

Warlust burns in your heart
Vengeful wrath
Burning the sign
...
