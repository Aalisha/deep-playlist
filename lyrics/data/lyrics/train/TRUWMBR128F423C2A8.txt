I wanna know what you're doing to me
I wanna know what are you doing, baby
'Cause you give me the feeling tonight
That I wanna, wanna hold you so tight
Give me love, give me passion, baby
I'm giving you everything that you need
I could do anything for you, ma'
I'd move to Africa
Me a go a tell it right
Di gal is dynamite
Me wanna take a bite
