It was always the world that I was crushed beneath
Scraping concrete with my teeth till it bleeds
All I ever asked though it all was
Please tell me that nothings wrong
Lost in my sickness
This is not a phase
On the top of a burning house daring the roof to cave
Its funny because coming from me
That
Doesnâ€™t
Even
Seem
Insane
No one will ever come for me
No one will ever come for me
No one will ever come for me
No one will ever come for me
Sometimes I leave the house early
Just to ride the subway all day
