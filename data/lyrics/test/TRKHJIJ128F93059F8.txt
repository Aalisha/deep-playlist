I wrote my mother, I wrote my father
And now I'm writing you too

I'm sure of mother, I'm sure of father
And now I want to be sure, very, very sure of you

Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no

Don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me
Till I come marching home
Don't go walking down lovers' lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me, no, no, no
Don't go walking down lovers' lane with anyone else but me
