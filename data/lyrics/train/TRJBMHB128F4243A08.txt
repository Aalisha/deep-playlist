You, you leave me wanting more
Leave me waiting at the door
You leave alot to be desired

You, leave alot of things unsaid
Sometimes I say them in my head
You leave alot to be desired

You never make me eggs in the morning
We never do it on the floor
You never tell me how good I'm looking
You don't bring me flowers anymore.

You, leave alot to be desired
But I still desire you (I still desire you)
