Ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh-ooh-
Ooh-ooh-oh-ooh-
Ooh, yeah, baby
Whoa-whoa-oh-oh-
Mmm-

Now I-m the kinda guy who don't believe
That chivalry is dead, no
'Cause I believe a woman should be treated
With the utmost respect, mmm-hmm-

Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away
I wanna get to know ya, well
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame
Just come and look me over

You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for
How could anybody ask for much more, woo-hoo-

Now I like openin' doors
Pickin' up [Yeah] her hanky [Yeah] off the floor
Treat her like a lady [Treat her like lady]
Light her cigarette if she smokes
Even [Help her with her coat], well
Treat her like a lady [Treat her like lady]

In this world of liberation
It's so easy to forget, mmm-
That it's so nice to have a man around
...
