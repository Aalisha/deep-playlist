Do you still feel something
When you hold me thight?
I got a leeling that you don´t
Will the flames be burning
Through our darkst night?
I got a feeling that it won´t

Bittersweet as a potion
Full of fading memories
Bittersweet as the kisses from your lips
I can taste the agony

What about love?
What about the love we used to know?
What about love?
