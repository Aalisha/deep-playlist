Cut off for the exits realize you have nothing left
I wish I knew how to say I need more time to run away.
We've got nothing to talk about
You keep trying but I'm shooting you down
Aren't you sick of driving me round
Out to the hills a long way from the town
I make no effort in learning to drive
Because I want so much to stay alive [3x]

Can you stay, I'm crying
