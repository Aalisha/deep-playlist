Hey, hey now
Don't you want to come down
Bring your guitar
Here we play music with our own sound
A lot of our friendship
And music's been born and bred
Right here in our backyard
At the pickin' shed

I remember the first time I walked through the door
I felt at home, though I'd never been in there before
The band was playing and I sang a few songs
I got to admit, I been hooked from then on

Hey, hey now
Don't you want to come down
Bring your guitar
