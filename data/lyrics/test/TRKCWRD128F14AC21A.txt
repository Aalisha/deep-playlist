Oh there's a pick-up truck that's rusting in the yard
And a barkin' dog out front like he's on guard
Well, the birds are singin' in the trees
Ain't nothing like the summer breeze
A hot wind is blowing through the trailer park

Well, just a mile further ain't that far
Well, Main street looks like an old postcard
Won't you check the aisle, take the dollar gas
And watch the convicts pick up trash
Livin' on the land of the brave and free

Georgia, Carolina and Tennessee
Here's the place you really just gotta be
Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi
From Texarkana down to Panama City
