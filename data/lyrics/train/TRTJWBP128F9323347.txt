I hate to break it to you
But this convenience ain't convenient anymore
Now I realize I had different eyes
Back when I thought this was a good thing

Here I am my anger and me
Temper makes it hard to see
This situation I'm in again
Everything must come to an end now

There's some things that I wanna do
And I don't wanna lie to you
But it still makes me go
And do the things I know
All wrong
