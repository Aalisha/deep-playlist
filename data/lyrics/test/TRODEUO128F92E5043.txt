It all comes back to me
Face to the floor
Heart in my mouth
My forehead hits the pavement
Again - numb - again
Sharing this humility
A circle of humanity
Momentarily black in me
Immomentarily black
So black
Memory leave me be
Close that eye leave love blind
When outcome is preceded
By an outlet that is needed
We forget all but the circle
As soon as the ends have met
As soon as the ends have met
I scratch the surface and see
Someone better than me
Where did I suffer that loss?
What was taken from me?
As you walk through the ashes
Remember my name
As you walk through the ashes
As you walk through the ashes
Remember the time
This blood proves me right
In that the last move is all that
Counts if the beasts must bite
...
