(Go home... this is the Minneapolis police...
the party's over...
if you all just grab your stuff and leave there won't be any hassle...
the party's been closed... etc.)

1, 2, 3, 4

Kids won't listen
To what you're sayin'
Kids ain't wondering
Kids ain't praying
Mo says he's worried
He says talk away
He says yeah I've been cured

I need some attention
No house of detention
I'd love some attention
Don't start again
