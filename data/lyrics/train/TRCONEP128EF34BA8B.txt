I went off to the doctors for the open plan surgery,
He said I just can't believe what's lying here in front of me,
It looks like what you couldn't drink you'd just have to smoke,
You've been living in a frying pan, what you need is health.
So I burgled a few houses took the candy from the baby,
In search of the prescription that was driving me crazy,
The policeman turned the corner looking down at me,
The judge said I hope to God that you're sorry.

You need help, that's what you need,
You need help, can't get it from me,
You need help, something you got or you ain't,
...
