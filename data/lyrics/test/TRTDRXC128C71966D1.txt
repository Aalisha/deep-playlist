Say you wanna be loved
But you won't let me love you
Say you want someone to trust in you, baby
Can't you see that's what I'm tryin' to do?

I know you've been hurt before
And you're afraid to try love once more

Without love by your side
You're only half alive
'Cause everybody needs love, oh, yeah
Everybody needs love

Say you wanna be kissed
But you won't let me kiss you
Say you wanna be missed
...
