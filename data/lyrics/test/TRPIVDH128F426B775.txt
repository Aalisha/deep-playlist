So you were born in an electrical storm
took a bite out the sun
saw your future in a machine built for two
now your rays, make me kind of go crazy, shocked and awe and amaze me
just a ticker tape parade and me
but something was wrong
till you tap danced on the air in the night screaming at the top of your lungs, you said
Come on, come on
Do what you want
What could go wrong?
Oh come on come on come on, come on, do what you want
Oh come on come on
What could go wrong? Do do do do what you want
Come on
