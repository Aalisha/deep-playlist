Make your escape
You're my own papillon
The world turns too fast
Feel love before it's gone

It kicks like a sleep twitch
My papillon
Feel love when it's shone

It kicks like a sleep twitch

Darling
Just don't put down your guns yet
If there really was a God here
He'd have raised a hand by now
Now darling
You're born, get old, then die here
Well that's quite enough for me
We'll find our own way home somehow
