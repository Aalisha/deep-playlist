Living in a house of cards
Praying the wind doesn't blow too hard
Giving in to differences
Straining to keep up appearances
Making believe the thread can be saved
You're aching to leave but deathly afraid of letting go
The threads entangled you so
Jealousies and legal fees
Running away like two refugees
