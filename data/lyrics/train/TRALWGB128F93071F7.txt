NEXT

"Imagine That"

Dream...
Imagine...
Close your eyes...

Ooh...(yah)
Ooh...(Next)
Ooh...(Divine Mill...2K3)

Ooh... (Tweet)
Ooh... (R.L.)
Ooh... (And T-Low)

Now I might not have
5 or 6 cars in my garage
But would you settle for a nice massage
And the love of a lifetime
Girl...
I swear to God that
With a whole lot of love
And little bit of faith
That we can make it
You just gotta believe that...

We could roll till the wheels fall off (And)
I'mma love you till my soul's gone on ('Cause)
It can happen, baby, just hold on
Close your eyes and dream (And imagine that)

Imagine that smile ever leavin' your face
Comin' home from work and never leavin' the place
Got chocolates and champagne just for you to taste
(Close your eyes)
Close your eyes, girl, imagine that
