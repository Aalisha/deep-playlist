Watch the time, wait for me
Patience is reality
I don't know how it feels

No, I can't see with your foot in my face
Your foot in my face, your foot in my face
Your foot in my face

No, I don't know how it feels
I can't decide

I can't see with your nose in my business
Your ass in my space
Your life as my problem
Your foot in my face

I won't, I can't, I'm lost, I'm a freak
I won't, I can't, I'm lost, I'm a freak
...
