When all you want to do is rock,
But you don't want to bear the sock no more,
When it's just sweat that fills your eyes,
Belated feelings that you have denied.

When every wolf is at your door,
Just like a hundred times before,
But you don't want to leave the end.

Cause you were amazing,
And we did amazing things,
And I wouldn't change it,
Cause we were amazing things.
