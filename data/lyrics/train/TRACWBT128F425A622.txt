From behind these walls
I hear your song
Oh, sweet words
The music that you play
Lights up my world
The sweetest that I've heard
Could it be
That I've been touched and turned
Oh Lord, please finally
Finally things are changing

This land is mine but I'll let you rule
I let you navigate and demand
Just as long as you know this land is mine
So find your home and settle in
...
