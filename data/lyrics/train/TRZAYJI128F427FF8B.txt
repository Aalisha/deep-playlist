It's 50 miles from Leaky down to Hondo
No straight shot the roads all twist and turn
Another 45 on in to San Antone
Seems a long way to go for just one girl

He pulls up Monday morning
puts his window down
Grins and tells me to breathe in deep
Her perfume still lingers from their last date
Says he's late for work
leaves me standing in the street

He's taken to wearing starched shirts
and his boots stay shined
He keeps that old truck neat as a pin
Her picture gazes down from his visor
...
