Ooh nobley born
Let the mind be not distracted
Though the road ahead is hard and long
And the journey seems about ending
Oh that which thou art
Let thy gaze be not deflected
Fix thy attention on the goal
And the light that shines so celestial

Onward ever ever on Destination Eschaton
Nowhere to hide nowhere to run
From Alpha into Omega
Onward ever ever on Destination Eschaton
Nowhere to hide nowhere to run
From Alpha into Omega

Pilgrim, take heart
There's a strange attraction giving strong acceleration
See the light, enter the light, become the light and shine
