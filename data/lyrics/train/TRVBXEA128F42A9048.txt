You got God if you paid for it
You got sex if you prayed for it
And those ever elusive weapons of mass destruction

You got Jesus with the palest skin
You had Lennon but you wasted him
I got sleeping pills that'll make you wanna call your mama

Everyone's keeping their love far away
Everyone's keeping their love far away
Keeping their love far away
Everyone's keeping their love far away

You got phones with 3D eyes
