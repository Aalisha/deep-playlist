This Blood

Violently they grabbed his arms,
As they tightly strapped each wrist,
With a hellish look stood a strong armed soldier,
Whip clenched in his fist,
Laced with chips of bone they beat him hard,
From his shoulders to his feet,
And it sliced right through his olive skin,
Just like razors through a sheet,

Countless times the blood splattered,
As each in-human lash was given,
Several times his knees gave way,
As his flesh just hung like rivets

And surprisingly he turned his head,
Though the words he used were few,
The soldiers face turned pale,
When he said "This blood is for you",

Uncaringly they tossed a garment,
Across his weakened form,
And his blood pressure fell deathly low,
As the crowds began to swarm,
They forced him to carry his cross up-hill,
As his face they punched and smacked
All the splinters from the criss crossed beam dug deep into his back
Through lack of sleep and dehydration,
His tongue began to swell,
