Once upon a long ago
Someone touched my heart and soul, my life
You and I were meant to be
Was I just too blind to see the light in your eyes

Long lost friend
So good finding you again
I curse the fool I've been
For drifting away from you

Though I lost my way
You've been strong enough to stay
Faithful to the end
