Come son, take hold of my hand now
Come daughter, jump into my arms
Come sweet darling wife, move quickly I'll keep us from harm
Well, the water from the sky, it is coming
And it's rising each minute of the day
And soon our dear home and our pleasures will be washed away

Chorus:
There's a new horizon and it's coming my son
Coming soon but I don't know when
When the sky will dry up and stop all this raging
When we'll be coming back again
The sun is trying to start shining
