There is no good reason
I should have to be so alone
I'm smothered by this emptiness
Lord, I wish I was made of stone

Like a fool I lent my soul to love
And it paid me back in change
God help me
Am I the only one who's ever felt this way?

A heart that's worn and weathered
Would know better than to fight
...
