If we meet by chance today, pretend that you don't see me
I love you, but if she knew I know she'd never free me
Long as I am tied to her we care not for the danger
So be discreet and meet me later, daylight stranger

She believes that I go out on real important business
 (Daylight stranger)
She's so right 'cause every night I taste your tender kisses
 (Daylight stranger)
That's what happens when a home is filled with pain and anger
