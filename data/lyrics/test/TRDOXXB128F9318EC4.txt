I still get that feelin' I felt when I fell in love with my baby
Every time he makes me smile
I still see the beautiful in your favorite song on the radio
Turn it up and here we go
Look at everythin' we have and baby, it ain't so bad

Today everythin' is sunny side up
I'm hangin' on to happy and pushin' my luck
You're lookin' at a girl who's lookin' at the world
And no matter what sunny side up, sunny side up
...
