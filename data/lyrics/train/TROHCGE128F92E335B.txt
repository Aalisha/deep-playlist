{[Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible]
Ya ya
[Incomprehensible]}

I said, "Hey there buddy"
Slow down for me
I'm friendly and I'm clean
I will not rob you or cause you misery
Your wheels sound good to me
I ain't green with travel
As you can see
I only got one bag
If I am trouble drop me off in Abilene
I'll pay my gasoline
