I sit and stare upon my trembling hand,
as it starts to move once again
Still I wonder why, is this all a lie,
what does this all mean?
Midnight the board awaits in a circle on the floor
Many sins held within, many pleasures to behold
Life's, Hell, Birth, Death Cast before my eyes
Spirits spelling out my fate
in a world that doesn't lie
It's like being crucified
No priest speaks my last rights
...
