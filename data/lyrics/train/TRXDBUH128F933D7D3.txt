I've been walking up and down this road
Missing something, searching high and low
Grabbing anything I could hold
Holding tight and never letting go
Taking too much of everything I wanted
Got me thinking about what I really need
The only thing I'm taking when I'm leaving
Is something to believe in

What good is a heart not loving
What good are those arms not hugging
What good is that smile you're smiling
Till you give it to somebody
Take a look at that life you're living
All you're got and all you've been given
What good is all the good you're getting
Till you give it to somebody
Whoa whoa whoa
