Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.

So use it and prove it,
Remove this whirling sadness,
I'm losing, I'm bluesing,
But you can save me from madness.

Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me,
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile,
And you use it only for me.

So save me I'm waiting,
I'm needing, hear me pleading,
And soothe me, improve me,
...
