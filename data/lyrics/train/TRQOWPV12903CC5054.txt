This is a war
So you've gotta stay strong and rise above
And lever let the mother fuckers tear you away from what you love
Gotta fight back and reclaim what's truly yours
Take revenge on the world and declare your fucking war
Your war
Stay
Stay gold
Stay true to yourself and your friends and never let go

You want a piece of my fucking time?
Well back up and back off
Get in back of the line
