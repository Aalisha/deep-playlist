Panic on the streets of london
panic on the streets of birmingham
i wonder to myself
could life ever be sane again?
the leeds side-streets that you slip down
i wonder to myself
hopes may rise on the grasmere
but honey pie, you're not safe here
so you run down
to the safety of the town
but there's panic on the streets of carlisle
dublin, dundee, humberside
...
