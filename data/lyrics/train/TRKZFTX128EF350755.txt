I heard the news, they told me on a Sunday
Opened my eyes, the skies they turned to grey
I count the years, the roll so slowly by me
Wish I could see you again

Ohhh it's so lonely, there
Ohhh it's so lonely

When I was young my daddy always taught me
To speak the truth and never tell lies
Now that I'm old and no one ever told me
The life you live, the truth you can disguise

Ohhh it's so lonely, there
Ohhh it's so lonely

I always looked but never found a trace
I always saw a smile without a face
