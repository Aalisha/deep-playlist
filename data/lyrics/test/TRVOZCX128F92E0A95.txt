How could we say it’s over
When it’s not over (baby)
How could you hold me in your arms
And say you won’t miss me when I’m gone

Chorus
I don’t wanna talk about it
I don’t wanna think about it
I don’t wanna dream about it
I don’t wanna cry about it
Without you in my life I would be so lonely
Without you in my arms I would feel so empty
Without you in my life

What can I say?
Tell me what more can I do
You know I … you know I … I love you
