Stop or go
I'm so confused I don't know what to do
Cos everybody looks at me and you
I think theres something we're supposed to do
But I'm not sure

And I will go
If you don't let me in
Is that where we begin?
Is that where we begin?

Stop or go, again
I think I've been here once before
Theres people hanging round outside the door
Doing things we're trying to ignore
But I don't care

Cos I will go
If you don't let me in
