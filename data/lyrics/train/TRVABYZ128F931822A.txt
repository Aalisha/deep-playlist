I have to get away
Out of this place where I became the type
Who sits and laughs at everyone who judges me

It's so damn dark in here, I can't see in front of me
My flames have all burnt out my hopes no part of my reality
There's no escaping fear, I can't breathe, I'm struggling
My flames have all burnt out my hopes no part of my reality

There's something pulling me in the wrong direction

My confessions aren't at rest they can't get by
Oh no, 'cause these are deadly weapons, deadly weapons
Why must this perception take my breath? I can't get by
Oh no, 'cause these are deadly weapons, deadly weapons

With no direction to go, will my feet carry me?
To where I need to go to find myself the perfect remedy
Can I bare all of the weight of my mistakes?
