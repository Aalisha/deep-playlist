Do you believe what some might say
Can't be could be reality
Let seven be the one for me, six chapters
Of life laced with mystery

Awaiting discovery

Immune you become
A war to be won
The soul of a voice
Let the voice of the soul be free

For most it does not come easily
For some it comes with pain
From a thought to a living sight
For some it's a life, for some a game
