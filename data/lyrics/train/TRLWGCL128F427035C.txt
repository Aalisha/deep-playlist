If you want a woman to treat you good,
If you want to be understood,
Here I am
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah

If you want a woman to treat you right,
Love you both day and night,
Here I am

Oh, oh, oh, ohhhhh
Just look over your shoulder
And darling, reach out for me [Hey]
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhhh
All you got to do is call my name
...
