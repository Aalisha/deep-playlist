It's cold outside, the night love died
On the night you murdered love
It's cold outside, the night love died
On the night you murdered love

From an early age
I was taught to respect
That a broken heart, girl
Ain? t a thing you collect

Close your eyes and say
Nothing lasts a day
You? re wasting my time
Yet I love to love you

Close your eyes and say
Honor love obey
You? re wasting my time
Yet I love to love you

It's cold outside, the night love died
On the night you murdered love
It's cold outside, the night love died
On the night you murdered love

January, February
