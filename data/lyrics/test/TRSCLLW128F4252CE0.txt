Diesel
back to rap to y'all
unloading
a lot off my chest
no sense in
holding
onto it, ya know?
Keep it rolling
while some walk around like
"gimme you owe me"
Not kidding
I mean totally
lost in self denial
full of bologna
So mean
always mad and loathing
everything surrounding
Just sucking
everybody energy up like
protein
Gossiping
lots of them don't even know me
posing, fraudulating
whole scenes
for the viewing pleasure
of those with
no things
to occupy themselves
and keep 'em growing
but y'all know me
I see no need
to stifle your thing
especially if we homies
but if that's the way it's gonna be
so be it
No grievance
I don't fear my soul
