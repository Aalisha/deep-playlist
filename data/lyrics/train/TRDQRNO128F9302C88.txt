You better check this
Plan up your family, ha-high, me say
Plan up your family, ha-high
Plan up your family, ha-high, me say
Plan up your family, ha-high
Yeah, this one's dedicated to the girl you see
And all bwoy big D, livin' in the city, I sing
Plan up your family, ha-high, me say
Plan up your family, ha-high
Uhh
Sex is part one but every story has a sequel
(Try)
Not to live with your parents now people
Let part two be planned by you, not fake
(Why?)
'Cu your baby you'll start to hate
(Cry)
Like if you can't afford a sausage
You on edge, baby cries, you throw him in the garbage
You know the stories that you hear in the news
Babies being killed, infants being abused
(Right)
Do people life they live like a movie
Yellin', 'Do me, do me', too much loose booty
They wanna be Blowfish like Hootie
(Chill)
Premature pregnancy is ill
You never hear the other side of the story
(Like)
Like what happens after you hit the shorty
