Glad bluebird of happiness

C E
I was walking down the road, not caring much where I was going
d G C
A heavy pack upon my back, burly good with inner sad of lonliness
C E
When fluttered by this bird of blue, he said I'll tell you what I 'll do
d G G7>>
Since you seem to be so sad, I will try and be your glad.
C
bluebird of happiness

F C
And he goes flying, far over the ocean blue,
G C
bound for places, I am not known to.
