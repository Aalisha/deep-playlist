Microphone check
Microphone check

Can I get a check up from the neck up
Can I kick a rhyme
While I'm checkin my time
Can I get a cure
Cause you did da crime
For sure
You're

Probably killin me
Wit these shots

Tell me what I got
And I'm gone

Pandemic
Who did it
Right who did it
That's who did it

WHO/World Health Organized
Murderized

Came to the aid got paid

Doctor doctor in a lab
Concocted a germ warfare to the botty
I rocked it

105 million goin down
In da ground

Most in da black an da brown
Ow!

How did I catch this riddle
If I didn't crossover
Like a Hardaway dribble
