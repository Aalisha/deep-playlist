Just for spite every day every night you still wonder you wonder
From the ashes I rise by the roll of the dice you'll go under go under
You never realized I'm back here to stay like a fungus that grows on your side
You never realized I won't go away not tonight
I'll never leave you lonely I'll be there tryin' to grab a hold yeah 
I'm not the nicest guy you know
You'll never leave me darling now hear my tender warning 
...
