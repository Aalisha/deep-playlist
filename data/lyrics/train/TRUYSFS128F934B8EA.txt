through black and blue, through thick and thin
it takes much more to break this skin
looks like we've finally made it
this time we finally made it

we've had our backs against the wall
and all you've said we've proven wrong
looks like we've finally made it
this time we finally made it

we give and we take, we bend and we break
but that's just the life that we've chosen
this sinking ship will not be abandoned

we're under the radar, we're under the rug
but that's just the way that we've broken
fall in line to get what you've needed
out of time, so take it or leave it now

through black and blue, through thick and thin
it takes much more to break this skin
looks like we've finally made it
this time we finally made it

we've had our backs against the wall
...
