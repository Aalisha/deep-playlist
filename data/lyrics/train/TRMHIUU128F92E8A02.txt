Am I allowed, to look at her like that?
Could it be wrong, when she's just so nice to look at?

She smells like lemongrass and sleep
She tastes like apple juice and peach
You would find her, in a Polaroid picture
And she, means everything to me

I'd never tell
No, I'd never say a word
And oh it aches
...
