Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me
Don't be afraid to try the newest sport around
Bust your buns, bust your buns now
It's catchin' on in every city and town

You can do the tricks the surfers do, just try a
"Quasimodo" or "The Coffin" too, why don't you?
Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me

You'll probably wipeout when you first try to shoot the curve
Bust your buns, bust your buns now
Takin' gas in a bush takes a lotta nerve
...
