And do you ever feel like you're alone?
And do you ever wish to be unknown?
I can say I have
I can say I have
And do you ever feel things here aren't right?
And do you ever feel the time slip by?
And I can say I have
And I can say I have

So hear this please
And watch as your heart speeds up endlessly
And look for the stars as the sun goes down
Each breath that you take has a thunderous sound
Everything, everything's magic
Just sit back and hold on, but hold on tight
Prepare for the best and the fastest ride
...
