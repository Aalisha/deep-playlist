I remember all those nights I used to stay at home
On the phone, all night long
Used to talk about the things we really wanna do
I believed in you

I remember how you used to say
Have no fear, it'll be Okay
When you told me anything you want is possible
We could have it all

I believed in you,
Must have been a fool,
All my dreams were with you

I say, it's OK
I can promise you it's all right
You ain't keeping me up all night, no more
You're not here but

It's OK
I assure you babe it's all right
You ain't keeping me up all night, no more
You're not here but it's OK

Well now you got to where you wanted like I knew you would
