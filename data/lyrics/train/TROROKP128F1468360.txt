From the distance I can hear the troops marching in again, a slightly different look, but the 
 goal's the same. The evil ghosts from our not so distant past are back, but no one ever 
 stopped them and no one sent them back. It's like we never ever learned anything at all, we 
 saw them rise again at all, if we don't wanna see them rise again at all and we don't wanna 
 see them rise again at all... 
 
 Fascism sucks!
