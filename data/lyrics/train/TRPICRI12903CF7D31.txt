I need love, the kind I've never known before
You need it too, the kind that makes you feel so good, baby
I want to give, give you all the love you need
Well, I'm a loner, and that's the way I want to be, yeah

Let me say as the sun climbs across the sky above
So your smile filled me with a stronger love
Just as you and I, watchin' the morning sky, oh yeah
Somehow I know it's time for me to say goodbye, yeah, yeah

Here's why: can't make a deal with the preacher, oh yeah, yeah
And I can't make a bargain in heaven, now
