violence on t.v., violence on the news
reality and fiction both served up neatly to keep us all amused
reality and fiction have both become the same
instead of facing the facts we search for new scapegoats to blame

the time has come to stop sitting back
to say "no, we've taken enough of this crap
violence isn't acceptable in any form
so let's work together to make peace the norm"

the blame lies not within the system
the blame lies not with the state
the blame lies not within religion
we've all learned to love to hate
