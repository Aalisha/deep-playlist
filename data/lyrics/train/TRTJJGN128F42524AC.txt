Are you still lost tonight
Living but dead inside
This is a proclamation
This is a call to rise

Are you abused, alone?
Walking with broken bones
If you feel you've been forgotten
Let this song guide you home

We are the disillusioned
We've been left wanting more
Before every aspiration
Hits the floor

Hold on for your life
All we feel is so
Far from alive
The damned are done believing
And the cursed can dream no more
So hold on for your life
Because only the strong survive
...
