Mmm, yeah
When I was just a baby, mama sat me on her knee
She told me "Boy you listen there's a lot you oughta see
A lot of pretty women, gonna try and tie you down
You don't know what you're missin' if you never look around"

Move on, that's what she told me
Move on, mmm yeah
Move on, whoo oh, oh
Move on, I'm leavin' on my way

Told you that forever was a word I couldn't say
I don't know 'bout tomorrow 'cause I'm livin' for today
You're every inch a lady and you'll always have my love
