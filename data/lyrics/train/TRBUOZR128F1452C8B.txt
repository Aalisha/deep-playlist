Hey yeah yeah

I was walking down the street
(Do-wah do-wah)
When this boy started following me
(Oh yeah)
Now I ignored all the things he said
(Do-wah do-wah)
He moved me in every way

With his collar unbuttononed
On my side he was struttin'

He was really saying something
(Saying something)
Really saying something
(Saying something)
Bop bop shoo be do-wah
