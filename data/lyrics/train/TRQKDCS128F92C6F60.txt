I love you, baby, 1000 times

Remember love notes
The teacher found in school
The whole class laughing
Gee, I felt just like a fool

Here comes the very funny, funny line
I had to write it a 1000 times

That I love you, love you
(Love you, I love you)
I love you, I love you
(Love you, I love you)
Girl, I love you, I love you 1000 times
(Love you, I love you)
