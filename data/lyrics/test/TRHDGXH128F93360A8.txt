(instrumental)
Come on, baby
(Ooo bump, bump)
Let's do the twist
(Ooo bump, bump)
Come on, baby
(Ooo bump, bump)
Let's do the twist
(Ooo, bump, bump)
Take me by my lil' ol' hand, now
(Ooo, na-na-na-now)
And go like this
Ee-yeah, twist
(Round an around an around an around)
Baby, baby twist
(Round an around an around an around)
Ooo, just
(Round an around an around an around)
Just like this
(Round an around an around an around)
Come on little miss
(Ooo, bump)
And do the twist
(Round an round an round an round)
My daddy is sleeping
And mama ain't around
Ooh, daddy's just sleeping
