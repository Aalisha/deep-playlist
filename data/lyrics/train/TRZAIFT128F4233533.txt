I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you
Whether it is right or it's wrong
I'm too weak to be strong
I'm so in love with you

Well you say you need something
to help you when you're down,
to take your fears away.
Yeah, you say you'd do anything
to keep your feet off the ground
and help you on your way, yeah.
You're all that I need
Yeah, you are all that I need

I'm so in love with you
...
