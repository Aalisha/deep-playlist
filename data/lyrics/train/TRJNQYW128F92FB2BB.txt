Fire clouds pass through a snow filled night
Reflecting frames eyes of diamond shine
Standing alone you feel the shiver cold
Naked and stoned in frozen winds of sorrow

You take every breath
It burns your heart dead
You drain your life now
Silent death renown

Laugh while you may now
Who are you with
Dance while you may now
...
