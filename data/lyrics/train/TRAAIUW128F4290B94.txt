These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days, you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claimin' Dogg Pound

These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days, you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claimin' Dogg Pound

I believe I got good skills
We been makin' music since we were kids
That's all I wanna do for life
Keepin' it real until the day I die

Obstacles get in my way
Continue to mash and don't forget to pray
I keep my hand on my steel
Because I love my life and I always will

Whatever people say to me
I take it in stride, I'm thinkin', 'Negro Please'
If you really don't know me
Then you best pack up, I suggest strongly

Yes sir, this is DPG, 'til the day I D-I-E
For my L-I-F and E
No matter where I look that's all I see
And I know

These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days, you gotta be down
Who said it was easy claimin' Dogg Pound

These days, you gotta be strapped
I'm already knowin' ain't nobody got my back
These days, you gotta be down
