Hey I'm suffocating
No need for anticipating
My deepest sight is turned off
Without a light
Depression gives me
The permission to live my life
Without a fight

Alienating from you, my friend
We'll be separated 'til the end
Until the end
Attain new things and seek new trend
My heart inside, I'm trying to mend

A hollowgram in fashion
With deceiving quicksand
...
