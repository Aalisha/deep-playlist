Gonna be someone, gonna give something,
I'm taking it on, i'm taking it on,
It's gonna be my life, so i'm gonna live each day and each night,
Taking it on, i'm taking it on

'cause i can't keep hiding, i can't keep hiding, i can't keep running away
So i'm gonna be stronger, i'm gonna be better made, i'm gonna give everything,
Just to bring me back again.
