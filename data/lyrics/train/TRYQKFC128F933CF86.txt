The pit, the pit (Ohhhh my!)
Yo, 1, 2
Dun dunna dunna dun.
All ya'll mentally dead muthafuckas.
We come to break ya'll some information and ressurect you
from the mentality of fool in this.
Yo, yo.

(Rza)
We come away and chop the heads of these snakes
It's better off they dyin in a pit fulla snakes
Mistake inside your self, that be the first head you take
It's better off you dyin in a pit fulla snakes

(Rza)
The marijuana got my karma glowin
Gold armor, surround my body
I'm reachin a high state of nirvana
But wanna chop and imitate
To bite, the livin spirits
Golden livin tablets
Transmitted by the Abbot
Blood related king to King David's mighty men
I appear in the atmosphere like nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon
dioxide,
helium, xenon, argon, neon, freon, be gone
I travel beyond
The range where sick sounds grave
You can't respond
Dynamic semantics makes your mind go frantic
Hand picked Gods
