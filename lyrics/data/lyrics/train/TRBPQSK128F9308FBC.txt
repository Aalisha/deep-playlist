With you I'm brighter, my eyes like lighters
They shine inside my Parker
Up with the winds, up with the skies, up with the fears
But you know with you I'm fine, I

You and me we're just fine
1 million invisible lines
Up your head and into mine
You and me we're just fine
1 million invisible lines
Up your head and into mine
...
