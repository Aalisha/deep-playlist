Have you ever passed the corner
Of Fourth and Grand
Where a little ball of rhythm
Has a shoe shine stand

People gather round
And they clap their hands
He's a great big bundle of joy
He pops the boogie woogie rag
Chattanooga shoe shine boy

Yeah, he charges you a nickel
Just to shine one shoe
He makes the oldest kind
Of leather look like new
You feel as though you wanna dance
When he gets through
