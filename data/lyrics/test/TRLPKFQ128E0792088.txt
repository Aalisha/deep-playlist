Just sit down right here in front of me
I'll let you see
Connect your face to the fist
I'll show you what you can be

No one to hear all your cries
No one to hear you beg
Listen to me, why can't you see?
You are with me, positioned under me

Let you live
I depend on your will
Do you see what's running through me?

So I'm wrong, I'm not alone
Seems like you're scared
