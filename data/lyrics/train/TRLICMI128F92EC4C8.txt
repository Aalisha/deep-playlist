And I need some substance in this relativistic world
I need some truth in the middle of all these lies
And I need some comfort to wipe away these tears
And I need someone to tell me there's more to this life

And You are the Truth and You are the Life
And You are more than I ever dreamed
And You are the Door through which I find
You are all that I'll ever need and You are God

And I need some wisdom to choose which way to walk
