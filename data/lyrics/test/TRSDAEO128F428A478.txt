I'll carry the torch - feed off my flame
love is the hottest word for me -
it knows my name
and your spirit cuts through me
like a silent sword
and leaves it's score inside
everytime I take a chance - take it
everytime a rule to break - break it
everytime I change my mind - change it
everytime there's suicide - you know
what's on my mind
you're everywhere I try to hide
I'm threatened by your suicide
...
