Go now don't look back we've drawn the line
Move on it's no good to go back in time

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings it takes two
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Danger, in the game when the stakes are high
Branded, my heart was branded while my senses stood by

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings it takes two
...
