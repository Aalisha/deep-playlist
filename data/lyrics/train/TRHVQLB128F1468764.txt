Say it
I wanna' hear you say it
I wanna' see the laugh lines
I wanna' see your lifelines

Get set
Get set ready don't stall
Don't stall at all and your feelings
Your feeling will devide

We regurgitate the teardrops and bellyaches
And the star signs the star signs tell the lies on you

And where's your, where's your sense of gravity
If you drown, at least I saw you down
At least I saw you.

Fake it
