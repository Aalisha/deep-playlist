Tyrant,
How many decades shall thy reign last?
Deceit as the basic structure.
Kingdom of lies and decay.

Tyrant,
How many decades shall thy reign last?
Deceit as the basic structure.
After a war there is a war.

Dishonour and betrayal are nothing for him.
Sadistic means and lust to cause chaos everywhere.
His heart's cold and freezing as the frozen fields of north.
On his face emotions never can be seen.
You'll get no mercy under the reign of this man.
He rules the lands with his evil legions.
Pure force and his twisted sense of justice.
Those are the highest discipline.
Knife in the back of the people disagreeing.
