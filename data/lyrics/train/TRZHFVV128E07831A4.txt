Little girl, don't be sad, I've set your eyes on fire
Don't say I'm a liar, that I don't love you
Something has brought me down but I won't give up hope
It's hard for you to cope when I'm around you

Let the sun break through
The cracks within my room
The gray sky fades to blue
It will wash away this gloom

Alcohol, company, I need to readjust
