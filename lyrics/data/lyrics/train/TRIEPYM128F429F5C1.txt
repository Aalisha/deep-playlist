(J. Astrop)

If music be the food of love, then play on
Play on, play on
Play on, play on

If music be the food of love, then baby play on, play on
Let the heavens celebrate our love
And baby, play on, play on

To be or not to be, it doesn't matter much to me
(That's right)
Wherefore art thou my romeo, the only boy I want to know
He's mine (he's mine)

I guess I'm lucky, I lead a charmed life
