They carved the message deep within
Our broken hearts that failed to mend
Make out kids never had
A chance to be best friends

She's into math and magazines
Director's cuts and gray-cell green
Armed with an eye for contradictions
She sees completely through me

I'm fond of Twin Peaks afternoons
Inexpensive wine with cordon bleu
Armed with a plethora of insecurities
We keep each other amused

Hooray for the madness
