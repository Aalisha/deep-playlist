I'm Tired Of Waiting, You Know You Always Change Your Mind
I'm Tired Of Fighting, There's No Space That I Can Find
In My Heart, I Lay My Feelings On The Line

I Saw Your Picture And I Couldn't Believe It
I've Tried But I Can Break Free From Your Memory

All That I Wanted, To Get Out Of My Mind Was You
Such A Long Way To Heaven
I've Lost My Emotion, There's No More Devotion It's True
Such A Long Way To Heaven
Such A Long Way To You
