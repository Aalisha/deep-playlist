I see a river rollin' like a log
I wade up Green River, rollin' like a log
I wade up Green River, Lord, rollin' like a log

Think I heard the Marion whistle blow
I dreamed I heard the Marion whistle blow,
and it blew just like my baby gettin' on board

I'm goin' where the Southern cross the Dog
...
