The name's Hamlet and I've got a tale
About madness, lust and a female
Dad's a ghost and he roams the floors
Lurks at night in Elsinore

Got a pale face just like kiss paint
Normal you know this ain't
Something is rotten up in Denmark
A sick mistake

My uncle Claudius, his alibi is fishy
Suspicions of murder because he's acting hella shifty
Frailty, thy name is woman because my mom's on his D
A N I S H throne, my dad's ghost tells me

Swear, swear, swear to revenge my regicide
Claudius iced me one night, under my crown he tries to hide
So Hamlet, here's your mission, use your antic disposition
Make them think you're crazy, bring justice, fuse the fission

Meanwhile my girl Ophelia is goth as hell
Keeps a razor by her wrist, rocks out to Soft Cell
This girl's got more issues than Amy Winehouse
I'm like "Get thee to a nunnery, I'm not trying to find a spouse"

And she says, "Screw that, forget about that
I don't want to think about anything like that
Screw that, forget about that
I don't want to know about anything like that"

I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you
(Forget it though)
I've got nothing to do but hang around and get screwed up on you
