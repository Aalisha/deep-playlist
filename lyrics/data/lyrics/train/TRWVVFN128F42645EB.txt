Verse 1

It was in November when while out one night with friends
That I saw her there
She was just standing there
something in a distant stare
a faint look of despair
to her I was drawn
asked her was anything was wrong
told her my name said how you do
bouts to say you take care and it was nice to meet you
then she stopped me desperately
as if to say don't go but then she said to me

Chorus

Anywhere you wanna go just take me,
take me
