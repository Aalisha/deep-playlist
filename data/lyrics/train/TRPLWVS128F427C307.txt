Going about my mind for one girl
There's not one thing in the whole wide world
I wouldn't do for the girl next door

She's not too pretty, you know she's sweet
[Incomprehensible] knocks me off my feet
And I know she's just the girl next door

Why do you try so hard to hide your feelings?
(Oh, the girl next door)
Please tell me how it feels inside
(Oh, the girl next door)
Just let yourself go and you'll realize
It's all for real, can you tell me how?

So remember how it used to be
And now you're there holding it back on me
And I know that you're the girl next door

I told you I'd be back one day
We all grow different, you're still the same
