In Search Of Sanity
Trapped by this madness
In search of something lost to me
Life has no meaning
In a place that has no heart to bleed
Through walls of glass i stare
With a silence written in my eyes
No love or laughter
Stranger is the passion of the wise
(CHORUS)
Stand up and fight
Won't someone listen to me now
Stand up and fight
...
