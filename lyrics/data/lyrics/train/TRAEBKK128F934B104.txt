Bastards of a lying breed
You've ruled us for too long
Truth to you are lies to me
And your right is so wrong

Moral preached by immoral fucks
All I feel is despise
Lie no more you fucking cunts
You tear me up inside

Your sons die from your abuse
But you're giving us the blame
The easy path's the one you choose
That road will lead to pain
You're trying to control their mind
And strip them of free will
