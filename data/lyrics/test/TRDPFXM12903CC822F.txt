Leaden sky, a snowy lane
The dateless willows standing stripped
Weeping cry of mourning train
An angel's waiting on the crypt

Goodbye, my little child
A better world awaits you
(Goodbye...)
We've lost your shining smile
We'll always, always miss you
(Goodbye...)
Now lord is watching for a soul
That left your flesh today
Goodbye, my little child, and fly away

Callow ghost fell out of shell
...
