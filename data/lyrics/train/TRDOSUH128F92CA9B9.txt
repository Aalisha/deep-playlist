The future's on it's way, the past is gone
Old and rusted, with your busted bones
Break the crystal ball, you're on your own
Wipe away the fear of the unknown

Now, here we go, on with the show
Makin' our way, just living for today
It's in my sight, and the time is right
For takin' a bow, into the now
