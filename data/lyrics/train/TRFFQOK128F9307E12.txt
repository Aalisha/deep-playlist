She works for the weekend
Mixtape of her favorite bands
Turning up the radio
Lost in the stereo, sound

She's trouble in a tank top
Pretty little time bomb
Blowin' up
Take you down

Living in the radio
Lost in stereo, sound
She's dancing alone
I'm ready to go but she's so
(Lost in stereo, lost in stereo)

She's outta control, so beautiful
(In stereo, lost in stereo)
And I've been
Waiting
For so long

But she'll never know
I'm losing hope
'Cause she's so
(Lost in stereo)

(Lost in stereo)
(Lost in stereo)
(Lost in stereo)

Shake down on a Saturday
Sit back gotta catch my breath
