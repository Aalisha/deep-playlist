You can do what you want just seize the day
What you're doing tomarrow's gonna come your way
Don't you ever consider giving up
You will find, oooh

It's a beautiful Life, oooh
It's a beautiful Life, oooh
It's a beautiful Life, oooh
I just wanna be here beside you
And stay until the break of dawn

Take a walk in the park when you feel down
