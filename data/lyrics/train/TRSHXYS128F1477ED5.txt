I'm looking for answers to all the questions no one knows
Bleeding and begged asked you for nothing but something showed

Your uneasy eyes the sweat on your forehead
Everyone's pointing your nervousness out
It's obvious now that you're scared of yourself
Nothing to keep them from knowing this now
There's nothing to keep them from knowing this now

Promises, shattered pieces, memories of nothing
Cowardly, you'll face this all alone
