Come all you broken hearted come
And lay your burden down
Come kings and queens, come royalty
Surrender up your crown

Come empty handed, come with nothing
Of your own to claim
Come naked, poor, come like a child
To ride the orphan train

Come ride, ride on the orphan train
Put your ear to the track, you can hear your name
Come ride, ride on the orphan train
It'll take you all the way home
