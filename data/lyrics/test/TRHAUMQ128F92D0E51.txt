Ha
As I stand here contemplating
On the right thing to decide
Will I take the wrong direction all my life?
Where will I go? Will I go 'head of me
I have strong determination
And I'm not afraid of change
I have yet to find that someone who would care
To satisfy me, to stay right by me, oh
Who can I run to?
(Who can I run to?)
To share this empty space
(Tell me)
Who can I run to when I need love?
Who can I run to?
(Who can I run to?)
To fill this empty face with laughter
Who can I run to when I need love?
