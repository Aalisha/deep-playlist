In A Time When The World Seems Unstable
Feels Like The Worst Has The Best Of You And Nothing Goes Right
Take A Look At The One Or The Other
Cause You're Not Alone
Have You Ever Seen Hunger?
Or Have You Ever Seen Anyone With Nothing At All
Take A Look At The One Or The Other
There's Only One Thing I Can Say
You're Not Down On Your Luck
Down On Your Luck
Take Some Time To Look Around
Got No Reason To Be Down
So Down On Your Luck
