It's been four years since I saw the ocean
It's been five nights since I held your hand
It's been forever since we talked the whole night through
It's been too long, I need a comfort hand

So tell my love I'm leaving
I gotta find something to believe in
Tell my love I'm leaving
For the sun, for the sun
A new day has begun
