Aah aah aah aah
Aah aah aah aah

I know some things
Well they don't feel right
And I can't sit tight
Still there's some other things
That'll make you smile
They can make you high

Still there's some other things
That'll make you turn your head
Make you change your direction
If you check their worth
Well they're not too deep
And you need some correction

I've got infatuation with the little things
 (Aah aah aah aah)
They make me feel good
 (Aah aah aah aah)
Why should I feel bad ooh?
 (Aah aah aah aah)
I've got infatuation with the little things little things
 (Aah aah aah aah)
