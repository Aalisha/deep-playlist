When I'm alone and filled with promise
Sometimes I feel nothing at all
I don't believe that silence is golden
I don't want to stray
Sometimes daylight drives me crazy
When you believe in the one and all
Some black masks roll out their feelings
I don't want to stray
If it's something I might have said

Life is a tug of war
Slap in the face
Life is a tug of war
All over the place
Life is a tug of war
Let's cut to the chase
Every night I dream

Soon you'll think love really happens
Now you got me up against a wall
