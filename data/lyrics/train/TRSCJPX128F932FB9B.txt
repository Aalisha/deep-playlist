Here in the final hour, hope lifts the tired eyes
Here now, we are waiting for You to arrive
Great things are set in motion
The sky breaks, the trumpets sound
You call all Your children to meet You in the clouds

We are waiting, anticipating
Your arrival, Your arrival
Voices raising, celebrating
Your arrival, Your arrival
