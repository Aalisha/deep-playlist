Lady luck and a four leaf clovers
Wanting this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
Till your leavin' ended the situation

I'm standin' on shakey ground, yeah
Ever since you put me down
Oh, standin' on shakey ground, yeah
Ever since you put me down

My car got repossessed this morning, yeah
Hardest times I've seen in years
Lord, you got to throw me a life preserver, yeah
