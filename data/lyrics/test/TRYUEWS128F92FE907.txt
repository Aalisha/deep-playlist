Standing on the corner of Heartache and Main
Indicision rainin' down on me
I could stay and I could go but I'm a loser either way
I guess that's just the way it has to be

I've been man enough to tell you that I'm sorry when I'm wrong
You never will admit it when I'm right
Maybe you will finally forgive me when I'm gone
But I won't be there when you apologize

=Chorus=
