I feel like the flowers in this vase
He just brought them home one day,
"Ain't that beautiful" he said
They've been here in the kitchen
And the water's turning grey
They're sitting in the vase 
But now they're dead

Dead flowers

I feel like this long string of lights
They lit up our whole house on Christmas day
But now it's January and the 
Bulbs have all burned out
But still they hang
...
