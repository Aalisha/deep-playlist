Well, now you're forced to listen to the teacher and the lesson
Class is in session, so you can stop guessin'
If this is a tape or a written down memo
See I am a professional, this is not a demo
In fact call it a lecture, a visual picture
Sort of a poetic and rhythm like mixture

Listen, I'm not dissin' but there's somethin' that you're missin'
Maybe you should touch reality, stop wishin'
For beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste
If this meaning doesn't manifest put it to rest
I am a poet, you try to show it, yet blow it
It takes concentration for fresh communication

Observation, that is to see without speaking
Take off your coat, take notes, I am teachin'
A class, or rather school, 'cause you need schooling
I am not a king or queen, I'm not ruling
This is anduction to poetry
A small dedication to those that might know of me

They might know of you and maybe your gang
But one thing's for sure, neither one of y'all can hang
'Cause yo, I'm like a arrow, and Scott is the crossbow
Say something now, thought so
You seem to be the type that only understand
The annihilation and destruction of the next man

That's not poetry, that is insanity
It's simply fantasy far from reality
