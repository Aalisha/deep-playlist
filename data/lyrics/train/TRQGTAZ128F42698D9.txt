Rise into the elder world
the burning purgatory
deadly cosmic terror
the lowest dephts of hell

I signed the book of blood
by will - now that's a fact
marked by the numbers
of predominance
lead me to the path of perfect celebration
I've been reborn in a world of consumption

Arisen in blasphemy
mutilation I need
consume souls eternally
for my torment they will bleed

Realm of darkthrone
