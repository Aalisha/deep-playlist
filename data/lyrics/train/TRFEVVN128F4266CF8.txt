i can't wait to say goodbye before you break
in you, i get torn in two
you don't see my reflection in my scenes
you fall, i don't come at all
i can almost feel you bleed
you've been falling in too deep
i can almost hear you say
but your words get in my way
why wait?
there's a world outside
why wait?
for the reason why
i come soon from the shelter of my room
you don't move
coming down on you
i can't fall
all that does is made to crawl
...
