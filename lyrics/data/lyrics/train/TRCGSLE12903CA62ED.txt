You, you lure me into your arms so I can't resist.
Get off of me,
Get off of me,
Get off of me,
You'd better get off of me.

My life is flashing before my eyes,
And all that I'm missing because of a lie.
My life is flashing before my eyes.
I won't let this happen,
Get off of me.

This is why, why I don't sleep at night.
My body is aching.
Her beauty is poison.
I could have lost all I have in this life.
Those beautiful eyes,
Those beautiful evil eyes.

I want you out of my life, and never come back.
Get out of here,
Get out of here,
...
