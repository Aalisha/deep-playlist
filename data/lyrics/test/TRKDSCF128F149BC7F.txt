Danny got of yellow school bus
Looking so sad today, you see it on his face
Mommy and Daddy have been fighting again
Every time they fight, he's caught in the middle of it all
He has dreams, like every little boy in the world.
But right now his main dream,
Is to get out of here.
Is to see Mommy and Daddy disappear forever.
He doesn't wanna hear those angry voices anymore
Danny, be careful what you wish for
You might just get it.
