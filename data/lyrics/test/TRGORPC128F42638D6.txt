Saw you there, Tall and dark, Handsome too
Put it all together baby and you got
Lots of groovy loving, Lover by the dozen
Giving you things like diamond rings
What they wouldn't do for you
At it's best there's still the emptiness
You travel down that road alone
Really got it going on

Snap your fingers and they all come running
But what about your love baby
Snap your fingers and they all come running
What are you thinking of baby

There you go up and down, in and out
What's another casual fling in the life of a groovy lover,
Underneath the covers
You hold on tighter still, to the thrill
What you wouldn't do for this
...
