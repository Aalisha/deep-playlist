yeah, one of these days i'm gonna write you off
have this tattoo removed once and for all
wake up smiling in another life without you taking up all the space in my mind
yeah, that's just a dream i'm living in
i walked out the door and then

[chorus]
can't even watch a sunset, listen to a song
cause when i think i got you lit, WRONG
no matter how hard i try, to turn it off
you keep going on and on
you're never ever gone
you're never ever gone
