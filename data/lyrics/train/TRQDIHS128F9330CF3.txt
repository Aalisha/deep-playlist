The single girl all alone in a great big town
The single girl gets so tired of love lettin' her down
The life's unreal and the people are homely
And the nights can get so lonely
The single girl needs a sweet lovin' man to lean on

I'm a single girl wonderin' if love could be passin' me by
I'm a single girl and I know all about men and their lies
