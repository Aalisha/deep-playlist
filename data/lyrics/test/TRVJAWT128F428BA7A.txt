So now come sit down
Will you talk with me now
Let me see through your eyes
Where there is so much light
We are biding our time
For these myths to unwind
For these changes we will confront

So please beware
With every place that you had
Look to your soul
For the things that you know
For the trees that we see
Can not forever breathe
With the changes they will confront

CHORUS:
You know some people they just won't understand
no I just won't understand
These things
Thank you for your message but I don't understand
no I just won't understand
These things

For this sacred land
...
