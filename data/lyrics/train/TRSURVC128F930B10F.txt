Don't believe in matter, so please don't fence me in
Don't believe in freedom, you've seen the shape I'm in,
Never mind the limits, the values come astray
Trust upon the only thing, that matters today...

It's true, the church of your heart
Will ring out the wonder of the moment
Spirit of the ages
All, of your colorful dreams
We saw them materialize, and, one by one
We trust the pages
