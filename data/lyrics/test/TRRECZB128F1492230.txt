love me today, and hate me tomorrow
Put all the bad feelings aside
why should we lay
in all of this sorrow
true feelings cannot hide

I was just about over you
and I really thought that we were finally thru
but there was something there that just would not break
and I kept wondering what more will it take
I guess we have that type of love that could not be broken with a simply goodbye

love me today, and hate me tomorrow
Put all the bad feelings aside
why should we lay
