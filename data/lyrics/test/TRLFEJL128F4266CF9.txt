I remember the first day we met
That's the day I'll never forget
You came into my life, made everything right

I remember the first time we touched
Never knew that I could love so much
You ignited the flame, and I still feel the same

Chorus:
I like your style (I like your style)
I like your smile (I like it baby)
I love your heart and I loved you right from the start

I made a wish upon a lucky star
For someone special just the way you are
That wish came true, oh when I found you
