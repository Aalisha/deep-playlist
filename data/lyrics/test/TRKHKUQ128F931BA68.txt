Here comes your man now everybody hide - he do the shark-walk
He says he's not guilty, well you decide - he do the shark-walk
The butcher and the baker and the fireman say - he do the shark-walk
And he wants everybody everywhere to walk this way - and do the shark-walk
He gonna walk forever with those wicked strides
And he knows if you ever ever stop you die
He do the shark-walk. He do the shark-walk.
She's hungry all the time - she do the shark-walk.
She like the Hokey-Pokey and the Southern skies - she do the shark-walk
