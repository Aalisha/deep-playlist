Your hateful nuclear weapons
Are mere props for your aggression
More tools for further oppression
Die with your... possessions
The blatant colonel gave the command
And millions died in a far away land
The atom bomb was dropped
Just as he had planned
And the whole city
Was reduced to sand
Innocent animal and people of towns
Slaughtered as the bombs poured down
We won't fight your war
We've seen it all before
Millions dying in anguish and pain
...
