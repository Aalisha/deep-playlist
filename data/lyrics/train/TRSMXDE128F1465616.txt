Boy when I first saw you
I knew I could adore u
And it's my nature to be shy but not tonight, no
So let me make the first move
I'll make it easy for you
Someone has to break the ice, oh baby, oh

Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive
Cos my affection ain't somethin' you can buy
Got my suspicion lookin' in your eye
That you could be my kind of guy

Do you like watchin' the sun come up
Sippin champagne in a paper cup
Laughin' when you're makin love
Cos I'm that kind of girl
Dancin' to a sad love song
Even when the music's gone
Kisses that go on and on and on
Cos I'm that kind of girl

Is this first star wishing
A woman's intuition
Has my arrow found its mark, oh baby, yeah-hey
Cos all I do is think of you
In a fantasy for two
And I've just got to let you know
...
