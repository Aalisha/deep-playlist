Checking your reflection
Is what really turns you on
And you're loving every minute
Thinking everyone has gone

You just roll your eyes
And you fantasize
Think you're number one

So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?

Always out at every party
So the pain don't show
Talking too much laughing too loud
