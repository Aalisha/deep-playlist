It was summer's first spark
Felt like finding the switch in the dark
Hey, how little did I understand
When she accidentally toutched my hand
That the odds were in my favor
They came in eighteen to one
And I am a lucky one
I am a lucky one

It's happening baby
She's waiting for me
Love happened to me
She's waiting for me

You know the shortest road home
Is the longest road out
I was in her presence for an hour
And I already wanted to shout
The shepherd is good, the shepherd arranges
A lot and that sudden changes
And I am a lucky one
I am the lucky one
