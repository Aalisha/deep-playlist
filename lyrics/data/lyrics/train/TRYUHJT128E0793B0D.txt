I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said seize the day, pull the trigger,
Drop the blade
And watch the rolling heads

The day I tried to live
I stole a thousand beggar's change
And gave it to the rich

The day I tried to win
I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch yeah
Singing

One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
The day I tried to live
