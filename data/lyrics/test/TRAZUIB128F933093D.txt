Face to face
My reflection in your eyes
I was scared to say too much
Perfect strangers in perfect worlds apart
Almost close enough to touch
Staring at my shoes
Feeling so confused
Shot down without a gun
Victim of a hit and run
Won't you...

Call me - call me
No time to hesitate - we must communicate
Call me - call me
Won't you call this number now

Mesmerised
I go back to where we met
...
