Rap: 
Wham Bam Thank U Mam 
Let's Get Down With Another T-Jam 
Anyway U Slice It, Dice It 
Move It, Move It, Come On Let's Do This 
Chorus: 
It Feels So Good 2 Do It Your Way 
Won't U Come Follow Do It My Way, Baby 
I Wanna Feel U Deep Inside 
U Got me Hooked, I'm On Your Line 

Vocals: 
I Am A Woman, U R A Man 
Let's Get Together & Do Just What We Can 
We'll Paint The Night A Thousand Shades So Bright 
What I Have 2 Give 2 U 
Will Make U Feel Alright 

Climb: 
Ah, Feels So Good 2x
