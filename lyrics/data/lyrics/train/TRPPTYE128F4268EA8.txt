uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yo, yo (ooh yeah)
let me explain this to you
see i'm not gonna let you run me
how we're gonna do it is...
i'm gonna run you
you, you've got a lot of nerve
i guess you haven't heard
i'm doin' fine out here on my own
you, you think that you can come
around here for some fun
but boy you've got a lot to learn
don't shake your head from side to side
saying that you've changed enough
that you see the light
cuz you just say what you say
and want your way
and it's that game that you play
it's a little late
as if
i'm ever gonna take you back
as if
it's ever gonna come to that
so see you 'round, wave goodbye
be a bird pass me by
as if
i'm gonna let you break my heart again
as if i'm gonna let your love back in my life
not tonight, get a grip
baby as if
(brandi)
come on (oh, oh) come on
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
