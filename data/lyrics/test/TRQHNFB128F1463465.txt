[3 - K.G. singing by himself]

[Intro: K.G. & Joe Budden sing together]
When your mind ain't right, and it's hard to sleep
And you try to hide the pain, but your scars are deep
Nigga look me in my eyes and tell me what you see, yeah.
When your mind ain't right, and it's hard to sleep
And you try to hide the pain, but your scars are deep
Nigga look me in my eyes and tell me what you see.

[Verse]
[1] - And my heart is like
[3] - There's one thing poppa told me
[1] - If nothin else in this world, it's how to survive
[2] - When I'm against all odds, and when the odds against me
[3] - I travel wherever my path may lead
[2] - Knowin nobody got my back like me
[1] - I'm gonna survive
[2] - And if you walk in my shoes
[2] - Guarantee you'll be just like me
[1] - And my heart is like
[3] - And if you leave me alone in the V with the chrome
[3] - I won't hurt nothin, but I need to be alone
[1] - Nigga. just me and my Sam Cooke tapes
[1] - And my heart is like
[3] - And baby if you don't understand
