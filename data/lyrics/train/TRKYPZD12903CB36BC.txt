Last time in Paris was a little strange,
Had time to myself,
Headed out to see the city sights.
Met a little thing on the Champs-Elysees,
Stole my heart away,
You know I never could pronounce her name.
She didn't mind at all.
We were sitting there,
Seemed like hours
Pass the day away,
Till they said we had to pay,
Or do the dishes or something,
I don't know.

Living at the plaza Athenee,
Got to rest for the show.
Man at the front desk knew my face.
