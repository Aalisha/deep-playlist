Just look at that girl with the radio
The sun's singing on her head to toe
Beach bodies in a big, blue ocean
Now, baby, look my way

My world, a million girls
I want you, baby
I'm not looking around the world
I'm just seaside lazy, yeah

You got nothing to lose
It's just the nature of the beach
So much to choose
It's just the nature of the beach

I like the seaside body in the summer sand
I like to see her in my hand
