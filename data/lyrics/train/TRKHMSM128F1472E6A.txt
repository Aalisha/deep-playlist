you wanna reggae music
reggae music

Playing with fire,
playing with you,
day by day
we create a new everlasting blaze,
a new everlasting blaze.

Playing in bed,
playing with you,
night by night
we create a new everlasting blaze
a new everlasting blaze.

AMANDLA, AMANDLA.

Your house is burning now
AMANDLA AWE TU.
