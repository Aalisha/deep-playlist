She bosses me around dang near all of the time
She may be my wife but I won't kiss her big behind
No matter how much she whines

Now I've been working hard for way too long
If you think I'm walking the dog taking out the trash
Trimming out the hedges or cleaning out the garage, you're wrong
It's your time to mow the lawn

Praise the Lord I'm going fishin'
It's the only cure for my mental condition
One of these days I'm gonna send her a packin'
...
