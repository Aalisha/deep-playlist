Dave Peverett - Riff Bros. Music - ASCAP




After all is said and done, it wasn't hard to be the lonely one.
Sad, but not a tear was shed, you agreed with every word I said.
I had my new life started, I couldn't be downhearted,
Days rolled slowly by, finally you stayed out of my mind.

I filed your name under "Forgotten", and then somebody pushed the panic button.
Suddenly my nerves were shakin', I realized I could have been mistaken.
Then like they say like you're supposed ta', I'm ridin' on a roller coaster.
I found love too late, too bad she's not the waiting kind.

I never felt like this before, I had to use my imagination.
Love came to my door, too late for the invitation,
Delayed reaction, Reaction, Reaction - Delayed reaction, (Reaction, Reaction).
