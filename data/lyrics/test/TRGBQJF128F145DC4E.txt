So tired of crying, but I'm out
On the road again
I'm on the road again
So tired of crying, but I'm out
On the road again
I'm on the road again
I ain't got no woman
To call my special friend

You know the first time I traveled out
In the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
You know the first time I traveled out
In the rain and snow
In the rain and snow
