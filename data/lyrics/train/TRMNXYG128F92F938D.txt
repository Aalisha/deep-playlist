Running around
This run-down, one-horse town
One of these days
They're gonna crucify me
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable
It is to be young, dumb, and have lots of money

Holding hands and stroking handguns
With pristine souls
And even my own mother will tell you

There is an apathetic heart of gold
