Into your car park drive obsolete motors
With petrol consumption at too higher price
Sell us through windows at backroom board meetings
Blindfolded and handcuffed and in single file

On your money mile
We are the faceless, the nameless, the homeless
On your money mile
There in your fortress where you couldn't care less
On your money mile
