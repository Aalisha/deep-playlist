Every little move she makes,
Is gonna catch somebody's eye.
You ought to see all the double-takes,
When she goes walkin' by.
But she's so distant.
She seems so cold.

Everybody says that rock won't roll.
They say the girl's got a heart of stone.
That rock won't roll,
Oh, but she's too pretty to be alone.
I've got all this love inside me,
And I've just got to see,
If that rock won't roll.
