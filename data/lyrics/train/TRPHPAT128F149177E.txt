In the night I will be waitin'
Ready to go, soon as the daylight is fadin'
In the night my heart is beating
Out of control, can't stop the way that I'm feeling
I wanna know how far to go, takin' my life in my hands
Out on my own, fighting alone, call me the desperate man

Danger, danger, give me danger, danger
Give me measures of pleasure and pain
Boiling the blood in my veins
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger
Give me nothing to stand in my way
