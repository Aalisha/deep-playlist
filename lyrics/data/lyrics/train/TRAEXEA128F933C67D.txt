Everyone who sees you
Thinks you should be smiling
That girl, she's so pretty
That girl, she's so beguiling

Everyone who sees you
Thinks you should be happy
Thinks you should coo-coo her
And start acting all sappy

But it's hard to laugh when you know that she's been cheating
Had her hands around him and she's been giving it a beating
Well it's hard to laugh when you know that she's been lying
