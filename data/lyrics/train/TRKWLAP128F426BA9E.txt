Listen!
You can rock me, rock me all night long.
Keep on rockin' me baby, rock me all night long.
'Cause you know what, when you rock me,
my poor back it ain't got a bone.

You can roll me, just like they roll the wagon wheel,
way down in the country.
Keep on rollin' me baby, roll me all night long.
You know, you can shake, rattle, and roll me,
till my back it ain't got a bone.
And I won't mind that! Yea!
