you're so problematic
and i know it's symptomatic
of you own masochistic ills
a psychoanalyzer would say
"better tranquilize her.
numb her with some of these pills."

a triple case of nerves
is more than you deserve
but you've only got yourself to blame
you're sick and sadistic
that's why i go ballistic
your excuses always sound so lame

your love is for sale, yeah
i won't be the buyer
bogged down in your emotional mire
you're not my messiah
just another liar
