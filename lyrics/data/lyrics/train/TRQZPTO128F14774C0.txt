"and so, my fellow americans
Ask not. what your country can do for you
Ask what you can do for your country" -> president john f. kennedy

"and now, back to new york"

Heart as, hard as, chinese arithmetic
Avante garder, not a heretic
Figure out a right rhyme, stick it in my cranium
Pete nice, elemental like uranium
Throwin joints, blowin like a cool breeze
Swimmin in, i lift on juice, i wax mc's
These hoes go frontin on my jimmy
I smack em on the back, sit em down, say
"gimme some rhythm" (rhythm!) baby loosen up my collar
I'll lay you out, like a funeral parlor
Ready willin, fillin, killin for a billin, top
I never stop, with serch and sam drillin it
Soul in the hole, mc's workin
Kickin it, vickin, the suckers who be jerkin
Me and my posse are hardcore, you want some more
Reason that i'm squeezin your girl (you never please her!)
So i pleased, then i threw her in the gutter
Cut her off, my wisdom wiser so i muster
Rows of all opposed, lows conquer all
Those who pose as dope i say nope, i wear def clothes
Dapper like dan from, three the hard one
Never stigmatize as a rapper or i'll slap ya
You're stung from my tongue as you run from the drum
(diggy drum) three the hard way, wordz of wizdom

"this time there was three"
"one two." "three the hard way!"
"this time there was three"
"one two." "three the hard way!"

A branch of the hip-hop tip grills your dome
You're toe ingrown low showin you ain't got nobody home
Prone to the microphone, light up, and take out
Make you your will bill, three is gonna break out
The stylee, me and p-e-t-e
Embark on a mission that's deadly, break out the ammo
Aiyyo sammo, hook up the beat
And i'll lay the plan oh man
You just got taken, i took a head out
Attack on the back of the six of the guinness stout
...
