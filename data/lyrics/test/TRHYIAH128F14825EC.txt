Tied to the testin' of wills
When my heart breaks and spills
Left to the sight of the sky
In your arms I'm defined

Thrown to the wolves
In the minds of your enemies
And I'm stoned in the eyes
Of your foolishness

If this is what I'm meant for
No longer interesting
Fall forward just to even the score
Just a thought to you
...
