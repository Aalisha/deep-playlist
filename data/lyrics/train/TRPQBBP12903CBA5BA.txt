[Intro]
So you know everything about your lover
Wanna bet

[Chorus]
My oh my
How can this be there he goes
Talking in his sleep
By and by
He will connive does he know
He's talking in his sleep

(talking)
The affair okay
He's corrupt
What do I do, what do I say
I feel ashamed, embarrassed, fatigued
Such a petty crime of sexual indiscretion

[Verse One]
At night when he lays down
How I wish I could not hear the sound
(But I could)
Oh the things that he said
