"Know Me"

Prepare to fight

I've slaved too long to be where I am
Won't let any man into my land
But if you know my secrets
And you still want me
You must be special
So prove it to me

'Cause breaking down these walls is a task at hand
If you have the strength then I'll demand
That you and me
We take some time
And get to know eachother
Then I might make you mine

'Cause I've got a plan
For the twos of us
We gonna walk around
Until it's dusk
...
