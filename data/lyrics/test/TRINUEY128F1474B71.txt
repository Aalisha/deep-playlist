She'll get you if she wants you.
Probly don't but feels the need to, 
Prove that she could if she wished.
Oh little girl, don't be so foolish.

That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl, 
Nothin' but trouble that girl.

She'll get you if she wants you.
She'll get you if she wants you.

Oh you thought you had a chance, yeah, you thought you were in.
