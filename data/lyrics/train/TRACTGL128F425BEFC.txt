At first I am afraid
But not because of fear
But the holy of holies is drawing me near
Your voice like thunder
Shakes the ground I'm on

So hide my face in the shadow of Your wings, oh Lord
Hide my sin from the beauty here before Your throne, Your throne

Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain
Hallelujah for the blood of the lamb that was slain
And so we enter in to see Your face, yeah
We enter in to see Your face, oh God, mmmm...

Well I'm falling to my knees
I feel the earth beneath
With the weight of my sin and this crushing unbelief
Could You really love me
With all that I've done, oh Lord
