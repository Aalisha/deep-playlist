Don't make me listen to the stupid broken record again
The needle's skippin' and repeatin' never reaching the end
You know you're bitching and complaining like you've got it so tough
We're sick of all your crying will you ever shut up?

So keep bleeding your fake blood 'til no one even sees it
If that's the best you can make up at least act like you mean it

Give up the grudge, you better shut your mouth
Why you gotta judge everybody but yourself?
Take a look around you, there ain't nobody home
I may be a loser but at least I'm not alone
