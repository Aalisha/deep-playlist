Hello baby, I betcha never thought I would call
Well my heart just went in with this dime
And I only get three minutes time, hear me out now

I wanna to make it as clear as I can
There's so much that I want to explain
And the final decision remains in your hands

Please remember what I told you to forget
There's a man on the phone and he wants to come home
To the woman he loves all alone
