am the daughter of the son of the son of a milkmaid with my name,
She one of seventeen children on the farm.
Grandpa fought in the war, and his father in the one before,
Three days in no-man's-land, no man ever should...
And when I look at grandpa's hands,
Pick me up and swing me round,

And the cows come in and the cows go out.
Some of the lessons we learn, I could do without.
