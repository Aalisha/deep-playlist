phone rings twice*
Hello?
(arabic voice) You have a collect call phone call
In a New York state correctional facility
Press five five to accept, or hang up to decline

Verse One:

Whattup gangstas, how tha fuck ya'll feel
We keepin it real, and hold on tight to your steel
Let them caps peel, one by one
And laugh while the nig run
He shoulda been packin his gun, now he gone
Cuz he got slippin like an old bitch
in the wet staircase shaft, now watch his man snitch
to tha police, but them no worry me son
I ain't trying to get back it'd be my third felony
Pataki he want to see us, criminals fry
in the electric chair, but my spirit will never die
A true project nigga, I won't hesitate
to pull the BLAOW, peace to all busy niggaz
