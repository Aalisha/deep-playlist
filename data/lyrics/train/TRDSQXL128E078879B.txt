First Thing in the morning when you just arrose your eyes still closed 
You're getting up, you're feeling down, maybe it cos your bed's creased on one side 
You can't hide your face was smiling while you heart wears a frown 
Always moving on, no place to go home living alone why should it have to be this way? 
Chorus- We all need someone to love, 
We all need someone to love 
Holding and kissing you 
When you go missin you 
Keeping you warm from the cold of the night 
We all need oh someone to love 
...
