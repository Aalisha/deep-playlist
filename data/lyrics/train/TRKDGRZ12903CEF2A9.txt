Stress, that's all y'all hear
I like a bag of stress
(Is that right?)
Baby mamma's own
Speak on this, uh
My baby mamma, why y'all be crazy daily
Hit us up with drama, playin' with babies
And tryin' to break your player partners
Wonder why we blaze weed and steadily smokin' marijuana?
Your baby mamma, your mamma
My baby mamma, probably been screwed
By so many dudes that she's confused
Keep makin' moves and breakin' fools and V-12's
Like you and I, I flew in' high of Endo and I.C.E.
That baby's supposed to look like me
Girl, youse a lie, now who's them eyes?
Where did he get that big-ass hair-fro?
Lookin' like a baby macks hair-drum, huh
Platinum, until my bread come, so she can try to sue me and do me
Like they did my man Num, my baby mamma
The typical groupie, she watch me go from
Squattin' the hoopie, to clockin' loochie and the prowl
I see woman livin' me coochie like, catch
(Catch)
Go, go smoke-a-lot Rolex stretch in the crowd, grab a bitch, hey
Throw up your hands if you're H-O-support
Throw up your hands if you're going to court, hey
The life that you live is long not short, hey
Dig it, you catch a nigga like me smokin' weed
On the porch with your baby mamma
My baby mamma, why y'all be crazy daily
Hit us up with drama, playin' with babies
And tryin' to break your player partners
Wonder why we blaze weed daily smokin' marijuana?
Your baby mamma, your mamma
Your baby mamma
