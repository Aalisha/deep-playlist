I might be apart of this
ripple on water from a lonesome drip
A fallen tree that witness me
I'm alone,
Him and me

And then life it's self can not aspire
to have someone be so admired
I threw creation to my king
have the silence broken by a whispered wind

All of this can be broken
All of this can be broken
Hold your devil by his spoke and spin him to the ground

And root to root and tip to tip
I look at him my country gip
Let it up I own his fears
...
