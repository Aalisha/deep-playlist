Sometimes you're better off dead

There's a gun in your hand and it's pointing to your head.
You think you're mad
that you're unstable.
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town.
Call the police
there's a mad man around

Running down underground to a dive bear in a West End town.

In a West End town a dead end world -
The East End boys and West End girls -
In a West End town a dead end world -
The East End boys and West End girls -
West End girls - West End girls.

Too many shadows
whispering voices
...
