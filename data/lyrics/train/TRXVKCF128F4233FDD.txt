Candle light, it burns in every hole of your eyes
It's beautiful, how much you'll never realize
So hush my love, there's something I'm to tell you now
Your time has come, around again my sleepless one
Your friend was young, hung and plastered
He never knew his own disaster
I think it's good, in fact it was faster
Cause it was you that he was after
Hold me now, as if you'll never let me go
