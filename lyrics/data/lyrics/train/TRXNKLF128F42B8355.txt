Lord, it's a constant struggle down here
Specially when all you know how to do is hustle down here
Lord, it's a miracle, I'm still breathing down here

So I keep my family near me down here
And keep my bulletproof vest on
Thank you, Lord, for making Teflon down here

'Cause the ghetto has a way of manipulating the children
