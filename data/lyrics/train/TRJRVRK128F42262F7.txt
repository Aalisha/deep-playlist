So where you been for so long
Did you ever stop to ask what's wrong
So hold on tight cos life speeds by
What's done is done ahead the answers lie

No sense in confrontation
Takes time to heal this tension
Just tryin' to keep me happy but all I feel is empty

And it's too bad that your homsteads lie
On battlefields where lack of space confines
So hold on to the ones you trust
...
