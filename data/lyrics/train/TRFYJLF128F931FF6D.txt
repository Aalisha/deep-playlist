The old man used to dream of the fortune he'd seek
Now he lives in the room where you pay by the week
His hands're all bothered and his pony's gone lame
And his bones always ache when the sky looks like rain
Well he dreams of the old days with bronc bustin' tails
And the wide open spaces where buffalo plays
Deep in his mem'ry wild horses ride on
But he knows the good times have all come and gone
...
