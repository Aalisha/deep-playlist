Excuse me sir, I'm lost
I'm looking for a place where I can get lost
I'm looking for a home for my malfunctioning being
I'm looking for the mechanical music museum

This is a warning
I'll spell it out for you, for you
This is a warning
I'll spell it out for you

Excuse me miss, I'm a dog on heat
I'm a complicated being with love songs to eat
I'm a poor, starving baby who can march all night
I'm a mechanical music man and I'm starting a fire

Hot chip will break your legs
Snap off your head
Hot chip will put you down
