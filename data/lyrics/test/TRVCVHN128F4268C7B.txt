Wake up your life
You may never get the chance to make things right
Rather than lie
Take a moment to reflect on what's gone by
It's a mistake
There's no reason I should be so full of guilt
Significant break
So you severed all the ties that we have built

(All I know)
I tried to give you what was left of me
But it was not enough
(Even though)
I didn't think about the rest of me
That it was not enough

(All I know)
I tried my hardest with the best of me
But it was not enough
(Even though)
I tried to give you what was left of me
But it was not enough

All mixed up inside
