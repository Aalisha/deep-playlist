I wanna be bigger, stronger
Drive a faster car
To take me anywhere in seconds
To take me anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
I will settle for nothing less
I will settle for nothing less
I wanna be bigger, stronger
Drive a faster car
At the touch of a button
I can go anywhere I wanna go
And drive around my faster car
