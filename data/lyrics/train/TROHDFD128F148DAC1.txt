You can hold her hand
And show her how you cry
Explain to her your weakness
So she understands
And then roll over and die

You can brave decisions
Before you crumble up inside
Spend your time asking
Everyone else's permission
Then run away and hide

Or you can sit on chimneys
Put some fire up your ass
No need to know
