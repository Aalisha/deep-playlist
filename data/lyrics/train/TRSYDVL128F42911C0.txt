When your heart is all alone every second
Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those ol' clouds that rain so blue

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

When it's late, the sun hangs low
