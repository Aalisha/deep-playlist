Evil E:
Yo, Ice, Man, we halfway done with the album, man. You been throwing' all this strong, dope, stupid, fly, pimp shit, but what's up with the sex rhymes! You ain't thrown no sex rhymes yet, man. What's up with that?

Ice-T:
Yo, man. I didn't even want to really do none this year, man.

Evil E:
Yo, why you ain't want to do none, man? Titties, man. Sex, sex, sex, man, all that. We need some sex!

Ice-T:
(laughs) Man, I really wasn't about that, homes.

Evil E:
Not? C'mon, man, just throw one sex joint man for me and my boys, man, me and the man. The Niggas, man! Whassup?
