In a filthy little room sits a dirty little girl.
Hair undone, eyes askewed,
She kills time.

Hangin' with rats and other vermin,
Stinkin' to high heaven.
She won't stop bitin', so she'll never go outside.

She's a dog.
She's a filthy dog.
And she'll bite until you're bloody and dead.
She's a dog.
She's a filthy dog.
And she'll never get enough to be satisfied.

The rocks and bones that she's collected
Are strewn to the ________ (?)
She's untidy, she's a surly bad luck thing.
