Time will let you go
All alone I break
Time will let you go
All alone I break

I don't know why you're wasting your own time
I don't know how you see this when you're not bleeding with me
Is believing in me, With nothingness in everything
You're leaving with me
I don't know why you're changing all the time
You're trying to slow down and fall behind
All this tension, no comprehension
Losing yourself in delusional dimensions

Time will let you go
All alone I break
