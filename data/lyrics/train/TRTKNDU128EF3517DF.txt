Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I remember when you was a little girl
I say you never ever ever wore curls
You wore nothing but an old shaggy, shaggy dress
I say you never ever try to look your best
Now when I look at you
All my love come a'running through
You've changed and it's showing
My love for you is growing
You've changed and it's showing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You legs were little
But now they are big
Instead of wearing a pony tail
You wear a little red wig
Your eyes are pretty
