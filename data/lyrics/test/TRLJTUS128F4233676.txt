I saw her just the other day
see what you mean,
yeh shes ok
seems like a sweet enough girl
but shes not me
you take the lead
ill take your hand
ill follow you
just like we planned
up to your room
and lock the door

Not sorry

coz i can see its true that you adore me
Lets not leave this room
till tomorrow morning

coz i dont care about your plans
dont care if your sombodys man
i look into your eyes
i know you want me
so tell her anyway you can
just let her go she'll understand
and if she doesnt thats too bad
...
