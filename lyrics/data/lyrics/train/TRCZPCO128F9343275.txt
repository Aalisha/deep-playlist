Gimme just a little break
Ain't no more that I can take
I am asking for the planets to align

Calling on the universe
Maybe once, just put me first
Gimme what I need or give a little sign

Nothing plays out like it should
And nothing does me any good
'Cause I'm missing you, it's making me cry

Ooh, I know it's turning
Inside I'm burning...

I'm so tired of the way the world works
I'm so tired of the way the world works
They conspire trying to keep this apart
