He's standing proud, waiting for sign
The days of the glory will arrive
Behind the eyes, his twisted mind
He knows that he needs no alibi

Now taking the last train, right to the promised land
No matter what it takes, he's giving everything he has

Now innocence will fade away, washed away by tears
All our dreams has gone astray, all that's left is fear
The cruelty in our hearts will tear this world apart
This is the point of no return
