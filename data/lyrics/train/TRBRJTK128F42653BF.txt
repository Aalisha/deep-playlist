Verse 1:

Rise before the sun
We leave when it lifts
The show must go on so we start on the run

Buy us a meal
And buy us some time if we want to arrive there

Look ahead at the road
You can't see a thing
But maybe we'll make it before it's too late

There is no time to waste---

Verse 2:

Turn, turn on the lights
As they drive by
World on the side (?) keep your eyes on the road

Hands on the wheel
Don't let us slip this is almost a nightmare

Turn, turn on the heat
...
