The media is a tool designed to mold us into slaves
Drugging us into an empty apathetic daze
The trick is that we think that everything is going fine
But the truth to our reality is buried in the mind

I don't really care if models can't fucking eat
I don't give a fuck about what movie is on top
But what I really know is that the shit has got to stop
