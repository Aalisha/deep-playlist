Faster, faster, you won't go far
Shouldn't leave, feeling faint, we both know why
You got to show me, both knees, cold I lie
Hold me, slowly, hide me, til I can fight
Always, we can sing, we can make time
Old songs, flood and flame, you could be mine
But you got to show me, both knees, skin and bone
Clothe me, throw me, move me
Til I can sell you lies
You can't get enough
Make a true believer of
Anyone, anyone, anyone
I can call you up
