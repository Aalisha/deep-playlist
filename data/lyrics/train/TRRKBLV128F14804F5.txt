Last night I woke up three times
And listened to the silence
It danced a weird ballet around my room

It was so strange, like the shape of
An unkown man had always stood there
Watching me come watching me go
And now he's gone, now he's gone

Even though I know the rain may fall
At moments you can never tell
I never knew silence could fall so unexpectedly
And wash away his shadow

I realized that the voice of
The unknown man was always there
Blackmailing, denying my right to live and laugh
For so long the power of his voice sang within me
