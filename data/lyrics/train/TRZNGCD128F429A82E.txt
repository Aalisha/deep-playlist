God in his wisdom tried
A new religion out for size
Kicked out the Christian's lies
Shocked his many minions
By silencing their mind

Dying for love
And this kind of fire inside
My blood is blind
I'm dining on a silent mind
And several other friends of mine

Goddamn this whisky
It's running all my system dry
