Good God! Uhh! 

(Oh wo oh)
(Oh wo oh)

Baby, if you would only talk to me
I think you'd know just what was going on
Baby, if you'd open your eyes & see
A broken heart, say now I know what's wrong (yes I do)

I tried to do the best I could for you
Gave you everything you could want
For that I lived in violent misery
But no more now since she came along (since she came along)

(Oh wo oh)
She I can't resist
(Oh wo oh)
She I can't resist
