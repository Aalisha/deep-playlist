I'm giving to myself most of the time
I don't need no one else to bring me down
And I don't want to hurt no one
But I'm still where I've begun
Where I've begun, where I've begun

When will I feel myself again
(Where I've begun)
When will I feel more than less upon
(Where I've begun)

When will I feel myself again
(Where I've begun)
When will I feel more than less upon
Where I've begun

Time tease the day control of room
But I don't mind if some I've ever seen
...
