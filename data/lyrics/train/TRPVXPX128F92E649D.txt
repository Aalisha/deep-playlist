you can hear the thunder
long before the storm,
but you can't hear the lion when he stalks his prey
he's moving like a shadow
creeping up on you
and like a siren's call he's gonna have his way
you'd better run, forget your pride
don't make a stand, just step aside
if you don't have what it takes
don't try to play you'll lose your stakes
remember this at least

it's the nature of the beast
...
