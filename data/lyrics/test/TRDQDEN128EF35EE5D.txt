I hate you I want you theres something that you do
I've made up my mind now and I want you to know
You please me you tease me you make it look easy
I've made up my mind I think I want you to know

Oh wont these feelings go away
They keep me up when im tired of thinking bout you darling
I've been awake for thirteen days
Won't you please just please let me go to sleep and I will go to sleep
