Days you feel like giving up but you know you can win
And some days you feel like you wont make it till the end
I got someone that is greater than your problems
[Background]
Put all your cares and your troubles on him

[(Marvin Sapp) Background] chorus
(he gave us power) he gave us (ooh yes) his power
(anything) anything (he can handle) he can handle
(just ask it) just ask it (and speak it) and speak it
(that's when) that's when (you shall see it) you shall see it

[Marvin Sapp]
Times you wish that you can make your problems disappear (ooh)
times got hard things got rough and you began to fear (ooh)
Know that God is able and he'll see you through
