Don't cry
you must have heard some things about me
That made you turn away
that made you have your doubts about me.
You were hearing rumours
I can see it in your eyes

They tried to get you to believe that someone else could take your place.

You can put your faith in me
I wonder never set you free

Hold you head up high and let everybody see:
With love to guide us nothing can divide us.

Don't cry
there has to be some trust inside us
