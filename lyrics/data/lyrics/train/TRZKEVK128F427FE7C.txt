Eyes transfixed at flashing visuals
Looking without seeing
Subject for subliminal attacks
Subconscious registrations

Efficient manipulation methods
The embedded distorters
One step in the mass hypnosis
On a monumental scale

Vile embrace of the one who beholds
Robbed of thoughts and of feelings

Draining dry the very mind
All we know is what they show
Never seen - the chains that binds
Lies enslave you!
Registrations that will burn our spirits hollow
Making sure the blind stays blind

We are slaves to the subliminal
...
