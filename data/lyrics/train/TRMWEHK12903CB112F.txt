There's no rules here
I been making stuff up from the beginning
How i feel today
Is it the price i pay
For all my sinning

I'm just a lonely boy
Would you be my enemy
I'm finding little joy in repetition
This routine they call destiny

When you put me down
Revenge is the first thing on my mind
But that's just stupid, man
I need a better plan
Delicate and refined
Between thunder and lightning
There is a gap
I should have listened to the warning
I would have seen the trap
