Our love is history

I'm gonna burn the letters you were sending me.
Our love is history

I'm gonna burn the letters you were sending me.

Now listen
people
to what I have to say:
I really love him but he took my love away - you don't say.
Our love is history

I'm gonna burn the letters you were sending me. . .

When you're gonna fall in love

there's nothing you can do about it.
When you're gonna fall in love

don't you beat around the bush.
When you're gonna fall in love

now don't you fry to deny it
...
