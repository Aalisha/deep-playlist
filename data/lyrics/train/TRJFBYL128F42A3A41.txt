Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Why do you look so familiar?
I could swear that I
Have seen your face before
I think I like that you seem sincere
I think I'd like to get
To know you a little bit more

I think there's something more
Life's worth living for

Who knows what could happen?
Do what you do
Just keep on laughing
One thing's true
There's always a brand new day
I'm gonna live today like it's my last day

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
