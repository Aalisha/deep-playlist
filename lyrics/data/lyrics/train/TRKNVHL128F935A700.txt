such a night.

it was a night, oo what a night it was, it really was, such a night
the moon was bright oo how bright it was, it really was, such a night
the night was alive with stars above
and when she kissed me i had to fall in love

it was a kiss mmmm what a kiss it was, it really was, such a kiss
how she could kiss oo what a kiss it was, it really was, such a kiss
