I just can't help thinking
What you've done to me
You built a wall of love
And tore it right down in front of me

And you think you know what's going on
You keep telling me that I am wrong
I don't care about what you do
'Cause if you mess with me, I'll get rid of you

The picture you see is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown to someone, I don't know
And it's driving me wild, it makes me act like a child
