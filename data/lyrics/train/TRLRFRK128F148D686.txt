Candy is quick and she's good at impressions
She's stacked on the corner, man, she's stacked on the street
They don't make pills for that kind of depression
Counting her friends on her hands and her feet

Running as hard and as fast as you could
Mainlining paint in some place in New Jersey
Misunderstanding what was misunderstood
And that's twice as bad as love, oh
