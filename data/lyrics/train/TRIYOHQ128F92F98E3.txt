Tattooed boys with expensive toys
Living in a bubble of sin
Money can buy you most of anything
Fix your nose or the mess you're in

Front page news, you can share your views
With a population, wants to be like you
Out on the strip, out on the tiles
Same old greed behind the P.R. smiles

You and all your entourage, to me you're all the same
You and all your entourage, playing foolish games

I don't want your big city shining
I don't want your silver lining
I don't wanna be a tattooed millionaire

I don't want your big city shining
