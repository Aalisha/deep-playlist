You won't stay and you won't go
Love shouldn't be so complicated
You won't say yes, you won't say no
Yellow lights you've contemplated

Tell me when will you decide baby if it's you and I
Just can't keep me on the side forever
You think that our love is strong but I just can't keep hanging on
What you going to do when tomorrow gone forever, forever

You keep running in and out of my life
Hello goodbye, hey hey hey hey

You don't laugh and you don't cry
Love can't live without emotion
You don't reveal and you don't hide
Wearing your disguise out in the open

Tell me when will you decide baby if it's you and I
