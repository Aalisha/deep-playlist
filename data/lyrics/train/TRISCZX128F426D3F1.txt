Sometimes my hope slips away
I go through the day
Without a way to see passed the decay
To say a better day is coming got me running my mind
Wondering if I’m cunning enough to find
A new pattern of though designed
So I can deal with this land of concrete
Cause them facts are i’ll yo we’re facing defeat from the trees to the sees to the seeds of the ghetto
The fleas on the dogs back have already settled in
Won’t allow no meddeling cause they shoot
Do anything for the loot
Wicked politicians making wicked decisions
Straight lying to the public so they can begin another mission of war
Man eyes are sore
Shit’s hardcore
We can all make a change what we waiting for?
There’s a million other people who feel like I feel
Too many cats are ending up with the raw deal for real
But, I read a boek take a look
Put it all in perspective ignore the crooks
Who be rocking their politricks, while running for president
If we want their asses kicked, then let’s set a precedent
See it’s not you versus me
But it’s you and me versus the war-industry
If you’re asking me what it is that we can do
Agaist idiots like G.W. it’s follow through
Chorus:

It’s what makes you cope
