You were there down by the water on that ambush night
When all the Crass punks refused to fight
Instead too many tithed into the shooting star
Trading their lives in for glamor of tar

When I found out all my heroes are just parasites
Where are the good people compromised by the road we have to follow?

Get out, get out, get out and get away
There's no one left who can make you stay
The city's making money barricading the view
