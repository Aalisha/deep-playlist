Tight Whips

(Magic)
We Roll tight whips everyday
Bently's, lex, mercades, and escalades
We Roll tight whips everyday
Hustling to make the paper but thats ok

(504)
They say that choppa's actin funny
He aint hollar in a day
He gots his top down
On his new Z-28
(Hollar atcha boy)
but the 8 of us aint
But they like my rims (sprewell) But when i stop they keep running away
Im doin 80 in the ***lightning***
Duece tre's on shine
Dem cops done pulled me over but my rims done blinded 'em.
Plus i got 4 models in the back of my truck
18 inch bazookas bumpin my stuff
Wakin the block

(Master P)
Call me ghetto Bill cause my seats they be gucci
And when i roll through the hood I got 2 or 3 hoochies
Lou Vaton Airbags 'case I crash bad
Futuristic Kidded up like im batman
Represent the pro-jects, T.V. when i roll that
Gambling for a car note hope i dont blow that
Whoooooo

(Magic)
We Roll tight whips everyday
Bently's, lex, mercades, and escalades
We Roll tight whips every day
Hustling to make the paper but thats ok

(504)
We Roll the big body bens, and the navigator
In the hood servin drinks like im a resturant waiter
Blue lights on that jag cause i love the shine
