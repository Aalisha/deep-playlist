I was walking down the street the other day
And a sight came before my eyes
It was a little hippie boy, I must have been twice his size
His appearance typified his strange breed
Gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down
I'd seen perhaps a thousand in my early trips to town

As he walked beside me on down the block
I noticed no unpleasing smell
He might have been on the weed or even LSD
But if he was I couldn't tell

So we walked together that way through this neighborhood
Finally he turned around to me
And he, he said, "Friend, you know we're a million miles apart
But you know something we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather
So why don't we put our differences aside
And just talk to each other"
