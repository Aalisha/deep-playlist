Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes, woo
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Betty Lou, ah ooh, ah ooh, ah ooh
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well, she walked in the shoe store
She picked out a shoe
She tried on a twelve
But that wouldn't do

Betty Lou, Betty Lou
Got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou bought a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou, ah ooh, ah ooh, ah ooh
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well, she cracked up
Over the solid fit
Walking down the street
With her brand new kids
