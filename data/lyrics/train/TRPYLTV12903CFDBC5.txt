Number one son

Took a walk in the park for a laugh we had sparkling wine 
Oh yes it was dark trees could not be identified 
That girl you were with did she have you on your knees
I shut my mouth my ears I don't want to hear you please 

Now we're skipping school going to listen to records 
Wrapped up in mohair dissing your elders 
I dip a chocolate finger, take a sip from my cup 
Remembered what you're dad said "button your lip"
