some things never change
some things never change
lonely and deranged
some things stay the same

what would you say? what would you do?

what fades away for me and you

wait til you're asleep

i'll pretend, that i don't see you there
pretend, you're gone
i'll pretend, that i don't really care
pretend, you're wrong

i misunderstood the power of a guilty conscience
