Feelings you never knew
Pulling you under now
Your fighting the undertow
Before it sucks you down

Pushing the senses
It's pushing the senses now
Come on come on what are you going to do
You can't find another day
Come on come on you're pushing the senses
You're pushing the senses through ...
Always, I can depend on you
But sometimes, it's burning a hole right through
Let's talk about it ...
