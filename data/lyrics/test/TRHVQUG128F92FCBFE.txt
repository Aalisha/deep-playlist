(feat. Letha Face)

[Verse 1: U-God]
Thanks for the rap action pack satisfaction
Snatch over match kiss the grand dragon
I'm tramplin the mass riddin head champion
Back draft crash landin
Last man standing
All bodies full of swords
Cards of confusion
Killa bee guarntee
The guilotine execution
Reviloution air pollution
New budda diva fairy, beaver, be cleaver, fever, curry speaker
Sweet creature hurry knockin
Dirty rockin jockin
One stand word is thirty shell shockin
Unlockin fell through the flurries
Hurry, don't worry cherry blow
Go beyond wall rip a hardcore
Right

[chorus: U-God]
Someone's knockin at the door
Someone's brining the swell
Y'all really want the fuckin war
Golden Arms bringing the swell
Somebody knockin at the door
Somebody brinin the swell
Young guns down for the cause
Golden Arms bringin the swell
