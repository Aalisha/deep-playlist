It's sad to say it
But I think love's gonna end
Once we were lovers
And now we're not even friends

It was good to have you
Near me for a while
But we made each other happy
And we made each other smile

The worst part is the knowing
That my castle in the sky
Fell apart and it's too late
To build it up
Too late to try
You took every dream I planned on
...
