VERSE:
look up(repeat x8)
pressure everyday feels like its never goin away but still somehow in the back of my head i hear its gunna be okay it gets so hard tryna make it through life it seems true happiness is no where in sight try to handle all my myself but i know i need some help you see my heart getts heavy i cry so muchi feel like im crazy and everything that could go wrong does all at one time tell me when will i see the sunshine thats when i heard a promise to me god will supply all of my needs i belive every word is true so i know what i got to do

Group: look up!
Lead: with tears in your eyes just look to the sky
Lead & Tye: you'll find out that he was there all the time ohh oohh
