All the world is watching
All the world does care
Even when the world weighs on my shoulder now
These feelings I can bare

Because I know
That you're here

Everywhere I go
I know you're not far away
You're right here
You're right here, yeah yeah

Well, everywhere I go
I know you're not far away
You're right here
You're right here, yeah yeah

All these thoughts I've wasted
...
