Left right, left right, left right, left right
Left right, left right, left right, left right
Left right, left right, left right, left right

All my soldiers march
All my people march
All my soldiers march

All my soldiers march with me
All my soldiers march with me
All my soldiers march with me
All my soldiers march with me

He laid on his back, his firearms by his side
Hearin' no sound, just watchin' the fireworks in the sky
I walk by, look down, he's still smiling 'cause he? s done fightin',
A fallen soldier now his war? s over

Don? t matter which side is wrong or right
Some innocent lives will be lost on the battlefield tonight
So hungry to kill, only his death can curb his appetite
Live ammo hit the flesh and it feels so right

I've embellished my life, now God please tell me
