Oh
Once upon a looking-for-Donna-time
There was a sixteen year old virgin
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh
Looking for my Donna

I just got back from looking for Donna
San Francisco
Psychedelic urchin
Oh Donna oh oh Donna oh oh oh
Looking for my Donna

Have you seen
My sixteen year old tattooed woman
Heard a story
She got busted for her beauty oh oh oh
Oh oh!
