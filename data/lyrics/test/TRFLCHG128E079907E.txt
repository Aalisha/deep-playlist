I have weapons and battle plans,
But in my heart I know
I can't ever protect you from
Things I don't understand.

And when I hold you in my arms
It scares me just to
Think that something so beautiful
Could just come apart in my hands.

I've always been chasing rainbows
Staring out of classroom windows.
I don't think I'll ever be happy,
...
