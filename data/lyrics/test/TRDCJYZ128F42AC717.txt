Backstroke lover always hidin' 'neath the covers,
Till I talked to your daddy, he say.
He said you ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a muffin,
Then you're sure to be a changin' your ways.
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder,
Oh the times I could reminisce.
'Cause the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin,
Only started with a little kiss.
Like this!

Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school,
And your feet flyin' up in the air.
Singin' hey diddle diddle,
With your kitty in the middle of the swing like you didn't care.
So I took a big chance at the high school dance,
With a missy who was ready to play.
Wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what she was doin',
And I knowed love was here to stay.
When she told me to

Walk This Way
