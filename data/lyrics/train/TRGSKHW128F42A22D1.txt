Insecurities
Hid beyond the hotel lobby
While I'm forced to call this a home
Without you
So let's keep this conversation
Lingering on
Don't say good night,
Not while I am

Gone
This will be a long, long ride
And I’ll be dreaming of coming
Home
And when you are alone tonight
I’ll be writing you another song
...
