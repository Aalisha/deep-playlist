(Vassal Benford, Debelah Morgan, Giloh Morgan) 
Verse 1 
I can't believe you left me in the rain 
Come back to me, I need you in my life 
These tears of mine have washed away my smile 
I need you by my side, baby hold me tonight 
Bridge 
You promised me forever 
Forever you and me 
Say that you love me 
Say you'll never leave 
Chorus 
Tell me it's not over now 
I can't believe it's true 
Tell me it's not over now 
I'm still in love with you 
Tell me it's not over now 
Please don't say goodbye 
Tell me it's not over now 
'Cause without you I'd just die 
Verse 2 
Just one kiss, one touch is all I need
