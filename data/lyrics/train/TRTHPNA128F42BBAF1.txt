I grew up where I could see the stars
Drinking sweet tea from a mason jar
Dogwood trees like leaves through the pines
People on the porch watchin' fireflies
And drivin' round the Wal-Mart on a Friday night

I'm just a small town girl
That's all I'll ever be
I'm just a small town girl
Hey, that's all right with me

I'd rather be fishin' with Grandpa on the lake
Than gettin' all glamed up fake eyelashes on my face
Cut off jeans and an ole ball cap
...
