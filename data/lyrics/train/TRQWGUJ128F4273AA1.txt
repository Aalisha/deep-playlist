Have you ever had your dreams broken?
It really messes up your heart
You want to stop right there
And go right back to the start

You got to leave the town you're living in
Oh I'm leaving, I'm leaving on the next train
My dreams have been broken
I don't think I'll ever be the same

It's a bad, bad feeling when all the things
That you've worked for just don't seem to turn out right
Well this happened to me last night
