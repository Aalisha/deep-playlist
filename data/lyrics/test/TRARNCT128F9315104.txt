Sittin here chillin with my Cream o Wheat
I got Dearfoam slippers adornin my tiny feet
Freezin cold chillin cuz they turned off my heat
You know I'm screamin at the landlord, Pete

You know I just got fired from the Chinese Restaurant
Told you I was working hard fto buy stuff that I ain't got
So I found another job you know it's all the same
