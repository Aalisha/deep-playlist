I'm lookin' out for number one
I'm lookin' out for number one
Work and slave, sometimes succeed
Lookin' out for number one
I got hot but never got burned
Well, all I know is she should have learned
Get too close you'll fall right in
You should have known, you can't do that now
I see what's goin' on
I've known it all along
I've seen what's goin' on
I'm lookin' out for number one
Lookin' out for number one
Work and slave, sometimes succeed
