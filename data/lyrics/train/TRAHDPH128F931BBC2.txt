Jack of Shadows, nocturnal outlaw
Daemon of darkness, brother to the night
Jack of Shadows, what's he hanging out for?
King of the dimensions, the other side of light

He casts shades of mystery black
Flowing like molasses
It's only Jack of Shadows on his way back
To the kindom of thieves
Before the skies crack

Jack of Shadows, cloak of constellations
