Step off the train tracks
Get out da way
Sometimes you gotta take a step back
Sometimes you got to wait
Take a different path
To get to the same place
So when the music stops
We're all the same

Take a little time,
Maybe take a little something
Take a vacation from your mind
It's not the best, but it's better than nothing
It's a reflection of the time
