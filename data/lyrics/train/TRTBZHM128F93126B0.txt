I spent my waking hours thinking of you
Dream all through the night
It might be wrong that little thing you do
But it feels so right
Give me a memory to carry for life
A piece of you that's mine
'Cause when you're out of reach and out of sight
I want you on my mind

Midnight heartache
We're gonna get it out, round and round we go
Midnight heartache
We're gonna get it out, round and round till dawn
[x2]
