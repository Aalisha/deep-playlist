Burning cross appears, symbolizing death
Black waters stir, a painful sight
Secret faces overarc the spheres
The wind groans, seance repeats

Gorge of night, unseen woods
Shadows cast out, purgatory winds
Desert moans a silent scream
Burning cosmos, sign of the beast

Through the spheres before time
Immeasurable dimensions
Full of anger, desire and lust
The secret faces overshadow it all

Gorge of the night, unseen woods
Shadows cast out, purgatory winds
Desert moans a silent scream

Nightmares hunting the innerself
...
