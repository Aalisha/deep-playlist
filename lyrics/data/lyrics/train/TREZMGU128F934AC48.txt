Fire surrounds, searing flames lick, skin and hair bum,
human flesh burning sweet, now sauteed meat, cooked alive

Die by fire, painful death,
Flames ignite your flammable breath
Intense heat sears your soul,
Body reduced to blackened charcoal,
The bowels of hell aren't this hot,
Cremation does away with rot,
Tissues melt into burning muck,
...
