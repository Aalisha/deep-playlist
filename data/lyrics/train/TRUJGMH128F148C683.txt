My music is my flowers
And my flowers are my songs
Baby, you're my music
Baby, you're my song

Can't you see, that it's me?
And I need your love badly
Can't you see, I'm in need
And I need you so badly

Can't you see, that it's me?
And I need your love badly
Can't you see, I'm in need
And I need you so badly
