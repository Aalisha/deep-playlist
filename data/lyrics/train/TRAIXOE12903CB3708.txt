Turn another turn...

Turn another turn, sp00L...

I think therefore I am, familiar to most?
How long did we eat the seed planted by our host?
4 billion years between our ears
still hatred brings us many tears
Still we judge each other...
Why when we're only looking for the same high?

Grind time for old misconceptions.
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion.
Won't salute you. Won't desert you.
Won't be a prisoner of assumption anymore.

Does language define us? Is reality... words?
How far do we appear to be...
is the measure of... scope. But...
with our junkie soul, we face the need,
of nature's planned dependency.
