her head is full of nonsense but she says her heart is true
fool for you
to play a game with you is all she really wants to do
it's easy with you
see those eyes, see those lies
her aim is not to please, all she wants to do is tease
so cute for you
i'm feeling rather funny and i don't know who i am
i'll forget for you
forget those eyes, forget those lies
you don't care about
you don't care about
that she'll forget about
...
