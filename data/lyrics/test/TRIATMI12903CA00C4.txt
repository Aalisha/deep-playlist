You can dance-every dance with the guy,
who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight...
You can smile-every smile for the man,
who held your hand neath the pale moon light...
But don't forget who's takin' you home,
and in whose arms you're gonna be...
So darlin' save the last dance for me...

Oh I know that the music's fine
like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun...
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
...
