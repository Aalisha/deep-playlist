Got your feet wet, got your heart broke
Didn't pan out like you'd hoped
But you played fair and you swear that
Love had the damn deck stacked

And you just won't put it behind you
But you sit and you dwell on the past
Well, can't you see, you can't see tomorrow
As long as you're looking back

You had someone you could count on
