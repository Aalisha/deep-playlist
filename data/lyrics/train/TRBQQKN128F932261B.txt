Don't speak of my heart, it hurts too much -- hurts to touch
I'm writing the book each and every day
Take a look at my face, I still need -- I still bleed
I've been running on empty since you went away.

The spirit world looks down on us
Sad that we're apart
So please don't speak of my heart.

Whenever we talk she says hang on -- just hang on
Meanwhile I'm drowning in the pouring rain
And each time we meet there's a sad farewell -- sad farewell
She tells me someday I'm gonna love again.

The way that she walked out on me
Still tears me apart
So please don't speak of my heart.
