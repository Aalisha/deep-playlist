Pay close attention,
Don't listen to me from now,
George'll be flying this one,
And it's anyone's guess how he does,
This is the right turn wrong universe,
And taking me in full bloom,
Fireball careful with that there,
See what you made me do?

I must be dreaming or,
We're on to something,
I must be dreaming for,
I don't fall in love lawlessly,
I must be dreaming or,
Pinch me to waking,
So undeniably yours,
As long as I'm losing it so completely.
