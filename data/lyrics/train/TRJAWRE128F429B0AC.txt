Woke up late on that sunday morning.
woke up late yeah the sun was burning.
slides and chutes spilling explanations. slides and chutes offer alibis.

where the freeways mate and the flies congregate
there's a needle hungry for a place to sleep
where the jumpers meet in the film cloud eyes
with the doctors notes and them heavy heads we'll cry

lay my face back in the sleep finds me lazy
a fears friendly fed when you're free to be resting
birds in the sky and the rain won't soon
...
