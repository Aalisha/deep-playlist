In the overcrowded cities where the nights are bright as day
You spend your weekly paycheck and turn your eyes away
From the crisis we've created with our self-indulgent ways
Living like there's no tomorrow, well that just might be the case

Now they're tearing down the forests and the jungles of Brazil
Without a second thought about the species that they kill
But extinction is forever and still the forests fall
And push it ever closer to extinction for us all

But you're so blind to the truth, blind to the truth
And you can't see nothing
Cause you're so blind to the truth, blind to the truth
And the judgment day is coming
