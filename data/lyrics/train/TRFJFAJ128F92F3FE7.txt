Long about midnight up on Chigger Hill
Making mischief in the moonlight
Just looking for a thrill

Then the lights were coming and they're flashing blue
And the running and their gunning after you know who
Grinding out the gears in my pickup truck
Trying to get away so we don't get busted

Flying ninety miles an hour like a wild bat out of hell
Singing hallelujah with a rebel yell
Dancing with a little danger, fast and hard, wrong or right
Praying I'm just gonna make it out alive

Good Lord willing and the creek don't rise
Good Lord willing and the creek don't rise
