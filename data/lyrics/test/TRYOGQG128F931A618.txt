You sow her up so she can't feel
You shut her up so she can't heal
I see witches still burning
And the world keeps on turning

I don't know why
I don't know why I cling to this impossibility

Cowboys and Indians
could love eachother like sister and brother
when we keep on falling back out of place

Cowboys and Indians
Could love eachother like sister and brother
When it's ourselves we choose to face
