This is how we do it...
This is how we do it!
This is how we do it!

This is how we do it...
It's Friday night, and I feel all right
The party is here on the Westside
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it!"
It feels so good, in my hood, tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
