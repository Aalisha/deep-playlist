This is the Last Show
I will ever play with you
this is the end of what you put me through
the Last Show i will ever play with you
this is the end of what we do...

I don't want fame, I don't want money
I just want to have fun again
I don't want girls, or backstage parties
I just want to feel like we're friends
I think I've learned my lesson
I think I've figured this whole thing out
this is a fine profession
but it's no fun
so i'm done

This is the Last Show
I will ever play with you
this is the end of what you put me through
...
