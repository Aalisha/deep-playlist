Does your friend have a friend, with some legs and an interest in the things that I say?
That's her blowing smoke ring, and alone you can't imagine the things
Well I'll talk and you will listen cause you know, you know that I care
I'll talk and you will feel it... cause I'm here
Woah-oh oh oh oh oh-wa-oh woah-oh oh oh-wa
It means all oh all the world just to meet her, to meet here
oh-wa-oh
But it's not my failt if it happens, not to me
...
