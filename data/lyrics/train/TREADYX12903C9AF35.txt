Turn on the TV, 'Cause I got nowhere to go
Seems that there's a little trouble down in Mexico
A 13-year-old boy robs a store so he can eat
And they got him doing time while killers walk the streets

A hungry politician is the wolf that's at the door
Hell-bent on submission and feedin' on the poor
We could stare into the sun if we would open up our eyes
But we paint ourselves into a corner colored in white lies

Busted on a rockpile
Getting dusted in the heat
Shackled to the system
And draggin' my feet

I'm riding on a breakdown
Another whiteknuckled shakedown
Feels like I'm livin' on a chain gang
I'm riding on a breakdown
...
