We've known each other for quite some time and I can tell you are confused
Don't really know what to make out of me or what I'm gonna do with you

I could be an agent of fortune, I could be a bad luck charm
I could take you to heaven or I could do you harm

Am I sent from Heaven or spawn of Hell?
Well, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know and I won't tell
