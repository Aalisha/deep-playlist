I draw a circle 
i’m inviting you in 
just one last step and then let me begin
you’ve got another chance before you start the game 
you crossed the line
now you can’t get away 
believe in your eyes 
this is for real
you’ve come to dance with the devil 
close the deal 
go 
just start and you will go down
stay in the corner 
ready for another round 
from behind my back is what i hate most
don’t come too close 
...
