Swiss beats
DC, Destiny Child (Slim Thug)

You need to stop playing round with all them clowns and the wangstas
Good girls gotta get down with the gangstas
Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

Oooh boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over check up on it, I might let you work up on it
Ladies let em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

If you got it, flaunt it, boy I know you want it
While I turn around you watch me check up on it
Oh you watchin me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin, you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin, I'ma let you have it
You think that I'm teasin, but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please you, but first I gotta read you

Oooh boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it, I might let you work up on it
Ladies let em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight
