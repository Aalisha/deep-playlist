Woke up this morning feeling bad
Thinking 'bout the times I once have had
You went out, stayed all night
Do you think that's treating me right?

'Cause you should not do it, you dog
Shouldn't do it, you dog, shouldn't do it, you dog
I'm telling these lovers
How to be strutting that thing night and day

Had your mama doodling around for 'em a while
Shook a dozen ribs down this aisle
Deacon Jones gave 'em to pray
Too much religion is what have had

Go to heaven, gotta stop this stuff
'Cause you been strutting that thing
Night and day, night and day
I mean, there's Jenny Lou
Out there strutting that thing night and day
...
