You can't judge the love by the lover
The sky by it's thunder
The road with no sign

You can't make the snow fall in summer
Or make him not want her
Not leave it behind

Maybe you'll stay in touch years down the road
And hope that he's still in your mind

The sun may come up and go down again
I'll still swear it's a beautiful life

Maybe we'll meet up in denver
Talk about weather
Talk of old times
...
