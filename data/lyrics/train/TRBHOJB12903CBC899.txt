[Chorus: All]
We gonna rock to express, our methods to the catch
The pitcher at hand here, but we too best
You see the mark is a charge, the rappers are ours
So rock from ya lumber, we came here to rock!

[All]
Right about this time!

[Frukwan]
We make ya shake and shiver
The devastatin' rhymes we can deliver
And ya sucka M.C.'s, to us ya a minus
We dominate the charts 'cause we are the world finest
Kings, who sat and heard Doug E. Fresh
And ya convicted to jail, now here's ya lesson
Stetsasonic, a name you will never forget

[Daddy-O]
But if you can't say it all!

[All]
Just Say Stet!

[Daddy-O]
Never were we meant to be ordinary
The way we rap is unique and legendary
Explicitally mapped, Stetsa, terrific
