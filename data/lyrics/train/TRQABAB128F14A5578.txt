So what exactly are you saying
You'd like to live your life between the sheets?
No destination
The hour's getting way past getting late.
To find the public opinion
You're talking big it comes to easily
I'm not prepared to entertain
You salivate when someone tells it straight.

You're young enough to always push your luck.
I keep my fingers crossed you keep em up.

Got a reason to get up this morning
Got inspired by the fear of being last
Don't deny your criminal past
Got a reason to get up this morning
Got inspired by the fear of being last
Don't deny your criminal past
