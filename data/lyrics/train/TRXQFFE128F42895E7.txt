The ship is hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh and
I don't know if they'll make it down
But im gonna try to slip inside the mind of a clown
To follow meeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Thinking I can save them
To Follow meeee
Thinking that I can turn a frownâ€¦
Into a smiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiile
Into a smiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiile
Whoo whoo
