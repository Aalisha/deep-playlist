talk to me
i am here to say farewell my son
now talk to me
i'm your season running out
i offer my equations
for everything you stole
and i claim now my expenses
i'm your private vertigo

you don't breathe anymore
when i walk out the door
something older than love
waiting right in the line of the storm
