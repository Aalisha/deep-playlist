I watched the planes come in
on the early morning flights

But I could not stand to see them land without you.
Now I'm thumbing through my fortyfives on another endless night

And the same old lines
going back in time

Tell me this is nothing new.

Well
I feel like Buddy Holly 'cause it's Raining In My Heart
