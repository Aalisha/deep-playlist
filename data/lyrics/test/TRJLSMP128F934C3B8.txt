The blackened city calls out
Enter the temple of sin
You must enter the temple of sin

Contorted sinners beckon
Join our twisted rites
You must join our twisted rites

The priests eyes gleam
Blood on their scepters of flesh
There is blood on their scepters of flesh

The nubile virgin bows
Await the piercing thrust
She awaits the piercing thrust

Perverse rites
Priests of Sodom preside
We are damned

Praise the gods of sin
