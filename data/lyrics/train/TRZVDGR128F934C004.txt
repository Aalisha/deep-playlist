We got somethin' we both know it
We don't talk too much about it
Ain't no real big secret all the same
Somehow we get around it

Listen, it don't really matter to me baby
You believe what you want to believe
You see you don't have to live like a refugee
(Don't have to live like a refugee)
Yeah

Somewhere, somehow, somebody
Must have kicked you around some
Tell me, why you wanna lay there
Revel in your abandon
