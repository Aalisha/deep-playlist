The moon is down
And heaven is waiting
For us to find her in our sites
With focus that's strong
But my strength keeps slipping

Now we're all the terminal cases
(We're all the terminal cases)
But we're so determined to thrive
And those with defeat on their faces
(Those with defeat on their faces)
Are those that we must keep alive
And I admire your strength
You keep us going on
You keep us going on
...
