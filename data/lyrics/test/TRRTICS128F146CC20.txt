I would shine just like a million suns if you'd just love me baby
I'll be in your life again so baby, baby just say maybe

Now here I come
To dance around the sun
I've been oh so blue
Stuck behind the moon
Now let me in
Back where we begin
And let me hold you like the way
I used to do

All the stars point me to you and lately they just drive me crazy
A universe can be so cruel so baby, baby be my lady
