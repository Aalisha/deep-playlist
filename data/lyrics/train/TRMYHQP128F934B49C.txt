Feel the razors tickle the skin
A hundred cuts release the blood
When the scalpel carves the flesh

Chainsaw the instrument for pain
Use the saw to cut the limbs
Body parts float in blood

Through the flesh, into the bones, total mutilation in blood
Carnal pain opening the skull, the crushed head starts to burst
Mangled skin falls apart, flesh-like human waste
