Baby likes to rock like a boogey woogey choo choo train!

(Ahh look out)

You know she likes to take me dancin' on the outskirts of town
Where the music's turned up and the lights are turned down
Shakin'--shakin'--shakin' on the dance--dance floor
Crowd--crowd--screamin'--screamin'--more--more--more
She got the boogie woogie woogie spread all over the place
She's got it stacked to the ceilin'--got it stickin' in your face
Ya know my baby likes to rock it like a boogie woogie choo choo train

Johnny's in the back room suckin' on his gin
Police are at the front door screamin' let me in
