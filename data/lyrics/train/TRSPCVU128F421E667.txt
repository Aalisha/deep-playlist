Something more graceful felt like leading you to war
It sounds so distasteful, more than what you're fighting for
More flights of stairs derailed, your ascent it falls so slow
Your body and love impaled on the spikes you left below

Grief turned to currency just like midas touched it black
Like rage in its infancy, you're afraid it might turn back
A flag slashed by injured nights in a fist outside your past
Waves only eclipsed by fright in its glory at half-mast
