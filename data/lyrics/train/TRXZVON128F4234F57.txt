Don't got no goatee
Don't got no tattoo
Don't got no nose ring
Don't wanna be like you

See I got these glasses
So I'll never be cool
Always get my ass kicked
When I get to school

Don't worry about an image
Don't got no attitude
I know I won't get laid
If I won't be like you

Don't got no biceps
Don't got no pecs
But I'll read you under the table
With my thick specs

See I got these glasses
So they kick my ass
...
