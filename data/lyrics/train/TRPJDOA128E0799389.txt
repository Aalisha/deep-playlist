Let's run and hide

I know the stars like the dark
Somewhere in this void of sky
It feels like thousand eyes
So baby, let's run and hide

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Oh, yeah

One single hole in the ice
We dived in with
One little glimpse, paradise
I gave into you, ooh
I knew heaven right there (right there)

One private kiss, stung my lips
Now I'm stuck on you, and who cares
I just want to do it, want to shoot
'Cause you're a trigger for me, I'm a sucker for you
Nothing can stop this feeling (ooh)

Let's get carried away, lost in the dark

I know the stars like the dark
...
