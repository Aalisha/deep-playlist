Quiet down now, hush hush my friend
Quiet down now, hush hush my friend
When all the others left, when all the others left
When all the others left, when all the others...
I know you'd stick around, come here now
I know you'd stick around, come here now
When all the others talked, when all the others talked
When all the others talked, when all the others...
You'd always been my habit now
Colored bees, and stomach aches,
Your friend's in need, and lovers quakes
My best friend, my, my very best friend,
My best friend, my, she never left my side
...
