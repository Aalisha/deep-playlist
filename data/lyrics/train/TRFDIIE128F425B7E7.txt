Where you off to with that head of yours?
Is there somewhere you should be?
Was it something that I said the time I held you down
And told you it's not you, it's only me? Maybe

Don't take what I don't need
 (Give me back my piece of mind)
Don't say what I don't mean
 (Give me back my precious time)
No way you'll silence me, you'll see

What you up to now your mirror's gone?
Is there someone you should be?
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you?
But honestly, but honestly, but honestly

Don't take what I don't need
...
