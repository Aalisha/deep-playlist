You don't even have to try, it comes easy for you
The way you move is so appealing, it could make me cry
Go out drivin' with my friends in Bobby's big old beat up car
I'm with a lot of people then I wonder where you are

Good times, bad times, gimme some of that
Good times, bad times, gimme some of that
Good times, bad times, gimme some of that

I don't wanna say, "Goodbye"
