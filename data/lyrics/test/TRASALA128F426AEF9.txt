Why, why can't we live this love she hides so deep inside?
I know she feels the same I do
Now there are so many reasons why this story dies
My heart didn't want to hear
Love you... love not...

Loving, spending tears in vain
I'm slowly growing stronger
So now I know I'm wrong each time
Breathing, I recall your name
