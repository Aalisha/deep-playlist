Said i be down in the city
walkin' around lookin' for someone
to be my victim to lay my
troubles on
maybe a leader someone that'll
teach me
the ways of the road
the way to survive this hellhole
when the grass is green
Chorus
when the grass is green
i'll be swimmin' in a zone
i just dread to be alone
'cause i'm afraid of me
