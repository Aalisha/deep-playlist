In the beginning there was silence
and darkness, all across the earth.
Then came the wind, and a hole in the sky.
Thunder and lightning keep crushing down,
hit the earth and split the ground,
fire burning high in the sky.

From down below, fire melted the stone,
the ground shook, and started to pound.

The gods made heavy metal,
and they saw that it was good.
They said to play it louder than hell,
we promised that we would.
When loosers say its over with,
you know that its a lie.
The gods made heavy metal,
and its never gonna die.

We are the true believers,
its our turn to show the world,
in the fire of heavy metal,
we were burnt.
It's more than our religion,
it's the only way to live,
but the enemies of metal,
we can't forgive.
