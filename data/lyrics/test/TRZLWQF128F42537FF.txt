Do you believe in heaven or do you believe in pain?
A sanctuary built for the mischosen
Is it the final contradiction or just an irony of fate?
Doomed we are to drown in an empty ocean

In Misery's dawn...
Can't you see?

God's forgotten children struggle for their lives
While innocent convictors celebrate the knive
...
