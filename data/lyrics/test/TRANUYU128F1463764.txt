Dive into yesterday, dive into yesterday
Dive into yesterday

Now since his disappearance through the smoke rings of
our time
While the plaster jester is speaking out of tune
In moonlight swimming madness deep within aladdin's
cave
But with good old diamonds dancing, we can all smile
too soon

Oh swing and sway, the petals say
Turn inside and out and please
