Living in dreams, day dreaming
Not in good shape for a life
Can't remember, why I like this feeling
Falling, falling on knives

Words can boost, words can break
Smiling sins can do no wrong
Say something good, if you speak
Good news never last too long

Forget the time too often
And I don't care to get some sleep
It's the skull I aim to soften
From there inside of you I'll creep

What did I expect to find
Dreams are not the same as life
More than the world inside my mind
Dreams empty into my life
