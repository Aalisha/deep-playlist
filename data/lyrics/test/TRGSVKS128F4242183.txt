Enter the archaic abattoir...

Exiled to a pernicious wasteland
My gray matter a thirst
Compelled to restore my deathcamp
Love for surgery in me

A man made predator revealed amidst
The last moiety of humanity in me is stripped
Feeding of a defunct social mess
Enumerate the dead left for you to explore

Abhorrent studies set forth in the abattoir
Intrinsic desecration of a fetid cadaver
...
