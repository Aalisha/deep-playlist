Girl, I swear you dang near took my breath
The way you sashayed in this bar all by yourself
You say you've heard about me
And all my ramblin' ways
If I could have a gal like you
I'd change today.

I've been called an old tomcat
Been in and out of this and that
I hugged 'em, I kissed 'em, I loved 'em
And I left 'em behind
But I'd do right by you
If you was mine
I'd spend all my time
Walkin' the line.
