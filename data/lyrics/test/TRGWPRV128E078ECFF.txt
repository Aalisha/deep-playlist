Aerosmith
 
 Dulcimer Stomp/The Other Side
 come on
 lovin' you has got to be
 (take me to the other side)
 like the devil and the deep blue sea
 (take me to the other side)
 forget about your foolish pride
 (take me to the other side)
 oh take me to the other side
 (take me to the other side)
 my mama told me there'd be days like this
 and man she wasn't foolin'
 'cause I just can't believe the way you kiss
 uh huh
 you opened up your mouth with baited breath
 you said you'd never leave me
 you love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss
 you're cryin' me a river but I got to get across
 lovin' you has got to be
 (take me to the other side)
 like the devil and the deep blue sea
 (take me to the other side)
