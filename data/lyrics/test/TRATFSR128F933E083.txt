In the littlest hours 'tween the dusk and dawn
While the nightlight glows with the music on
You could climb so high in the dreamtime sky
And go anywhere

In that sometime place ever lost somehow
In the here and gone or the there and now
Did it all go bust â€” crumble down in dust
Or just slip away

Paging Audrey
Any random star
Lost and lonely
Somewhere very far
Paging Audrey
