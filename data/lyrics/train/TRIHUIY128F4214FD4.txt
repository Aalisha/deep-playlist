Said, I've been around the world
Wrote a million songs, it's all a bore to me
I've slept in the gutter and I've lied with the dogs
It never bothered me

Said, the sheriff he come too with his little boys in blue
They been lookin' for me, child
But with my crystal sheen guitar, I'm another ego star
So give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, yeah, yeah

Get me to the stage, it brings me home again
This is Shangrila
I'm trippin' on it now, it brings me home again
