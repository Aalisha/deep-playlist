Alone in the dark, I feel like I'm drowning
Hope I'll see a light to guide me to morning
I'm gasping for breath, the temperature's falling
Can you hear me calling?
I'm searching for heaven

Sent on a mission to rescue your kind
I've seen so many things I've wished I was blind
I'm floating through space, I'm diving through time
Lived millions of lives, none of them mine
Why did I fail here I'll never know
Now I'm drowning in an ocean of desolate souls
