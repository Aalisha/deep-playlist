Oh Lordy me
I feel so bad this mornin'
A but I won't be feelin' bad too long
I'm headed for Hangover Tavern

My head is heavy
My spirit's kinda of low
And every time I feel this way
To Hangover Tavern I go

Well, this bar I'm talkin' about
The shades are pulled down
To keep the sunshine out
The beer is poured in a frosty cup
