Impoverished inner workings
Solitary, dejected hollow shell
Ridiculed by your peers
Frustrations consuming all waking moments
Delusions and anxiety riddle the mind

Turning on yourself slicing vulnerable tissue
Compulsive neurosis dominating you

Emotionally starved, obsessions contrived
Fabricating a whole new world
Imprisoned within, hallucinations solidify
Empty feeling of dread
...
