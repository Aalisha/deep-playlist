(Kenneth Gamble / Leon Huff)

Used to be a time
When I wasn't doin' so good
But that was because I never understood
Just how much in love with me you were
But you paid your dues
Now I'm devoted to you

You're the star of my show
Always want you to do an encore
You're the star of my show, ooh, baby, baby
