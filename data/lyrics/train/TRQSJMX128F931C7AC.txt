Sometimes I feel like
Throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying
Lord I just don't care
You've got the love I need
To see me through

Sometimes it seems that
The going is just too rough
And things go wrong
No matter what I do
Now and then it feels
Like life is just too much
You've got the love
I need to see me through

When food is gone
You are my daily meal
When friends are gone I know
My savior's love is real
Your love is real

Sometimes I feel like
Throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying
Lord I just don't care
You've got the love I need
