Yea 1998 Fun Factory's back in the house with a brand new cut
here we go – boom
Hey – ho – hey – ho 
yea yea yea
Take a look at the old and check the new
party people in the house we're doin' it just for you
come on jump jump and scream and shout
yea we're gonna turn it out
and if you wanna party like I know you do
come on loud 'cause we're doin' this just for you
and to the people in the house if you wanna dance
put your hands in the air like you just don't care
Well it's I'm on the mic tryin' to make 'em hot
hey give 'em what you like
keep 'em hands real high with the flow reel rock
tick tack hip hop workin' the beat don't stop
just groove till it makes you hot
now move even pack the sky
it's the Fun Factory in the place to be
so come on got to rock with me
