Well if you're lookin' for the best
Then baby be my guest
I'm right before your eyes
I'm a-tellin' you no lies

You wanted my disease
You'll have to do as I please
You'll jump off the roof if I say
I won't let you get away

It must have been the devil in me
I don't know what else it could be

Tunnel of love (tunnel... of... love)
Tunnel of love
Let me visit your tunnel of love (tunnel love)
Tunnel of love (tunnel... of... love)
Tunnel of love
I've got to visit your tunnel of love (tunnel love)
