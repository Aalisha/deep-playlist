Oh yeah

I put you in the flyest gear making sure you're tight
Perpetrating making you think every thing's alright
Call you on my cell phone even on my time
The crazy things I do for love

Bouncin' baby acting like money ain't a thing
Only if you promise, girl you will try no game
Kiss me, girl and I'll spend every dollar to my name
The crazy things I do for love

Movies haning out spending time anything my girl wants
Phone calls, money cards, shoping malls, nothing's ever to much
I know I can't afford it, baby but I'll do the best I can, lady
'Cause you my everything one day with my ring I'll do all for you, baby

I put you in the flyest gear making sure you're tight
Perpetrating making you think every thing's alright
Call you on my cell phone even on my time
The crazy things I do for love

Bouncin' baby acting like money ain't a thing
