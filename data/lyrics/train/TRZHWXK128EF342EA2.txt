I love the east, I love the west
And north and south, they're both the best
But I'll only go there as a guest
'Cause I love being here with you

I love the sea, I love the shore
I love the rocks and what is more?
With you they'd never be a bore
'Cause I love being here with you

Singin' in the shower, laughin' by the hour
Life is such a crazy game
Love all kinds of weather, as long as we're together
...
