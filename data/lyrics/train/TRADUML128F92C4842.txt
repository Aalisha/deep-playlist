I guess you'd say
(Ladies and gentlemen, take it to the dance floor right now)
What can make me feel this way
(We gonna do a so so now)
(We gonna party like a three day weekend)

It's Friday night and I got stacks
The club was crunk, jammed packed
Mrs. Bartender what drink is that
T-Pain 'Buy A Drink', playin' in the back

Girl, tell me your name again 'cause I forgot
It's way too many y'all up in this spot
But you can love club, come 'round 3
Lose your girlfriends 'n' you can leave with me

First round up your friends
Jump in the car, take her to the club
Take her to the bar, take her to the floor
Let 'em know who you are party like a rock star

Let's shut the club down
We gonna shut the club down
(Aye)
Let's shut the club down
We gonna shut the club down
(Aye)

Let's shut the club down
We gonna shut the club down
(Aye)
Let's shut the club down
We gonna shut the club down
(Aye)

I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday
(Woah oh)

Man, I like my beat down low
I'm a drive slow
