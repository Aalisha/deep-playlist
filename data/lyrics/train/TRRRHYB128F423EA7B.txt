the rhythm of the rain gives an off beat on the window pane
like an angel crying from the sky
I can see its beauty after the snow
I can see its beauty after the snow

the temperature's dropping rapidly
normal service will shortly be resumed
I can see its beauty after the snow
I can see its beauty after the snow
after the snow
