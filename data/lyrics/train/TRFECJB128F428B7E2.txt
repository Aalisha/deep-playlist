Day by day by day oh
Livin' day by day oh...

I want to make it in life
I want the chance to be right
I want to make it in my life
I want the children to see
They have the right to be free
I want to see it in my life

Born and raised in Babylon
Under lock and key
Still they keep the pressure on
Trying to control me

Can't make it alone
I don't want to wait in vain
Together we're strong
Believe it and we'll break the chain

Day by day by day oh
Livin' day by day oh...
