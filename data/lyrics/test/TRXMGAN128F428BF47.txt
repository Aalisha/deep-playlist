Slave to habit, a bottle, a pill-what will you do?
DEMAND INDEPENDENCE
You're losing your mind and you're losing your will
Is that really you?
"Hey I'm just growing up, I'm just having fun"
You're just on the run
You reach for excuses, but there are none
Should've never begun
Demand independence
NO WAY-won't walk into that maze
NO WAY-watch the fire blaze
NO WAY-it's just so damn cliched
So what will we do?
