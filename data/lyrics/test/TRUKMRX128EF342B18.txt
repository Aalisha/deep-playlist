No I never knew you
We both went to different schools
Me so scared of the rules
You chasing all the girls

But it seems to me
We never grew up we just got ourselves free
Inventing what we could be
To buy all their curls

Get up and dance
Get up and smile
Get up and drink to the days
Ones that are gone in the shortest while

She was just eighteen she collapsed
And they took her away
She didn't make it for more than an hour
Then she was gone
