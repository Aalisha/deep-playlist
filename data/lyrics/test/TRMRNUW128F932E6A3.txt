Celia
See what you've done
See what you've done
See what you've done to someone
Oh girl you was looking so good
Actin' so smart
You took the man's heart and then you broke it
You had your fun, fun for a day
You took him to your room and then you sent him
On his way
Celia
See what you've done
See what you've done
See what you've done to someone
