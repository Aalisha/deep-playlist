When I see her comin' down the street
I get so shaky and I feel so weak
I tell my eyes look the other way
But they don't seem to hear a word I say

And I, go to pieces and I wanna hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Everytime my baby passes by...

I tell my arms they'll hold someone new
Another love that will be true
But they don't listen, they don't seem to care...
