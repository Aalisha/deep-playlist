That big river's still rollin' through Memphis
And on Beale street they still play the blues
The smokie's still wear their halos
It's heaven on earth in the mornin' dew

They still make Jack Daniels in Lynchburg
On the Opry, Mr Acuff's still keen
You can get the best biscuits and gravy
And Loretta can still really sing

But there's no love in Tennessee
At least not the kind I really need
The folks here will gladly give you a helpin' hand
But they can't help me get you back again
