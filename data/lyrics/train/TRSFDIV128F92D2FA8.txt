When I saw your face,
Love hit me.
And there was no way I could run
But my lonelyness was over
And my life had just begun.
When I saw your smile
Love hit me.
And I just couldn't turn away.
I was hypnotised by your beauty
And I just had to stay.
Baby let your love shine on
Keep it burning all night long
You can really turn me on
Oh, honey you're the only one.
Baby let your love shine on
Keep it burning all night long.
