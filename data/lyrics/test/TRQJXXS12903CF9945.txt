Some say it's better off this way
Now it's over
You say, "The future's looking gray
If it's over"

Yeah, there's sorrow as we break
But it's over
Yeah, we've had all we could take
So it's over

Stow away memories of yesterday
To think over
Run away, the truth you can't betray
Or pushover

Yeah, there's silence as we break
...
