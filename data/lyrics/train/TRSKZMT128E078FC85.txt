ill just tell you now
cuz i dont think you know
the things you tried to kill
i found a way to grow
ill just tell you now
you may have made your mark
but im still here today
knowing who you are
ill just tell you now
ill just tell you now (dont want to dissapoint you)
youre not the city of god (or be one to annoy)
you cant strike me down (but it wont go away now)
from your mountain top (and heres the reasons why)
ill just tell you now (you took my intuition)
your not the city of god (my knowledge of the truth)
you cant shoot me down (the love i had in this world)
