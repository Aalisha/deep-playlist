All I see, fruits of my own labor
All in vain, all for nothing real
All I taste, disappoints in flavor
What I know is fighting what I feel

This is no time to be distracted
Time lost can never be regained
Don't let yourself become attracted
This need has got to be restrained

Where is the treasure?
I know there is one
I've looked everywhere under the sun
I'll search, and I'll fail, and be dead when I'm done
But I've looked everywhere under the sun
