Somethin's wrong with my life I'm crazy
Somethin's hard on my mind, guess who
It's tough to live with the lights on maybe
All we need is a spine for you

Somethin's wrong with my mind and I'm angry
Somethin's hard on my life guess who?
It's tough to light what we live for maybe
All we need is a spine for you

Super guy is a long way baby
Mr Man's not as tired of you
Procrastination's the long way maybe
All we need is a spine for you

Bam, I'd like to bash you in your head
Damn, I can't make sense of what you've said
