I never been who I wanted to be
I never felt completely free
No ones ever had all of me
Or made me feel so beautiful and sexy

Now I'm flyin like an airplane
Now I'm ridin on the open range
Now I'm livin out my destiny
I know the truth,
I got it all in you and me

Ohhhhhh.I'm giving myself over to you
Body and soul
I'm giving it over
I'm giving myself over to you now

Like a brand new day
now you and I, we're the face of fame
Ain't nobody got nothing to say, no
And from my feelings
I never have to run away
No more
Because he's here
Holding me tight
Now every day and night
Oh baby
...
