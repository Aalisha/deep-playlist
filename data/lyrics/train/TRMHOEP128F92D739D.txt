I don't know what you're gonna say
But you know about last night
I had sex with another girl
It's been well?

I don't know what you're gonna do
Maybe you'll kick me out from your life
I have nothing to say to justify
What I've done last night

I? will try the way tomorrow
To the moment dance the place away
...
