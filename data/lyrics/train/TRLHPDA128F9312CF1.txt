Callin' out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancin' in the streets
They're dancin' in Chicago
Down in New Orleans, up in New York City

All we need is music (Sweet music)
Sweet music (Sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere (Everywhere)
There'll be swingin' and swayin' and records playin'
And dancin' in the streets, oh

It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy grab a girl (Come on)
Everywhere around the world, there'll be dancin'
They're dancin' in the street

This is an invitation across the nation
