When the door shuts don't worry about me
it's not attention that I want from you
I need you to trust who I'm gonna be
and in everything I'm going to do

Cuz I'm not afraid of what I don't know
for understanding is all that I earn
what is for sure is I'm going to go
I'm going to live and I'm going to learn...

And I know there will be mistakes that I will make...
...
