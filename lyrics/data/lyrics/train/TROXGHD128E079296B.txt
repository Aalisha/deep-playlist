You're strutting into town
like you're slinging a gun
just a small town dude
with a big city attitude
honey are you looking for some trouble tonight
well alright
You think you're so bad
drive the women folk wild

shoot 'em all down with a flash
of your pearly smile
honey but you met your match tonight

well that's right

You think you'll knock me off my feet
till I'm flat on the floor
till my heart is crying Indian
and I'm begging for more
so come on baby

come on baby
come on baby show me

what that loaded gun is for
If you can give it I can take it
'cause if this heart is gonna break
it's gonna take a lot to break it
'cause I know tonight

somebody's gonna win the fight
So if you're so tough
come on and prove it
...
