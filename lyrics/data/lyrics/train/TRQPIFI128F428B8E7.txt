Frustration is breathing down my neck
It's right behind, just like a shadow
Frustration keeps me company
Wherever I walk it seem to follow

When I turn around, see all these people
Waiting for salvation to come
And if you take a look, they're moving like robots
Waiting for directions from someone

Turn, gotta turn it, let's turn
Turn the world upsidedown
Turn, gotta turn it, let's turn
Turn the world upsidedown

I'm stuck as I, well, as I stand and watch
