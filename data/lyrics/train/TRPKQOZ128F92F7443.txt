Disappear!

I remember the first time
But it wasn't the last time that you told me that
You'd take me back
So I'm still wondering why
It was ever a question
Should've learned my lesson
I keep coming back
Like a heart attack
That's always breaking

I can't let you vanish
There's no magic
When you're gone

You say you don't need me
You say there's something beneath me
I'm not gonna let you disappear
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna believe it
I'm not gonna let you disappear
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
