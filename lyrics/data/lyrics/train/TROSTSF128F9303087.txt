Well, look-a there, look-a there
Look-a there, look-a there, ooh wee
Look-a there, look-a there
Look-a there, ooh wee

Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah! Ooh wee

Well, she's so fine, fine, fine
She's so fine, f-f-fine
She's so fine
She's so fine, fine, fine

She's really sweet
The finest girl you ever wanna meet

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Reet petite
The finest girl you ever wanna meet

Well, have you ever seen a girl for whom your soul you'd give
For whom you'd fight for, die for, pray to God to live
