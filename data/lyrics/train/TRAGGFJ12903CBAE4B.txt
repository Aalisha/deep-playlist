Save me, I can't be saved
I won't
I'm a president's son
I don't need no soul

All the soldiers say
"It'll be alright
we may make it through the war
if we make it through the night."
All the people, they say:
"What a lovely day, yeah, we won the war.
May have lost a million men, but we've got a million more."
All the people, they say.

Share with me all of your pain
I won't
Share your love
...
