Woah now, retaliation
Singing woah now, we a go wake up the nation
Radio retaliation, it's such a different corporation
We taking over your station and we a go change the vibration

People fi get up and pump them fist when sleepy talk
Hear mi transmission whether you drive or whether you walk
Put up me antenna inna the middle of the park
And transmit mi signal inna the light and inna the dark

Radio retaliate, and never ever get caught
And change the stereotype of people's wash over thoughts
Fifty thousand watts of Thievery hit them like poison darts
And watch the whole system what them build up fall apart

Singing woah now retaliation
...
