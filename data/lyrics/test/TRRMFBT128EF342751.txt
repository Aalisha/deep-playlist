Lurking, he knows your face
He waits and bides his time
Mind clocks your every move
'Till you step out of line
Stalking streets by night
Pushing guns by day
He knows it isn't right
But he wants to make his name
He's working harder
Gotta make another, make another martyr

Hide your eyes
They're moving closer
But you know you're not allowed to look them in the face
Hide your eyes
Cos' you're the loser
Before you even start to run you've lost the race
