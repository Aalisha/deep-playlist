World is calling, patience falling
Distant dreams and thoughts of you
Time is wasted in far off places
Wish I could fly and be with you

No time for sentimental thoughts in my head
Do you keep me in your dreams, can you hear me calling
Hear me calling

And I know you're there
I search the stars
To see your face lit in the sky
I love this place and I know why
You're always there in my mind
But I wish that I could hear
You're silly voice sing in my ear
Hold you're hand and hold you near
...
