Every single time I come to this town
It brings out the worst in me
Decadence dries deep in the root of mine eyes
To bring out a thirst in me
Bust in to Burbank and buy a big beef jerky on Barham
Stare into the stockyard
Life in this car out on the road
Can be so easy
Then in the evening time
There's a welcome sight
In my lazy dream
I'm still hoping to find
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
Hansel and Gretel turning tricks
For the big bad wolf on Sunset
In front of the health food store
...
