Sometimes we only live for the here and now
Sometimes we're lonely
Sometimes we feel we need a place to be grounded
Or fly away again

I will fly away again
Oh, I will fly away again

I feel rain pourin' down
I wait to rot
Rot away
Live again
Here forever
The spiral never ends
Never ends

Why are we feeling something's familiar around us?
Are we just dreaming?
Always we search for the answers but nothing is found
...
