I guess I'll always love you
You've got the love I need
You've got the love I need

Open up your arms
And let me walk on in
Open up your heart
And let me live again

When you left, you left with me
A dream no longer reality
I live the shadows of our past
With this love that's born to last

I guess I'll always love you
...
