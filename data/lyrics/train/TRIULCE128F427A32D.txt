Everything must change
(Everything must change)
Everything must change
(Nothing is forever)
Everything must change
(Everything must change)
Everything must change
(Nothing is forever)
Everything must change
(Everything must change)
Everything must change
(Nothing is forever)
Everything must change
(Everything must change)

What is it that makes a person wanna stay in power forever?
What is it that makes a person wanna stay in power forever?
What is the reason for a man to wanna force his will upon a lot?
What is the reason for a man to wanna force his will upon a lot?

Oh!
Everything must change
(Everything must change)
Everything must change
(Nothing is forever)
Everything must change
(Everything must change)
Everything must change
(Nothing is forever)
Everything must change
(Everything must change)
Everything must change
(Nothing is forever)
Everything must change
(Everything must change)
Nothing is forever

Jonasi Savimbi why don't you get away from here
Jonasi Savimbi why don't you get away from here
Heyyy Charlie Taylor why don't you get away from here
Hey Charlie Taylor why don't you get away from here
Arap Moi when are you gonna say goodbye
Arap Moi when are you gonna say goodbye
