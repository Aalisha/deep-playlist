Our generation sees the world
Not the same as before.
We might as well just throw it all

And live like there's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow
There's no tomorrow

We are the ones
Who are living under the gun, everyday.
You might be gone before you know.

So live like there's no tomorrow
...
