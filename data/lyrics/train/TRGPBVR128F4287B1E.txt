Oh, I don´t know what I do, babe
I reach out to you and I hope that you´ll help me to be a success
I can´t handle it if you´re nor there, I couldn´t settle for less
´Cause I need somebody special to help me enjoy all the fame
Someone to help me face the crowds, who loves me for more than my name

Masquerade - it would be a masquerade, I would be so afraid
If you weren´t there to help me share

You´ve been around to all the bad times when I couldn´t pay the rent
