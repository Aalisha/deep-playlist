I'm tired of getting postcards, and tired of paying long distance bills. Baby, be back soon.
I'm tired of dreaming of sex and tired of not being able to show my skills. Baby be back soon.
Over and over I hear you in the halls.
Over and over I wake up with my pillows in my arms.
Oh baby when you coming home.
A day without you is a day without the sun.
I've been missing out on your love and your shadows.
And I can't wait much longer babe, without you near I'm going crazy. Be back, be back, be back soon.
Yeah.

I'm tired of walking alone and tired of seeing happy couples walking by. Yeah. Baby be back soon.
