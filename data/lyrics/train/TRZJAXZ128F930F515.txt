I can still remember
Not so very long ago in 1977
We would sit and we would talk about forever
In our little house on Lugo
It was our little piece of heaven

We would laugh, we would dream
You'd embrace me and make me believe

If the sky should fall to the sea
I would live in the hope of your sweet mystery
You have faith in me, and forever I will be
A true believer

If I had to do it over, I could do it all again
...
