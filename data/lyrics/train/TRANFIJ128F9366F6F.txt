My heart is beating faster can't control these feelings any more,
I've waited long enough I want it more than anyone,
its time to step up and deliver what you want to see,
my blood is pumping now this is how its gonna be,

its 45 minutes of love,
i wanna see you push and you shove,
i'll show you just how far to go,
its time to lose all control,

its a feeling,
i can't control these feelings anymore,
believe me,
my heart is racing and I can't seem to get enough,
am I dreaming,
just like a drug but i know it's just adrenaline, go,
just feel it,
ooooh my heart is beating faster,
...
