And I Remember Giving You My Heart, Mind, Body And Soul
Babe Such A Price To Pay
For The Kisses Of Your Lips And Warm Embrace
And In My Average Reign Your Love Would Forever Be
My All And All
But Even I Never Thought Id Dreamed How I Just Might React
When I Came In The Door And You Jumped Back
Holding Her In Your Arms
But Guess What Baby That's Just What I Needed To See
My Heart Broke Right In Front Of Me
Would You Believe, Maybe Now
I'll Let You Go Away, Just So Far Away
Never Did Want Reality
There Was No Way Ever This Love Could Be
That Was Just What I Needed To See And As Your Eyes Dropped To The Floor
You Seemed So Insecure
