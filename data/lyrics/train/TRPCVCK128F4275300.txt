Hey brother where the hell have ya been
Ya don’t you know it’s always nice to see a friend
Ya I see you time and again

Well I ain’t been up to nothing I’m just hanging around
And you can find me in every single stinkin’ bar in town
Lord I do get around

But there’s no way out so I’m stayin’ in
Drinkin’, drinkin’ my blooze again

I’ve got my friends, got my time
We chip in a buy a nice cheap bottle of wine
Get that cheap stuff most of the time

We get along ‘cause we’re one and the same
...
