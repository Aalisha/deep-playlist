Cross our hearts and hope to die
It just might be the perfect sign
Cross our hearts and hope to die
It just might be the perfect sign

This is a sad day
The saddest day we've ever known
No, I never thought we'd come so far
Over means that fall so fast

Another car crash by the side of the road
We'll take one more glance till the story is cold
Draw the lines of what's real, re-imagine the truth
Every fiction turns fact when it's running with you

Any hint of trouble there's a camera waiting
Every way you turn there goes another flash
We cling to the wreckage, it's our guilty pleasure
And once you get the hunger then you can't turn back

This is a sad day
The saddest day I've ever known
We swore to hold our heads up high
We swore we'd look away
