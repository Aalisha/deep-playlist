D A G A
I'm happy to roam I can find my way to the mountains and the ocean foam.

(Riff 1)

A D G A
But if I had a map to show me the way to your heart dear I'd follow it home.

(Riff 2)

D A G A
Making my way through the dim lit streets of the old town - nowhere to go.

(Riff 1)

A D G A
Wanderin' with the sea wind in my hair I never slow down - I miss you so.

(Riff 2)
