Can you see me switchin on?

Could you push your button?
Could you feel that switch?
Could you push your button,
Like you rub an itch?
Can you find that button?
Can you find that switch?
Can you keep on pressing,
When you hear the click?

Can you see me comin' on?
(See me switchin', see me switchin')
