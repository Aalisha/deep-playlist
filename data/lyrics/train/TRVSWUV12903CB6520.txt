This is it
Oh This time I know it's the real thing
I can't explain what I'm feeling
I'm lost for words
I'm in a daze
Stunned and amazed
By your open ways

This is it
Oh This time I know it's the real thing
I can't explain what I'm feeling
I'm lost for words
I'm in a daze
Stunned and amazed
By your open ways

Whoo, you smiled at me
And suddenly
The wheels of love began to turn inside of me
Hey, you said hello
Oh, I felt aglow
Right then and there I knew I'd never let you go

'Cos I know
I know

This is it
