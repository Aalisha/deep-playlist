This is a call to wake
The sleeping army, dreaming for
An end to fear
In our hearts for the last time

A shared vision, love's transmission
Through the hollow days ahead
A hope for where we grow
When it's over and it's over

It falls, it passes through me
It falls, and you won't be mistaking me
It falls, inside us, inside
It falls, it passes right, right through me
