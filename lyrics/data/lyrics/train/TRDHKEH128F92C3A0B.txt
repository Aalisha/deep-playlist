Just drifting along with the world
Every motion is paranoid and paralyzing
Give it up or give? em hope
Let us all survive the wake

We, we? re a race, a human race
Under the glass behind it all
Watch us crawl, watch us crawl so fearfully
I might be wrong after all, I might be wrong
But weren? t we just so delicate yesterday?

Sit back and think about it
Sleep it off, sleep on it
Come to, and make your motions
