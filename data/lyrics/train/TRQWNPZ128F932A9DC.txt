The song I love the best’s the one my father taught to me,
The kindness of a stranger is dust from an unseen wing,
But an old friend at my table is by far the finest thing
This tired mile could give to me.
The colors of the man I love are deepest blue and green,
And it isn’t very often that I say just what I mean,
Cause the feeling seems to scatter and these words fall in between.
For what I miss I’ll just tell you this,

It’s something to me.
It’s something to me.
I don’t know what it comes to and it’s not so much to see,
But you take tomorrow so long as you know
It’s something to me,
...
