Know when to walk
Know when to walk away
Know when to walk
Know when to walk away
Know when to walk
Know when to walk away
Know when to walk
Know when to walk
Slowly grind away the innocence
If you can hide the evidence
Erase the photographs
If you can choke down the laughs
Advertise the bruises and the lows
Cause you know it never shows
It's too late to let it in
When it's under your skin
Why'd you take the long way round
Going nowhere
I heard you tried to make a sound
Out of dead air
Your silence is murder
Your silence is murder
Your silence is murder
Know when to walk away
The only way that i know how to be
