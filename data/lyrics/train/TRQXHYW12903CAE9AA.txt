late night, i would write
see the world through my composition, thirsty
stay strong in the face of adversity
now my rhymes took me further than i imagined
torin, atlanta, sicily, manhattan, staten
island right back to the valley
just to show em how we do in central cali, my home

on the map now, they tell me sit in the throne
i tell â€˜em i'm not concerned with the crown or the robe
just wanted to meet the world, become a man on my own
and i did, now the name's household, santiago
CA get hot, as i ran i hit Chicago
it's the heart that guides me, my mind just follows

i go where the wind takes me
samsonite bag full of clothes
like jack hit the road
to the next city
fuck it, let's travel the globe
luggage already packed, who knows when i'll be back

they say i'm a rolling stone, where i rest my head is my home
i let it be known that i'm a samsonite man, yeah i'm a samsonite man
...
