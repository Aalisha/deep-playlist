I see the blue in your eyes
Baby, what are you hiding?
I catch a glimpse of the truth
And it don't look good, no
I feel the ground fall away

As you fight back tears and choke the words

{Chorus}
You don't love me
You can't say it
After all this time
You don't want me
You can't mean it
Tell me you've lied
Yesterday everything seemed so ok
How can it be that today
You don't love me?

I thought that I really knew
Who you were, baby
