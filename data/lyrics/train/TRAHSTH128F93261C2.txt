momma's hurtin' but she don't cry
just drown her sorrows in another's wine
daddy left us here to die
the hour is too late for the good life

made of flesh and bone
i'm a suicide hero, yes i will return
innocence is gone
lord it's so easy, cause i've got nothing to lose

so they kick me harder but i'm not riled
they can't break me, i got murder in my style
they sent me off on that no-chance train
...
