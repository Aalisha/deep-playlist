What happened on the bridge today
were those the words you planned to say
was that some kind of statement that you had to make
Do you believe in fairytales
cause I think I just saw one slip away today
well I'm not sure and anyway...

...there's too much water underneath this bridge
and it keeps changing
and you couldn't fill my shoes if you implied it

So sail away to Libanon
fly off to Peru
what do I care
...
