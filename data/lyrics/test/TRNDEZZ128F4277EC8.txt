She screams bloody hallelujahs
to the alter, these lungs of mine are closing in
and in her nasty dress like her mother's she falls between the skin
and the lines on her forehead

I have found my place, face down heading forward
and I can't sleep tonight, because all the lights are scaring me,
they're scaring me tonight
...
