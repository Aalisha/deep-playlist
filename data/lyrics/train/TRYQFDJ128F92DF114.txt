I see you
I see you

Walking through a dream I see you
My light in darkness breathing hope of new life
Now I live through you and you through me, enchanting
I pray in my heart that this dream never ends

I see me through your eyes
Living through life flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice
I live through your love
