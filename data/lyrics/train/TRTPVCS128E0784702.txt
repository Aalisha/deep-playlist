When the town fool is a liar
And he's preaching to the choir
You've got a lot of explaining that you do
You see, no one likes a quitter it makes us oh, so bitter
So drop your hat and sit for awhile

Ya see, every now and again we struggle with our past
We try to stare it in the eye and pray that
It won't last Most questions that get answered,
They never make much sense
