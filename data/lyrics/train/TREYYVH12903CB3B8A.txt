feeling the weight of unseen chains
this routine is growing thin
it's a narrow path that we walk
and the walls are closing in
caving in
is there room still for us to grow
within the bounds we've come to know

beneath the dust of our days
hides the key to our emotions
and it's been a while since we've been moved
...
