Chorus:
Dim all the lights, we darlin'
Cause tonight it's all the way
Turn up the old victrola
Gonna dance the night away

Love it dont come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up

chorus

Love it dont come easy
No it seldom does
When you find the perfect love
Let it fill you up
