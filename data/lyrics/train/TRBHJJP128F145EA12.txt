Got myself a threadbare gypsy soul
Likes to dance and drink and go wherever the wind blows
Gotta little threadbare gypsy soul
Gotta little threadbare gypsy soul

Gotta little wild streak in my heart
I guess that I have had it since I heard the music start
I gotta little wild streak in my heart
I gotta little threadbare gypsy soul

I like to hear the highway sounds
And I don't think that I'll ever settle down
I can't change and it's a sin
Hope St. Peter gonna let me in
Come on Pete won't you let me in
