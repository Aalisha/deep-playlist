I'm so happy 'cause today
I've found my friends, they're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's OK
'Cause so are you, broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is every day
For all I care and I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze
'Cause I've found God

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

I'm so lonely, that's OK
I shaved my head and I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame
For all I've heard but I'm not sure
I'm so excited, I can't wait
To meet you there and I don't care
