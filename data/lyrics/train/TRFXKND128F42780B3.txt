The more I look, more I see, The more that life asks of me
The more it hurts, the more I feel, The more it takes time to heal

For easy times they come and they go
They come and they go so quickly
And peace of mind is so hard to know
It's something to keep me striving

The more I learn the less I know, So little time, so far to go
