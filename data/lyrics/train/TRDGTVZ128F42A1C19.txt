Rockets launch us to outerspace, far away from the human wasteland
We're bringing heaven to other worlds, abandoning the home fires of our birth
There are fools who believe we can't live here as one
There are wisemen who believe it still can be done

Chorus:
Who is watching the world, who is changing the balance of power
Who is watching the world, are we building a future or just standing still
