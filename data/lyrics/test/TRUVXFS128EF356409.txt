There's no future living this lie
Cos sooner or later girl she's gotta know
She aint gonna lay down and die
She won't do it, cos she went through it too

All young lovers, who come this way
Who can't sleep nights and worry all day
They don't regret seeing it through
And you know in your heart that's what we've gotta do
And I won't run away, Your baby's mine too
I won't run away, I'm in love with you
I won't run away and get out of touch
I won't run away, I love you too much
