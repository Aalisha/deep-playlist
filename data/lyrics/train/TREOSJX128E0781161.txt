I don't mind if I hurt you
If I hurt you, if I hurt you
And leave this guilt behind

So here I go burning bridges
Burning bridges, burning bridges
Did I play my hand too soon?

So for the first time in my life
Feel like a country boy
Caught in headlights
I found my rosebud
I found my rosebud

Arrived in New York City
Feel like a scapegoat
Before a committee
I found my rosebud
I found my rosebud, whoa, ooh, whoa

All this talk off regret
let's go slumming
Let's go slumming
...
