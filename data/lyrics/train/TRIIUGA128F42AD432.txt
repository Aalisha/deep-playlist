Gazing through the window
At the world outside
Wondering will mother
Earth survive
Hoping that mankind will
Stop abusing her, sometime

After all there's only
Just the two of us
And here we are still
Fighting for our lives
Watching all of history
Repeat itself
Time after time

I'm just a dreamer
I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer
Who dreams of better days
