Attack me with your love, baby

Hey...

When you walk, when you pass me by
There's reasons that come immediately to mind
One is I'd like to have you, two is I love your face
The third one is irrelevant ‘cause there's no time or place

Attack me with your love
Attack me with your love, baby (Attack me with your love)
Attack me with your love
Bushwhack me with your love, baby (And I'll do all the things you want me to)

Excite me with your love
Entice me with your love, baby
Come slap me with your love
I'm happy with your love, baby

I think you need to know the deal about just how I really feel
‘Cause intentionally I'm for real and I'm sure I'll make you feel
That I'm a mean man and I'm a go-getter (Ow)
Hey, baby, baby
