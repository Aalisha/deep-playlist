There was a time when I'd believe in anything but you
I closed my eyes and let you in
Ready to let my life begin, it just hit me, couldn't ignore it
Heard your voice calling, now I know it

I wanna see your face
I wanna speak your name
I wanna tell the whole world
How my life has changed
I'm gonna lift my voice
Ever to sing your praise
As long as I'm alive know that I
I'm living for you

Lord, here I stand before you now
I want to give you everything
No matter what may come my way
You give me a smile they can't take away

Holding onto all you brought me though
You're the strength that I'll always cling to

I wanna see your face
I wanna speak your name
I wanna tell the whole world
How my life has changed
