When you woke up
You should have rose with a praise
No complaining Appreciating another day
You are still alive
Someone didn't survive
He deserves so much more than what we give
All I'm trying to say is
Let's live this Word
I need the Word
Gotta have the Word
He is the Word
And His Word
Keeps us from day to day
Ohâ€¦ The Word is more than just letters on the page
But it's a compass and direction
When we've lost our way
If we hide the Word within our hearts
