Well, you can walk out on me tonight
If you think that it ain't feeling right
But darling, there's ain't no getting over me.

Well, you can say that you need to be free
But there ain't no place that I won't be
Sweet darling, there ain't no getting over me.

I'll be the bill you forgot to pay
I'll be the dream that keeps you awake
I'll be the song on the radio
