Young but now I'm older
Never have I seen the righteous forsaken
Believe in what You told me
You would always hold me safe in the palm of Your hand

Even though I go through the valley of the shadow
I'm not forgotten
And I'll never let a day go by my, my
Lemme shout it from the mountain

I just wanna say I'm not afraid
I know that You are with me always

Young but now I'm older
Never have I seen the righteous forsaken
Believe in what You told me
You would always hold me safe in the palm of Your hand
