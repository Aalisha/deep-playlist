The sun was rising in the sky just like the day before
Just another normal day not knowing what's in store
It's naturally You found a way to creep into my mind
You're whispering, I'm listening, how'd You get inside?
Listen up, I've heard about enough
That's right, I've turned my life life around

Never, oh no, never again
Will I fall for Your schemes
Will I fall for Your plan
Never, oh no, I won't give in
This game's gotta end
'Cause I'm not turning back, never again

I was not a stranger to the lies that You had told
I have been in danger of desires taking over
Everything that I believe and all I know is true
Hypnotized, compromised, all because of You
So listen up, I've heard about enough
...
