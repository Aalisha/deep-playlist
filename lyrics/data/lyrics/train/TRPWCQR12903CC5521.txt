This is for myself
As selfish as it gets
And the only thing that I have left

But you don't understand
'Cause you're the standard wave
You got your balance down
But your vision is so plain.

The pictures in my head are great!
I prefer them over you.
There's nothing you can do or say
To make me ever change the way I am.
