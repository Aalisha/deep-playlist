AJ: Here we are, seven days
And seven nights of empty tries
It's ritual, habitual
But it's never gonna work this time

Brian: We're to the point of no return
And along the way the only thing we've learned
Is how to hurt each other

AJ: I'm looking back and wondering why
It took so long to realize
That nothing's changed, it never will
All these years of standing still
And still we stay in all this pain
And nothing's gonna make it go away

All: I don't wanna wait another minute
Put me out of my misery
I can read your mind baby you're not in it
And we're not what we used to be
No you wouldn't have to lie to me
If you would only let me go
And I don't wanna wait another minute to hear
...
