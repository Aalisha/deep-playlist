She makes me wanna die
Follow where Mary goes
Cherish the things she knows
Says if I change my stride

Then I'll fly
She makes me wanna die
And change my stride
Then I'll fly

Look to the sun
See me in psychic pollution
Walking on the moon
And how could you dare?

Who do you think you are?
You're insignificant
