She believes in me like I've been trying to do
I'm seeing things I've never seen before
Ever since she came into my life
I've been a better man

Run, run, running, I was running scared
Always looking for a place to leave
And I couldn't seem to find where I belonged
'til she took my hand

We can make this work out, baby
I know it's true
I can't picture myself with no one but you
And I think I got it right this time
...
