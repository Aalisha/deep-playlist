Deep in the soul of a man who's seen it all - he stands alone with borrowed time
dealing with two, nothing's new but they look at you with broken backs and bleeding minds
well I don't know even though they tell me so
you'll be the one who walks the line
standing tall, they're so fragile
but they always find you when you hide

cause you're a broken man, in a broken land
cause you're a broken man, in a broken land
and don't they wish they were blessed like you

the struggle inside your mind is a waste of time - your purest thoughts evaporate
dark clouds reveal how you feel in your idle time - your own tail becomes the bait
...
