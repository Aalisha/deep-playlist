Life
Is too short to understand
What bring us down
To the point of no way out

With a shame
We attend the world around
Staring blind
Sleeping passengers
In a bullet train

And then
Before you know what's happening
Everything's in place
Every doubt has disappeared

For a while
Can fulfill the emptiness
Just to fall again
Keeping a glimpse on
