Say goodbye to the old street
That never cared much for you anyway
And the different colored doorways
You thought would let you in one day
Goodbye to the old bus stop
Frozen and waiting
The weekend edition
Has this town way over-rated

You walk across the baseball green
The grass has turned to straw
A flock of birds tries to fly away
From where you are
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, old friend
I can't make you stay
I can't spend another ten years
Wishing you would anyway

How the sky turns to fire
...
