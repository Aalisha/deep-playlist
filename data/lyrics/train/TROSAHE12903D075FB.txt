This is a poison everyone knows
It runs through my rivers.
created and cured by the same, and it will flow.

Tear through these holds, and rip away my heart.
with an effort so constrained, this is the venom in my veins.
This is the venom in my veins, created and cured by the same.
This is the venom in my veins. (I've spoken reckless words?)

And I know I've built a bed of unrest
that destroys my heart once I lay my head down.
Destroys the crutches that I've built,
I thought they were sound.

We are the reasons for health and light, for illness and weakness.
