Edward come and sit with me,
I fell asleep and now I am afraid.
The sun came up so quick and I
Have always been suspicious of the day.
The dream I had that you were in -
Turned bad and then it finished,
And I am glad to be awake.
And glad,
To be with you,
Cause I feel safe when we're together.

Read to me again
About the King who took
his daughter to the feast.
Tell me how she lifted up her veils
And she laid them at his feet.
Execution in her eyes,
She pointed to her prize, and said,
"I want him to be mine."

And everyone,
Knew the man was going to lose
his head tonight.
