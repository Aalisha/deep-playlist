Battlescared and weatherworn
Light absorbs and nulls the schism between lines of emptiness and form
Indifference to death
Is not a reaction but rather a cause for alarm
Distinctive wisdom
No longer plagued by desire
When abandoned trappings of flesh
Indifference to death is a reaction
To the demands of time
Endvisioned
Realms beyond barbwire enmity and ironclad scorn
Obsolete in purpose
When will is not one's own
Existence falters
