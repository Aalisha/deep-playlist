You wanted money, you wanted fame
You broke the rules before you know the game
Bounds tearing you up like a knife
Wish it was the end of your life

It's a nightmare, going down that road on account of you
No escape from the things you put me through
I don't know, I don't care, I can't go anywhere
It's a nightmare, coming back to you
