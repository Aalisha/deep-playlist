I get uptight
When I see you creeping around to someone else
No it ain't right
There's no mistake in you're eye of comedy
It's a drag

She used to care
But things have changed
She used to tear
But things have changed

I don't wanna wake up
On my own
Forget the loser who's the stranger in my room
I don't wanna wake up
...
