It may be winter time
But baby it's super fine
You may be near or far
Finding a way to really get to me
Baby you know you are getting close to my heart

Your self is my best side
My hope my faith and my guiding light
Your love is super fine
And it feels good in my heart
And I hope that I'm a part of you
