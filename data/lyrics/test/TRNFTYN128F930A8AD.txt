You never ask you insinuate
Suggest I would do something typical
Expect the worst expect the critical
We take liquids for that
We take liquids for that

Refused the comfort of silence
Rejected all you care about
In the search for something different
Something non-existent
Something non-existent

A relapse into
Distress get up
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
