Leave me alone
Come over here
I know it sounds funny
But I just cant stand another day on my own
Another bug in my ear sounds like noise to me

Living alone
A chill in the air
I don't hear from my brother
He is living in another continent far away
And it was his birthday today
But I think I missed it

Setting sun
I think I'm heading for a setting sun
I really need to find a way back home
Oh it's so urgent
There's an urgency

Leave me alone
