hook

I.C.U do you see me, I'm staring at cha' (x4)

(Khujo)
Before you got on, I could a hear a pins drop
Maybe make me wanna clean out your clock
Go in your socks, confiscate your knot
Cool you off, because you think your hot, when your not
Fools on the block, will take your hand, brigettes and rocks
And your watch
Can't wait until you come through
One more 'gain so they can empty your bins
Check your chin, don't try and be my friend
Get close and then attempt to do me in
Niggas know you'll spin, we can get on that Henn, eyes shut
Huh
Can't touch
We don't care nothing 'bout you doing ten, up in the pen
We ain't finna be mothering 'bout nobody
Cause we motherfucking grown men
