I want to watch the world cry
I couldn't open my eyes
I almost spoke but can't speak
still being shelled all those lies
chorus
Blues from a gun
I'm not the only one
I've been fooled
You got me on the run
I've tried hard everything's been done
I've been fooled by blues from a gun

I start to watch the word crumble
I had to open my eyes
I start to run but I stumble
They stole to blue from the sky
