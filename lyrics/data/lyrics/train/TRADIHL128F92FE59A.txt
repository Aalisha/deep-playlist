Dress Me Up
I've got holes
Holes in my shoes
Holes in my jeans
Holes in my heart that can't be sewn up
And I'm getting cold from all this unwanted ventilation to my soul

And I stink
I smell like the dirt
I smell like the filth
I smell like myself and it won't come off
I've got to get out of this disgusting sinful clothing
So I'm gonna...

Take everything off
Throw it away
I don't want nothin' to mess me up
