Dear Lord, this pain inside me tears me apart
And Lord, the more it hurts, the harder my heart
Oh, in my darkest hour
Your love comes shining through

Your word is true and You make all things new
And I know You're all I need
And You say You're here and You calm my fears
And I know You'll never leave, You'll never leave

Dear Lord, my heart is breaking, breaking in two
And Lord, my spirit's torn and crushed without You
Oh, in my darkest hour
...
