Life's a gamble and then you die,
No explanation or reasons why,
You hit the big stage up in the sky,
We'll see who burns and we'll see who flies,

Why am I here?

Forgotten images of what we are
It's like a...

Spinning me around again
Twister
Here we go around again
Blame it all on me

Life's a short trip on a fast train
Put some deal-with-it in your veins
