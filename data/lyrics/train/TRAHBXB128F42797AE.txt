Why can't I take it all OK?
I like to dig and fuck around with your day
I'm gonna tell your mamma
Yeh I'm gonna blackball your name
Ain't no way you'll go without me
Every chance I'll make you pay
On your space, in my face, I tell you I know
Somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know somethin'
