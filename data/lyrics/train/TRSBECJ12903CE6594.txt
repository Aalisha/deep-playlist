This used to be a house
Until the walls came tumbling down
Now what we gon' do now
With both our feelings hurt
And words keep blurting out

And somehow we found a way
To turn love into hate
You can hear the bell ring for the final round
It's goin' down

This ain't love and this ain't human
This ain't real, so what the fuck is we doin'?
And this ain't life, there's much more to it
This whole situation is ruined

We trapped in and we can't get out
We can't get out, we can't get out
We trapped in and we can't get out
...
