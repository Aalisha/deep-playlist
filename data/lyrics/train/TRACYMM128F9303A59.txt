The hero is exposed when
his crimes are brought to the light of day
won't be feelin' sorry, sorry, sorry
on the judgement day.
It wasn't me who said
there'll be a price to pay
and i won't feel bad at all
when the hero takes a fall
when the hero takes a fall
(hero takes a fall) oh no.
Your mother told you stories
you substitute with girls who tell you more
