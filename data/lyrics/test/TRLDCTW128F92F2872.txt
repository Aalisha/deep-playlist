I am not limited to this Underworld.
I am settled in this Barrenness.
I am kept in this Emptiness.
I am not restricted to this Underworld. (182)

I travel Earth in the train of You.
I offer Earth to reach the field of You.
I walk Earth to see the mark of You.
I proffer Earth to feel the lure of You. (182) (FOREKNOWLEDGE)

Hail to you, prime mover of the Deep.
Sun of the heart: possessor of Voids.
The awe of whom created This.
The thirst of this revered Abyss. (182) (ADAEOT)

[Pre-Chorus:]
BEINGS, BY-COMINGS, THOUGHTS...
MONADS, ATOMS, WAVES...
APERTURES, GULFS, CHASMS...
RESULTS AMONGST RESULTS!
