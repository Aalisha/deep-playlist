I can feel the earth begin to move
I hear my needle hit the groove
And spiral through another day
I hear my song begin to say
Kiss me where the sun don't shine
The past was yours
But the future's mine
You're all out of time

I don't feel too steady on my feet
I feel hollow, I feel weak
Passion fruits and holy prayer
Fill my guts and ease my head
Through the early morning sun
