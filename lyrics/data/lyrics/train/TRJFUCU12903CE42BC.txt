Dad dad why did you let that man
Push you around like that
You should have beat him down
Down to the ground
Down to the ground for that

He said, "Son, you're still young
And you always jump the gun"

There's real people in the big big trucks
That you flip off when they get in your road
You get so hacked but you pay no mind
