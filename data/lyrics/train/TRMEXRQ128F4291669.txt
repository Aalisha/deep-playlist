We are two shadows moving on a wall
Two characters both weak and strong
We chant and we dance, we draw ourselves in
Then we run from each other again

Love is so strange, how we change
From day to night
And love is so strange, how we change
From black to white

Ever so strange, how we change
From day to night
Hey yeah

I draw a picture of your face
Another time, another place
We are the ones who fell into this love
We must be in the right place, ooh
