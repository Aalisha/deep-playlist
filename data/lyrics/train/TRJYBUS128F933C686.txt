I'm looking for someone that I can play with
I don't care if she's skinny, I don't care if she's fat
As long as she goes for boys like me
'Cause I like them like that

She might be a Catholic
She might be a nurse
She might give me a child
Or gonorrhea or something worse

She might be a painter
Or a communist with my luck
But that the the kind of girls
You really want to fuck
Yeah, so I'm looking for girls

Looking for girls
Looking for girls
Looking for girls
