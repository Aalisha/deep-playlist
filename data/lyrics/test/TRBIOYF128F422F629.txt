We have reviewed your yellow form
Congratulations! we find you qualified
You have just the right capacity
For putting up with our nonsense
There's just one thing you've got to prove
We know how you must be dishonest and lazy
If you're so desperate
You actually want to work at this place

CHORUS:
You must be guilty (lie detector)
Guilty (lie detector)
Guilty (lie detector)
Guilty 'til you're proven innocent

These days
Blood pressure clamps around your arms
