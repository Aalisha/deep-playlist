I'm holdin' on
waiting for your call
it's simple but I can't explain this
I'm sinking down
I feel like I could die
I'm fallin' off I don't know why

I still believe it when you say it's another perfect day, another perfect day
I still believe it when you say it's another perfect day, another perfect day

So I might try to leave it all behind
