Hot breath, rough skin,
warm laughs and smiling,
the loveliest words whispered and meant -
you like all these things.

But, though you like all these things,
you love a stone. You love a stone,
because it's smooth
and it's cold.

And you'd love most to be told
that it's all your own.

You love white veins, you love hard grey,
the heaviest weight, the clumsiest shape,
the earthiest smell, the hollowest tone -
you love a stone.
