Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down flyin' low for me
One time I trusted a stranger
'Cuz I heard his sweet song
And it was gently enticin' me
Tho there was somethin' wrong
But when I turned he was gone
Blindin' me, his song remains remindin' me
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down flyin' low for me
He wages war with the devil
A pistol by his side
