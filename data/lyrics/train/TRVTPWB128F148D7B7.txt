Oh Lordy I got to feelin' so cold
You know the mornin' it ain't too good for my soul
I've been workin' an' in some faraway place
I got to thinkin' about your sweet smilin' face

I got a thing for you, if you want me to
Gonna change all my ways
I'm gonna get off the road, I'm gonna lighten my load
I got a thing for you, can you feel it too?
I think I better slow down
All my wandering's done, I found my place in the sun
