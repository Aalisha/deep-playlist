Woke up in the morning staggered out of bed
Thought about getting back again, but went downstairs instead
Read the daily paper have to know the truth
Slammed the door as I ran outside, looked at my watch and cried
Gotta get to work on time
Gotta get to work on time

Then the sky turned a deeper blue
Not a cloud as the sun shone through
But all around rain kept falling to the ground
The wind was blowing but the trees didn't make a sound
Just another alien afternoon
Just another alien afternoon

Time that I was leaving while there's still a chance
Before I start believing in what I see or hear
Nothing here to keep me, nothing anywhere
Gotta get out pack my bags before I go insane
Gotta get away in time
