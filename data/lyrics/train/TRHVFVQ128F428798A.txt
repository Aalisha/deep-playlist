Broken bonds of self construction
Poise of mind's final abstraction
Leaves behind our consciousness

It's path we follow
To dispel our actions
We unveil the shadows
To release desire

Healing wounds of mental matter
We connect the fabriqued patterns
Merged beneath the flesh that's thread

It's a vital function
To induce the mind-fold
We indulge in suffer
Capturing the downfall

Tearing truth
Breaking through
Uncovering mystery
