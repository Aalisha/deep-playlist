A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air
The monkey thought that everything was on the square

The buzzard tried to toss (toll throw) the monkey of of his back
But the monkey grabbed is neck and said now listen jack

Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down papa don't you blow your top

Ain't no use in diving
What's the use of diving
...
