Thought with memory
A lost wisdom, an endless chapter
Condemned to a long awaiting
Recalled through electric dementia
Upon the calling, to confront... unite
A dead circuit, static laughter is waiting
Created through to process, upon the waiting
To confront... unite

Torn within my heart and my soul from disgrace
Schizophrenia is terrifying me
