CHORUS:
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady

Don't think I don't see them looking at ya
All of them wishing they could have ya
And as a matter of fact, uh
A bunch of them are itchin'for you to scratch'em
I'm tired of hiding what we feel
I'm trying to get with the real
And I'm-a gonna make it know
'Cause I want them to know
...
