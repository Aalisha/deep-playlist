Folding Money
Radney Foster

Verse:
Em G A C
When I was just a boy, my granddaddy took me to town one afternoon
Em G A C
He drove an LTD, wore a big white Stetson, and two-tone cowboy boots
Em G A C
He said son 창? Here goes창? and handed me a twenty just to see the look on my face
Em n/c B7 (ring)
He said, 창? Don't tell your mama nothin' about it, don't spend it all in one place.창?

Chorus I
Em G
You see it takes foldin' money to get the deal done
A C
Foldin' money to have a little fun
Em G
Foldin' money to pay a few bills
A C
Eat a steak dinner, and cure a couple ills
Em G
