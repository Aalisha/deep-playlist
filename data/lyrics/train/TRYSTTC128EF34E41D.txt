If you wanna
Sink to the bottom with me
Come get gotten
Reeling and rotten beneath

One, two, three
And down you go
You'll be smiling
Before you know
If you wanna sink to the bottom with me

We're all rotten
Buried and forgotten
Living it up underground
So take a ride
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
You really can't be looking so surpised
If you can't beat them
Might as well eat them
No ones getting out alive
Give it a try
(Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
It really is a wicked way to die

Listen my friend
To sound of the sweet melody
Doesn't it seem to resound
...
