Dimebag Daryll godbless that man
ripped from us by the devils hand
only thing in his plan was love and rock n' roll
cowboy from hell on a twisted trail
swept away where the wild winds wails
sad truth is you can never tell when its your time to go.

well, bad news travels faster
than any good new that you hear
just one more dark disaster
