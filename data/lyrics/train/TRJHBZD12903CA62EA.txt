I can't believe I've done this horrible thing.
I shot the maid,
What more can I say?

It's all a blur,
Remembering what went down.
I swear, I swear,

It's time to think fast.
What do you do?

What have you done, murderer, murderer?
What have I done?

I can't believe I've done this horrible thing.
I shot the maid,
What more can I say?
