I wanna be someone who loves you
I wanna be someone who cares
I wanna wrap my arms around you
Because I can, because I can

I got an angel face, I got a brand new dog
I got 40 Megs of RAM and a CD ROM
I got a hired car and a record deal
I got an old guitar and a pedal steel

I got a lot of things coming to me
But there? s one more thing to be

I wanna be someone who loves you
I wanna be someone who cares
I wanna wrap my arms around you
