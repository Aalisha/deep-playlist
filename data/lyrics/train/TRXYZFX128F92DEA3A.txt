You can find your hope
Amongst the crowds
Of all the people you’ve let down
We’ll find a way to make this OK
Well yeah we skipped through the nights
It’s all that we need to
And maybe it’s all that we'd ever need
Just to make us feel alive

You are you are you're all around
you you are you're all around me now (x2)

I will never give up on you for
All the times you sat and sang to me
...
