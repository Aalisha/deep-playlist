Silver screen such a disgrace
I couldn't look her straight in the face
A foolish picture I live in disgust
Degradation being eaten by lust

No bone movies
No bone movies
No bone movies

Inspiration that's blue and uncut
Can't kick the habit obsession of smut
Voyeur straining in love with his hand
A poison passion a pulsating gland
