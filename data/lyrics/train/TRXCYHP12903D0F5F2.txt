I earned my reputation
Then, when it was expected
Now, there's a new equation
Who wouldn't feel dejected
But I'm much more than this

More than a sex machine
I really do exist
More than a sex machine

Well, happy happy birthday
You'll get what you had wished for
Art, talk and contemplation
Someone who is an eyesore

But I'm much more than this
More than a sex machine
I really do exist
...
