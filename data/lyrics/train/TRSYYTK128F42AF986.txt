With you by my side
I know I can survive
With you by my side
I know that we can fly

With you by my side
I know I can survive
With you by my side
I know that we can fly

Through my years here on Earth
I never met someone that was worth
The time was waste of energy
That was until you came to me
Special woman, you make me feel
Full and complete, the real deal
You are my friend, you are my lover
'Til I'd lie there will be another
...
