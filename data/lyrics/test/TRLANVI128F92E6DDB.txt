We don't even talk anymore
And we don't even know what we argue about
Don't even say, "I love you", no more
'Cause saying, "How we feel?" is no longer allowed
Some people will work things out
And some just don't know how to change

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby
...
