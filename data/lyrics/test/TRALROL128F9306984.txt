step right up, hurry, hurry.
before the show beings, my friends.
stand in line, get ya tickets
i hope you will attend
it'll only cost ya 50 cent to see
what life has done for those like you and me
see the man with the broken heart
to see that he he sad,
he's hurt so bad
(so bad, so bad)
see the girl who has lost the only love shes ever had
there's got to be no sadder show to see
no doubt about it satisfation guaranteed
