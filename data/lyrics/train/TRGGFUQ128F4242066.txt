I took a deep breath and I just stood there staring
It could have been stupid but I was past caring
It all seemed to depend on one little kiss
Oh but who would have thought it would turn out like this
And if I had I'd still have taken the risk
Please pick me up, cos I'm falling apart
That's why I try
Hard not to start
These affairs of the heart
These affairs of the heart
