Express yourself
Express yourself

You don’t ever need help from nobody else
All you got to do now
Express yourself

Whatever you do
Do it good
Whatever you do, do, do, Lord, Lord
Do it good, all right

It’s not what you look like
When you’re doin', what you’re doin'
It’s what you’re doin', when you’re doin'
What you look like you’re doin'
