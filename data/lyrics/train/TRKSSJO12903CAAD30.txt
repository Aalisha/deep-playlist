You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning, she's my water
In the evening, she's my cup of tea

As long as I live
Wherever trouble lies
I go to her, and like a miracle
Everything just turns out right

You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
She brings her lovin' home now
...
