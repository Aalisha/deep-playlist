Back to nature
I can't go on like this
I want to walk where the power is
Back to nature
I don't know where to start
Back to nature
I don't have that kind of heart

Back to nature
Back to somewhere else
Back to nature
And right back on top of yourself
Back to nature
I've got to look down
See where I am
Or just hit the ground

And I'm telling you
I know what you've been going through
In my heart of hearts
...
