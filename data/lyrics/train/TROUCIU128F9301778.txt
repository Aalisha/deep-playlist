you left a guy who told you where to be and when
i was with a girl who tried to sleep with my best friend
we both took comfort in each other's messy lives
finding warmth on that cold november night

we swore it'd be years before we brought that on again
days later you said that we should be more than just friends
i let my guard down cuz the feelings were so strong
but acted stupid and thats when he came along

CHORUS:
its been so long, i should just move on
there's other fish in the sea
but i keep hoping you'll swim back home to me
...
