Two steps forward
and three steps back
and I don’t know where we are
you see it your way
and I see it mine
and we’re lost here in the dark

it’s not just a matter of talking it out
you know it don’t mean nothing if there’s something to hide
I know you know just what I’m talking about
There’s an unspoken hesitation we both feel inside

Am I here? Am I gone? Tell me where I belong
All that I need is a reason
Am I wrong? Am I right? Are we saying goodbye?
