I could read your mind and all its freakish desires
A full on femme fatale with an elegant face of fire
Through the haze of your senses and your defenses
God only knows how long it is till you hit the bottom
but that's all right
I'll get you through paradise

Don't need your wings
For the Queen
Little alligator

From the fangs the poison is so sweetly injected
...
