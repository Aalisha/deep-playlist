From the way you smile
To the way you look
You capture me
Unlike no other
From the first hello
Yeah, that's all it took
And certainly
We had each other
And I won't leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
I'm telling you
Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
It will stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again
From the heat of night
