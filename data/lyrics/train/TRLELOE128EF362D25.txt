Eee ah ooh ah ah (many times)

People hint and wonder and they wanna know how and why
But let me first introduce myself I'm tagging name romye
I'm 20 years of age I ran across some bullshit
People promise you bowl of cherries but don't forget there are pits
No hints, it's quicks, it's like the water and grits
They got another boy who can rhyme and do the fly flips
And that's I high I better get by because my ally
About to flip that crazy shit while I go look for some thai

I need some zig-zag, zig-zag (3x)
I need some zig-zag, zig-zag
How I need those zig-zag
(i need some) zig-zag, zig-zag
How I love to get high

Eee ah ooh ah ah (many times)

What the?
Oh what the heck
Niggas just wanna get wrecked to the track
It's brand new and heavy as a chevy and in fact
The pharcyde is coming and I hope we're not wack
But at this point there's no turning back
But to be exact, I've got more flavors than a bucket full of fruit
In 92 we take cash 93 we take loot
Because the vinyl is delicious=20
I'm the nigga who's got bitches
Michael ross is the genie he's giving our wishes
One I wanna just jam with your band
Two two two...=20
