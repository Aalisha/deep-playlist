Back for the next ground
Safe haven still not around
No road lined with gold
Someone else to carry the load

Rebound like a boomerang
All aboard the gravy train
Lip service with no action
Fan the flames of stagnation

Give another token pledge
Ride the tide
Live another token pledge
Leave the ride
Give another token pledge
Break the timing of the stride
Give a token pledge
Live the lie

Gone when dreams turn to sweat
A vision we regret
...
