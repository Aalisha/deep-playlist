Come along, we must be strong
To reach the castle before dawn
Don't mind the moans at your feet
It's just the friends you've left behind
You can use their bodies to help you to climb
Run boy run, one by one
Your wings will blot out the sun
You'll find a glorious seat among the stars
As they align, at last you'll cry, this world is mine
Watch the stars, as they align
Wings of jet black, never look back
...
