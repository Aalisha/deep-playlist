Who do you think are you going to be
What will you do, can't you answer me
Winter or summer I will take the fame
From chaos to mayhem and you are to blame

Can you enlighten the dark
Do your words tell the truth
Do we share the same point of view
So why is your face full of doubt... tell me the truth

Who will take the victory
