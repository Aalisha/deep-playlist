I saw a picture yesterday
You know the one we were laughing in the rain
Remember how it used to beÂ ?
(We were so in love)
Remember when you were still in love with me?

But you turned away
(You turned away)
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive

Don't leave me
Alone tonight
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive

Don't leave me
'Cause I won't survive
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive

I can't believe that we are through
Is it someone else
Have you found somebody new
'Cause I die inside
...
