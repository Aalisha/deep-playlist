Well, I know I'm gonna love you, baby, once before I die
Know I'm gonna love you, baby, and I ain't gonna cry
There's a time to live, and a time to die
There's a time to love and there's a time to cry

I've got reap while you've got to sow
I'm gonna stay and you're gonna go
I told you once and I'll tell you now
