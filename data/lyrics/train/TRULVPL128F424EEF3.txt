Awaken in many deceptions
I've learnt how to ignore it
time will drift my pain away
time will drift my pain away
Roaming with scary obsessions
The heart of threatening possessions
Time will drift my pain away
rejected inside
A veil to mask blind treacheries
I now know what isolation means
Time will drift my pain away
Time will drift my pain away
