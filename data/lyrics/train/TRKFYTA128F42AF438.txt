It's that time of the year again
I hate this time of the year
Because you ain't here
If I had to sum it up
I would say it just like this

The sun is out, the block is hot
The club is jumping but I'm not happy
No, I'm not happy, you know it, girl

The girls are fly, they love my ride
But I'm not smiling 'cause you're not with me
No, I'm not happy

There was a time when I would wake up
I would see your face with no makeup
So beautiful, I miss it so

I would lay there thinking to myself
...
