Baby, I like what you're doing to me
I'm all messed up now
Baby, I like what you're doing to me

Your mama called you no good
And like most other men I see
You can't be true, it ain't in you
And it's no secret to me

But when you hold me in your arms
You're like ten good men wrapped in one
Baby, I like what you're doing to me
Baby, I like what you're doing to me
