I'm not falling for anymore of these tricks
I'm so tired of ever thing here
The sun is calling me to the west
Everyone's having fun out there

My bags are packed as I'm looking out the window
Everything is so outdated here
I wanna move west to were the sun is shining
I want my friends to all be there

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Let's pack up and move to California
She's got lots of friends out there
We'll never get bored 'cause we can go boardin'
Let's let the sunshine take us there
