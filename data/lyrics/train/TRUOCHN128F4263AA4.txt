This has got to stop
I am not gonna put up with this any more
So tell me what's your excuse this time
No never mind I don't wanna hear it

So many times you pushed me aside
I'm getting sick and tired of your alibis
All alone sleepless nights
Trying to pretend our love would be alright

I could've changed my mind
