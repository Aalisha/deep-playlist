My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me right off of my feet
She's so fine as can be
I know this girl is meant for me

Candy girl, you are my world
You look so sweet, you're my special treat
Candy girl, all I want to say
When you're with me you brighten up my day

All I know when I'm with you
You make me feel so good through and through
The way you walk and the way you talk
You always look so good, you make me forget my thoughts

Do you really love me? Do you really love me?
Don't you really care? Don't you really care?
Do you really need me? Do you really need me?

And will you always be there?
