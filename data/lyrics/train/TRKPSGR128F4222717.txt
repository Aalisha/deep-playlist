I'm your worn in leather jacket
I'm the volume in your fucked up teenage band
A bag of smokes and a six pack
I'm the dreams you had walkin' down the railroad tracks
You and me

I'm your first taste of romance
I'm your first broken heart on a Saturday night
Guys like us ain't got no chance
But I'm the thing that keeps you and me alive
But not forever

So take me down the road
Take me to the show
It's something to believe in
That no one else knows
But don't take me for granted
...
