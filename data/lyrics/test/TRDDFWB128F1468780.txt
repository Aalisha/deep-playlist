Somedays it goes your way
your on a road you can't explain
and then it all goes down the drain
Your cat's hit by a car
the ATM eats you card
you're wondering what changed from yesterday

Save me from- from going mental
Save me from just spinning out

Somedays are better than others
Somedays you just can't figure out

Somedays you can't explain
...
