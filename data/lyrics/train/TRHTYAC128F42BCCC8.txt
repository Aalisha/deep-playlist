Fly away with me tonight
Take me on a one-way flight in your lovin' arms
And ev'rything's gonna be alright
You're the one who took my hand
When no one else could understand
You're the one who moves me
Like nobody else can.

Take me down where I wanna be
Turn around, this man who lives inside of me
Take me down and love me all night long
Hold me close and make me strong
Take me down, take me down tonight.

In your eyes I see a light
It's your emotions glowin' bright
So keep the fires burnin'
...
