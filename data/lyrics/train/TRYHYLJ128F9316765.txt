Wu-Tang Clan comin at ya, protect ya neck kid, so set it off
de Inspector Deck
I smoke on the mic like smokin Joe Frazier
The hell raiser, raisin hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tic toc and keep tickin
While I get ya flippin off the shit I'm kickin
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger!
Deep in the dark with the art to rip charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
Ya battle, you're sayin Goodbye like Tevin Campbell

Roughneck, Inspector Deck's on the set

The rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal
The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back relax won't smile
Rae got it goin on pal, call me the rap assassinator

Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat, blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb, shit like math!
So if ya wanna try to flip go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit ya with sixteen shots and more I got
Goin to war with the meltin pot hot
It's the Method Man for short Mr. Meth
Movin on your left, aah!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back

Small change, they puttin shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame!, my style'll live forever
Niggaz crossin over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a "sue"
