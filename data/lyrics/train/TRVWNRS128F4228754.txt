Flow...
Flow...

Get your flow
Downhill
Let it go, where it will
Get your flow
Until
That's your MO
Flow

It's kinda like getting-your groove on
If your forgotten to move on
There's one thing sure to hurt ya
Thats givin' in to inertia

The path to least resistance
Is not the shortest distance
But you must begin moving
Before you are improving

They may say
"Walk don't run"
But that's no fun
There's another way that you can go

Get your flow
