I can't stay away from you too long
Even if I do I'll always call
Checkin' on you, make sure you're okay
Be the one to brighten up your day, yeah, yeah

And the point of it all
Is I love you, yeah
You know I love you, baby

My days seem long whenever we're apart
It's like someone has thrown away my heart
You're a major part of my life
And no matter what the storm may bring I'm fine with you
And the point of it all

Is I love you
...
