Born to rule as a future pharaoh
He learned how to play the game
Building monuments and temples
They were to spread his name

Ramses the Great inherited the throne
He wanted to restore Egypt's might
As a living god he would to be known
And he was leading his troops in to fight

A warrior whose name rings all around
A pharaoh who rules over the lands
A living god who wears a double crown
He is chosen by Re
