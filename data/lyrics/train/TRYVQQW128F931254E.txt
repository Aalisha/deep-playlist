Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, for what you're trying to do

Livin' on your cheatin' and the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me cryin' in the rain
Love you forever but you're drivin' me insane
And I'm hangin' on, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you

You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I'm the girl
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards
With my heart hangin' out
...
