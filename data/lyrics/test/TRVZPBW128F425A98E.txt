If I were you
I would never let me go 
If I were you
I would always love me so if I were you

I can't play your part in life
But I would surely walk my way 
I cant think the way you think
But I would never go away

You can trust me when I say
That I will always be for real
You can always count on me
No matter how alone you feel

If I were you
I would never let me go
If I were you
I would always love me so
If I were you
