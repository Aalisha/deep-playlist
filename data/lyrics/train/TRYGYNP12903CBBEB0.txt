If I could find yesterday
I would take You back to where I'm coming from
Cause You can see the way
All these scars have kept me running
And chasing down the past
But I'm not done, I'm turning back
I swear, You're the only reason I keep breathing
I swear, You keep on giving me the reason to keep believing
Finally I'm worth it, though I'm not perfect
It still feels right, and I keep on giving
Trying to make a difference, in my life
But I know another way to show
Everything I can be for You
You're all that I'll ever need
I'll give you the Best of Me
If I could read tomorrow's mind
I would know exactly where You're taking me
