Jay Love
Louis Logic
Odd Couple
(Porque?)
Call me Felix Hunger, starving artist at-large
Independent entrepreneur, the hardest to rob
Hardest to dodge, till I'm offered a job
So call off your guard
I'm tryna get this loot and buy cars for my squad
We far from the odd, we're a couple of nuts
Cuddlin' sluts, puffin a Dutch and clutchin' up cups
Filled with nothin' but suds so top off the shot glass
I got hash, it top class, I copped it just as a cop passed
I stopped fast, thought about it then I broke north
Slid up to the crib and took my coat off
Took a toke off the chalice in the Odd Couple palace
Thanks to Alice my hands don't have a single callous
I think my style is different from the rest
I'm a spit it for a test and put the critics to a rest
