Caught me with your video lies, it gives you something to lie about
Watch me with your retail eye, it gives you someone to spy on
Stab me with your double-blade knife, it gives you something to cry about
Drive me with your chemical high, it gives you something to ride on
I may be an evil girl, with my colgate smile,
And if I am an evil girl, you put me on trial
