I'm counting my lives
Feeling the strain
To get right with you
Can't be this hard to do

No saving this day
My chance slips away
These words overdue
Won't stop me from losing you

And it's lonely, lonely, lonely by your side
And I've nowhere, nowhere left to hide
And it's lonely, lonely, lonely by your side
...
