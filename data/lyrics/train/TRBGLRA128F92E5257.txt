"Where you gonna go? Where you gonna run? Where you gonna hide?
Nowhere. Because there's no one like you left." -Bodysnatchers

Find
Words fade above the snow
The carved out somebody stitch
The carver's all who waves surrender
Through all tempers looking back
The skin begins to crack
Those ever double jointed blamers

Fine
Closed off no power the wheel inside no peace
No feeling all disease around security

Eyes
Devised the cycles find
A call that's never caught
Beneath the locusts timed decision

Find
The vice grips never freed
A crease upon one's debt
And never paying forward

Hate
What will we won't be late
...
