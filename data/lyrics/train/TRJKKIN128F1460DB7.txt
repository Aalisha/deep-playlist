here it goes and this wont take long
just let me dedicate a song
to a girl who turned this boy to stone
and you know who you are
heres a hint, she doesnt have a car
or the time to be in love with me

Why did you say
this feeling has to stay
left me to wait for so long

you dont have to stay
but i hoped you would anyway
all you did was up and go

Excuse me, but this wont take long
im sorry for writing you this song
but just what do you think you deserve

because when you had the chance for romance
you burnt it at both ends
i guess im not sorry in the least
