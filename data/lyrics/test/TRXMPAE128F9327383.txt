We have one nanosecond
In the spectrum of time
Cause it's about the dead
It's all in your mind

Reality, senility
Human race, outer space
My head's about to overload
Explode, explode

Alien forces live inside my brain
I must obey them or I'll go insane

Procreation, cocentration
Penetration, ejaculation
My head's about to overload
Explode, explode
Explode, explode

Cold shots on the rocks
You know how it makes me feel
You better see, set me free
Don't give me no better deal
Anagram, sonogram
Looking for a thing that's real
