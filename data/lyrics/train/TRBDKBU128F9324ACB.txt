If you think I'm hiding
Don't take too much notice
You can come and find me
Melt me with your eyes

Give me a good reason
It only takes a moment
I can make it easy
Take me for a ride

Turn on
To my Inhibitions
Dream on
See what's in my mind
I can
Give you my permission
Search and you will find

My Inhibitions
My Inhibitions honey
My Inhibitions
