You said I could never find a way to ease your mind
But where I go you wind up in the dust
I tried so hard to have you reach another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot

Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for

Diserty can wear you down, but still I'm rollin' through
Did I see your figure in the haze?
