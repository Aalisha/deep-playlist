I just keep moving on... (moving on...)
I just keep moving on... (moving on...)

Time and time, a brother asks why
The rhyme is not laced with a gangsta touch
I said "simply because I don't live that way
Still kickin' them rhymes rugged and rough"
"But that won't sell,
Cause you gotta keep it real
So that we can feel
Where you're coming from
Because these streets is ill so if you ain't
Killing niggas in rhymes
Your whole sound's just bubble gum"
I said "I won't contribute to genocide;
I'd rather try to cultivate the inner side
And try to evolve the frustrated ghetto mind
The devil and his army never been a friend of mine"
"But niggas don't wanna hear that shit" said the brother
Who was obviously totally misled and yelled out
"Murder murder, kill, murder" instilled in the influential parts
Of our kids' heads


shallow days, you never wanna
let a brother be a brother
fully inner to the outer
caught up in all them hollow nights
can't escape cause everywhere that I look
people front, and it just ain't right
(repeat)
...
