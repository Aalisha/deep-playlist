If my faults are your song
Then I will not be content to sing along
If I'm the one that's making you so out of touch
Then why don't you just go ahead and...
Why don't you just go ahead and

Blame it on this southern weather
Blame it on anything
It's not like you to ask small favors
You can blame me for everything

If I'm the cause of all your sickness and pain
Then I'll bury my face in the all of dirty shame...
