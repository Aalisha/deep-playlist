[CHORUS]
I've laid around and played around
This old town too long
Summer's almost gone
Yes, winter's coming on
I've laid around and played around
This old town too long
And I feel like
I've gotta travel on

Papa writes to Johnny
But Johnny can't come home
Johnny can't come home
No, Johnny can't come home
...
