[Prelude]
I am sleeping in the dark.
There is blackness in my heart.
I'm calling to the gods.
Give me the power for my march.

[Verse 1]
Up in the highlands, there's wisdom and silence.
Where thunder and wind is in the air.
My spirit was sleeping. Enbodied and deepened
Down in an unholy sphere.

And now it's been wakened. The mountains were shaking.
A rumble accured in the sky.
My eyes start to see and my old wounds are bleeding.
I know I was sent back to life

[Bridge]
