Well, the midnight headlight
Find you on a rainy night
Steep grade up ahead
Slow me down makin' no time
I gotta keep rollin'

Those windshield wipers
Slappin' out a tempo
Keepin' perfect rhythm
With the song on the radio

Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a better way, for me
Ooh, I'm drivin' my life away
Lookin' for a sunny day

Well, the truck stop, cutie
Comin' on to me
