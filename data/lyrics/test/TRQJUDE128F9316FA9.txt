This is so amazin', got my heart racin'
The way it goes down, I'm not afraid to say you can take charge
Got my eyes in the back of my head while I'm seein' stars

It sounds like you're ready girl for daddy girl
We don't have to prolong, in fact we can get a track
And do it to the sound of a hand clap

Let me handle that, ooh just how you like it babe
I can give you what you lack, don't take it in a negative way
Baby it's a fact when we get up in the sack
I'm gonna break ya back in a good way

Stop then we start again
I can hear ya moanin' and wer'e not alone yes
I can see our shadows on the wall movin' gracefully

There's people in the other room but I don't really give a damn baby
I've been really missin' you and I am sick and tired of waitin'
