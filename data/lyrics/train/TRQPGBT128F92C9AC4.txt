You can tell by her smile she's such a love child
And every man in this place would love to be in her space
As the night settles down she'd meet a lot of clever clowns
And I'll do my best to be better than the rest

She is so, so sweet and tender
And I'm glad, so glad we made it girl
She's so, so sweet and tender
And I'm glad, so glad we're makin' love
Oh I, oh I love that girl, oh oh

Then she walks my way, and said boy I hope your free
...
