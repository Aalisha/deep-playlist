We have heard the Thunder
And we have seen the storm
Echoes of Your kingdom coming
Rumors of our home

Where one day we will stand before You Lord
Our altogether beautiful reward

We will give You glory, bring You honor
King above all Kings, You deserve our everything
We will lift our voices with Your praises
Jesus You are our King
Yes, You are Lord

For now we walk in darkness
