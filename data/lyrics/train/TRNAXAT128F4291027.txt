The end of ends, to solve the problem
The cause of death, the sum of our stricken lies
Natural selection, a dying dog will die

The old stray of the pack we weep in pity
To see the utter truth, believe in infamy
Destroy and conquer and lacerate humanity

Beneath the bowels of a hollow life they dwell
Without belief, isolations now reality
The end of ends is now indicative
So let the fatal wounds bleed

The end of ends our path is sanctified
Strangulation to rid ourselves of heresy
Altercations a cruel hand we strike
