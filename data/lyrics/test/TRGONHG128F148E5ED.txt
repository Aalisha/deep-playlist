You're so ahead of me
Don't see how that could be-
Did I just miss something here?
It's the worst I fear
My Dear

You're lookin oh-so-cute
Did you just buy that suit?
And you just changed your hair
It's so unfair
I'm tryin not to care

Just remember this-
It's just a kiss
Nobody has to know
And I won't tell anyone
But I know
And I'll be waiting by the phone
