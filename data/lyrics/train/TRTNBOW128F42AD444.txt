So close to something
The closest I've come in a while
So close to something
I can taste it in my mind

Torn, don't know what to do
It's like nothing I've ever seen
The line amidst right and wrong is gone
And I stand in between

Where do we go from here
Do I hide behind the walls of another's pride
Or do I say goodbye

So close to something
...
