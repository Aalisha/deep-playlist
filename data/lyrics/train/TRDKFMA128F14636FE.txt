Fare thee well my brother
please don't stand in my way
I'm going down to that dirty town
no matter what you say
You fooled me and you ruled me
and you played in every part
I gotta go, it's no use me stayin' home

Goodbye my sister
please don't let me see you cry
Gonna be a star some day
no matter what they say
And when you hear the crowds
all callin' and shouting out my name
until then, my little friend, I'll be unsatisfied
