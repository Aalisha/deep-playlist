It Don't Come Easy, That's Understood
Faint-hearted Loser, That's no Good
Just Take a Lesson From the Great Mohammed
He Said... He Said...

Pick Up a Rifle, You Must Be Strong
To Take a Title, Can Be So Long
If You Believe, You Can't Go Wrong
I Said... I Said...

He's a Fighter, He's My Friend,
Always Winning in the End,
He's no Angel, He's no Fool,
Never Plays It By the Rule,
