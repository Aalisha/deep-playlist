I have gone right round the world, trying to find a women
A women that'll understand me
I have gone right round the world, trying to find a women
A women that'll understand me

All the women I had before, never understood me
Now that I've found you baby
I ain't gonna look no further
Now that I've found you baby
I ain't gonna look no further
Now that I've found you baby
