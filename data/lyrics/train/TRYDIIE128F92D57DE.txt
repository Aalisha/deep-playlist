Time, you do lead us astray
Leading us almost everyday
Are you a friend?
Are you my keeper?
Are you a relic?
Are you a cheater?
Can I deny you?
Can I believe you?
Can I deceive you?
You're a deceiver
You're a deceiver

Time, when you rush in
From day one,
'till the time that we're done
we just run
trying to catch you
...
