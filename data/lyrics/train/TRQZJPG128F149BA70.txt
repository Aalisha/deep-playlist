Share with me the blankets that you're wrapped in
Because it's cold outside, it's cold outside
(it's cold outside)
Share with me the secrets that you kept in
Because it's cold inside, it's cold inside
(it's cold inside)

And your slow shaking finger tips show
that you're scared like me so
Let's pretend we're alone
And I know you may be scared
And I know we're unprepared
But I don't care

Tell me, tell me
What makes you think that you are invincible?
I can see it in your eyes that you're so sure
Please don't tell me that I'm the only one that's vulnerable
Impossible
