Ain't nothing i can do with a woman like you but love ya
I love you any kind of way, just say whats on your mind, oooh
there aint nothing i can do with a woman like you but love ya

On this rare occation
And we'll be taking our time
in a loving situation

But oh what is in you
Makes me wanna do ooh ooh
Aint nothing i can do with a woman like you but love you
