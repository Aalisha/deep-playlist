Stress! Alas! You have to confess.
Nothing more and nothing less.
Don't you know your time expires?
Fading away, fading away. Another day...

Just another link in the chain.

Through the desert sands you're running.
Falling again, falling again.

Is that you're living for?
You run away from sun.

Is that you're dying for?
Is that you're dying for?
