(Tek)
This is the story of a place, that we call home
Where the kids pack heat when it's time to roam
Everybody's on the scramble, life's a gamble
Hoppin on the white horse, tryin to get a handle
On the fast pace that we call the last race
Step wit precaution when you enter this place
We got a spot on every block that makes ya dreams come true
Just come correct wit the snapses or ya doo
Don't come cryin broke, still tryin to cop the dope
What parts of no, do not you understand bro
We can't afford to take shorts or be playing sports
Empires need to be built, mack 10's bought
Or even caught for them deceased ass hustlers
And we still got the pound for ya living muthafuckas
What goes around comes back to the roots
See you at the revolution and Crooklyn, true

(Chorus)
We live in Brooklyn baby
We try to make it baby
We gonna make it baby
We live in Brooklyn baby

(Steele)
Another day, another dollar dead
Pigs rushin the crib to catch a collar now I'm fed
What the face now, me and my people's taste crown
...
