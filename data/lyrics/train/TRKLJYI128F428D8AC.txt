we've been workin' hard all week
we've been under command
we've been trapped in this prison cell
i think it's time to get out

and now it's friday 5 o'clock
we know it's time to rock
so leave all your worries behind
and switch into overdrive

let's get crazy, let's get wild
let's get crazy, let's get wild
...
