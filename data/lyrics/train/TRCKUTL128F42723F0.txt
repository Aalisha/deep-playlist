I see her sailing on her silver wings
With hands that move like little trees
Alive and bending in my raging storm
To a heartbeat, my lady lives for me
To a heartbeat, my lady lives for me

Out of the country to my city life
All wrapped in dreams she wears like pearls
She dances to the music that I play for her
And my lady is the softness in my world
...
