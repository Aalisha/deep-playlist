Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
Have you seen that vigilante man?
I've been hearin' his name all over this land
Lonely nights down in the engine house
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse
Man comes home, chase the crowds in the rain
That's a vigilante man.

Vigilante man
Vigilante man.
