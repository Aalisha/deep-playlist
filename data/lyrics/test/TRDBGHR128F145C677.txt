Loving is to live with the power to forgive
Loving is to live with the power to forgive
Lead me, show me, where can it be found.
Reach me, hold me, don? t ever let me down.

Tell me what you? ve seen

Tell me what you mean

Tell me what you? ve seen
The crimson fell like rain

Should I even try?
Whatever befalls me
Living out a lie?
I believe in glory
