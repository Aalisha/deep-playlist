Clung to a ball
That was hung in the sky
Hurled into orbit
There you are

Whether you fall down
Or whether you fly
Seems you can never get too far

Someone's waiting to put wings
Upon your flightless heart

You're on the verge of a miracle
Just standing there, oh
You're on the verge of a miracle
Just waiting to be believed in
Open your eyes and see
...
