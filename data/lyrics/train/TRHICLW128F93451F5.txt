How many times have i felt down inside? 
The Need to be loved by you! 
I wanted to show you how good it could be, 
If you would only show a little interest in me. 

You came into my life and turned my head around 
And just as quickly you put me down, 
Now you don`t wanna know what I`m going through 
Cause just like i said, it means nothing to you!

OOOoo, OOOoo, OOOoo. 

I`ve got this need eating away at my soul 
An insurmountable need that i just can`t control 
You created this fire, when the flame got too hot 
You turned and walked away, just leaving me on the spot! 
Yes you run, you just won`t show love 
That`s the thing you`re frightened of...
