Voice of the wise is trying to summon you
From the world where all the problems you can think of are solved
Blindfold, no one can see what's going on
People rave though there are not even any drugs involved

The vision unfolds and the things you've been told
Are unjustified by your own mind

Come with me and I'll show thee
What lies beyond the veil of delirium you'll see
...
