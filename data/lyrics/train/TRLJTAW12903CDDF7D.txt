ooooooohh
im loosing patience it's been so long
feels like a million years since you've been gone
swear if i hear another slow song
you might see me on the loose
i just can't wait until your phone call
what you been doing, nothing at all
i miss your skin, yeaa it was so soft
im sorry to sing the blues but oh yeaa
this is the hardest thing that i've ever done
i need your love, i wish you were giving me some
i might go to parties and i might have some fun
but nothing compares to you
so i know the way i'll be all alone
the smile on my face sinking like a storm
but im not afraid to be on my own
if im counting the days till your coming home
and when your coming home
when you coming home
