Tell me your thoughts now baby
Tell me what's on your mind
Tell me what's eating you alive
Tell me your darkest secrets
Clear up those stupid lies
Show me what's there behind those eyes

I want to know 'cause i can't face another day here in the dark
I'm tired of owndering when we're together baby where you are
Why should i give you everything
When you will only break my heart
You will only break my heart
You will only break my heart
