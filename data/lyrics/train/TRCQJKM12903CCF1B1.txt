Let me take you to a place
Where everybody knows your face
There's no king and there's no queen
And everything is like a dream

You can live in harmony
With those who were your enemy
You can do just what you want to
No one here will ever hurt you

There'll be lights and thunder
There'll be time to wonder
And there will be no cryin'

There'll be lights and thunder
There'll be time to wonder
And there will be no cryin'
There will be no lyin'
There will be no dyin'

There won't be a hell below
And there won't be no God to follow
No religion, no believin'
...
