Do you believe in fate or chances
Design or coincidences
Would you say that all the people
Live their life for good and evil
Some have reached the end of patience
Start to play with God's creation

They know you
Control you
In a game we shouldn't play
Corrupt your heart
And make you part
Of a game we shouldn't play
We run blind
