Chorus
Come and take a walk with me
I need all of y'all to come and take a walk with me
I need for all of y'all to feel what im goin' through
And see what I see, if u got time then take a walk with me
Wait a minute [now], shit aint like I thought it would be
Come to jersey from new york with me, I know ur busy
But take the time out to walk with me,
Pay attention on this tour with me, maybe im seeing something wrong,
Come along and make sure with me, come and take a short walk with me,

Vs. 1
Yo,
im seeing a couple things wrong with the way that im living,
so come and walk with me I just need a second opinion,
ill introduce u to my friends, I gotta see if u notice
if they loyal or if they all got an alterior motive
they some snake Niggas, me and them don't deal anymore
ever since I got signed I don't know whats real anymore
im paranoid so excuse me if I seem to be nervous
but everybody from my past now they trying to resurface
trying to rekindle, they don't think i know they go limo
I got cousins I never knew they trying to pass me they demo
Maybe im wrong like I told u man I need g' ya opinion
Me and them never spoke before so I don't see whats so different
Dudes I don't know they recognize me start extending they hand
And I m trippin ready for beef when he was only a fan [why]
Cuz these Niggas in my hood say they don't like how im reppin
Let me know how strongly u feel, will I be needing my weapon
As some sort of protection,
should I carry a pen and pad and ask everybody in the fuckin hood for they suggestions
im letting the labels know that jersey city is gifted
when they aint no that jersey city existed
