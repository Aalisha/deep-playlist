You wore a sagging dress in satin way (?)
Barefoot with style
My grandchild,
And I was proud in every way
Walked by your side

But today, my love...
I'm alone and you're high up above
I do remember dreamy wednesdays
In the rain creative pain
How I remember dreamy wednesdays
In the rain

I miss you, the way you used to take my hand
We're all alone in the whole wide world
...
