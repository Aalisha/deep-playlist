Let's go fishing in the morning
Just like we've always gone
You can come inside and wake me up
We'll pack and leave by dawn,
We will pack and leave by dawn.

And you'll say I hear something
and I'll say never you mind.
It's just our two poles knocking in the back seat
and your truck is running fine today
