If you can feel what i am feeling
then the truth is just believing
you're my, you're my diamond girl
Diamond girl you make me feel
like i'm on fire when you are near
you captivate me with your smile
girl you make me get so wild
ooh oh diamond girl
you're my diamond girl
ooh oh diamond girl
you're my diamond girl
Diamond girl i'd like to know
if i am getting near your door
which will only make me want you more
