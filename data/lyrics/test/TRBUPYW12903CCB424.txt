Abduction


I wake in sweat you've come to steal my life away
Some strange electric glow of artifical day
The power breakers close, the grid of darkness falls
Shining gleaming black as night, burning all the light

[chorus:]
What do you want from me?
I sense your mastery...
There's something you won't ever find
So have your way with me, this prisoner is never free
...
