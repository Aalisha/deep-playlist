Honey, love, honey, love, what you do to me
I can't think, I can't act the way I use to be
Got no choice, just your voice send me through the roof
I'm a mess, I confess it's because of you

Ooh, shook me up so quickly
Ooh, hit me like a smooth breeze

Smooth like the air, I take you into me
You're all I crave, remain within me, deep
Just like the air, you're there around it all
Smooth everywhere, your stare, it made me fall
...
