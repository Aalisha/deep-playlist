I seen you go down to a cold mirror
It was never clearer in my error, so
You lick a shine upon your forehead or
Check it by the signs in the corridor
You light my ways through the club maze
We would struggle through the dub daze

I see myself in there upon my lover
It's how you go down to the men's room sink
Sad we talk of how madmen think
I see myself in there upon my lover
I don't know her from another miss
I don't know you from another
See me run, now you're gone

Dream on

Why you want to take me to this party and breathe?
I'm dying to leave
