Promises, promises
There to be broken
This truth is forgotten, honestly
Apologies, apologies
Here's my confession
I learnt from my lesson, long before
Toast the crimes, the foes, the fears
The truth behind the sober tears

I'll find my way back from the stars & the sea
This kind of journey just means nothing to me
I'll find my way back cos it's easy you see
This seperation still means nothing to me
