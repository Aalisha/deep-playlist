Did you read what I wrote?
Oh did you read what I wrote?
Or did you just sit back to tear it up
and prove I was wrong?

And did you smile when you read?
oh did you smile when I said:
That you have a cold heart, cold hands,
and you're a cold, cold disgrace.

And do you roam on your own
oh do you roam on your own
or you had to ask mother, father, brother
for some money again

I will send a little love token
wrap it in my heart and go home
