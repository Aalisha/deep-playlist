Wear me loose, wear me tight
Wear me out on Friday night
Change your mind, put me away
Saving me to wear another day

And I'm watching you
And I'm seeing you
Slipping away
Further away

Love is lost and found
More than you
But you're not around

Love is lost and found
More than you
But you're not around
