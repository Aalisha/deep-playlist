I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel, the other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says "Baby, is somethin' wrong?
I say "Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song"
And he says

Our song is the slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone & you talk real slow
'Cause it's late & your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her & I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said "Amen"
Askin' God if he could play it again
...
