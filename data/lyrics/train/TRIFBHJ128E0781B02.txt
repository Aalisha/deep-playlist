Bill Barratt has a simple dream
He calls it his plan B
Bulidings in the sky and the air is sugar-free
And everyones very friendly

Well, plan B arrived on a holiday
He took a cab to the shopping malls
Bought and ate until he could do neither anymore
Then found love on channel 44

La la-la-la-la
He wants to go to magic America
La la-la-la-la
He'd like to live in magic America
