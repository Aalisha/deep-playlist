Jenny, you are the frightened kind
But you're leaving all your troubles behind today
You never thought you'd turn that curve
You never thought you had the nerve to walk away

Now you're leaving all your troubles behind
Somewhere past the Tennessee line
You're leaving all your troubles behind you

Your boyfriend is the kinda guy
Who always makes you wonder why
You're sticking around
