Find me here
And speak to me
I want to feel You
I need to hear You
You are the light
That's leading me
To the place
Where I find peace again

You are the strength
That keeps me walking
You are the hope
That keeps me trusting
You are the light
To my soul
You are my purpose
You're everything

How can I stand here with You
And not be moved by You?
Would You tell me
How could it be
Any better than this? Yeahyeah

You calm the storms
And You give me rest
You hold me in Your hands
