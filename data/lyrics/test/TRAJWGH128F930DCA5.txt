Burl Ives - Tam Pierce (Widdecombe Fair)
Tarn Pierce, Tarn Pierce, lend me your gray mare,
All along down along out along lea.
Us wants to go to Widdecombe Fair,
Bill Brewer, Jan Stewer, Peter Gurney, Peter Davey,
Daniel Whiddon, Harry Hawk,
Old Uncle Tom Cobbley and all,
Old Uncle Tom Cobbley and all.
