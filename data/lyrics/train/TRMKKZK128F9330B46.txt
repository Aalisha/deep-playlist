Limitations in manners nailed deep within
Spreading as internal flood
This peak of knowledge and it's corrosion
Has turned the survivors into their own victims

Constant progress in escaping alive
Is degradation of regret
By the time they deviate
A state seen as an I'll vision has become the essence

Discarding the future, discarding senses
Raising barriers in front of what's gone
