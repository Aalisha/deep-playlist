People get ready for the heartbeat props
(We're giving heartbeat props)
Everybody get ready for the heartbeat props
(We're giving heartbeat props)

We're gonna make it funky with the heartbeat props, y'all
(We're giving heartbeat props)
It's time to get busy with the heartbeat props
(We're giving heartbeat props)

I give my man props 'cause he's living
(Why wait until the heartbeat stops?)
Check it out, y'all, proper respect is what we're giving
(We're giving heartbeat props)

Uh, I give my man props 'cause he's living
(Why wait until the heartbeat stops?)
Don't you know that the proper respect is what we're giving

Seems like you wondered each day if the Underground
Is going to stay down with the funky beats
Even if you know that I'm a junkie for a bump that's funky
And a fool for the loop, see, a groupie for the old one-twoiee

A bass freak would say oohwee
Peace to DU 'cause I like the way you do me
I love to go on about the funk, matter of fact
I'd love to be another funk front runner

But first we gotta deal with the fronters
So I can't go on, it's time to drop a few bombs
Get busy, G, go on and take 'em to school
Yeah, it's time spread the jewels

I ask you about Malcolm and you tell me that he's wicked
Farrakhan comes you can't seem to buy a ticket
And check what my man's got to say
Right or wrong, don't you think that he deserves a play?

'Cause he's living for you and you and you and you
The brother X tried but he died trying to get through
So why wait until the heartbeat stops?
Yo, go on and give my man his props

If you're really that down then act what you say
KRS and Chuck need support today
I see you posing with the Dr King hanging on your wall
Only difference is Chuck might give you that call

To march on Friday, yeah, it's kind of frightening
Let me move so I don't get hit by the bolt of lightning
Striking you down 'cause you're fronting
A dead leader can't tax your mind
Therefore he's not a threat to your personal time

All the lagging and the dragging
Yo, I got something to do that day
Yeah, you sound like an old bitch nagging
Fuck that fronting, fuck that fronting
We're pumping up the brothers 'cause the brothers keep it pumping

You got it all wrong
When you wait for the TV to tell you what's going on
Don't you hype on the mic, yeah, they never get it right
That's why you see we gotta thank God, y'all
For niggas like Ice Cube

'Cause they'll tell the record straight
Yo, my man's a prophet too, yo, god, you think he ain't?
So do the right thing, it's not a black or a white thing
We're here to let you know it's just a human being thing
