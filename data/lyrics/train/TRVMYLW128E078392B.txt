Woh
Yeah
I feel guilty
My words are empty

No signs to give you
Don't have the time for you
You say I'm heartless
And you say I don't care
I used to be there for you
You've said I seem so dead, that I have changed but so have you
Guilty woh
Guilty, I feel so empty
Yeah
Empty you know how to make me feel
I put a shield upon you
Didn't mean to hurt you
Would've only poisoned your mind
Never meant to make you cry
You've been so thoughtless
