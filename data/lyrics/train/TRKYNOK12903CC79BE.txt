I bear the curse, that haunts the minds of men
The hunger for power, the great respect
I will lead, lead you against the gods
I will make you see, your destiny

Come to me, come minions sworn to obey
As you give you shall receive
Bow your heads and praise the fire
As you burn for me

Gods hear me, hear my thunder rise
I will destroy your reign of lies
Gods betrayed me, betrayed me before my eyes
