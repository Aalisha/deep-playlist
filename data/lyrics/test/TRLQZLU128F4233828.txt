I hope you understand
What fear is before you have to feel it
I hope my neurosis don't rub off on you
I hope you always have enough to eat

I hope you're never bullied
And I hope you never bully others
I hope you find love
I hope you don't die before your time

I hope you don't blame yourself
For things that are not your fault
I hope you're always playing your tape
And I hope you'll visit me when I'm old
