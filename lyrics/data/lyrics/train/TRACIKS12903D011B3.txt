Tall machines wait in line
So still lost in time
Jets turn and make no sound
Returning to the solid ground
People drift out of time
Watching numbers turn
Seems that I've been waiting here forever

Jetstream
Stormy seas
Cast adrift on a troubled dream
I've seen the sleeping ships at night
I will meet you there
The roar of the engine in the air (Jetstream)
