Deception they lie and propaganda-ize.
They prey on weakness from the seekers of a better fucking life and bleed them dry. 
Promise and faith to fucking hook the bait till they got you where they want you 
and pull your strings and taunt you every time. 
I call shenanigans, it's Un-American lies, lies, lies.
