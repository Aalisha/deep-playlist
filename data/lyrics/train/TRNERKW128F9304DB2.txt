He's been a drifter all his life
He's been to places that you will never find
And all the things, and all the lies
He has seen the betrayal a million times

Every time he looked around, there was nobody there
That he could trust, full of lies they were
Now everytime he will be, the one who don't care
About anything and anyone no more

So full of lies
Oh, no more
Won't pay the price
Oh, no more

And forever he will travel on
...
