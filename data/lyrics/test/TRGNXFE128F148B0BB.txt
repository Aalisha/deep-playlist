Jenny's daddy was five years gone
By the time that Jenny was 6 years old
It was her and her mom and her parakeet Pete
In a little blue house at the end of the street.

Her friends ask her what her daddy did
And you know how it is when you're just a kid
She couldn't tell em' that she didn't know
So Jenny just lied and told em'.

He's a cowboy riding the range
He's got a painted pony with a flowing mane
And he's chasin' the sun, dodgin' the rain
And he don't go running away.

When it gets tough
He's made of that stuff
That don't let you down, boy
No, he's a cowboy, he's a cowboy.

Ten years later after a pillow fight
