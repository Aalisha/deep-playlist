No more timing each tear
That falls from my eyes

I'm not hiding the remedy
To cure this old heart of mine
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight

I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
I can dream about you
If I can't hold you tonight

I can dream about you
You know how to hold me just right
Moving sidewalks

I don't see under my feet
Climbing up from down here below
Where the streets see me lonely for you
I can dream about you
