I know the kind of pain you offer
Baby, I've felt your kind of pain before
Change your mind like revolving doors
Change your women like you change your clothes

Chorus:
I'm telling you
You better watch your step
You'll fall and hurt yourself one day
You better watch your step
You'll fall and hurt yourself one day
