The earth need some moulding
I'm gonna dig and dig some holes in
And bring forth some fruits, oh Lord
Trees bearing fruits
The earth needs some moulding
Arise my sheep if you're sleeping
And bring forth your fruits, oh Lord
Trees bearing fruits
Trees bearing fruits
Said I know of a place rich and silent
With these lots of work for each and everyone
To be done, it's no fun
Bring forth your portions sistrens and bredrens
I believe the time has now come
Let's not tore he, 'cause her heart is ready
Something has got to be done
I said the earth need some moulding
