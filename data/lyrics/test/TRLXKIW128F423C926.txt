Bearing the mark of a demon from hell
The dragon is cast onto the earth
Seeking revenge on the woman of man
Satanus unleashes his wrath
Angels of death are the allies of hate
The jackals destroying the cross

Fighting with fire the dragon attacks
Burning the cross
And unleashing the powers of hell
Cursed are the mortals who dare
To fight with the beast

Demons of hell bear the mark of the beast
The sons of the dragon are born
Summoned to earth armageddon is here
