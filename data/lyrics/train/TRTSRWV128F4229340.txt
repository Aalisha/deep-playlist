Chaos, disorder
Mathematics of our creation
Mistakes bring deceit
Acknowledgment of our demise
Transcend the strength
Future messenger of all that's dead
Quench a blind man's thirst
The list of curse, reversed

Enter the glorious faith
In full shocking effect
All along this deadly river
Flowing through these veins

Worlds twist into convulsion
Suffocating myth arise
Shocked beliefs of slaves embedded
Reborn fear in man create

Onwards to the throne of sorrow
...
