(S. Hoffs/V. Peterson/J. Shear)
Susanna & Vicki

I got nothing
There's no sense in looking back
All my yesterdays went up in flames
Now I'm gonna
Just forget what's in the past
I don't even recognize their names

Two undiscarded lives, a simple proposition
Everyday a little pain
Survival's up to me, since every time I
Open my eyes the world remains

I got nothing (got nothing)
Too bad (too bad)
But I'm happy cause that's all I have (that's all I have)
I got nothing (got nothing)
They want (they want)
