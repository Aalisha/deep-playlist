Don't you get it, come and get it
It doesn't mean all the time
Quit yer whinging, wind yer neck in
for franks sake get a life
you try to own me, don't you know me?
you really haven't got a clue
Or maybe I've just outgrown you...

chorus
Never gonna go back there again
Never gonna let you fence me in
'Cos you're watching me, always watching me
Get yer fill, overkill
...
