Spend all your time waiting for that second chance
For the break that will make it ok
There's always some reason to feel Â“not good enough"
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction, oh beautiful release
Memories seep from my veins
They may be empty and weightless, and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight
