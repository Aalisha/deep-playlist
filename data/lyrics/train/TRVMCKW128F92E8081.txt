Can you hear me cry across the great divide
Do you hear me calling or are my tears just falling
In an ocean of regret, words left unsaid
I wish I could hold you, I wish that I could have that chance again
But when I close my eyes
I can see you there reaching out your hand to me
And I follow you through every dream
How I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you

Somehow over mountains
Somehow over seas
Love will break the silence
And bring you back to me
Love will bring you back to me
Somehow - break the silence
