I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up

See it never used to come that easy
And I was just lying my way
I don't no how I did it but
I will carry on 'til I die, I ain't gonna lie now

Mama tried the best to bring me up right
Guess it never worked, she was cries
I was well involved in crime
From the age of nine music got me kind of famous
Now they want a piece of pie

Blud I'm blowin' up the scene but I don't no where my bed is
I smoke so much weed 'cause I don't no where my head is
I might have fame, but I'm still low on credit
Management loved the money, someone tell me where my bread is

I come across a lot of rich kids that die to be thugs
But I don't understand them they very, very loved
They don't wake up in the morning to see man pipin' dubs
You have to worry about them goons with the 38 snubs

You got too much to lose, you're in a great position
How can you be hood
If my whole freakin' flat is smaller than your kitchen
You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from, you'd go missing
So appreciate what you've got 'cause with that I'm still wishing

I've never had love for the feds
But I've always had love for my slum
I'm addicted to these streets like a mum is to her kids
So my people in the slum put your hands up, brap

See it never used to come that easy
