How do we

Often we live for tomorrow
When all we really have is just today
where did the joy turn into sorrow
How did we let it all slip away
I never ever meant to hurt you
Even time can't undo what's been done

Chorus:
How do we mend a broken heart
How do we find a place to start
How can we learn to trust each other
How do we wipe away the tears
Just walk away from all these years
