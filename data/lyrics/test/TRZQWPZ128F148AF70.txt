It's sinfully late and I'm sinfully drunk
I've sinfully spoken a whole lot of junk
but I'm sinfully happy with things as they are
I haven't yet fallen asleep

And I didn't do it, I really did not
go off to lose the one thing I've got;
the idea that I have, whatever that means
the chastity belt of a queen

And that ain't easy
...
