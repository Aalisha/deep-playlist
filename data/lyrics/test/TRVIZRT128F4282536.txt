I've got something new for you
when it hits you wont know what to do
Relax, let me move u
dont resist its in the air
just one taste will take u there
let it flow right through u
I know ur getting tired of the same ole thing
Imma break the rules gonna change the game
You'll be screaming my name
and imma take u places u neva seen
u couldnt picture this in your wildest dreams
Don't fear, you're here with me

Chorus:
Let's get Lifted
(lifted)
ooh imma get u high
im really gonna blow your mind
We'll get Lifted (lifted)
