Don't talk rubbish to me
i use reason on my brain
it's those little superstitions
that get me through the stress and strain

i have made my contributions
and now and then i find
on the subject of my love life
i've been left behind

let's make the most of it
the time we've got together
quit all the secrets that are
choking up your heart
and tearing all the light from the stars

let's make the most of it
the time we've got together
quit all the secrets that are
choking up your heart
and tearing all the light from the stars

i'm made some calculations
but will not put them to the test
it's those little superstitions
that cannot be laid to rest
