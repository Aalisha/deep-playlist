I need you
I need you

One, two, or, three…
Maybe a hundred times, she'd say a thousand times
That my insecurity was showing out over and over again
And the problem wasn't her (it was me)
And the fact that i never trusted you
And i know that must have disgusted you
But i had to hurt ‘til i learned

More than ever…
After what i been through
All i really know is that i need you
More than ever…
Standing here in the rubble
I know that i'm in trouble
I need you more than ever (never ever)
...
