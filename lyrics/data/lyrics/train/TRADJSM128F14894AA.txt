They all asked about you
down on the farm
the cows asked, the pigs asked
the horses asked, too
all wanna know why to the city
you moved, changed your name to kitty
what's come over you?
it ain't true; it ain't true, linda lou
say it ain't true, linda lou
it ain't true; it ain't true, linda lou
say it ain't true, linda lou

they's all bawling 'bout you
down on the farm
the cows bawl, the pigs bawl
...
