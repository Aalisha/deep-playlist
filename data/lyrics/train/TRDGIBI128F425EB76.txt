Dreams of earth quakes
Dreams of hurricanes
Dreams of pouring rain
Dreams of tidal waves to wash us all away
Dreams of guns blazed
Dreams of fire rage
Dreams of swollen graves
Dreams of hollow pain
All gone

No more fallen
No more enemy
No more casualty
No more dream

Fall into sleep, fall into me
I have a dream
But nobody cares, nobody wants to listen
Fall into sleep, fall into me
Hang onto a dream, that nobody wants
...
