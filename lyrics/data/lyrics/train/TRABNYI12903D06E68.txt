Walking down the street
Paranoia's got hold of both of my feet
I can't remember last weekend
It's only fair to tell you my friend
This war is shaping up the same way
I can't even remember yesterday, but
Well, I'm not Jesus I'm definitely not Barrack
Could you please prise the leeches from my back?
And I'm never gonna save the world, but
I might try and take it over
Grab a drink, find a girl
It doesn't matter if she's older

Forget the weight of the world
You don't need it on your shoulders
Forget the weight of the world
You don't need it on your shoulders
Forget the weight of the world
You don't need it on your shoulders
