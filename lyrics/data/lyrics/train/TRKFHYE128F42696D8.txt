I hear the sound of a voice
Crying out in the wilderness
(Prepare ye the way of the Lord)
I hear the sound of a voice
It sounds like thunder
(Prepare ye the way of the Lord, ooh)

This is a war cry
Calling all of the warriors
(With your weapons fit for the fight)
We must stand as a people
Filled with His light

Chorus:
Prepare ye the way
Of the Lord, Lord, Lord
Prepare ye the way
Of the Lord, Lord, Lord
