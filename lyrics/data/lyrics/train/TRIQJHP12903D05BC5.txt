Baby, watch my blood boil
To an opalescent blue
Better draw the curtain,
They're trying to catch
A glimpse of you
Slowly watch the fruit die,
Still clinging to the vine
Redemption from a bottle
That stays empty all the time

But, my dear, it's worth the pain
When they're pulling your insides out

Baby, know your nemesis
