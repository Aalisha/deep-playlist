Jennifer dates a man in a 60s cover band
He's the ess-dog, or sean if you wish
She's 18, he's 31
She's a rich girl, he's the son
Of a coca-cola middle man

Kiss when they listen
To brothers in arms
And if there's something wrong with this
They don't see the harm
In joining their forces and singing along

See those rings on her toes check that frisbee in his volvo
It's a volvo with ancient plates
They've got a dog she named trey
