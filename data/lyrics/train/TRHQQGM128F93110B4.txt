Was it really this hard
To be in your skin
To want what you wanted
Knowing you couldn't win
Was it really this long
The road that you walked
Before you laid down
The lines around you were chalked

So Godspeed my friend
May you never be lonely again
And the enemy from whom
You always have run
Was yourself
And your army of one
