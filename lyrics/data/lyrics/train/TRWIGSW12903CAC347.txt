All I needed was a light
In the darkest place
I've ever been in all my life
As I try to find my way
And the changing seasons of my life
And my eyes don't see
The things I love have run their course
Are they done
Are they just beginning

And I'm old enough to know
That time doesn't move slow enough
And young enough to know
That I can't ever be too old enough to trust you
Higher and higher
I wanna go there with you
Some say your fire, your fire
Is through
And I don't wanna think that way

So you lost your job and lost the girl
