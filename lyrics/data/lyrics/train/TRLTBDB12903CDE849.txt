The Last that ever she saw him
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away
By a moonlight shadow

Lost in a river That saturday night
Far away
On the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she could'nt find how to push through
The trees that whisper in the evening

Carried away
By a moonlight shadow
...
