If I send you roses, for no reason at all.
If out of the blue, I stop and give you a call.
Once in a while, it's breakfast in bed.
and then pull the covers back up over our head.
If I call in sick, just to stay home with you.
I want you to know, I do what I do.
It's my way of saying, what I can't express.
But I want you to know, Girl I'm doing my best.

Chorus:
Ooohh I'm just a man, that's the way I was made.
I'm not too good at saying, what you need me to say.
