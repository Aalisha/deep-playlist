Oh rain falls, thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move, they're shaking all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes

When a woman cries

Fire burning through your brain
Turn to face the train
Hey, it's magic, said the mother to the child
It's stronger than a smile
Let it go
