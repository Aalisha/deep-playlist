Tell her how I feel
She just says "Me too"
It's such a raw deal
But what can I do

She's not romantic
It's not her style
Sometimes I plan it
She just smiles

Not everyone
Gets the rainbow
But it's no fun
To miss your own show

She's not romantic
It wouldn't do
She might get frantic
And come unglued
...
