Dreams so stylized
(Do it)
Sweet as cyanide
(Do it)

I got to see a light
Gotta, gotta, got to do it
And push the rules aside
Got, got, got, got, got to do it
Come on, it's suicide
Never mind I got to do, do, do it, do it
I'm gonna cut deep inside
Never, never know
Cause I'm not sure that
I can make, break the bounds

See a light
Gotta, gotta, got to do it
You push the rules aside
Got, got, got, got, got to do it
You know it's suicide
