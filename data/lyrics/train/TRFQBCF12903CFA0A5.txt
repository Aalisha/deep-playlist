Hey, say, wait a minute
Where you going with that suitcase
Wait a minute, listen
All right, well, you don't have
To answer, just listen

I don't mind when you say
That you're going away
I just don't wanna be lonely

And I don't care if we
Share only moments a day
I just don't wanna be lonely

I'd rather be loved and needed
Depended on to give a love
I can't give when you're gone
When you're gone
I just don't want to be lonely
I'd rather be loved

I don't mind when the tide
