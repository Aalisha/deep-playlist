Sic 'em on a chicken.
Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly 

Sic 'em on a chicken.
Sic 'em on a chicken.
Sic 'em on a chicken. Bring out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry.

My dog Pete is the smallest dog of all the dogs in my yard
He's a mean son' bitch
Drinks Beam and water from a broken mason jar

Sic 'em on a chicken.
Sic 'em on a chicken. 
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly

Sic 'em on a chicken.
Sic 'em on a chicken.
