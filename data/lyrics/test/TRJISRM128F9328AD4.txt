what's the bullshit for
verbal battlefield
syllables of war

i shut myself off and it happens again
you're not my friend
you're not my friend
you're not my friend ... go

the winter knocked down my door
like a selfish bitch
i'm glad that you haven't got your wish
in the cold, all alone
i've been thinking of
everyone but you

and it feels like seventh grade again
and none of this will ever end
i'm just your public malcontent
another extraneous trend

don't try to be like me because
i'm not one to compete
just to obtain the status of a symbol
of idolatry

this time i'd really rather be alone
can we forget this, i can just go home
this time i'd really rather
be alone

acting unaffected by this hand of fate
saying everything's ok with a straight face
i remember when you said i could count on your for anything
and I still hold on

you'll all hold off and play
...
