I tried to do the best I can for you
But it seems not enough
And you know I care
Even when you're not there
But it's not what you want

You close your door when I wanna give you more
(I wanna give you)
And I feel, I feel so out of place
And you know it's true
Don't you think I'm good enough for you?

Can't you see
(Can't you see?)
That you're hurting me?
