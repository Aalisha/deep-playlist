Annul a race, destroy a kind
I'll take their land, I won't lose mine
Murder honored [misprinted as "honered" in CD liner notes?], peace is quelled
Death or dishonor, spirit melts
Pushing on, fire fight
Limbs on the ground, blinded sight
Piercing slug, piercing scream
Spraying blood, my enemy

Setting sights to take lives
To delimb, no war crimes
Feel the rape of your land
Drop like shit, useless stand
Incendiary [misprinted as "Incinderary" in CD liner notes?], you are ended
Still to fight, attempt and defend

Let me hear your battle cry
Is it the same before you die
Smell the death, inhale [the/your] pain
Taste the fear, violent insane
Skin burns hotter before it's cold
