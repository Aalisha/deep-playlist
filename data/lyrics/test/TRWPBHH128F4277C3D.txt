So, just because I use salty phrases
And I go through stages
Where I neglect endeavour
Does this means that I'm not clever?
No, I dont think so

Just because my newspaper pages
Haven't been the Times in ages
Does that mean that
I don't know as much as you?

Jealousy will destroy us
Or so she used to say
You'd kill for half the things we do
Including yesterday

But I suppose you know
Because you went to school with me
You'd sit in the garage and you'd see
All the things that we do, don't you?

No you didn't, and no you don't
No you didn't, and no you don't
...
