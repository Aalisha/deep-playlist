Dead from the neck up
I know you hate to face the truth but can't you see me I'm not like...
You can count the true friends you have on the fingers of no hands
You never looked before you leap
Never think before you speak
The things you think of as your strengths I depise for being weak
You made my acquaintance with broken glass
I know you hate to face the truth even when you're faced with the proof
Can't you see that you're just a fake?
How much of this can you take?
You're dead from the neck up
