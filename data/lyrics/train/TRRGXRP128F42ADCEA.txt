God must love you I said to myself
'Cause you're more beautiful than
anybody else
God must adore you, it's easy to tell
Must be wonderful to wake up to yourself
From the moment I first saw you
Had a vibe that's fit to kill
It was then you know that I knew love was real

On the day I met you, you were so so chill
On the day I fell in love with you my heart stood still
And I never saw this happening to me
It's like something just came over me
I never thought that I could be

God must love you he's proud of himself
When he made you girl he broke the mold for real
