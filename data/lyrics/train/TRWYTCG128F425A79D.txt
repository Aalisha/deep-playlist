In summertime I have no fury
No chance of sinking sailing ships
If time stood still
I'd take aim and fire for you

For every ocean there must be shore
On which I'll stand with restless toes
When everything I look for in myself
Is in you

I feel a little more than empty
But I wanna feel more than full

It's a pity all I have
Is just enough to keep you satisfied
This knot could come undone
No matter how we try to keep it tied
...
