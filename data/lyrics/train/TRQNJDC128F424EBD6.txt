Outside there's this flickerin' sound
I can feel it rising above me
Above the ground

My eyes, they gleam like fluorescene signs
As I start across the sky
I can smell freedom
Prepare to cross the line
Ridin' hard on my rock 'n' roll machine
Well, I'm dressed up the 90's
And I'll always come clean
A body of perfection
Made of the richest kind
I'm seeking out a hero
...
