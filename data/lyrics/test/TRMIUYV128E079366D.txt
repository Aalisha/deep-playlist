(Chris feat. Bono on All Star Tribute)

Bono: Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying 

Chris: Brother, brother, brother 
There's too many of you dying 
You know you've got to find a way 
To bring some lovin' here to stay 

Bono: Father, father 
We don't need to escalate 
And war is not the answer 
...
