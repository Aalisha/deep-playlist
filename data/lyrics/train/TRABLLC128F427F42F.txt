Rip the womb
Feeling so sorry
Selfish and sore
Piece by piece I can carry it all
Strength to be driven
So unforgiving anything is possible
Like leaving you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small

Step by step I'm pushing through this
All of you get away from me
Eye for an eye I'm pushing through this
My law
Step by step I'm pushing through this
All of you get away from me
Tooth for a tooth I'm pushing through this
Through you

Salt the wound
Cut through a conscience I've failed to explore
The calm before the storm
Speak your peace and prepare for the fall
Words have been chosen
Tainting the gift
Lying truth's so incredible
So fuck you all
I'm turning my back on this killing so small

Step by step I'm pushing through this
