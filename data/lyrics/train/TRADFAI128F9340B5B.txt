[Mastamind]
I feel like to a foreign land,
Feel like taking it somewhere (somewhere).
Some type of foreign land, got to get away E
You know what I'm saying, what I know

Life's hard what am I supposed to do in this cold life
Only thing I really know how to do is hold mics
On cold nights we the hottest
On the blocks or the projects
Bless the mic for Natas
Now the heat is on we got the streets warm
We'll only stop setting shit on fire when the beat is gone
Keep it strong money keep it long
With each song history is born we da wrong
Cats to collapse so what the beef is on
Never cry about the pain if the game treat us wrong
Wicket world wide over seas it's on
We clock gees while they clock zees
Who you sleeping on huh?
