I'm no scholar and I'm no philosopher
But I've lived and I've learned a thing or two
It don't help to worry, there's no need to hurry
And it don't take a lot to pull you through

Like your favorite song, a call from home
Or the rain that falls across your windowpane
A season change, the smell of springtime in May

A precious child, a baby's smile
