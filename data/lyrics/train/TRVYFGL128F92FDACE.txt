You said goodbye so suddenly
There was no time to think things over
Seasons turned
You brought me winter

I can't conceive we're not together
We said I love you I meant forever
Whatever things you might've heard
I'm gonna keep my word

[CHORUS]
Waiting here for you
On the other side of love
I'll be where the broken heart
Starts to beat again
Waiting here for you
On the other side of dreams
I'll be where the broken heart
...
