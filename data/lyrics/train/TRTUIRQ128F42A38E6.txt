Do do do

Hey little girl, won't you meet me at the schoolyard gate
I got back stage passes to the biggest show in town
So honey don't you make me late

If we leave really early
And we hurry we can get in with the band
'Cause little Tim Smitty's got his old man's van
So let's get to gettin' while the gettin' is right
And roll with the rhythm tonight

God knows that I love my music
Ain't no one gonna change my tune
...
