Getting down, there's a party in motion
Everybody's on the scene
And I can hear the sound, like the roar of an ocean
As it rushes to the stream

Live it up, don't you hear people screaming?
Gotta do it all their way
Until they burn it up and the lights nowhere gleaming
What a price you have to pay

Why do we feel we have to feed the fire?
We're only caught up in our own desire, ooh

I've had enough, it's just too tough
To keep it up, so I'm calling out to you
To lift us up, the world is rough
I am so tired and I've had enough

Spinning 'round in perpetual motion
...
