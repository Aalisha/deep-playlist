Verse One

Two weeks before my old man busted up in her
My moms never walked slow
Now she smoke crack, sit back, and listen to talk shows
I hope she don't eat pork fried rice tonight
See, the cholesterol already got my arteries tight
I might select even before she injects her lethal chemicals
to wrap the umbilical cords around my neck
Shit, I'm pissin' in the abdomen
Two and a half weeks old, already thoughts of stabbin' men
Unravelin' plots and plans for thievin' and shit
Immune to the gospel, not believin' in shit
Where the fuck do I go from here?
Cuz when the afterbirth disperse it's hard to persevere
I swear I can't fuck with it
She hits about two packs of cigarettes a day and I'm stuck with it
The asthmatic, internally scarred from crack addicts
Who share needles outside in the rain on Kraftmatics
and laugh at it
I guess for them it seems funny but soon
I be the nigga who kills for petty money presume
Inside this Temple of Doom we throw the womb
I bloom to be emitted in June, considered a coon
Livin' my life incomplete though
