Hold tight
Now we're on our own
Cue lights
Now it's ready to roll
Tonight
How I've waited for
I've competed for years

It's fun
Oh I just can't wait
Hold on

You're on
I'll do anything
If it's the right thing to see

Does it matter
What is shown?
Just as long as everyone knows
What is selling
What to buy
The stock market for your hi-fi

Take the money
Leave the box
Everybody's on Top Of The Pops

There's one
Born every day
