Turn me loose from all this madness
'Cause the situation changes day to day
I've been searchin' the world to find the answer
I just got to find some time to slip away

I just got to get back on my feet
Find out about love

Where has love taken me?
Where will love lead me to?
So many questions, I gotta find out
Here it comes
