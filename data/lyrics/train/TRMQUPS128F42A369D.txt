I'm here to tell you that ahhhh I'm feeling like a butterfly
There's no denying that ahhhh I've always loved the high life

Never needed real emotions, I get my feelings from a magazine
I don't know where you got the notion
I'll be the one fullfilling all your needs

I'm here to tell you that ahhhh I'm feeling like a butterfly
There's no denying that ahhhh I've always loved the high life

Get physical tonight, the world's alive
Get physical in the light, this is our time
Get physical tonight, we're riding high
Get physical in the light, going out, feel allright,
It's a magical night, it's a magical night,
It's a magical night, it's a magical night
