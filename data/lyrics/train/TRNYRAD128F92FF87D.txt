Lord, I love to hear Hank Williams sing
And there's a lot of Lefty's now with different names
But it'll never be the way it was before
Take me back to yesterday once more

How I miss ole Tex, those days were good
And nobody else could sing like Jim Reeves could
Red Foley's Gospel songs touched my heart
Take me back to yesterday once more
