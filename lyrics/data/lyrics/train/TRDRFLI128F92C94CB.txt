Cause now it's judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause johnny's come back
To me
Aww when judy left with johnny at my party(my party)
And came back wearing his ring
I sat down and cried my eyes
Now that was a foolish thing
Cause now it's judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
...
