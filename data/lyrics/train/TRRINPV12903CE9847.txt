Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
...

Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
...

So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need

...
No more lives torn apart
...
That wars would never start

And time would heal all hearts
...
And everyone would have a friend
...

...
