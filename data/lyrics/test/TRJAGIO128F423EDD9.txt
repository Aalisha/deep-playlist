Sway your head
Move your feet
Wake yourself from the sleep
If there's a day, there's a way
You can get yourself there
Golden smile, you got style
That they can't take away

Scream and shout, get it out
Before it swallows you
No surprise in these times
How it really gets through
All the walks and the thoughts
But can you break through?

You're alive
So alive
Now c'mon

You gotta pull yourself back together
Give it one more shot
It's now or never
With the new day falling for you
You gotta believe
