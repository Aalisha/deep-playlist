A just the sweet, sweet sensi, yuh know
Yeh, I, yeh, I
Nah, nah, nah, nah, now

Finally the herbs come around
The high grade when me a look for me
Get it by the pound, yeah
Sweet sensi a come around
Me a take a little draw and pass it go round, so

Finally the herbs come around
The high grade where man a look for me
Stock it by the pound, yeah
When Babylon a come around
Ask them where them ago search for

Ever since the herbs slow down, police and rude boy
Dem inna showdown, them a search round the compound
Yuh kno, I'ma man a no weed clown
Find a little piece of land and I plant me home grown, so

Tell the youth them nah fit take pill
Too much crack and cocaine
A make the world a feel ill, yuh kno
Nuff ganja, nuff spliff a build
Only thing whe a make man feels chill, whe
(What?)
Me say

Finally the herbs come around
...
