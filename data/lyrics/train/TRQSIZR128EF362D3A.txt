Trapped in the cockpit at forty thousand feet
The sky is the limit, but we superscede
The greed for the speed is like way beyond limits
I grab my parachute with like forks and spoons in it
And I'm falling, I'm falling, my heart rapid rushes
Death before my eyes, oh why did I trust this?
My reactions are repeated over and over and over
Oh it seems like I will never be sober.

The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe

I look in every hip-hop magazine it seems
That the blunts are being passed around the scenes in teams
And the ganja man with contraband in lesser amounts
I guess cause understands he has his chance passes like Fouts
But his pass is incomplete cause I can tell in the smell
To let the dutchy pass me by, let the left catch hell
If I wanted to smoke tobacco I'd get a skinny white bitch
I know that Fatlip carries a pack to cure the nicotine itch
Because the only itch I have is for the indo or sens
So don't pass me that mess or try to even protest
That it's adding to the flavor cause the old one was fine
Won't you pack the pipe and keep it moving down the line

The pipe, the pipe
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe
...
