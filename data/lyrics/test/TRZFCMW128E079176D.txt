High above the midway lights,
High above the rides,
You, me and the sky,
The whole world looks small tonight,
And you said we could never really fly.

Well if you're right and we're nothing at all,
Tell me, why did I keep thinkin' 'bout your calling,
If you're right and we're nothing at all,
Tell me, why do you keep thinkin' that your falling.
