You throw a look, I catch a stare
You're checkin' me up and down
Temptation's in the air

Is it against the law to wanna taste?
A sexy boy, the heat is on
We're really steamin' up this place

I'm hypnotized by what could be, boy
Crawl and

Creep up to me, take a deep drag of me
'Til you're high, I'll make you feel so good inside
Lower, deeper, damn, it's getting hot
Harder, sweeter, don't you ever stop

Yeah, you creep up to me like a shadow over me
Cast your spell, it feels so good inside
...
