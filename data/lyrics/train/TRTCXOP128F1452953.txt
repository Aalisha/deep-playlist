Ride shotgun
Come on

Oh
I don't even think I can take no more
I know we need a place to go
Time to paint the spot
We ain't hit the floor
You know our money's
Running real low

So we gotta do what we gotta do
You know we gotta get that buzz
Understand why
I don't expect you too
Nobody does it like we do

Leave the City of
Angels behind us
You and me now
Feeling free

I'll let you ride shotgun
Out of L.A. to Vegas
It's gonna be a hot one
Time to escape and say that you wanna
Go far away
Don't want another hold up today
You know you're riding shotgun
All of the way to Vegas
We're gonna slot one
No other way to say this
We're gonna stack up the chips
We're gonna be the names on your lips
