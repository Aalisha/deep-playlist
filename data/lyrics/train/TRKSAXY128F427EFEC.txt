Love is the one thing to rely on
And as long as we all have today, we'll be okay.

Six o'clock, so you feed the kids
And you pack them off to school
Take a drive through your secret life
It's a mystery to you.
It's not the way you thought that it would be...

But love is the stuff that we depend on
...
