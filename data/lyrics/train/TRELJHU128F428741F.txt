Talk about love

I've been around this great big world, yeah
Had my share of shady deals and girls, hey
Now, I've been thinking of the coming attraction
The wink of an eye and the gleam of satisfaction

Talk about love
Talk about love

Baby knows wherever she goes

Howze baby, I got the potion
You're a cool operator got the machine in motion
Now, we're all alone
doing all the talking
She's got me on my back
