bitch
shit can happen
shit can happen
shit can happen
shit can happen
shit can happen
shit can happen
shit can happen

shit can happen
Yo, that's right motherfuckers we back
Same slanging
Orangutaning
Wilding out on hoodrats that say I act
Like I'm too famous
To say hi and tell 'em what My Name Is
But really I'm still nameless
You niggas don't get it yet do you?
Kill or not
Platinum or flop
I'll still put it through you
With a luger that'll spit fire
And hit higher
Than a pitch by a bitch like Mariah
You think for one second since we got a deal
That we won't deal with you in front of St. Andrew's still
You gay rappers better learn that
I won't stop until I see 'em turn back
If you don't slow that road you pack
You gon' see these Runyan Ave. niggas
That really need some Prozac
To show that ask the others
Brigade'll lay you down

Next to your mother's mother's grandmothers

You know I'm feeling real rowdy tonight
Ready to fight
And half the niggas I give DAT to
I don't even like
The same cat who never gave a damn about your name
I gives a fuck about it
Like the next L.A. Clippers game
I'll kill you in ways you couldn't even fathom
You ain't a madam
It's really unexplainable how I have 'em
Who call theyselves screaming about a challenge
Nigga we got a gift while you barely making it off of mere talent
My skills are deeply imbedded
Even your hoe said it
She was knock-kneed
I fucked her now she bow-legged
In the middle of rapping I drop the mic
