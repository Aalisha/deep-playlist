I'm gonna love you tonight
You turn me on so relaxed
Tell me are you ready for a stommy
Crazy love

Come on closer baby
Don't be afraid, we're alone
I'm gonna keep you warm
All night long
It's gotta happen baby,
Ill make things start
It's natural boy
I gotta lay you down I know
I need to feel the fever
So come on in and lock the door
Cause I'm the girl
Who's gonna love you so right
I'm gonna make you sweat
