We say it's okay to leave it alone
But i want u to notice
This case isn't closed
Doors are open
The lights are left on
And there's never a night I sleep
With the dreams that I'd have if u never decided
Decided to leave
Decided
Decided to leave...
There's never an ounce that I breathe
Without thinking about
Who i could have been with you
There's never an ounce that I breathe
Without thinking about
Who I could have been if you didn't leave


The phone's been patient to hear your call
But you never touched the dial
You never touched the dial, now I know
There's someone I wish walked through these halls
But you'll never take the chance to come home
So come home
