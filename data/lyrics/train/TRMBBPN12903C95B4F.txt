Written by ricky & marty wilde

Cruising 'round there's a sound with a place to go
Tuning in tuning on like a radio
Fell the sound in your head and you set the seal
I believe it's a force of the life you feel - tuning on

Do you know what the sounds that you hear will find
Reach to space to the stars and another time
I believe that they search like a seed to grow
