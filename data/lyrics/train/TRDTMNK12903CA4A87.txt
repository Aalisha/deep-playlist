Mi go so na na na na na na yes!
Huh! Na na na na na na yes!
Don't you worry honey, about a thing, take it.
Easy believe me and never give in.
Don't you worry honey, about a thing, take it.
Easy believe me and never give in.
Life is not hard as it seems,
Take it one day at a time and fulfil your dreams.
Remember no one is an island, no one stands alone.
You must always remember your fear.
An' when things get hard and lean,
Hold on to your faith and fulfil your being.
And don't you worry honey, about a thing, take it.
