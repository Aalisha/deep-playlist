Mama always said love is like heaven
Holdin' hands in church and prayin' together
Late night talks and morning walks
But I don't remember all that innocent stuff
What I can't forget is the feel of your touch

I guess I ain't no angel, but you gave me a reason to sing
To have you back in my life again, I would trade all silver rings
So forgive me for the cold hard truth
The only thing about heaven I miss is you
