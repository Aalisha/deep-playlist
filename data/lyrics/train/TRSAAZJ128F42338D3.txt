We do our best
We stay in step
as time goes marching by
but there's something wrong
We don't start living
until we almost die

Yeah Yeah Yeah
The Universe Listens

I was born silver thorn
on a Midwest Rose
Found out fast Love is last
and it comes and goes

Made a deal
hearts to steal
They will know my name
I will pay the price
any price
just give me the fame
...
