See her come down, through the clouds
I feel like a fool
I aint got nothing left to give
Nothing to lose

So come on Love, Draw Your Swords
Shoot me to the ground
You are mine, I am yours
Lets not fuck around

Cause you are, the only one
Cause you are, the only one

I see them snakes come through the ground
...
