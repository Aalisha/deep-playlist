City High, City High, '99, '99

If you my dog, let me hear you bark
It ain't my fault that the thought that hit your heart
Split you apart, you should've kept your guard
Trying to play it hard last night pulled up in a black Lex in a yard

Talk a lotta Ra Ra, ya gonna murder me
You got the wrong conspiracy, this ain't Kennedy
Jealousy get ya no where wit Lady C
You want a wish you better I dream of genie

Yo, all I left her was a broken heart
And a bunch of lies that I told her
And I bounced before the sheets, were warm
See, I'm the type to love them
And leave them for no reason, I'll be out the door
I don't catch feelings 'cuz my heart is cold

See, I'm that brother that your mother tried to warn you 'bout
But you just had to try it, now you crying on yo mamas couch
You put your heart in the fire, baby, it burned up
So, here's a little story 'bout a lesson you should learn from

It ain't my fault that I'm a dog, I've been in love before
But me, I picked the apple that was rotten to the core
I put the world at her feet she kicked it in the dirt
Now, I won't fall in love 'cuz I'll end up gettin' hurt

It ain't my fault that I'm a dog, I've been in love before
But, the trust I had in women as been thoroughly destroyed
