My darling I would not die
I would kill for you
and let me choose the man who is the sacrifice

shout and groan and cry and bite make me forget my pain
scratch my back and pull my hair make me forget my name
I am the grassman
put me where you choose
I am the grassman
I will burn for you

come the storms that try to doubt us
we won't feel the rage
unless the world is worthless now
...
