How do I know this is love?
Can someone guarantee it's real?
Could this end up like before?
A wave goodbye and out the door
I still believe the words you say
Take the risk my heart could pay
It's you I need, you are the cure
There's no mistake this time I'm sure

'Cause if you say I can
Then I know I will
