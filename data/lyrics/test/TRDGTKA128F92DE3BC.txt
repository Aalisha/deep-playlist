Formed, in ancient Rome, violent, age of steel
Man's, brutality, found new depths of pleasure
Slaves, captured in raging battles, forced, to fight, till the death

Roman, way of life, savour, a human sacrifice
Prisoners, could die by the sword, or live their lives in shame
Treacherous, murderous, thieves, helpless feast for the lions
