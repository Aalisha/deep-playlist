Let's leave this sinking ship
It's gonna leak until there's nothing left
Now the whole world can have the rest

What's the secret?
How'd you make planet Earth fucking hate you?
It makes no difference
To us about your money or your fucking daddy
You've been abandoned
By the same fat pigs who used to be your yes-men
The facade rusts
...
