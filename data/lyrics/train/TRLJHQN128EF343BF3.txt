She's a special girl, you know,
The kind I'd hope to see,
Hanging on a wall,
Watching me cross the street

I wonder how long it will be,
Before I'm sick of her,
And I no longer care
Where she goes or has been,

'Cause she's the new thing
'Cause she's the new thing
She is the new thing
'Cause she's the new thing

She is the new thing,
She is the new thing,
Another new thing,
Feel my stomach sink,
...
