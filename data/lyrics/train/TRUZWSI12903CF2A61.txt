Enter the gates of pure abominations
of abyssic chambers with infinite dimensions
frozen winds distant shine of stars
distorted reflections
of the slaughtered and damned
following circles of malignant essence
fallen angels feasting thru seas of black blood
awaiting for the summoning of infamous command
as the blackest sun solstice breeds
blinding shine of cataclysms
massive merciless genocide
...
