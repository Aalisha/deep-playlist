Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart
With all your soul, with all your mind,
and with all your strength
Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart
With all your soul, with all your mind,
and with all your strength

With all your heart, with all your soul
With all your mind, with all your strength
Love the Lord, your God, with all your heart
With all your soul, with all your mind,
and with all your strength
