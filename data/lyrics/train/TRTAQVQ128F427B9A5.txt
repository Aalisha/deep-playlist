Hello lonely
How you doin' today?
Hello sweet thing
Why don't you walk this way?

Hello, you again
How could you go and be so cold?
She said, "Goodbye, sad man"
'Cause all this pain is getting old

So why're you sad?
Don't you know that
It's you that holds my dreams
And seems to always come back?

How do I live without you?
How could you walk away from this
Just walk away from this again?

How do I live without you?
How could you walk away from this
Just walk away from this?
