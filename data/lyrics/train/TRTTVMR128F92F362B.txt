Oooh oooh ooOh Oooh Oooh
Aye aye aye aye aye aye
Oooh oooh ooOh aye aye aye aye

We had known each other for quite a long time
What else could be more important girl
than to make you mine
We surely gonna know, incline our open minds
The more we live on,
we become so loving and kind, whoa
Your love makes me so strong, whoa
I'll be with you all life long, girl
Oh your love is so real, oh oh
Let me fill you with these vibes I feel

CHORUS
Just like visions bright and clear
I can see that we gettin there, whoa oh
Just like heaven and earth I say
I'll be there for you all the way, Oooh
