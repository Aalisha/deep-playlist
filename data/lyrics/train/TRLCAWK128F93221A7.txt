Everybody gather round
And listen to my dream, you're bound
To thank me when I'm done
So here is one
I was there and you were too
But it wasn't exactly you
And it wasn't really even me
Don't you see

I don't expect
For you to understand completely
Even I
Don't ask why
Cause it can't be summed up neatly

Word of mouth began to fly
...
