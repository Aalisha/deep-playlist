I will stay by you
Even when we fall
I will be the rock, that holds you up
and lifts you high so you stand tall

I won't let you go
No one can take your place
a couple fights & lonely nights
Don't make it right to let it go to waste

I won't let you fall
I won't let you go
No matter where you are
No matter where you are, I'll be there
No matter where you are
No matter where you are, I'll be there

I will hold on to
...
