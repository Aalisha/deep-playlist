I am your clock
I am your religion
I am your shotgun mechanical bride
nothing is done without my approval

I own you
I decide how long you sleep
And how much rest
You are ever allowed

I decide what you desire
I deny you time to think
I am the mirror of constant humiliation
That follows and shadows you
Wherever you go
And blocks out the light
At the end of every tunnel yo try
Be on time
Be on schedule
Always feel
Like you're always late
And need more scolding and punishment

Do not daydream
Do not dilly-dally
Do not fall behind
Wings are flapping right behind you
You know what's coming next
As I swoop down like a hungry owl
And sink my talons into your back
And drag you back to square one again
The pain gets a little worse every time
Crash
Crumple
Do not pass go
Do not collect
Your dignity and your self respect

Give up
It's over
Now time allowed
To try something you like

The bills were all due yesterday
You've failed
You're through
First we form our habits, then they form us

We dress up as someone else every day
Gingerbread houses
