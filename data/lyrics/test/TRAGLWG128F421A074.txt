i took a walk through your world today
nice place to visit but i wouldn't want to stay
i want to see how other people live
remote control and not a thought to give
we're going to get up
we're going to get even
we'll start to worry when the cynics start believing

after visiting
i'm sure i'll feel fine
i'll be placated by the things in my mind
locked on the inside while i'm out here running free
i might be crazy but at least it's really me
...
