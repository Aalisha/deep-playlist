Every time I watch TV
On the news is something major
I'm a prisoner, set me free
Turn this atoll into vapor
Genocide put on the side
It's always new
Politicians want to share their
Point of view

United nations are demanding
Foreign troops have made a landing
City dealers at an auction
Shares are falling fast
Suicide is not an option
Waiting for the crash

CHORUS
I walk this wild road
...
