Stop searching the sky for answers
Black girlfriends avenge, black girlfriends
My greatest gift is the lie we are given

This is the price you pay
For throwing your whole life away
Why can you know yourself
When your worlds were just one lie?

Still I rise from the ashes, from the ashes
Look inside, search for meaning
Truth cannot survive, truth cannot survive
