My car broke down on our first date;
We missed the movie an' we never ate;
It was freezin' cold an' the heater broke.
I apologized: you kissed me goodnight,
An said: "It couldn't have been any better."
Girl, if you like that, you're gonna love forever.

If you like that ring you saw in the window,
In the jewellery store down town.
If you like tuxedos an' white satin dresses,
Maybe you better sit down.
