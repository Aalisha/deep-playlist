What have you got
That you can leave behind?
If it fits in a box
Was it a waste of time?

What have you learnt?
Did you stop to write it down?
Do you deserve?
How cold you feel right now?

You never needed anyone
But you need someone today
You never needed anyone
But you need someone today

When it all breaks down
When it all breaks up
And it's too late now
Too late for Hallelujah
