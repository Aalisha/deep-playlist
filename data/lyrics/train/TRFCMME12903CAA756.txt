You know I've (you know i've)
Got a little problem
I have to be the one
The second guy to none

And I've got
A pretty little girlfriend
Who tells me all the time
That she'll be forever mine

And she says

That your baby loves you
Yes your baby loves you
When you're baby loves you
Nothing's gonna hurt you

Sometimes
I lie with my eyes open
There's so much on my mind
My teeth begin to grind

And she'll console me
Repeating through my senses
Everything's ok
And I hear her say

When she says

That your baby loves you
