You're the one
You're the one
That made me cry
Oh you're the one
That laughed at me
Then said goodbye
You're the one
You're the one
That made me blue
So how's it feel
Now that you're the one
Its happened to

Now you're back calling me with open arms
What happened to the one you met with all that charm
You say he's gone
And you're alone
Well that's a shame
But if you think real hard
I know you'll see
Just who's to blame

Now you're the one
