Touch me, you know just how to touch me
Kiss me, you know just where to kiss me

You know how to make me, make me feel so good
You know how to make me, make me feel so good

Hold me, I feel secured when you're holding me
Talk to me, I understand when you talk to me

'Cause you know how to make me, make me feel so good
You know how to make me, make me feel so good
