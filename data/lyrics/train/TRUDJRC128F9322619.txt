I love you so much, but you're leaving today
Somehow we've lost touch -- I can't make you stay
You say I'll get by, but it's my head on the block
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

What did I do wrong, tell me what was my crime
I've loved you so long, now my neck's on the line
You pass judgement on me while I stand in the dock
It's easy to talk -- so easy to talk.

When we were living in the city of a million dreams
You were telling me that love is never what it seems
Yeah, you walked into my life and now I must surrender.
