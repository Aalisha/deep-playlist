Once there was a boy who left the bed he slept in
And he ran away 'cause he felt life was cruel
A killer of fools was walking close behind him
The boy was afraid that he was a fool

Oh the fool killer is a giant, they say
He chops down the fool and he goes on his way
That runaway boy was a runaway boy
Very much like you
