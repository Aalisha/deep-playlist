I: motherless children
Have you woke up screaming in the silence of the night?
you wish you could start dreaming in clouds of white
but everything could change tonight
when you duel with the devil living in your mind
Time reveals nothing - it's a suicide love affair
whispers in the darkness and revolution in the air
will you see or look behind
when you duel with the devil living in your mind
Motherless children
wandering nowhere
feels like there's miles to go
reaching for water
longing to go there
flooding into your soul
into your soul
Do you know the difference between who and what you are
will you ride off in the distance like some highway star
will you try until you make it good
or will you sell your body down in hollywood
Motherless children
wandering nowhere
feels like there's miles to go
reaching for water
longing to go there
flooding into your soul
into your soul...

ii: walk away
There's a time to understand
there's a time to see the sun
there's a time for makin up
...
