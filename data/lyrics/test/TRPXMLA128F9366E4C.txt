Everyone I thought I count on, has let me die.
Everyone I thought I could lean on, Has made me cry.
Everytime I close my eyes there's nothing there.
Feeling empty is all I have left, There's nothing else to bare.

And I realize, that I've lost my mind.
And I realize, that I am the lie.
It's over, my time to shine.
I'm already dead, so why can't I die.
