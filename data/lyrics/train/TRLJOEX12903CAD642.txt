My mom'd give me twenty and say stay out till dawn
When her boyfriend was over and they wanted me gone
I would walk through the woods to the old graveyard
And roll my own tops and think two kind of a thoughts

Are we high enough to clear these trees?
I don't know

That was the summer dave's girlfriend OD'ed
She died in the bathroom at a party down the street
I went to see him the next night, he had a new tattoo
He was watching home movies of her
His face was wet, he looked so confused

They had a funeral for her
The preacher said she was with the Lord
There were lots of pictures of her
Taped to a poster board
