Fly away my little bird,
spread your wings and fly away
fly away my pretty bird, on a cold winters day
fly away my little bird,
sing this song with tears in my eyes
fly away my pretty bird,
while a blue sky turns grey

Fly away my little bird,
to the green fields of your home
fly away my pretty bird,
to the isle where the sea wind blows
fly away my little bird,
keep our memories in your heart
fly away my pretty bird and bring me back a rose

Give a fool a kiss and he will follow you
he will follow you to the shores of your land
