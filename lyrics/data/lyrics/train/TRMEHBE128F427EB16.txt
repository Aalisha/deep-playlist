Heaven fell from the sky tonight
There were virgins in my backyard
Chasing angels with fire sticks

Heaven fell on herself tonight
And Moses lay in pieces from some
17 year old bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, yeah

Here we go, someone's knocking at my window
Here we go, I didn't ask for this shit
Here we go, someone's knocking at my window
Here we go, I didn't ask for it, ask for it, ask for it

Heaven fell from the sky tonight
And the whole damn world invited themselves
To my Sunday barbecue, yeah

Heaven fell and it's not all right
And God won't dare show his face
