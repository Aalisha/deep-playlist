Ever since I saw you walking down with your men
Paying no attention, barely graving your hand
Obvious to see that he don't give a damn
He don't love you

See you later on, all alone at the bar
I don't know your name, but I know who you are
Love to make you feel like a superstar
Know you want to

'Cause baby I'll drive you crazy
Giving you what you need every time you please
I said baby, don't need to worry
Just come with me tonight

I wanna go deep, deep, deep undercover
Wanna, wanna, be your down low lover
When you're in between my sheets
You'll be losing sleep rolling undercover with me

I wanna go deep, deep, deep undercover
Got to be discreet when it comes to each other
So if he sees me in the streets, he wont know it's me
Keep it undercover with me
