Ev'rybody understands the blues
Are you listening?
YEAH! [audience replies]

I say ev'rybody understands the blues
Ev'rybody from one day to another has the blues

You take the little baby that's layin' in the cradle
He can't get that milk bottle fast enough
He go to kickin' an'cryin'
An' goin' on, tearin' up the little baby bed
He got the blues
Can ya dig it?
YEAH! [audience replies]
Ha, ha, ha

You take this girl that's got this main squeeze
That's her boyfriend, that is, you know

An' he just bought a brand new GTO
You know she wanna be wit' him ev'rytime he cranks it up
An' go around the corner to the soda fountain
This is where she wanna go an'show it off
Where all the girls and guys be
You know what I mean?

An' she get ready to go out this particular night
An' her mother say, "Daughter you was just out last night
You can't go out tonight, that's too many nights in a row"
