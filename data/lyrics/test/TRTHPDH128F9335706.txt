Well good morning Judge, how are you today
I'm in trouble, please put me away
A pretty thing took a shine to me
I couldn't stop her so I let it be
I couldn't stop her so I let it be
I couldn't stop her so I let it be
I couldn't stop her so I let it be

He didn't do it, he wasn't there
He didn't want it, he wouldn't dare
Well good morning Judge, yes I'm back again
