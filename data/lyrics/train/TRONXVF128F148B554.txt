Midnight at the oasis
Send your camel to bed
Shadows painting our faces
Traces of romance in our heads
Heaven`s holding a half moon
Shining just for us
Let`s slip off to
A sand dune, real soon
And kick up a little dust

Come on, cactus is our friend
He`ll point out the way
Come on, til the evening ends
Til the evening ends
...
