They say that all is fair in love and war
And child believe it
When mama stayed in Saint Tropez
She had a fall or two

And I'm telling it to you straight
So you don't have to hear it in another way
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy
Oh Annie, I'm not your daddy

They say that out of sight is out of mind
And child believe it
