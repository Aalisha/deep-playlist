Lock the doors...!

Intro/Chorus: Cee-Lo

It's a shame, when niggas gon' realise we're the same
Helpin the enemy win the game
If you a player, use precision, don't make a decision in haste
Blood is a terrible thing to waste

(Big Gipp)

In my flip-flops and socks, I walk blocks confused
cos my nose ain't right, my sight blind
Smoke, need somethin from my toke
More than half my folk vying for the juice of cooked goose
In the city of disgust, nuttin new blew in
but almost left your bed, yet I said...
My mind back home, I roam the path in the trees
I give my ankles in the mud for my blood, what happened was
something for the ill-minded, even though you're true
your feet can't fit in my shoes, I got red in my eyes
My old man still don't understand why
The things I do, the way I think
A hot spell and death feel, got the chokers for the low-low's
Specialisin in the greenery
Code name: Cardwell, so what's real?
I still float the sidewalks of Abbotsville
Consume smoke with my folks on the low-lean
Blew Dixie Hill to get a little more pote'
And if ya can't find none of the Goodie in the veins
of the ATL, try the wood or the trail

(Cee-Lo)

I try to make sense outta nonsense each and every day
I got to cos things is kinda crazy round the way
Each word that I say may cut you like a knife
and totally influence and change somebody life
Who me? I'm 19, and best to have seen
what I already seen
Life taught me a lot
That you ain't gotta carry no gun to get shot
Ain't gotta be no jacker for offense from the high
A liquor store on every corner that you walk by
I watch my niggas die for no reasons
In my neighbourhood ain't nothin changed but the seasons
Them crackers don't give a fuck, then again why should they
...
