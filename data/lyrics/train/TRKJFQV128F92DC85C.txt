I go mental every time you leave for work
You never seem to know when to stop
I never know when you'll return
I'm in love with a robot

In the night, call you up and
Wanna know when you're coming home
don't deny me, call me back
I'm so alone

In the night, wait up for you
Even though you don't want me to
Go to bed, leave the lights on
what's the use
