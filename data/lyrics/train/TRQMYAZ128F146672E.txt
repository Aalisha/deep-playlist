Ooh, hey, baby, baby, yeah
Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
And I promise you, girl, I promise you
To love you as if your heart were my own
And we're not alone, no, not anymore

I can't believe that I found you
I can't believe that you're here
After all that we've been through
To have you so near and to hold you so close

I can't believe I still need you
And that you feel the same
After all that we've been through
I know it's a shame, just to throw it away

Take me, you're the only one that I wanna know
 (You're the only one and I promise you, I promise to)
Love you as if your heart were my own
And we're not alone, no, not anymore

To remember and cherish the things
(To remember)
