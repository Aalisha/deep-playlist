(words & music: D. Snider)

Ow, alright
Hey girl, across the room
Say I'm in love, babe, it's much too soon
But you know I'd give you everything that I have
Girl, do you know what you're doin' to me?
I'm gettin' burned in the first degree
I want your love, never needed somethin' so bad

BRIDGE:

Ooh, I need your love, oh, I want your love
All I got to have is your love
Ooh, can't get enough, oh, you're so damn tough
All I ever want, ever need is you
