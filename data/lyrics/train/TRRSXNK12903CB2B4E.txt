She came to me one morning
one lonely Sunday morning
her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind.
I know not how she found me, for in darkness I was walking

to fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or god.
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies
so eager was my passion to devour this waste of life.
