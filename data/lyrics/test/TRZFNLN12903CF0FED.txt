Erase superstition
Engraved in the mind
Seek out, locate
The DNA that hides
Mind-imprisoning to restrain life
Knowledge forgotten, believe the lie

Vivid as a raging tidal wave
Every last illusion washed away
Taking life for granted, lead astray
Saved by catastrophy

Coming again, signs will descend
Ride on the tide that marks the end
Time to unfold, life will move onwards
Breaking the waves

Complete exposition
