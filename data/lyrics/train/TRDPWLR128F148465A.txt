I'm sitting here on the phone
Blackberry to my head
Repeating all the words you just said
You said it's getting real
And you don't know how I feel

You're falling in love
And now you're getting scared
(You wanna know)
Do I feel the same
I'll be lying if I said yeah

Something we need to address
Before you hear me say yes
I've been down this road a time or two
So it's gotta be right for me and you

(So if I fall in love)
You gotta ride for me, like I'ma ride for you
(If I fall in love)
You gotta fight for me the way I fight for you

(If I fall in love)
Fall in love
You gotta hold it down even when I'm not around
(If I fall in love, in love, in love, in love)

It's been 3 months, 4 days, 5 seconds till the minute
