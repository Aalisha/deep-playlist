It's time to say goodbye for now
We'll have our second time around
But before we go
There's something I'd like to say

Every thing's not what it seems
There's a stronger force behind the scenes
He's in our lives every day
He's right there when we call

In Him is where our strength lies
I'll lift my eyes beyond the skies
Only He can save my life
And only He can hear my cry

I wanna thank You, God
For giving me one more chance
To raise my voice and to sing Your praise
I sing it out loud, I sing it all day

This song in my prayer
...
