dearest love,
I hope this message finds you well
as these endless thoughts drip from my soul
every single word secretly paints a fairytale
of when we will melt into one...

eyes (i am so scared) forfeit sight to the pain(so scared
cold scalpel's steel whispers tear at my very core
as I cling to memories of you
I am so scared... so scared... I need you with me

were the last words that I wrote for you enough to tell you
that in my death the light that shone through my painful darkness
was a blinding vision of your eternal smile?
