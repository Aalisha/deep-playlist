I am the last of a dying breed
the Spartans; built to fight and born to lead
we will destroy the covenant and make them bleed

Heading off to the halo rings
finding out that earth is the final key
destroying the flood for all eternity
killing brutes, jackals, grunts, and covenant elites
I am the master chief
