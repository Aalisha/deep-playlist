Escucha el ritmo de tu corazon
Feel the Rhythm

From the coast of Ipanema
To the Island of Capri
All the way to Kuala Lumpur
I will follow you wherever you may be

From the moment, I first saw you
Knew my heart could not be free
Had to hold you in my arms
There can never be another for me

All I need is the rhythm divine
Lost in the music
Your heart will be mine
All I need is to look in your eyes
Viva la musica
Say you'll be mine
