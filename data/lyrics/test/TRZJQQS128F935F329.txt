Oh my honey
Oh my honey
You better hurry and let's go down there
Ain't you goin'?
Ain't you goin'?
To that leaderman, ragged meter man

Oh honey
Oh honey
Let me take you to Alexander's
Grand stand brass band
Ain't you coming along?

Come on and hear
Come on and hear
Alexander's ragtime band
Come on and hear
Come on and hear
It's the best band in the land
