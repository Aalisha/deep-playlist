First you came and you sold us Christianity
But all your members just lust after vanity
Telling them to trust in you faithfully
Not seeing it's the return of the slavery
Taught us of heaven way up in the sky
Where we can't reach unless we die
But you can't fool me again
You can't fool me again and again
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, no you can't fool me
