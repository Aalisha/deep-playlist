Atmosphere... Atmosphere... Atmosphere

(Slug)
Atmosphere and maybe you don't like us
But of all the stars in the sky believe we're one of the brightest
My life is as trite as your favorite rap record
And I'm posessed with that insight that enables me to laugh better
From the last letter back to the A come around my way
Out of the wrapping paper with out the fucking holiday
Can't never be captured but they can toy with my shell
But only after they walk a mile backwards through b-boy hell
From hear on out the sun rises at noon thirty
And didn't quit pressing till the whole f-ing room heard me
Soon the birdy will fly with or with out the wings
