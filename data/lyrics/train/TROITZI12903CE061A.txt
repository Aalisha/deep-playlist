Ow ow and yeah i like the way you move.
Ow ow you saw me dancing to the Roots.
Ow ow we're clappin like a million hands.
123 hey here we go again.

Ow ow i am rappin yellow black and blue.
Ow ow yeah break it down like a racoon
Ow ow i am not a boy i am not a man.
123 hey here we go again. 123 hey here we go again.

Countdown to the House Of Love.
Countdown to the House Of Love.
Countdown to the House Of Love.
The House Of Love No.1.
