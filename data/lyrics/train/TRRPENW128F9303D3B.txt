Sour is the taste on my tongue
Heavy the sum of treasons
Enormous the price to pay
Profound the feel of despair
Days break under the same sun
Life streams and finds me still
Night fall not to surface again
What matters remains unseen

Far away from the drowning
Far away from the greed
Far away from the dreams of glory
I redefined me

My turn even when life bites hard
Grounded serene and deeper
...
