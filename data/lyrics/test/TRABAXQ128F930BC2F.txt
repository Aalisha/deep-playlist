Hell, I don't know why, but
Sometimes they stay, sometimes they go
I tried & I tried but like mercury
It just slipped through my fingers
Golden apples on a silver tray
You know what they say, well...

Sometimes they stay, sometimes they go
Sometimes they stay...

Like birds in the sky
Well, sometimes they stay 'n sometimes they go
...
