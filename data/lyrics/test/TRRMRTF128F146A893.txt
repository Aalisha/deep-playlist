Wait,
Before you leave I've got something to say
*sigh* so listen to me

I know you wanted to hate me
When you found out that I lied, yeah
I wanna spend eternity
But you say you've been decieved
Now you say you wanna leave
But I say...

Hell no, hell no - I won't let you leave me this time, no
(no, whoa)
Hell no, hell no - Don't act like you never lied to me
(don't act like you never lied to me)
Hell no, hell no - My actions are not justified
(are not justified)
Remember the many nights I cried
So hell no you can't leave me this time

Now under the circumstances
Do you remember what you did to me (to me)
...
