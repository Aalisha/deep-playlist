Wheel in the sky sent me here from the future
Keeps me under it's spell
Lying awake scan the things that surround me
Sleeping city awaits
Electric mind, silver circuits, Electrodes
Never know who I am
Father of children, the one stood beside you
Only time will tell

If all the secrets, they've been hoping to find
Unlock the programs buried deep in my mind
And am I human or just a robot slave
They sent me here so thier world I could save, yeah
