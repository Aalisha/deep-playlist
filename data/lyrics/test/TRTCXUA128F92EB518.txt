Watch you dancing underground
it's not to synchronizing sound
what'cha you gonna do when your money comes through
gonna look about, shop around
your best friend has moved away
wouldn't stay another day
what's he gonna do when his words run out
and there's nothing left to say
(chorus)
you're putting your smiling face
and you're dressing up with style and grace
...
