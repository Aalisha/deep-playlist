Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
You don't have to tell me you've gone to found someone new.
'Cause I can feel his presence, whenever I'm-a-kissing you.
How can you ask me to try, try and understand
Well, just put yourself in my place.
Go on, just see if you can.
I'm-a begging you. (Don't, don't you let him)
Baby, please. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
I'm begging you, baby. (Don't, don't you let him)
Oh no. (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)
So what if he whispers how much he loves you in your ear.
