Simian moths in searcg of
Metanoia and illuminance
Exuberant dismay will reap

Condemnation decomposes sanity
Through inhumanity and putrification
A plunge towards hopless dismal death

Another pawn has taken the fall
A mind unsound and rotted
Put him up against the wall
Along with the tortured, the raped
And the gutted
...
