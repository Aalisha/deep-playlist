I was the kid with the backpack full of revolution
Listing the crimes like genocide, slavery and
Mass polution
With footnotes and documentation
So I could argue with confidence at hockey rinks
And bars
Alone against the relentless machine in mercy
I put myself to sleep
Yeah I'm ashamed, I put myself to sleep

Wanna change the world WAKE UP
...
