Why don't you play the tune now?
I don't like music.
Come on you little geezer.
You'll look funny when you're fifty.

Somebody I never met
But in a way I know
Didn't think that you could get
So much from a picture show
Man dies first reel
People ask what's the deal?
This ain't how it's supposed to be
Don't like no aborigine

Took a trip in Powis Square
Pop star dyed his hair
No fans to scream and shout
When mobsters came to flush him out
Gangland slaying underground
New identity must be found
On the left bank for a while
Insanity Bohemian style

Ritual ideas relativity
Only buildings, no people prophecy
Time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
Foresight, minds wide, magic imagery

Met a dwarf that was no good
Dressed like little Red Riding Hood
Bad habit taking life
Calling card a six inch knife
Ran off really fast
Mumbled something 'bout the past
Best sex I've ever seen
As if each moment was the last
Drops of blood, colour slide
...
