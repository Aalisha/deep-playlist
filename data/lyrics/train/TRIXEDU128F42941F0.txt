Ooh it took me down I'm on the groung tryin' not the breathe 'cause I know I'll be found
Dray the lord 'till I'm sore it's pounding me until I'm driven in
I would be damned if I ever fell but could I tell
I would be damned if I do I'm damned if I don't this time I'll go for the kill
Monster monster I can't take this hell no more beast be gone something's gotta give
