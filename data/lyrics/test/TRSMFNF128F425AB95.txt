back in the day I used to misbehave
ride around town rockin lemon parade
livin it up seizin the day
runnin like the devil till I heard the choir say
come on, come home
my life is never gonna be the same

don't you know that love, love, love's gotta hold on me
don't you know that love, love, love's gotta hold on me
and now I live my life a little differently
since love found me
