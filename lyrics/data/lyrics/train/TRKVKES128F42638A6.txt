He sits all alone in his easy chair
Starin' back on all his lost yesterdays
Long before he encountered the bottle
And the demons that drove her away

In his hand he is holdin' her photograph
Her image all tear-stained and worn
Tonight he's embracin' reality
And he curses the day he was born

And the darkness still echoes her warning
You can't have two loves in your life
Now the things that will haunt him
...
