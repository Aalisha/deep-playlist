It'll catch your eye
Drawing you in to stop you cold
A little shine
Yea, but all that glitters isn't always gold.

Chorus:
Bowing at the feet of temptation, gazing in the windows of whim
You see the pleasure that has got you standing still
But there's more to that than meets the eye
Don't let it hold you there against your will
Better walk on by, yea, better walk on by.
