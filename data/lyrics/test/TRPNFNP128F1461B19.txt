He was drunk as Cooter Brown
Words fell from his tongue
With a slurring silver sound
He come this way from the other side of town

He was drunk as Cooter Brown
And his coat hung 'round his shoulders
With a gangster's tone
A stylish man no woman leaves alone

He blamed the warmth of the evening
I blamed the circle 'round the moon
We spoke as if in solitude

While the world was spinning around us
And people started to stare
But I just didn't care
I just couldn't move
I was was floating on air

I knew
We two
Were drunk as Cooter Brown
Soooo...
