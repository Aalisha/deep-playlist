Long way down a one way track
The cold run down the length of my back
You whipped my heart with a mighty crack
You gave me the closest thing to a heart attack

My body shivers, my body it shakes
You rock the house with the love that you make
I'm growin' weak with this intangible ache
But baby keep it comin' for goodness sake
