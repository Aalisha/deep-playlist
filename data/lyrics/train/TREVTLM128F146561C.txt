Ah, come on
Ooh, who me?
Come on, uh

I saw you outside
Getting out your ride
A CLK 430, you've got style
As soon as I checked you out
A ladies man no doubt
From head to toe you're all style I like it

How bout you buy me a rose 'cause I think
This is gonna get a little interesting
Let's see where this conversation goes
I'm not sure that I want you to know

I wish I could right now
Wish that I could show you how
I'm feeling you (I'm feelin' you)
Boy I try I can't hide (can't hide)
How badly I want you tonight
I've gotta fight it

If you take me home
Get me all alone
Nothing could happen it's just too soon
I'm just being upfront
