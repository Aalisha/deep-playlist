Before I jump ship, for cooler shores
may I gently close this account of ours
Though all that I know and have loved, is inside
I'm just losing faith in these costly times
And I pray for your health and your peace of mind
but God must know I just want you by my side
And the morning I've woken and sought your warmth
If only I'd held you and told you before

But I'm no fool, my heart is just exposed
...
