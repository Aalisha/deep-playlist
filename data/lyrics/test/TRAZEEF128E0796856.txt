The big wheel keeps on turnin'
On a simple line day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggles while another relaxes
There's a hole in my soul like a cavity
Seems like the world is out together just by gravity
The wheel keeps turning, the sky is rearranging
Look my son the weather is changing
I'd like to feel that you could be free
Look up at the blue skies beneath a new tree
Sometime again you'll turn green and the sea turns red
My son I said the power of axis over my head
The big wheel keeps on turning
On a simple line day by day
The earth spins on its axis
One man struggles while another relaxes
