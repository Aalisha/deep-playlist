Girl, if I didn't have a plan, could I be your man still?
And if you couldn't watch cable, would you able to understand?
And if I couldn't buy you diamond rings
Take you out and things or do nothing special
Would you deal, would you stick around and chill
Would you keep it real?

Tell me, would you be here if I had nothin'?
Would you be here if I was strugglin', if I had nothin'?
Would you be here at any cost?
Would you be here if I didn't have a boss, at any cost?
Would you be here to pay the rent?
Would you be here, no benefits?
Girl, if that was it, would you be here if I gave up?
Straight outta love, would you give a what?

Girl, if all hope was gone, we didn't have a phone
Would you stay at home with me?
And how long would you stay by my side
If I applied and weren't qualified, baby?
What if I was finished and you couldn't do nothin' else with it
Would you forget it?
Girl, do you swear to tell the whole truth, nothin' but the truth
I'm listenin', baby
