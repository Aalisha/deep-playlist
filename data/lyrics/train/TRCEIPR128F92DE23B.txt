Smile an ever lasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
'Cos that would bring a tear to me

This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love

You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

It's only words
And words are all I have
To take your heart away

Talk in ever lasting words
...
