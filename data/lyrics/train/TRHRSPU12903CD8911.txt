Today I lost my common sense
It slipped away on the corner of Pike and 10th
I guess it happened on purpose
'Cause lately it's been getting quite intense

Today I wandered round the bend
I took the trip with a friend shopping round for fence (?)
Had no particular purpose
Just picking up the pieces and pretend it all makes sense

You blow my mind
And I'll blow yours
I've seen the force of your pretty smile
Now baby do it one more time
