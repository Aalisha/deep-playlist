It's after the rain, it's just like Sunday
Candy dreams inside my mind
I never knew loving can be this way
A trip on a star, love keeps growing
Summer kiss, it's nice of knowing
You're here with me, so happy to be this way

I should have told you
Every word I say is true
I'm so in love, I'm so in love with you [So in love with you]

'Cause I'm falling [Falling] under your spell tonight
[Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh]
I'm falling [Falling] under your spell so right [Do, do, do, do, do, do]
Love's calling [Calling] under your spell tonight
[Ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh]
Yes, I'm falling [Falling] under your spell so right
