Mortal crosses standing in the row
Seem to reach up to the burning sky
Damned souls grouping on the dark
Going round the stretched arms
Bodies, faces
Unnaturally bended in pain
Lifeless eyes staring at the space
Persecution of the dying has begun
Here's the place of the alteration
Where life turns into other form
Dark ritual of demons procreation
Hear the cries - of the crucified ones
Throbing Flashes in the rhytm of thunder
Nailed hands greeting angry gods
Coming fourth to feast in blood
Bodies, faces
Unnaturally changend in lust
Purple fluid streams on the wood
Like tears of dying cross...
Here's the place of alteration
Where gods turn into temporal form,
Dark ritual of demons procreation
Come on! Leave your life and join the dead in hell
Masters of forgotten arts
Deign to look at your servant
...
