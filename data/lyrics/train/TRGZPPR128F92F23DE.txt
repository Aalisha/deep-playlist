(CHORUS)
A quest for new world order
A better time and place
Somewhere the paths are broader
An end to disgrace

A quest for new world order
Will rise for all to see
Once we have crossed the border
We'll be set free

Through the rubble of ages, all victims look the same
Resignation on their face, no one there to blame
...
