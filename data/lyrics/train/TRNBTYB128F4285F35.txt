Show you where show you whereâ€¦ show you where
Do what you want but think about the omen
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Straight from the underground let me kick this quick death and mystic
in other words let the spirits get to you job's better kinda like flue-due
experience the power to be hold strong enough to make space unfold
I'll go back with a single that I'm ready nightmares kinda like Freddie
pleased to pretend that I will jump the mind to make you dance and collect combine
it's time for the foe to go to work drop a bomb and you go for certain
trancing trancing buggle while you buggle while you're dancing
Do what you want but think about the omen 
a vision in your mind will lead your way
go where you want but don't forget the omen
the light at your side will show you where
Do what you want but think about the omen
