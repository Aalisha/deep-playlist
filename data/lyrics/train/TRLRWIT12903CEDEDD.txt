Tell her that Alberta says hello
Tell her I wish she'd come on home
Tell her that I think she'd like the show
Tell her that Alberta says hello

Tell her that the winters are still cold
Tell her I still got the old wood stove
Tell her that the Oilers are scorin' goals
Tell her that Alberta says hello
...
