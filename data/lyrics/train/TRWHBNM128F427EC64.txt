Looking for direction
Got nowhere to place my loyalties
I've stumbled and I've fallen
My life is breaking me down like some disease
I'm lost in the darkness
Can't find the light, I can't see anymore
I'm crying, I'm waiting
I'm asking is there something more?
Have mercy, have mercy
In the name of God have mercy
Please help me, please help me
