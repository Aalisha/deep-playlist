(Intro Scat: Hold up, oh no, who let them in the door,
It's like a freak show, shake it a like a photo)

Hate, is only what you say, not what you mean,
And Pain, is what's inside of me, not when you're bleeding
I, will fall, I'll fall, and take your breath away,
We, could change it all, and take your breath away

This anger changes me, it affects the way I see,
Affects every part of me, and makes you my enemy
But when it falls apart, it's like a brand new start,
And I can't remember why, I ripped everything apart
...
