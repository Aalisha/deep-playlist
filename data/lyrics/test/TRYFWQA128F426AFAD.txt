Short were the days of the wise man, went up the hill and never came back
A stubborn soul will fight anything, a restless soul won't just settle in
Left home in search for a paradise, found a place for parasites
Like leaches they sucked him dry
Numbed the pain, with bottles of whiskey
On that day, he went up that hill, couldn't go on by remaining still
Gave him some and took some more, made him their slave, became a whore
There was no other choice for it to end, just to look at the bullet with a grin
