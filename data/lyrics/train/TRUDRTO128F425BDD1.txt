Pedal down the foot hills
Wheelies on the front
P-p-pedal down the foot hills
Wheelies on the front

I got this 89-90, Pistons champ flat
Bill black starter cap with the hologram tags
White Mag rims, red rubber tires
Chain, frame, pegs, grips, ship to my supplier
Dope man attire, gimme bout an hour
And I'll have it clicking, ticking, gliding, flying like McGuyver
I'm a Murder Club, dope pedal rider
Nigel said I'm good to get that ink on my bicep
I gets, busy as a bee on my bike grips
If I catwalk this sidewalk, I can fly this
Bitch and I'm fly, and it's tied to the side
That's the flag that I'm flying
Add to the fact that it all coincides with these wheels that I'm riding
3pt Mags make you think that I'm gliding
Shiiiit nigga I ain't lying
I got a long rap sheet that'll say that I'm tied in

Pedal down the foot hills
Wheelies on the front
P-p-pedal down the foot hills
Wheelies on the front
I'm on the dyno with the black mags
Black mags,
