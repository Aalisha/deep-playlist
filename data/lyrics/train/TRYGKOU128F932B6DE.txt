Verse
So you did it, do it again
Who you kidding, ten out of ten
Yeah you did it, do it again,
In a minute, I'll tell you when
Little pictures in my mind, but I 
Got to make it on my own, if i
Try to fake it, it's a crime, cus I 
Have my conscious saying take me home 

Chorus
But, ooh baby I like it like that,
Touch me, touch me
Before I turn back,
Ooh baby I like it that way,
Touch me, touch me
A little this way,
Ooh baby I like it like that,
Touch me, touch me
Before I turn back,
Ooh baby I like it that way,
Touch me, touch me
