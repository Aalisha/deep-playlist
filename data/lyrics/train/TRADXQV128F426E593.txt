You must leave, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out the saints are comin' through
And it's all over now, baby blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sins
And take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
...
