It's my time like it or not gotta ride
Can't fight,
This thing'll take you with it like a landslide
My mind spitting rhymes refined as old wines
No games since age 5 I hold mine
Never fell for the spells
They tell in this world
I read Malcolm, you was learning to spell
I took exams early with the geeks in the school
Opened a business,
You were still chasing your balls
I spent my teens sticking but I'm one of Britain's best mathematicians
Official, I got the certificate
So however you want it kid
We could do scholarship politics
Or the opposite,
War with hollow tips No supathug, just I don't fear, why would I?
You bleed like me and breathe the same air
I got a purpose on this earth
And I ain't ready to go
So if I gotta send you first then let it be so

[Hook:]
Roll wid us or get rolled over [x3]
It's time now the wait is over
Roll wid us or get rolled over [x3]
It's time now the wait is over
