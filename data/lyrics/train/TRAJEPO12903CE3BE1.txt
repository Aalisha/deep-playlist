Heading westwards towards the sun
When the past starts to bleed into one
And the rest will disagree
How your innocence can sway easily

But oh, I can tell your words so well
And all I can see is that I, I'm sorry, sorry
I'm sorry, sorry

Heading westwards towards the sun
Where we're going everything comes undone
...
