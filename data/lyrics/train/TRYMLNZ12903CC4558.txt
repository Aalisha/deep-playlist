I made a wreck of my hand
I put it through the wall
I made a fist and not a plan
Call me a reckless wrecking ball

I throw my plates against the wall
And give it all I got
I aim to break not one but all
I'm just a big ol' wrecking ball

I am unruly in the stands
I am a rock on top of the sand
I am a fist amidst the hands
And I break it
Just because I can

It takes a dedicated hand
To put it through the wall
You gotta wanna break the heart
...
