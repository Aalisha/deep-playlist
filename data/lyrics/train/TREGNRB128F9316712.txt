Dutallee!
Dutallee!
Dutallee!
Dutallee!

And when soldiers came
Them say them come to make us tame
And from that day until now on
We were jeered and laughed to scorn

Things used to be ire (before the soldiers came)
Things used to be nice, so nice now
Things used to be ire
Things used to be nice, so nice

Our country them did enter, yeah
Troops trodding left right and centre
Everywhere
One moment at peace with Nature
