This is a dark one for you
You've made the worst of my best year
I'm talking record book good times
And then along came my worst fear

Oh, I hope you're ready for this
Heartbroken life approaches
Oh, I hope you're ready
For this

If it takes the rest of your life
You owe me one good year
Until then I'll be screaming revenge
Deep into your ear, my dear

I can't tell I'm alive
...
