Sittin here in this chair
Waitin on you
aaahhh baby to see things my way
But not a word do you say
You won't even look my way, yeah
Girl I'm spendin my dimes
Wastin my time
Talkin til I'm black and blue
Uh can't you see
I wanna get next to you

Dreams of you when I go sailing by
When ever your eyes meet mine
Your so fine
And girl you make me feel so insecure
