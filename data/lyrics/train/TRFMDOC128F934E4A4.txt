Get kicked out for coming home at dawn
Mum and dad cursed the day you were born
Throw your clothes into a duffel bag
Shouting and slam the door at home to drug
Who can I turn to, where can I stay
I've heard of places open all night and all day
There's a place you can go where the cops don't know
You can act real wild, they don't treat you like a child

Runaway boys

Your hair's all greasy and you feel like a slob
You're only 15 and you can't get a job
