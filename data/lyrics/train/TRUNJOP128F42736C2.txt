Ian

Lay down now and slumber
Mama's boy is torn asunder
All the fields have gone grey
All the leaves are gone brown

Let me tell you a story
Lay down, I know you're weary
While the stars in the sky
While the moon's on the rise

Lay down and don't you wake 'til mornin'
Close your eyes and helpless through the night
Lay down and dream of love and glory
This is a lover's lullaby
