(Go ahead London)

Bad laugh?, Bad language
Bad news, Bad

When I'm at home
My woman won't leave me alone
And that's bad
So bad

So I walked out of the door
And it seemed worse than before
And that's bad
So bad

And the thought occurred to me
How come that everything you see
Is so bad
So bad

But before I realised it
Hit by a truck and paralyzed
And that's bad
So bad

A golden opportunity
Claim my insurance polucy
Hmmmmm...
So bad

These are the things that drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)
These are the things that make me bad
(Go ahead London)
(Crazy)

Watch TV go grab a bite
See a horror movie get petrified

Gonna dye your hair use peroxide
Smoke a split get red eye

Hitler wanted to commit genocide
To the allied foes he notified
Went to Poland, the place he occupied
...
