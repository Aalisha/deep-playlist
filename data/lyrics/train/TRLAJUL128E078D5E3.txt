You say that i'm lost
You got the word that i'm going down
Yeah it may be true
It's like twenty-four tons of hard hitting headache
When you realize that you're coming unglued

I've sown and you've sown the seeds of youth
Time won't and i don't conceal the truth

So get up and fly away
Or forever be in doubt
You know - saviors never cry
...
