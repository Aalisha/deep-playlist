Two blocks from the edge
Two blocks from the start
Two blocks from a war
Two blocks from the heart

I'm a sucker, I'm a fake
Just a snack on a dinner plate
A dancing monkey, a slimy snake
Concealed my destiny
And ruled my faith

Here I am, rolling down the slope
Counting down, watching out for the final blow
And I don't know, and I don't see how it's killing me
Who's the winner, who is not, here I am
...
