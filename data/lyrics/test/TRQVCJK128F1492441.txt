WAAAhh What are these noises?
We're sending this one out to a beautiful, beautiful human being
Noise, noise, noise from down below
and It's coming from the basement
it's underneath the house now and
it's rockin' the foundation
it's a noise we love to make
and for years we have been making
while Doctor D, watches TV his house is fucking shaking
he lets us practice in his place IN HIS PLACE!
