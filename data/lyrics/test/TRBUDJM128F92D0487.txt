Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
If I were a painter, mixing my colors
How could I ever find the blue of your eyes?
The canvas could never

Capture the light of your smile, of your smile
And girl, if I were a sculptor, working in marble
I couldn't hope to copy your perfect face
The curve of your body, the feel of your skin
My hands could never ever trace

So I'll try and find the melody as beautiful as you(Baby)

Find the words to say your eyes are bluer than blue
Fill my voice with the emotion I'm feelin' for you(Oh, yea)
And now, when the beat is so strong
I'll give my heart in a song oh
Oh, girl
...
