Every face sing we had to happen, every face is you
Every smile that I force on someone sends me to the edge
Coffee breaks I take because I need more time to clear the fuzz
Take me back, 21st Street

Troubled times that I find myself in, double without you
Such a loss that I try to replace, sends me to the edge
Living breaks I take because I need more time to get a buzz
Take me back, 21st Street

I think I'm losing, losing my mind

Just anyone means nothing's done just yet
I need more time to heal
