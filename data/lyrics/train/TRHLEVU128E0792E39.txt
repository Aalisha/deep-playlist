Go on and close the curtains
Cause all we need is candlelight
You and me and a bottle of wine
Going to hold you tonight

Well we know I'm going away
And how I wish wish it weren't so
So take this wine and drink with me
Let's delay our misery

Save tonight
And fight the break of dawn
Come tomorrow
...
