If it's getting harder to face everyday
Don't Let It Show, Don't Let It Show
Though it's getting harder to take what they say
Just let it go
And if it hurts when they mention my name
Say you don't know me
And if it helps when they say I'm to blame
Say you don't own me

Even if it's taking the easy way out
Keep it inside of you
