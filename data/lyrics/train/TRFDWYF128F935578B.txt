Oh comely I will be with you when you lose your
breath chasing the only meaningful memory you
thought you had left with some pretty bright and
bubbly terrible scene that was doing her thing on
your chest but oh comely it isn't as pretty as
you'd like to guess
in your memory you're drunk on your awe to me
it doesn't mean anything at all
oh comely all of your friends are letting you blow
bristling and ugly bursting with fruits falling out
from the holes of some pretty bright and bubbly
friend you could need to say comforting things in
your ear but oh comely there isn't such one
friend that you could find here standing next to
me he's only my enemy I'll crush him with
everything I own
