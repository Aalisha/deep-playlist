Believe me
I'm not scared by anything
But being you could break me
Drain my heart and wrench my sprirt
What do I do
That's so enchanting you can't bear to leave me
I deserve hell
So take me do your worst and do it proper
The shell must break so

We could be kings
This planet is ours
We've love on our side
The keys to my car
We'll storm through the city
Let's drive
Hold tight
