They think they're fucking smart today
Actually they don't have a thing to say
Cause everyone stands around like they got no brain
To look the part they think it's smart

Well it's in to be a rude boy clone
If you don't want to sleep alone
Well who knows what the look will be next month
I guess just London, England knows

And they're all thoughtless parasites
Nineteen-eighty punk disco-ites
They were all dead when they were born

And they're all thoughtless parasites
