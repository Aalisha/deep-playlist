[Intro - Akrobatik - talking]
HAAAA ...
Back on the front steps, you know what I'm sayin?
City done took away the jobs from all the youngins
Cats got nothin to do and shit
Shit is whack man
The summer days be hot (yeah)
Shit
[Verse 1 - Akrobatik]
Yo, to my niggaz on the block, hangin out on the stoop
With your team you slang with and your little rap groups (uh)
Notorious throughout the low income neighborhoods
Accused as the reason why the hood'll always stay the hood
Organized to set up the trap, to set up the raps
But what if you organized your people dog, imagine that
You could be a young entrepreneur, never wantin for more
When po' come through, you not duckin to the corner store
They make us hate each other, by keepin us poor
But if you got your shit legit, tell 'em "fuck you!"
They shit outta luck too
Long as you pay your federal and state
They gotta keep their filthy hands off your general estate
Take it from a brother that been there, we in here
People livin in the hood, in prison, and in fear
Same thing they did to the Jews after the Holocaust (what?)
Stuff us in the ghettos and then we all are lost
And when we riot, they won't care about the dollars lost (uh)
