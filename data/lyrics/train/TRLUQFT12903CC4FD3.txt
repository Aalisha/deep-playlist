I'm afraid of got nothing
to show for the years
So many doubts
and a collection of fears
But my heart won't let go of the hope
that it's working for good

I've decided to change myself
so many times
All my efforts
like the antics of pitiful mimes
And the distance seems greater sometimes
for the places I've stood.

There's death
anchored deep in my soul
but still I hesitate to let you take control.
