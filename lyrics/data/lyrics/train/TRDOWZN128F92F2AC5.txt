Sometimes love ain? t enough
And there? s times just giving up is alright
No matter how much you want it to work
Someone? s gonna get hurt

Sometimes it ain? t about who? s wrong
And as bad as you wanna hold on
The right thing to do is to get out right now
Before it? s too late

And the hardest part of leaving is picking up the keys
And finding the nerve to start that car
The first night is the longest, you? re waking up alone
And you find out how strong you really are
