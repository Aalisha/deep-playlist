So you think you are safe, and nothing can hurt you
It's all an illusion, created from lies
Made yourself a safehouse, no one can get in
But you are the prisoner, in your imaginary world
You should take a look - at the concrete maze
Cause you'll die alone
You should take a look - at the concrete maze
Cause you'll die alone
Yes your loosing grip, though you never had control
And now you're walking away...
