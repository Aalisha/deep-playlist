Welcome to my little island
Though it's not much to look at I know
But it's somewhere to come
When things have slowed down
You can stretch out and let yourself go

Welcome to my little island
Just relax get away from it all
When the peolple and crowds
Get too noisy and loud
You can slip out and over the wall
Just give my little island a call
