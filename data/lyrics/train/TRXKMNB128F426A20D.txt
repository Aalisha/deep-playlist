Honey, I wish you were here
To brighten my lonely nights
How long I've waited
To hold you in my arms again

Honey, you know I'm so scared
Scared that you might not come back
One day without you
Is one day too long for me
Wish you could see
The love in the heart of me

Honey, I really miss you
Honey, I need to kiss you
Honey, I wanna hold you
Honey, have I told you
I really need you now
I really need you now
