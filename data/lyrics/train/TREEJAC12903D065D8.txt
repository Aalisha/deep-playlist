When love takes a back seat to life
When a man runs away from his wife
That's when you know he's in the world

When a guy tries to round up his mate
But she's gone and it's gettin' too late
That's when you know he's lost his girl

So it happens all the time
Don't get low, just stand in line
Now take your turn, and make your move
And crush that girl with a ton o' luv

When a woman takes a back seat to man
Gotta tell him where to go if she can
