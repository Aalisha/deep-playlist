Hey baby, I just might be
My own worse enemy
But if I'm gonna regret this night
I won't go down without a fight

I got a dream that you can't see
I got a soul you can't reach
And there's no time for another chance
This song died on our last dance

There's no time, so we're falling apart
I need you like a bullet to the heart
So long, so you say, hey, hey
So long, so you say, hey, hey

Hey baby, there's no reason
That will keep me from leaving
'Cause I'm tired of watching you
