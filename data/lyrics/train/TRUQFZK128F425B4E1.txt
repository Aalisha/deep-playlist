Patience, child it will find you
Your deepest dreams will guide you
the moment that you're born
all night my fear inside will come through
haunting right behind you
don't let it get that far

Somehow
breathe a little deeper now
cause this is who we are
when we look into their eyes
don't fly so high
so high little bird
you'll get your wings clipped
we'll pick it up, pick it up
now you've learned
