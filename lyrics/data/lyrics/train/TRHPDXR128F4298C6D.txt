They've read the scripture, they've passed the plate
And we're both prayin', he don't preach late
But he's gettin' "Amens", and that's just our luck
Yeah, it's eighty-five degrees outside and he's just gettin' warmed up

Oh you and me, we could be soakin' up that sun
Findin' out just how fast your brother's boat'll run
I tell you there ain't nothin' that'll test your faith
Like a long sermon on a pretty Sunday
