Here's my life, I give it to You
I place it in Your hands
I place it in Your hands

Here's my heart, You're dwelling inside
I place it in Your hands
I place it in Your hands

For so long I have held on to all that I am
When all You want is for me to place it in Your hands
In your hands, Lord in your hands

Here's my thoughts, I want to think of You
And place them in Your hands
