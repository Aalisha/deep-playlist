Howling night of bitter winds
This old house is burning
Reasons why forever retold
And no one is learning

I move in the strange light
In a world with no eyes
Miss a turn in the midnight rain
Never come this way again

When love's light deserts you
Never change your heart
When lightning strikes and love is gone
Don't let it break your heart

Don't let it turn you around
...
