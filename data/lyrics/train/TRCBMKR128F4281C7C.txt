Oh, the razor blade, that's what I call love,
I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it
If I put it down
It gets extremely complicated.
Anything to forget everything.

You've got to take me out,
At least once a week
Whether I'm in your arms,
Or I'm at your feet.
I know exactly what you're thinking
You won't say it now
But in your heart it's loud.

Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours.
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry.
