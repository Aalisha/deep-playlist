Ain't got enough, so I go out and get some more
It got so bad it nearly left me lying on the floor
I started thinking that it's wearing on my soul
But I got to get it getting tonight

Raindrops keep fallin' on my window - pain!
They make my company
I can hear them knocking on my door
Now, should I let them in?

When I look at the faces baby
You see how the other side dies
I've got to - got to - got to
Let them come on in
...
