Good morning judge, what may be my fine?
Good morning judge, what may be my fine?
Good morning judge, what may be my fine?
Fifty dollars eleven twenty-nine
They arrest me for murder and I ain't never harmed a man
Arrest me for murder and I ain't never harmed a man
Arrest me for forgery and I can't even sign my name
Arrest me for murder and I ain't hurt a man
