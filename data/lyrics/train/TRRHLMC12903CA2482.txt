I try to call ya
But I only get your service
You're the playmate of the year
So I guess that I deserve it
Well you left me with some habits
That are awful hard to kick
If you see me on your TV screen
You better come on over quick
Cause true love and true confessions
Are the same thing
Don't go and sell our secrets for a gold ring
Our love was ended quickly for the deadlines
Now you talk about me in the headlines
You're always seen in Paris
