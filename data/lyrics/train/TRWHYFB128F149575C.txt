(Mac McAnally/Chris Gantry/Rhett Akins)
(Track 1 - Time 3: 52)

I pulled in her driveway
Turned the radio down low
And I sat staring at what she was wearing
Waitin' by the front door
She came walking down the porch steps
Her daddy's pride and only innocence
The way she smiled
I knew we were gonna be

Heart to heart
Falling in love by the radio light
Underneath the stars
Nothin's ever felt more right
Than being alone and lost
In each other's arms
...
