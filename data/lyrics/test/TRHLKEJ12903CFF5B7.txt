A face with no emotion
Lost in the television's glow
He's slipping into darkness
Not far from comatose

With a bottle in his left hand
A cigarette in his right
He's drowning out the echo
Of voices in the night

Through the conversation
The old me drifts away
Hiding from the moment
I long for yesterday

I hear your voice so distant
Calling out my name
If only I could answer
If we were still the sameâ€¦

Oh, but we've changed
