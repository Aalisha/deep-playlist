Goodness me, yes, I'd agree
I was the one who ended up our history
Well, it looks like you wrote the last page to me
Your friends say you've got a new man

Girl, that's so not cool in so many ways
These were supposed to be my carefree single days
Instead I'm punching walls and coming up with ways
Ways to win you back from your new man

Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah

Right now, he's a probably moaning your name
The thought of it is driving me insane
Got to get religion just to ease the pain
Thinking about you loving your new man

Well, did you get the literature I left in your bed?
Told ya keep it frozen, it caught fire instead
Have you not heard a single word I've said?
No, you were busy loving your new man

Goodness garage, his name is probably Rog
