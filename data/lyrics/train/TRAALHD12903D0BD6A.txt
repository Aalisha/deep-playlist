Well they took me to the hospital,
And I swore I would't go.
My blood was running much to high
my heart was much to slow.
The doctor had some questions,
somethings he had to know.
My baby shook her head and said,
The boy's got no control.

Well I wasn't born in trouble.
It's my adopted middle name.
When you're running with the devil,
ya got noone else to blame.

He says Im ok.
He might say I'm all right.
But, I lose control everywhere.
It keeps me up all night.

No control
I got no control
you bet I know
