Wish I'd told her how I feel
Maybe she'd be here right now
But instead

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls are closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm cryin' inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumbling down
...
