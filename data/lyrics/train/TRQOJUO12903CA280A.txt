Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

Guess the little bitty living room ain't gonna look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's gonna be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beatin'
...
