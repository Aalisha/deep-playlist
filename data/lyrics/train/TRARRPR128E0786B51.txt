Who cares what I'm gonna do
Without you, without you
Who cares if I blow a few
Without you, without you
I go run after dark
I know you heard it all before
I'm doing fine without you
On my own
What do you expect of me
You used to run, used to be
Got my own life without you
(Now I know)

I've made it through
I paid my dues
There's somebody out there
And black and blue
And so confused
There's somebody out there
And so a few are born to lose
Getting me nowhere
I've made it through
I paid my dues
There's somebody out there
...
