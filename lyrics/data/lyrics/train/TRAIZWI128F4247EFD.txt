I've got a pocket full of money I shouldn't spend
To drink him away again
My heart stops cold in my chest
There he is in the back of the bar, looking his best

He passes me by and grabs a stranger's hand
He pulls her on the floor to dance
Oh no, I don't understand
He don't even know who I am

He's just an old memory
