Talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there
Don't let her know that she's getting through to to you
Talk back trembling lips

Heart don't let her know that your breaking in two

Every day our love's a battle royal
Dear it seems that fighting is all we do
But if i let you know how much I love you
