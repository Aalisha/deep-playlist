The time has come for us to pause
And think of living as it was
Into the future we must cross (must cross)
And I'd like to go with you
And I'd like to go with you

You say I'm harder than a wall
A marble shaft about to fall
I love you dearer than them all (them all)
So let me stay with you
So let me stay with you
