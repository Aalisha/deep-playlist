Your dreams, your fantasies
Your desires, your choice

Look outside your window, tell me what you see
Past all the flowers, beyond the trees
Is it what you wanted your life to be
Or is it what you settle for?

Is it 'cause they laugh at you and talk about you too?
They talked about Jesus Christ, what makes you think
They won't talk about you?
No need to worry, you are a star
And you are perfect just the way you are

Keep on dreaming, keep on shining
Keep on grinding, don't stop trying
Keep on dreaming, keep on flowing
...
