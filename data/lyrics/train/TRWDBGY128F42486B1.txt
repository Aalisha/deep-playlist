New day same thing, we got people in the streets
But the governmeny ain't doin' a damn thing, and all we investing in is
Hydro and liquor stores SS 4 doors and 24's
But where I'm from thats what we live for, the ghetto so

[Hook 1:]
If you're livin in the ghetto and your feelin me
Let me hear you say OH, OH, OH
If you're sick and tired of the same thing
It's alright to say OH, OH, OH
Cuz you know the Po Po's the project and the old folk
That waht we see 24 in the ghetto, corner spots crack rocks and gun shots
Good time the bad times the same place with the sam rhymes
You need to stop waitin' round for the punch line
Cuz ain't nothin change but the time
