Just a still town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real-time world
No one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing woman into life
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between
Will and what will be

She's a maniac
Maniac on the floor
(On the floor)
And she's dancing
Like she's never danced before
(She's dancing likes...)

She's a maniac
...
