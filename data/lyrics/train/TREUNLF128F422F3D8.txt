Let Jah be Praised
While I pray for my blessings to rise (Woh-woh)
Listen

Dem belly full but they're starving
Have a lot an still wanting
Jah without you we're empty
Fill us up with your mercy
Dem belly full but they're starving
Have a lot an still wanting
Jah without you we're empty
Fill us up with your mercy

Man shall not live
By bread alone (and I know)
But by the words
That proceeding from Jah, Jah
Man shall not live
By bread alone (and I know)
But by the words
That proceeding from Jah, Jah

Dem belly full but they're starving
Have a lot an still wanting
Jah without you we're empty
Fill us up with your mercy
