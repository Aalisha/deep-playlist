It's a beautiful day.
It's a rather nice day.
A day for a glorious wedding.
A rehearsal, my dear, to be perfectly clear.
A rehearsal for a glorious wedding.
Assuming nothing happens that we don't really know,
That nothing unexpected interferes with the show.
And that's why everything, every last little thing,
every single tiny microscopic little thing must go...
According to plan,
Our son will be married.
According to plan,
Our family carried,
We'll go right into to the heights of society...
To the costume balls,
In the hallowed halls.
Rubbing elbows with the finest.
Having crumpets with her highness.
We'll be there, we'll be seen, having tea with the queen.
We'll forget everything... that we've ever ever been.
