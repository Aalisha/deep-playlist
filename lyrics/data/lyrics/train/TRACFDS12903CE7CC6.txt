The days, they stay the same;
Stuck inside this mental game.
A tidal wave,
It blow this house of cards away.
It's never been the same,
We built this out of love and pain.
It stays the same,
Who am I to point the blame?
If I could turn back time,
We'd never fall in love.
I can see I don't know where you are
And how we got this far, outta hand.
If it's up to me, I'd do it all again,
Do you understand, what you mean to me?
