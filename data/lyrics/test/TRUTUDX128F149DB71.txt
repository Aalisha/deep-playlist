(1935) ira gershwin, dubose heyward, george gershwin
I loves you, porgy, Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
And I'll be glad
Yes I loves you, porgy, Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With his hot hands
...
