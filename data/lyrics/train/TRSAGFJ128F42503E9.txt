Damn, I'm sorry you had to find out like that.
(Aye aye)
Wait a minute.
Can we talk a minute?
Ohhh...
I'm sorry you had to find out this way.

There's this guy I've been seeing, hold on though.
Everytime I close my eyes he's in my thoughts.
We've been going through it for some time now.
It ain't my fault, no.
I'm just tryna be truthful to you.
And let you know.
Everytime I try to leave something always tells me no.

And just when I think it's working
itself out... can't be so.
