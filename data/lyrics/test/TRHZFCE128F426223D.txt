Born to die and you get to sit and watch yer TV set
believe the lies before yer eyes credit cards and apple pies
50 stars to blind yer eyes 13 stripes to hypnotize
free thought is gone you'll never see yer just a pawn
you'll die tomorrow but today yer empty dreams just fade away
evaporate, dissolve to hate while you survive and wait
until a lifeless fate yer stupid lives just piddle on
you slave fer others and then your gone I just can't escape the lying
the moment we are born we're dying it's such an ugly sight

we have no rights
we have no future
