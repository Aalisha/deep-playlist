[Intro:]
IIII girl i love you so 
Never want you to go 
Haven't i told you that i always i love you 
Haven't i told you that i always i care for you 
Haven't i told you that our lovin' is special 
Haven't i told you i put no one above you

[Verse 1:]
Girlll it hurts me inside 
For these silly questions that your askin 
How many time 
I got to say to you that im not leavin' 
Girl you've become apart of me 
Without you in my life 
My life would be so incomplete 

[Chorus:]
You'll never knowww
