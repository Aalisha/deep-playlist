There's so much to offer, so much to throw away
The ever present darker side is making you color blind
But luckily my blinded one
I know you and not what you've done
Not what you've done

You beautiful soul
When you go a feeling that chokes
When you go a fever that soaks
When you go you go away
Into the unknown
When you go you break my heart
Don't you go cause it's chokes
It chokes
