I'll not want for longing, it causes heartache yet this singularity burns just the same
Hope for ash of memory, this is pure agony
Eyes, they are too blind to see, this is pure agony
I'll not beg for you, this is pure agony
Knowing whats been true, this is pure agony
Fall from your light world, not again, this breeds fear
My life weakens and the pain I hold tight
Life hurts so now, I have no power here
Cease living somehow, I long to release you

As I fall I... As I fall we cry in despair
Don't be lifeline... don't be my lifeline, let me fall away
Alone, desolate. alone and desolate am I the only one
...
