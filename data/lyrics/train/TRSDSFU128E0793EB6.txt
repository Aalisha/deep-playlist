Please may I leave the table
I don't think that I'll be able
To swallow your family values again today

Because a giant squid
He stole my wife and kid

Full story and pix
Ten pence off your Weetabix, yeah, yeah
Sometimes this world just drives you
Crazy, lately
Yeah and the smoke gets in your eyes
Run the exhaust back inside
Close the window and take a ride
I've got a place to go
Nowhere to hide
...
