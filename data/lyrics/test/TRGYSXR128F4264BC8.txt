 [Chorus Forte' & DMX] 
 
 {Forte'} 
 You wanna bust guns? (You wanna lock fists?) DMX in parentheses

 Straight up! We locked it! 
 
 
 [Forte' - Verse One] 
 
 Associated with the razor blade spinners like gym stars 
 and heavy hitters, 
 Them younger gods love banana clips, broads that strip 
 candle wax, brown Beamers to whip 
 And jerk a bitch, known to hit ya, for taking pictures! 
 Thirty two shots to split ya! 
 It's all about the cash when I'm fuckin' wit' ya! 
 John could make ya richer! 
 Fuck the Prince of Bel-Air! 
 I'm known to sell heir, got game like a politician 
 whose trying to add on, when it's not addition 
 You need to revamp! The hottest nigga out the Refugee Camp! 
 Run up on you B, and leave your seat damp!
