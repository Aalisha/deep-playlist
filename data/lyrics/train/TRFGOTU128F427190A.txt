So I hope this finds you well
Sun is shining down eastern valley ways
There's some news I need to tell you
Give my Mother a kiss
Tell her I'm ok

I recall her words
"If it's too easy, It never lasts
I have compromised
Now Im finally free of the past

Now I can dance
Clouds have all disappeared
Freedom
I hold so dear
Cause nobody knows me here
Though I can only imagine the sadness
In your eyes
Please understand
Now I can dance

All alone the other night
...
