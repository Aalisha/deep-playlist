On the Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
On the Rock Island Line, there's a road to ride
On the Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
If you want to ride, you gotta ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station on the Rock Island Line

Jesus died to save our sin
Glory to God, weâ€™re goin' to meet Him again

On the Rock Island Line, there's a mighty good road
On the Rock Island Line, it's a road to ride
On the Rock Island Line, there's a mighty good road
If you want to ride, you gotta ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station on the Rock Island Line

Yes, the A B C double X Y Z
Cats in the cupboard but they can't see me

On the Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
On the Rock Island Line, it's a road to ride
On the Rock Island Line, it's a mighty good road
If you want to ride, you gotta ride it like you find it
Get your ticket at the station on the Rock Island Line
