Ocean's gonna roll without me
And river's gonna flow without me
And love it's gonna spin without me
And there'll be songs to be sung,
Long after I'm gone

I walk by the stream,
As the sun goes down
(Sun goes down)
Music runs through me,
But I can't make sounds
I try to cry out,
But I don't know why
My face is frozen,
I can't even cry
Even when I try
I beg you hold
Hold on to me
Hold
...
