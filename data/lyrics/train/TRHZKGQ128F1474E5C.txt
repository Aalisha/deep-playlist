I've heard every kind of love song,
Cried unrequited tears,
I've lived all the lines for so long,
But never felt you near.

And I listen to my radio,
Every record in the chart,
When you said 'be my baby'
It made the fires start.

Now that's what I call music,
Music to my heart,
Now that's what I call music,
Music to my heart.

(Call music, music,
I call music, music to my heart,
Music to my heart.)

And I've moved to every rhythm,
And danced to every beat.
