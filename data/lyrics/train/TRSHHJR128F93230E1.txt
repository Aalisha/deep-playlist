Looking for the working man's café
In the shopping center of the town
Looking for somewhere to fit in
In among the retail outlets

Bought a pair of new designer pants
Where the fruit and veg man used to stand
I always used to see him there
Selling old apples and pears

Chatting up the pretty girls
With knocked off goods in the van

Don't you know he was a working man
Long ago he was a working man
And we sat in the working man's café
The working man's café

Everything around me seems unreal
...
