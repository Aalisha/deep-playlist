with woodchip on the wall.

Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown.
Be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road."
I never knew that you'd get married.
I would be living down here on my own
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago.

You were the first girl at school to get breasts.
