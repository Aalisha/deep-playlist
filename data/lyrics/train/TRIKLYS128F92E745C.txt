You for me, me for you
That’s the way it’s gonna be, yeah
Oh, baby
Oh... oh... oh... oh... baby
We won’t be in and out, up and down, all around
Not this time, baby
It’ll be me for you and you for me
Yes, it will

I’ve got love on my mind
Ain’t no use in me wastin’ time
I’ve got you on my brain
I ain’t fixin’ to play no games

Baby, you’re my life
Give me one more chance to prove my love
Baby, oh, you’re so fine
I promise to be true only to you

Oh, this time, baby
We won’t be in and out of love
In and out, baby
This time, baby
We won’t be in and out of love
In and out, baby

This time, this time, baby
We won’t be in and out of love
In and out, baby, yeah

I’ve been selfish at times
Always tryin’ to blow your mind
Usin’ you was so easy
