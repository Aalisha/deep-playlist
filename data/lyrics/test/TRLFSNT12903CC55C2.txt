Pounding heart you shake me
I have never been so close
To an earthquake
Take my word I'm trembling
For I know
What I have felt

Pounding heart believe me
Rain is sweeter than
The spring water fountain
Take my hand and lead me
To a place
For us to melt

Into one another

Think the inconceivable
Desire the untouchable
