Goodnight Bullcreek
You were the world to me
Now you're just a well worn post code for the memories

I drove down your road
Searching for I don't know

Something I'd left long behind

I stayed up all night thinking of ways to tell you
That my whole life I been here waiting for you
Now my heart is blind
And I'm losing my mind
