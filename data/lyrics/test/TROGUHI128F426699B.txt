(Written by - Travis Tritt)

I disappeared one morning
Left without a warning
Some thought I was finally gone for good
But those doubters just got rattled
'Cause I'm back in the saddle
Doing better then a body should.

Surprise, surprise, I'm back again
Who says I've lost too much to win
That wouldn't be too safe a bet
No you can't count me out, yet.

My self-esteem diminished
They said that I was finished
Just a washed up piece of history
But some things needed changing
I did some rearranging
My recovery ain't no mystery.
