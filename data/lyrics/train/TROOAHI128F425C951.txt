I can't seem to stop the music
All those familiar sounds
My thoughts cut in on partners
Dancin' in their empty arms

Tangled up in the lives of others
That don't make any sense
Lost looks in the eyes of lovers
Their sins are innocent

Don't you stop to wonder
What's goin' wrong
When everything you've ever loved
Has come and gone

You thought and never told me
You thought but that won't hold me
So much was left unspoken
Held in a heart now broken

Situations all invented
...
