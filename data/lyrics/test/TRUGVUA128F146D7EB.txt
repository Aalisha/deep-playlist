(feat. Rivers Cuomo of Weezer)

Hi, my name is Bob, and I approve this message...

I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
Now everybody wants a blast of magic
Magic, magic, magic
(M M) Magic, magic, magic
(M M M) Magic, magic, magic
Ah ooooooo
I got the magic in me

The trick that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse I'll hypnotize you with every line
I'll need a volunteer how about you with the eyes
Come on down to the front, sit right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time traveling, have your mind babbling
...
