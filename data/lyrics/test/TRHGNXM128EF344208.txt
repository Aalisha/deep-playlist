Rain falls outside
I think the sky must know what's happening tonight
Children born while fathers die
It's that circle of life that we all live in time

And we've been friends for a long, long time
So, if you can't talk, just cry
And know that we will talk
On the other side

It's bitter cold outside
But the sun still shines 'cuz we can feel it
Benjamin, you mark the life
That's been left behind, we see him in your eyes
