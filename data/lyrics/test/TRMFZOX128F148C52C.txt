Don't touch that dial, don't click the clicker
we love to watch, they love to bicker
don't turn the knob or change the channel
hey! where the hell did they get this panel?
where are they from? where have they been?
they air it out, we suck it in suck it in
up on stage all in a row
at each other's throats all through the show
the mood is tense, the tension's thicker
...
