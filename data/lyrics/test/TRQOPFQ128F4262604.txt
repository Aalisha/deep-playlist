Look at you now, you really haven't changed
Still as beautiful as first day we met
But something's different, doesn't seem so long ago
Amazing how the years can go

When we wanted different things
You wanted a family, I was chasing my dream
I didn't know what I had back then
How could I go off through the growing pains of being a man?

I really didn't understand
I took you for granted, now it's out of my hands
Now I wish I had it to do all over again

'Cause all I do is dream about the times we had together
We used to think that they would last forever
But who've thought it be my fault we didn't make it
And when I'm missing you so much that I can't take it
