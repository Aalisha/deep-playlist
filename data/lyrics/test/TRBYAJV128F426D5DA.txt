If you want my love, you got it
When you need my love, you got it
I won't hide it
I won't throw your love away, ooh

If you want my love, you got it
When you need my love, you got it
I won't hide it
I won't throw your love away, ooh

Yes, I thought you were a mystery girl
A special girl in this crazy old world
You couldn't see me when I laid eyes on you

Lonely is only a place
You don't know what it's like
