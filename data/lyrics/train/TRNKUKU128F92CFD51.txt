Life, a struggle, to meet the day,
When hatred leads life, to take away.
On a field, blood marks an appealing end,
A crimson carpet, in vain to defend.
Bathe in gore, fight, mass suffering
Love destruction, the pain it brings
The hell in my eye's, devoid of god.
To say war is pain, a sick facade.
Existence- life is done
