Well I had a job, but I got laid off
I had a heart but it got too soft
I had a girlfriend and she lied
I had a wife but my wife she died

One too many drinks about an hour ago
All I want now's just one more
And when it hit, a baby I don't care

Where (where)
Where (where)
Where (where)
Oh where

Where is the next one comin' from
Where is the next one comin' from

Some folks they say there's just one thing (where is the next one comin' from)
Gonna make 'em dance and gonna make 'em sing (where is the next one comin' from)
Had a little o that and had a little of this (where is the next one comin' from)
Well I checked 'em all off 'a my list (where is the next one comin' from)

All I know is don't get enough
