Falling from grace forever damning the human race
A parable amongst mortals, for we were damned from the start
Mass creators of population, yet destroyers of civilization
With piss and bile coursing through veins that flood an ashen heart.

God damned this world, that is if “God” exists
God hates this world, left his “Son” tied to a stick?
God as sadist, this is the portrait you paint
God is within and we ruin everything…

We ruin everything.

Slow death (in the garden) unnatural selection
