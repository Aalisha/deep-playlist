It's unfashionable, I guess,
To knock success,
It's magnified and blessed,
Folk are so impressed,
This is uniformity,
Remember something please,
As we travel up the tree,
We show worse anatomy,

Yet we must be so charming when we're praised
Like kids when we are trashed, we come of age
It's crazy I think of you
I know that you're coming too

Hey sunshine! I'll never shake your pride
You're what I need,
You've been appointed
...
