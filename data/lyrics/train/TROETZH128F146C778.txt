Hot

You can keep your black tongue
Well I found at the mortuary
You know I'm gonna want some, want some
We'll hide in the backroom gonna have a packed suit
With this you will regret
Just let it be your yeah, yeah, yeah

Sunny kept his rain on, red tape so ordinary
Love I feel like it was gone, gone, gone, gone
