Woke up this morning feeling so bad
Out my window it was raining
Didn't even feel like running
I didn't feel like doing anything

Then the phone wouldn't stop ringing
And my head wouldn't stop pounding
I feel so down I don't know why
There's something overwhelming me inside

Just one of those days
Just another day, it don't go your way
(And tomorrow can't come soon enough for me)
Just one of those days
Just another day, it don't go your way
(And tomorrow can't come soon enough)

Gotta get up
Any how I can't afford to lose no hours
Got a deadline that I must meet
Every second matters to me

Hard to function feeling like this
But I got to keep on going
Am I in a huddle to get over
I've got to do things much darker and colder

Just one of those days
 (Just one of those days)
Just another day, it don't go your way
 (Just another day)
...
