Someone told me you should never trust a desperate man
Keep your head straight with your eyes on the final prize
Don't lose the focus now
Fighting forward
There will always be the ones who question everything
I've always noticed
There's nothing bigger than all of the little things

It's what I'm waiting for
I've never wanted more

There's no telling just what we could do
Just have to get through this
