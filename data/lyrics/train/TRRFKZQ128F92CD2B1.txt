I've got a feeling you don't care
And everything I say you cannot hear
So celebrate the time we have
'Cause I don't think I can stay, for too long

Oh yeah, and how could I forget
The complications you have failed to comprehend
I know, I know you're wasting time

You're wasting time on me
Now I can see

Tell me do you still have pieces of me
'Cause I am not complete at all
We can try, we can try
But we're never gonna get it right
Unless we fall
