Verse 1

Now i met this girl in Daytona
Spring breakin' with my dawgs i was on her
Didnt give a chance to let another dude get on her
Ya'll know i came wit my mack game, hood like a crap game
I caught her early, i was sober
That meant my thoughts going right and my words flowin' nice and
When she movin got me on the fly
Get ready for take off, them clothes got to break off

Chorus
Got her gigglin and laughin, and i know she knows what's happenin'
She can tell by the way i'm rappin', gotta rap this up baby thats whats up
She like a girl gone wild, cant miss the girl she stand out in the crowd and
Young and sexy with the freaky freaky style
