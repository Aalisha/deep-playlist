From a desperate place
How do I reach you
You know I scare myself
These crazy nights without you
And I feel no pain
When I see you cry
We can turn it around now
You're my reason to try
We've all seen some trouble
But we've always come through
You know things could get better
Hey babe believe me
Tough times don't last
Lovers do
Baby don't give up
On me and you
Cause trouble's just a storm
That's gonna pass
Tough times don't last
We can work so hard
Til we feel the strain
We can get so close
It's the distance
We can't explain
