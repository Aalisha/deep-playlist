I wanna hear your voice but I don't want you to call
I wanna see you girl but not see you at all
I wanna make-up but I still want to fight
I wanted to break up but it just don't feel right

(sittin' here waiting on you)

I hate you you hate me but still can't escape
Even all the bullshit we've been going through lately
Heart-broke, love-struck, tellin' ya'll this ain't me
Life without you girl it's something that I can't see
I ain't goin' lie, sayin' I don't get lonely but it's only so much I can kick it with the homies
And somebody told me, you already moves on
I broke up with you you ain't supposed to get your groove on
Not now at least wait a couple weeks got me lookin' like a chump with my business in the streets
Been a couple weeks but it feels like you still there
No matter how I clean I'm still findin' your hair
Or some shit you forgot or I'm standin' at that spot when you came so hard
I didn't think that you would stop
But quiet as step I know you miss just a little
Washed the sheets when you left but I still smell you on my pillow

[Chorus:]
Everything I do it reminds me of you
And everything I see it reminds me of we
