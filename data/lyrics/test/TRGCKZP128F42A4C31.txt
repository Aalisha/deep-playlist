Yo, I ain't superstitious but these niggaz is nice

A lot of cats pop shit, I pop apocalypse
Toppin' propaganda force fed to the populace
My thoughts run the gamut from outstandin' to preposterous
On top of this I move posteriors brother impoverished the 'Pac shuries'

My process, accomplish through percevierence
Every man's not my brother regardless of appearance
Apprehension clouds the spirit tension prepares us for ascension
And at his best is when he breaks conventions

A convenient covenant coveted for conception
We're all from the same mold, spores and bacteria
Those woulda fear me others would thaw hysteria
A claustrophobic neurosis in this masquerade ball
Of fake glasses and big noses

Molasses splashes explosive flows two exposed
Pinnocheos growin' nose composed of compost compositions
Clothes are gettin' a little close fittin', I stop this shit and I'm over-confident
The script's compliments of my frozen mic dominance
A passively aggressive testament is how I'm reppin' shit

Watch Vast murder the track effortless
Like God's on my side and He answered my Christmas list
After the first couple of bars I start to smell fear
That's when I take them there so they can breathe Aire

What you're so secure with your insecurity
Perfect world of piety I swat flies when they bother me
Some say I touch hearts like Kano
Now every time you see a mic you just say no

Some write with words, I write with matters
As my soul is brushed free Vast Aire dusty
In the coldest winters we thought husky
