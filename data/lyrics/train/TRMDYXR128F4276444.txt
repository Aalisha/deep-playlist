It happened before and it will happen again
You got beat because you didn't look like them
Five men jump from the back of a van
And pound you to the ground with the bats in their hands

VIOLENCE! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL! KILL!

Anger causes violence and stupidity
But I can't stop myself from getting angry
I sometimes wish I had a gun so I could go kill everyone
I'm sick of being pushed around and living in a world of fear and hate
