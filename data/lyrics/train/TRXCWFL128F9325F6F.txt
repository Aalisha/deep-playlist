I never thought that I could be so bold
To even say these thoughts aloud
I see you with your man, your eyes just shine
While he stands tall and walk in proud

That look you give that guy, I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy instead of me
I'd never let you down

It always seems like you're going somewhere
Better than you've been before
Well, I go to sleep, and I dream all night
