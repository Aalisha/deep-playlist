Even While I Sleep
Willy DeVille

You maybe far away
Or just maybe down yhe street.
I hear every sound that you make,
And every time that your heart beats.
You're there in every dream I dream.
You're there in every bteath I breathe.
You're there Even While I Sleep.

You've got some kind of magic charm,
...
