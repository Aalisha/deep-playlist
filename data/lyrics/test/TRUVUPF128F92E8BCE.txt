Can't understand what is happening to me,
This isn't real, this is only a dream,
But I never have felt, no I've never have felt this way before,
I'm looking down on my body below,
I lie asleep in the midst of a dream,
Is it now could it be that the angel of death
Has come for me?
I can't believe, that really my time has come,
I don't feel ready, there's so much left undone,
And it's my soul and I'm not gonna let it get away.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait til another day.
I have a lust for the Earth below
And Hell itself is my only foe,
'Cause I've no fear of dying,
I'll go when I'm good and ready,
I snatch a glimpse of the light's eternal rays,
I see a tunnel, I stand amazed,
At all of the people standing there in front of me,
Into the paths of rightness I'll be led,
Is this the place where the living join the dead?
I wish I knew this was only just a nightmare.
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
Heaven can wait,
...
