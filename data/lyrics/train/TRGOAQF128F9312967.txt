Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

Well, I was walkin' through Macarthur Park
Looking for some sugar just to cure my heart
And after dark I talk to the cabby
'Cause he drives me home if I call him daddy
And it's alright

Just as long as I can get high
Sit back and watch the sunset in the sky
I don't know if you know what I mean
But it's love in Los Angeles

Hey!
Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

Lazy days in Los Angeles
If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police
We just want to get our kicks for free
We just want to get our kicks for free

Walking through Malibu, not a thing to do
Gotta find a fine young little girl to screw ...over
