My supermarket trolley
Glides around the shelves
Of frozen foods
My supermarket trolley
Glides around the shelves
Of pre-packed goods
It rattles an accompaniment
To the droning from the speakers
When I knock a jar (checkout 5)
I stand and stare oblivious as it shatters
(will the manager please go to checkout 5)

Someone passes by
We near collide
She's silent but she's frantic
Can't figure out why she's bought so many useless items
(checkout 5, will the manager please go to checkout 5)
I can't figure out why I've bought so many useless items
(there is a problem at checkout 5)
I only wanted cigarettes
(will you investigate please)
I push my trolley further
(will you investigate please)
I glide around the frozen goods
Lost in here forever
Lost in here forever
Lost in here forever
Lost in here forever
Ever (ever)

My arms do things oblivious of my wishes and my orders
(there is a problem at checkout 5
Will the manager investigate please)
The frantic woman has turned white
A hand upon her shoulder
Buy (buy) buy (buy)
