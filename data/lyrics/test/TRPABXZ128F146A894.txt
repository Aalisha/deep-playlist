Sometimes I think about
What life was like before
Was it full of old remidies 
That kept me reaching for the door

But I know this love is unconditional (yea e yeah)
Deep inside your my living joy (yea e yeah)

I'm gonna sing you a lullaby
A thousand times or more
You're a sweet as a butterfly
Baby all I need and more
Gonna sing you my song
'cause I think the world about you
You're the only one that matters now
Since the day you were born

The first time I looked at you
On that friday afternoon
Your eyes were all a wonderin'
