It's too darn hot, it's too darn hot
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
And fill the cup with my baby tonight

I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
Fill the cup with my baby tonight
But I'm not up to my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot

It's too darn hot, it's too darn hot
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch some woo with my baby tonight

I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
Pitch some woo with my baby tonight
But I won't fight with my baby tonight
...
