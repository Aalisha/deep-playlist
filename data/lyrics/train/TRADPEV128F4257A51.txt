Shadows of sadness dazzle me deep inside
Tears are falling, as the winter captures my mind
Darkness surrounds me as reach out in emptyness
Running through a maze, a desert which holds the pain

The sands that blinds my eyes,
has hurt me deep inside Entonglement, trust fades away
Nothing to hold besides enduring pain

Merriment has forsaken me
Obscure dreams of degrading times
Countless thoughts possessed by remembrance
Forgiveness, will it cross my path?

Midway in my life journey, I went astray
My heart is filled with fear
as fate shriveled and shrank
...
