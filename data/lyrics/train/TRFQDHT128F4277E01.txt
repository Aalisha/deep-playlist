I haven't seen Sandy
and Johnny, or Mary
I heard they got married
Mighta had a couple babies
And traded their memories
For fairview and makers
And never play no pinball
Or get up pass the breakers

But not me, pretty baby
I still love Tom Petty songs
And driving old men crazy
And all while little lita
is waiting
So you sing me slow songs
And I'll drive you crazy
Tonight

Yeah!

But all I want is you
...
