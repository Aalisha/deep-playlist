Uhhhh yeahhhh uh, The Firm
Lust... hate... envy... jealousy
Connivin niggaz
Nigga nature, uh, yeah

Jumped out the ride, floss high, black tie
Cocoa to lye, three guys, slanted eyes
I shoulda tried, sweet thugs stay dove
Up in the Land, crash bar ill beam
They threw this CREAM, my whole team must fiend
The ghetto dream, Fox Boog, jigged up
Stay in the cut like WHAT, layin in the Bentleys
stoned, flossed on, me and Capone
Picasso, Mardi Gras, play the low in a six-double-oh
Benz chrome, dominicano
Superstar Lila Escobar holy matrimon'
Tied to The Firm, die for The Firm
So help me God, street life played right
I got his wife, hemmed up, in bun
Nigga two to the gut
