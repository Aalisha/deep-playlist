Some people say a man is made outta' mud
A poor man's made outta' muscle and blood
A muscle and blood, skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons and what do ya get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up a shovel and walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
