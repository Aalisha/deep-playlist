words and music by Graham Nash
Â© 1975 Thin Ice Music (ASCAP)


Saw a sign on the highway
I was driving along, way home
On a hilltop is where I belong
I took a look at the hole
Where my head used to be
And I'll sing you a song
That descended on me

The way I live
Determines the way
My people survive
Yes the way I live
Determines the way
...
