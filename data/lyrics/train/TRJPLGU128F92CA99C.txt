Oh time well it goes on and on and on again
like a driving rain like asnow flake in the sun
fallin out of the sky on everyone
you and me everybody everyone now everybody you see
you know I traveled so far seemed like forever
never mattered just as long as we're together
I traveled so far you knlw it gets so oh oh no
and this time well it goes on and on and over again
like a driving rain like a snow flake in the sun
falling out of the sky on everyone
you and me everyone now everybody you see
You know I said it before
you're the only one that can make me feel better
I'm lonely out here on my own

Try so hard
I try so hard to believe
try so hard
