Oh, c'mon

Everybody's talkin' 'bout the supermodel world
Cindy, Naomi and that whole bunch of girls
Redheads and brunettes and blondes with blue eyes
They come in every shape, yeah, they come in every size

You know I love everything they do
I check 'em out on every Pay-per-view
Oh, but honey that was way before I met you

And then you walked in with legs up to your neck
You walked in, I'm a physical wreck
You walked in, I've lost my cool, babe
But what'd you expect

When you walk in, baby, love begins
When you walk by, baby, ooh, my my
When you come around, my jaw hits the ground

When you shake your thing, I jump outta my skin
When you cross the floor I scream, "More baby more"
