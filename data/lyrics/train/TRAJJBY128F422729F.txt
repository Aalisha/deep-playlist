E heh heh oooh oh hoh ya wa
E heh heh oooh oh hoh ya wa

Hey which way Tuks
Come on over to my place
We got too much to do
You know time is a short space
But when we talk all day
And when we talk all night
You me yarn till we see
The morning light

Deadly weather for fishing today
Can't chanse the though of sleep away
Chase sleep away
Chase sleep away
Chase sleep away
