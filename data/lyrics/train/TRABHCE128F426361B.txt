Runnin? runnin? down your face flows a sea straight through to midnight
"Are all the dreams this loud", she says while the stars swim in the dark
And around and? round we? re turnin?, sketchin? rings down in the sand
We? re moving? neath the melting moon 'til we wash the world away

And the days just wash away, just slip away
And the time just keeps on spinnin?
And the time just keeps on spinnin?

And tonight we? re not alone, we pull the sky down by our side
And I? m not leavin? you anymore
Standin? in the sand, starin? at the sun, twistin? into sound
...
