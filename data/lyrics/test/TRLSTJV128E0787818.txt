What a difference a day makes
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said, "You are mine"

Oh, what a difference a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above
Can't be stormy
