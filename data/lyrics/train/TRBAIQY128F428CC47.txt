Hurt you, cheat you, I can't believe that you're
Staying with the man who can love you like I can
He don't deserve to have a woman like you
And you don't deserve to have a man that's not true

Queen, and I mean that, I'm not just saying that
One of a kind and not just because you're fine
He don't deserve to have a woman like you
And you don't deserve to have a man that's not for you

Girl, it's not to drive me crazy
Listen to the words you're saying
How could you just sit and let him
Take your precious love for granted

It's a good thing I don't know him
I don't feel no shame in saying
Evidently he can see that
Anyone would want his lady

Hurt you, cheat you, I can't believe that you're
Staying with the man who can love you like I can
...
