Every night, I sit here by my window, window
Starin' at the lonely avenue, avenue
Watchin' lovers holdin' hands 'n' laughin', ha, ha, ha
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

Thinkin' 'bout things, like a walk in the park
Things, like a kiss in the dark
Things, like a sailboat ride
Yeah, yeah, what about the night we cried?

Things like a lover's vow
Things that we don't do now
Thinkin' 'bout the things we used to do

Memories are all I have to cling to, cling to
...
