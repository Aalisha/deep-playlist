California show me love,
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up!

California throw it up,
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up!
California show me love,
Get buzzed, let's get fucked up!
California so high we'll ride all night!

Coming straight outta Cali'.
The 818 valley.

323 fucking horsenut alley.
And from Highland to Clayton,
All these bitches are hating.
'Cause the shit that we're saying,
What's the shit that they're playing?
If we don't make it we'll take it,
If it ain't real then we'll fake it.
Open your mouth and I'll break it,
Don't give a fuck if you hate it.
We're looking for the six chicks,
Down with the six dicks.

Rolling on Tens, getting buzzed,
It's ridiculous.
Horny like a sickness,
Quickies with the quickness,
Pussy like it's business,
Work it like it's fitness.
Listen while I spit this,
Game at all these bitches,

Now I'm gonna hit this,
...
