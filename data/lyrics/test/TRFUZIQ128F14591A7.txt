I have learnt through all my past mistakes
Not to let the hurdles sap my energy
Time will tell and time is all it takes
You won't see the bastards knock the running out of me

And the band, they played one more song
One for the mocking bird, they played one more song
All the tears, they fell one by one
All for the mocking-bird, they fell one by one

Don't be fooled by those who feed you words
