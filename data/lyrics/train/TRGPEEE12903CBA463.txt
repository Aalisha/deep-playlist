[MJG]

Now we done talked about the pinky ring
And talked about the gold grill
So tell me
What's left to give really yo spine a cold chill
We call some call em diamonds
We call em ice
It varies in the sizes the shape
The color and the price
From canary yellow, ruby red to baby blue
One stone or maybe two
Fuck it cause we all cant be babies fool
Some of its jazzy
Some of it cant be real
Nigga say its sittin platinum
