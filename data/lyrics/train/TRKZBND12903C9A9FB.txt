My baby got mystery action
Well she lookin' like a fatal attraction
So I call her on the telephone
Say won't you come on round
It's cold out so were stayin' at home
I gotta say out loud
Battery operated - She got flashing lights
Push button activated - She got no time for fussin' and fights
She's not recommended by a problem page
For children under three years of age
She never far away but she's always out of sight
