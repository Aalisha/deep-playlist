We don't have to worry bout no money, to have us a real good time
And we don't have to leave in the morning, the whole day just you and I,
And it don't have to get any better, it's perfect you in my life.

If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool

We don't have to worry bout no groceries, we can fill up on love alone,
If we ain't got enough for a movie, we can just sit at home
Have a little role play baby, whatever turns you on

If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool
If you're cool, then I'm cool, then we're cool

Quit your worrying baby
Quit your worrying girl
Quit your crying lady
