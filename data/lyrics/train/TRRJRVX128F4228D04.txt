[Chorus:]
Tell me how you'd feel
If I was, If I was go'n,
Tell me how you'd feel?
Tell me how you'd feel
If I was, If I was go'n,
Tell me how you'd feel?
What if I was go'n forever?
No more chocolate kisses,
No nappy dugout ever,
No mamma, no daughter, no sister, no
No sister friends
Tell me my brother,
What would become of you then?
What if, poof, every black female in the world
disappeared?
Your man-child left unattended
Lost without no one behind the steering wheel
Tell me, hmm mmm,
C'mon, how would that make you feel
C'mon, c'mon, help a sister say
