DANCE
DANCE
DANCE
DANCE
DANCE
DANCE
DANCE
DANCE

I feel like the DJ is my bodyguard
You see the way he keeps me safe
With the treble and that bass
I feel free enough to party hard
This dress won't go to waste
Feels like I own the place
V.I.P to be the boss
You see the way these people stare
Watching how I fling my hair
I'm a dancefloor lover
Baby there's no other
Who do it like I do it yeah

From here on out
I'll be your commander
No fear no doubt
I'll provide the answer
Right now I command you to dance
