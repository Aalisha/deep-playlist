Verse:
We have come to praise and magnify The Lord
For all that He has done
And for the victories we have won.

In the good times and in the bad times,
in the happy times and in the sad times;
Having You there made the difference,
just having You there (having You there).

(Repeat)

Bridge:
Having You there,
having You there.
