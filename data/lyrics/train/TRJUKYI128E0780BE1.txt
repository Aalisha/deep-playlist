Oh oh yea, oh
Nina Sky's in the buildin' tonite
Here we go, feel dis

Checkin' in da club, feelin' nice
Got ma home girls rollin' wit me on ma right
I feel the music gettin' inside and hit da dance floor
'Bout to set the nite off right

They said, if the rythym gets inside me
I bet that later would be grindin'
No stress cuz' we left our men at home
And if ur feelin' wat we singin' then yo no dat it's on

Come to dance and do our thang
Party in this club see wats in that thing
See guys tryna holla we gon' holla back
And party to dis Nina Sky track

Come to dance and do our thang
Party in this club see wats in that thing
See guys tryna holla we gon' holla back
And party to dis Nina Sky track

50 afta party 'bout 5
Checkin' all da fly papis are inside
I feel da heat gettin' hotter
And I'm gonna get ma party on tonite
