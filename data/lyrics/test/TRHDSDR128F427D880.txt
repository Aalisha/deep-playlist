Yes I like stormy weather
From my window sill
But you ain't yeah you ain't so clever
You've got it all made up

But it feels
Like love, love love

Yes and it feels
Like touch, touch touch

I sit around to pass the time
I try to get it off of my mind
But the little world is oh so small
that I can't get around the sober

But it feels
Like love, love love

Yes and it feels
Like touch, touch touch
