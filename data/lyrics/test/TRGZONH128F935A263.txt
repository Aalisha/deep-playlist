I got me a job on the local paper
Everybody there thinks I'm nice
But they'd better look twice
'Cos it isn't me
I wanna be

Headline hustler
Scandal maker
Headline hustler
Money taker

You keep writing me letters
But I haven't got time
I'm busy looking at photographs
But they'd better not be from the BBC
You're gonna hear from me
