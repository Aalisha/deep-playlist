Yeah, Yeah, Uhh

Don't only wanna dream about you, yeah
But a dream like this should never be this hard
If I should live this life without you, yeah
I'd come back and try it from the start

And I'll show you love
'Cause we're all alone
Put business aside
For life passes by
And I'll part your hair
When it's in your eyes
Love
Little red houses down under in my mind
Got an 8 x 10 for you to sign
