Send me back all the thing she ever wrote
Tell me secrets of her days when she was young
Show me nights when she laughed
So innocent
I'll be happy
Waiting till they come
Love the people that she smiled upon
Walk with me in streets
Where she once stood
Say if it could be that we once passed like strangers
Long before the love we ever new
'Cause I've been longing
For a new world waiting
I've been hoping
To be sent
I've been picking up
All the love we squandered
Until you
Hold me in your swaying arms again
One day I can see us walking
...
