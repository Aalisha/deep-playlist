When I am fast asleep
I dream and see you floating high above me
And I awake at dawn
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
From on the bedroom floor
I watch you sailing far above the seashore
In deep Atlantic skies
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
Above the avenue
I search among the clouds trying to see you
But you are just a blur
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor

I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
...
