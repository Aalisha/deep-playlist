(Intro: Pimpin' Ken)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, like I said this is your boy Pimpin' Ken dot net
Sell the bitch pussy till it's drip drop wet
You know what I'm saying, the vet, not the pet

Only time a bitch get off is when a bitch run off, you know what I'm talking about

(Dirty Mouth)
As I pull up to the club
Jumping out of the Jag
24's still spinning with a dealership tag
Brand New
Bright leather guts and pearl blue
These hoes they choosing like a lucky horseshoe
But that's alright cause I don't pay these hoes no mind
As I stroll to the front of the VIP line
Straight in I go, headed straight to the bar
I got a superstar status, so I guess I'm a star
Haters checking me out
Now tell me what's that about?
I'ma chill to the point haters checking me out
Sipping on the Crystal
Bitches wanna get wild
Popping X and smoking dro' on the verge of my style
These bitches calling, asking where the after party
The Embassy Suites downtown, room 112, my darling
Bring your friends so we can let this party begin
And bring a box of Magnum rubbers so we can fuck till the end

(Jazze Pha)
Hey bitch, sign your name on the dotted line (well)
Cause you belong to me (you belong to me, yeah)
Hey bitch (hey bitch) sign your name on the dotted line (well)
Cause now you're mine

(LA)
Just pulled up at the club
I'm flyer than a motherfucker
Damn, why they staring? ho, shit I'm the motherfucker
Not the front door
We better go through the back
See, that was back then, now look where we at
Straight to VIP, my niggaz, man we deep
