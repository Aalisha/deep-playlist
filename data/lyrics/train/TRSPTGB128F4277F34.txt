You're pulling at your teeth
And I'm the Novocain you pump in your cheeks.
That's why I'm still around,
You've got blood running down your chin.
But you suffered peacefully (suffered peacefully)

She was a termite
Eating away at my roots.
I was just a lost soul
Who needed a home
I was filling a void with you

And I, I can't, can't wait
Until you've see see seen
What depth and disgust
Has done to me
And I spent three years wishing
For two things, that one day you'd break
And I'd get to see
How all the choices you made
...
