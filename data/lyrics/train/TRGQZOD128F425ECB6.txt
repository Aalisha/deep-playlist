The waves are breaking on the wall
The queen of roses 
Spreads her arms to fly, shed falls
If I had wings I'd cut them down
Live without these dreams 
So I could learn to love the ground

'Cause I wanna live inside the world
I wanna act like a real girl
I wanna know I'm not alone
And the dreams are not my home

The future's like a ringing bell
...
