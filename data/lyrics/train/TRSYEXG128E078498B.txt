1 2 3 and we're all in the city
You and me yeah we're all in the city
Boys got free going out getting busy
Tonight, tonight

1 2 3 and we're all in the city
You and me yeah we're all in the city
Jay's underage he's at home what a pity
Tonight, tonight

Well it's on and we're ready to go
Skinny white boys will be checking the show
We won't be leaving we won't go
Until the whole town we know

1 2 3 and we're all in the city
...
