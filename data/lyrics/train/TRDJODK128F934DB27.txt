Everything is my fault. Don't cry
Even if I opened my two eyes like this
I couldn't see your painful tears.

I needed to hold you and love you more but
like a fool I put you at unease.
I made you hinder and rest on another shoulder.

Erase everything. Erase this kind of me.
Although I couldn't say anything cause my heart burned, please be happy.
For the time you live in this world,
Don't cry because with the reason of love again.
