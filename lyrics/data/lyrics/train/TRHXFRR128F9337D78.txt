I looked at your face, is that the face I love?
It's been a long time since I've seen you
You've got a lovely place, the kids must send their love
We stood there lonely, baby, without you

And girl, you don't have to walk in the rain
'Cause baby, I know things can be just the same as before
When you walk through my door, you'll be home, girl
When you walk through my door, you'll be home
