so sick of lying about it
but can't live without it
keeps up the pulse in my veins now
heart in mouth
it just keeps on beating
it's stuck on repeating
the way that your name sounds

I don't want nothing to do with me
but i'm acting alone again

and your lament
"you can't repent
for the sins of another"
the wedding dress
the black regrets
will do nothing but smother us

you push when i push back
you should feel like you act
you should pause for moment together
breathe it in til you choke
...
