Wake up

Oh how the times have changed
You're not the person I knew back then
Let's get this straight
This is a calling
When will they stop falling for this
You lack all inspiration

We are not the same
I'll do whatever it takes
To get it through to you
And we'll call this a day
We are not the same
You are worthless
Stay in your place

It's like speaking in tongues
To all of you now
