So many miles away from the place
Where this journey once begun
I was sent to find another place
And a reason four our existence.
Now I travel deeper into the space
I may even find another race
Do you know I'm entering to Mars
or am I just lost between the stars?

I'm here but never completely free
Between the worlds that you see
...
