My cheeks are red and now they're swollen from the kisses
the strangers dance next to me
They're waiting on the sunrise or the armageddon
doesn't matter which ever comes first

Did you see those fireworks
explode and fall and fade like tears
It's where I waited
it's where I waited

please don't say that something is wrong
I was at the party, you never came
please don't say that something is wrong
I was at the party, you never came
...
