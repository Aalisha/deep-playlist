Don't leave me this way by The Communards
Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without you love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
