I think you should leave him
The next time you see him
I can't let you get hurt again
And I don't want your reasons
I know what your feeling
But he'll let you down in the end

Cause if things were the way that you say
Then you wouldn't call me like everyday

Girl I know that your young 
And he seems like the one
But I think your just hurting yourself (yourself)
