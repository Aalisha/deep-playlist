Are you still into it? 'cause I'm still into it.
We haven't had sore bits for about a fortnight.
Am I your only one? 'Cause you're still my only one.
But if you need more, I'll just do it in some, right.

We should go into town and spend some money.
We could go to the pictures and see something funny.
We'd share a popcorn and we can go to the pub at night.
