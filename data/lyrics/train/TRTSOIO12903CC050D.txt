And I promise if you take me home,
I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone
Said come on baby, throw me a bone,
I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone

And I promise if you take me home,
I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone
Said come on baby, throw me a bone,
I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone

I'ma tell you something. about me, heheh
That's my favorite subject, I don't know if you picked up on that yet or not

I never said I had a business mind
I just don't believe that quitting time exists, ain't no finish line to this
You got to give me mine, I really shine, my given time is this
Live and die with the grind, driven by the fist
Where you do place my name if I never played your game?
We don't race the same, I don't run inside no painted lane
Plus ya'll pace is strange, ya'll need to stop and you sprint
Run when it's sunny and hide if it change to rain
I wouldn't be half the Ali that I am
if I slowed myself up and tried competing with these people, fam
I've every bit as unconcerned as they are unprepared
Market flooded, needless to say I wasn't scared
Let's all drop the same day, I don't fucking care
Put listening stations in the store and let the public hear
Better yet, let's have an in-store performance
Make it oranges to oranges, me dwarfin' your endurance
After that we'll shoot the shit with our supporters
and see how many more discs of yours the indie stores order
See you already know I out-rap 'em
On the low, we out-work, out-think, and out-class them

And I promise if you take me home,
