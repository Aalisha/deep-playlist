There are times
when the world feels like it's closing in on us.
There are times
when our doubt and fear can get the best of us.
It's not so surprising it feels like you're dying,
the moment when everything starts falling apart.
You don't realise it, but you can survive it,
the only thing you need to do is follow your heart.

Don't be afraid,
in the morning you will know
you won't feel this way for long.
I'm saying don't be afraid,
see how far that you've come,
you have only just begun to make it.

You will find there is more to you when you begin to try,
you will find that life's hardest parts become your favorite times.
Just keep your eyes set on the horizon,
even when everything is falling apart.
