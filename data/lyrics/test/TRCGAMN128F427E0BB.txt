You say you love me a little
You say you want to stay friends
You say you don't want no strings attached
No one on you to depend

You see love as a prison
I see love as a key
You think a little is more than enough
It's not that way for me

I need to be loved too much
I need to be held too tight
I need to hear someone say at the end of the day
I'll make everything right
When the rest of the world goes home
I need to feel someone's touch
