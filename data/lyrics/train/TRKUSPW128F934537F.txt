Ok here it comes it start from the begin and it takes you two to
yeking
For paranoia is all around you
like someone it 's watching u.
And it 's stil snowing through your blood vein.
Then you fall Down and pick yourself up;
and Say wich way am I going
So you take another step and another step
and it knocks all your feet again
And I'm Strung Out

{Chorus]
I'm so strung out And now I don't know what to do
Should I take my life away Dear God or will you pull me through
I'm so strung out Some how my life has gone astray
So I lay me down to sleep
Please Lord now take my soul away

[Rap 1]
Now I'm all alone
Sittin' in my room in a corner
Starrin' at the wall and I'm wishing I was on a
Mission but I'm fishin' in an empty bowl
Cocain got my brain And I'm sweatin' 'cause I'm ice cold
Hold - on for a minute what's that sound
Raise up to my feet
Paranoid lookin' all around
...
