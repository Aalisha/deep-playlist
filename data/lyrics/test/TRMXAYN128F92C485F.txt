(Brooks/Paul Kennerley)

When I close my eyes
I almost see
The way you look
When you were standing next to me
And I still feel you holdin' me tight
Oh I can hear the laughter
And all the words you whispered in the night

Picture this and paint it blue
A photograph of me and you
Smile has faded with the years
