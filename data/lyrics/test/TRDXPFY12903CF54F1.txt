Always remember empires never last
They always crumble and fall

A bully with a smile, transparently nice
Beware as she carries a big spoon and a long sharp knife

She'll diss you and stab you as soon as look at you
She'll point the finger and pull the trigger
For no good reason
And your only crime was to tell the truth

She don't like it, no she don't like it

Always remember empires never last
...
