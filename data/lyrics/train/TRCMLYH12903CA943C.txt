If I were him
I'd know your birthday
Just what to get
The colours you wear
We borrowed bikes
We'd ride on Sundays
You'd review the books I said

I know,
Takes 22 steps,
From the walk to your door
Takes 22 steps
'Cause I've tried it before
And one day I'll knock
But just not yet

If I were him
I'd buy the rain coat
The orange one
