Come on, try again, everyone!

The school hall's packed
and the place is full of beer
The voodoo boogie shakedown's on
and Totally Rad is here

So jump and pounce
and bounce around
grab hold of someone near
put your finger in your mouth and stick it in their ear

You like light
We like night
We play video game with the life
I'm down lets fuck with this dream team

Zap through the black
Like neon beam dream
Most hip-hoppers are like very dumb
Underground fan clubs
Don't like having fun

You secretly wanna sniff my smelly bum
Totally Rad come kill everyone
Snuff one, mothafucka
Two mothafucka, three

All miff off your spliff or your bong
cause you stay at your friends
but you live with your mom

You ill, with the skill
Hate grown ups
Still haven't worked out
...
