Now down the road just a mile or two
Lives a little girl named Pearly Blue
About so high and her hair is brown
The Prettiest thing boys in this town

Now anytime you want to know
Where I'm going, down the road
Get my girl on the line
You'll find me there most any old time

Now everyday and Sunday too
