Why are you listening to all the things they tell you everyday?
Why are you listening, what happened to your own mind anyway?
Why are you listening, to their advice on what to watch and do?
Why are you listening, has your mind been overrun - what do I do?

I don't know how they pulled you fast and buried all the trace of the past
I don't know how you left so fast - I really hope that this won't last

Oh Shelley
Oh Shelley
Oh Shelley
Oh Shelley listen to me
