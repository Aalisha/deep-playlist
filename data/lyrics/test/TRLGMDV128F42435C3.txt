If you want some lovin' baby
That I 'll give to you

If you want some huggin' baby
Oh I could hug some to

All I want baby
Is some touch from you

Just a little bit attention .yes
Is gonna see me through

'Cause you know you're my kind
And I want you, I want you to be mine

I idolize you
I idolize you baby

I want to make love to you
When the lights are low

Scream to you baby
...
