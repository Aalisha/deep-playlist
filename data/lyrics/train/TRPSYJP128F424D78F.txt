Someone said you was, runnin' 'round
Like you owned the world
It's no secret, you're the talk of the town
You know, the best of the girls

That's right, and now you
Walked right out of my heart
You know it's all over town
I said you walked walked, right right, out of my heart
You know it's all over town
Now it's all over

You're so neat, you're so cute, you're so fine
You know that everybody wants some action
They see you comin' and they act like it's cool
