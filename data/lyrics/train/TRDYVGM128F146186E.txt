She's a small town girl with no room to grow
and he's a reckless boy with no where to go
they're like birds in a cage with no place to fly
so he parks the car and she holds him tight

chorus
and they rage on some how searching for the answers
in the night like shadow dancers before their time is gone
they rage on

on the same dark night two more people meet
in a rented room on a cross town street
and she's lost her youth and he's lost his dreams
...
