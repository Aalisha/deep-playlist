Hum mmm oh, hum mm oh yehum

It's an illusion!

Once again my wings on fire
Flapping round your deadly flames
Walking on the old high wire
Trying to keep myself away
You come walking down your marble stairs
Throwing back your yellow hair
And I want you and I need you
But every time you let me near
You leave me feeling such sweet despair
'going to keep away, keep away

Chorus:
It's an illusion
To think I can keep away from you
