They tell me you walk on the water now
I know who showed you the stones
You pray that I banish my appetite and lie there alone

I hope that you've practiced your instrument
I fear it will take you away
You ain't the type to be traveling, so why not just stay

Here it is morning for some folks
and twilight for those of us left
who sleep while the soldiers get sunstroke
...
