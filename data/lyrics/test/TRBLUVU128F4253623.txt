Now the devil is old and diseased
In the very heart of each bone
All the sons have gone to their mothers
To learn the things that will count
Those who die may come back
"How you leave today" does not
And if you wanna get down below
Then you'll get down below
How I'd like to live in a city
That don't breed for spiritless dreams
But I'll stay awake and I'll pray
...
