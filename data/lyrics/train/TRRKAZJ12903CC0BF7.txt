Look - up on the building
See a silhouette
Crowd looks hungry
Because he ain't jumped yet.
Man up on the tower,
Looks big up there
He's got something extra
I wonder if he's scared

Come on, come on
Come on, Turn it on
Turn it on, come on
Power... (Power)
Power... (Power)
Power... (Power)
Power... (Power)

Is he turning on us?
Is he turning?
