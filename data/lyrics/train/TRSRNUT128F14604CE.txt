Just outside of delta country
Where the bitter weeds growin wild
Born seven miles outside of Woodland
Was a Chicasaw County child

An Poppa done brung us some peppermint candy
Momma fixed a custard pie
Bought her a store-bought doll from Jackson
She's 'a apple of everyone's eye

Chickasaw County child
Is gonna be ok
Chickasaw County child
You gonna be somebody someday
