Hello, I'm a Truck
G
You've heard songs about truck drivers
Em
many times their story's told
A
How they pulled out of Pittsburg
D
for six days on the road
G
'Bout that feather river canyon
Em
and a-climbing' that ol grapevine
A
That old roadhouse down in Texas
D
and the girls they left behind
G
You've heard their tales of daring
Em
and I think that's just fine
C
but if you could spare a minute
D G
well I'd like to tell you mine

Chorus:
G C G
There'd be no truck driver's if it wasn't

for us trucks
D G
no double-clutching gear jammin' coffee
...
