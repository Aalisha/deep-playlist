Pound for pound and cheek to cheek
Cheek paler than a lamp light
Take me down to light the box
And play super Scalextric

And turn this
Darkness
Into light
And I'll turn too bright
Forget all the hype

I'll need heart and I'll need courage
We all need...

Toe to toe, there's nowhere to go
So I'm tiptoeing around it
I held you down and I held my own
And now I feel like I'm floating

So turn to this
Head on
And keep on
Keeping on
...
