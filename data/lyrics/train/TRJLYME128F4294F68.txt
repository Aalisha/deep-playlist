Well I tried to find something
Something to hold on to
I thought it was you cause I'm sick and tired
Of trying to make something
Something out of nothing
I guess since you were bluffing
Now I think I'm losing my mind
The pain in my heart
Was it worth the price?
The pain in my heart
Was it worth the time I wasted on you?
You're giving me the top dollar blues
