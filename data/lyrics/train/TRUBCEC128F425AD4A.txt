There is one thing you have to know
Everybody wants to do it
We have a job to blow
'Cause everybody wants to do it
Everybody here we go
Things you won't hear on radio
And everybody wants to do it
This monkey crew just won't say no
And everybody wants to do it

Chorus:
Saturday - Saturday - Satur - Saturday
Satur - Saturday night is over
