Now, this tune should be easy for you to deal with
All you gotta do is remember back home
You know what I mean
When you was sitting out behind the house
Or practicing on your own guit feble

Tryin' to get things together
And you couldn't make up your mind
Kinda halfway knew what you wanted to do
But you didn't have it all together

But you did know you wanted to travel
(That's right)
Yeah, I remember those days real good
(I know)

Didn't have really many clothes
Didn't know nobody to call to sing for you
So you had to get out there in no time, you know
(So)

You don't make no tiffanies, you say
