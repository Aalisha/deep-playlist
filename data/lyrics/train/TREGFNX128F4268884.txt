(Chapter II - Forgotten ancestors)

Absent are the skies that tend the winds...
It overruns the enraged lands...
Surpassed beyond the life bonds...
Spitting forth Its blizzard of Wars

Of Wars... Of Wars... Of Wars...

One's belief and effort shall survive this...
Search the oldest form of wisdom that has been
inscribed...
By the Codex Life Itself...

One's bloom will succeed by the whirlpool of the
earth...
One's bloom will succeed by the whirlpool of the
earth...

Unique is the way that balances our key, to negate
the unliving...
Extraction... Exclaims the wrath of the Valley!

The geyser holes expulse their breaths...
...
