I saw the colossal landscape
Of which i never was a part
It was a magical day
Of which i'd never seen before

The first time i saw colossal girl
The first time i saw colossal girl

Such glowing mountains before us
Pillars of life all fade away
Of all the things i need to say girl
All of these words are in my way

The first time i saw colossal girl

Well she's running to the hills again
Can you tell me if she'll ever return
...
