[Big L]
Aiyyo spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Making quick money grip before your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightnin
You seen what happened in my last fight friend? Aight then
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah, cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomer-rangs
No matter how far I throw them, they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C.
I'm down with diggin in the crates
And I'm M.V.P. yeah!
