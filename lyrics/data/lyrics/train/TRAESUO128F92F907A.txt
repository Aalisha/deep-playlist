well he's the prince of the world his work is never complete
and though he promises all you'll lie a slave at his feet
don't you know the world is his dominion?
can't you see that you're bound in his chains?
the time is short so take your strength in what remains

he will fill up your ears and he'll dazzle your eyes
but don't believe what he's saying 'cause he's the father of lies
in your heart don't you know that he'll betray you?
in the end he will drag you away
till all the world is crying for the judgement day

and he's fallen how he's fallen
...
