(Kevin Wells/Andre Pessis)

We're all a mystery in this world in which we live
And there's no guarantee that we'll get back what we give
We take a chance on love a dream that lasts forever
We're only flesh and blood
Throwing coins in a wishing well

Only time will tell if a love is true
Only time will tell what a heart is gonna do
