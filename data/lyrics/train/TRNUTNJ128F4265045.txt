She doesn't feel like she fits in, in the small town she lives in
She doesn't think the same and they can tell she's different
No one knows her name
They don't talk to her, they pass right by, it makes her feel so invisible

She buries her head in books, tries to ignore all the dirty looks
She pretends she is some other person
She's got dreams
She wants to see the world someday if she can ever get out of this place

Wasted away, wasted away
She's wasted away
