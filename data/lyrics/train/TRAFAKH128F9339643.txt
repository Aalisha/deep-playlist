(WRITTEN BY STEVE AZAR)

IT WAS AT THE END OF INDIANOLA
WITH A NOD GOODBYE AND A GOOD TO KNOW YA’
AND WITH A PROMISE THAT I MADE
SWEARIN’ I’D BE BACK SOMEDAY
TO SAY I TOLD YA’
IT WAS AT THE END OF INDIANOLA

DREAMS WILL HAVE YOU CHASIN’ ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT’LL COST YA’
AND LOVE DON’T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THEY MEAN
THAT’S WHY I LOST YA’
