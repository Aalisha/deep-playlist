This one might not ever be a single
Just something on my heart I had to sing
I hope they play this on the radio
Give me a chance to let somebody know

That we can change the world
One boy, one girl
One person at a time
In time

Well, I know your station's got to pay the bills
And there's only some and there's lots to fill
But I'm just trying to bring what's something real
And if FM won't surely AM will play
