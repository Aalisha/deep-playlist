You used to say that I was special
everything was right
But now you think I'm wearing too much makeup
that my dress is too tight
Ya got no reasons to be jealous
I've never been untrue
So why does it really matter if they're lookin?
I'm only looking at you
You should never try to change me
I cant be nobody else and I like the way I am

What U see, is what U get
This is me hey you
