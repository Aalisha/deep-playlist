Goin' down to Rosie's
Gonna talk to Fanny May
I gotta tell her what I heard
Her boyfriend say

But don't you start me talkin'
I'll tell ev'rything I know
I'm breakin' this signifyin'
Because somebody's gotta go

Jackie's wife two dollars
Gonna get some '?'
Because she stepped out on the street, you know
Ol' George slaps her face
He knocks her down
And gonna blackeen her eye
So when she gets back home
Tells her husband a lie
