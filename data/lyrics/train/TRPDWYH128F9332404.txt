She got the type of love that entice a thug*
A tender mommy
But sometimes she like it rough
See shorty way of thinking is we might split up
So when she think it's getting cool then she spice it up
She get the fever give her chill bumps when I caress her
All night she never lets up I love it when she gets off
On a certain night again multiple pleasure
She love playing new games and love playing dress up
Role playing all day finding secluded spots
Sex in the city with views from the rooftop
Find a cool spot stop
Christening the new drop
