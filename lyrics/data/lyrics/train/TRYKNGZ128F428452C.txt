Like a movie scene
in the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
on my fingertips, have to say is even better.
Then I never thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life...

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms.
Waiting for tonight, oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long.
Waiting for tonight.

Tender words you say, take my breath away
...
