Counting on the words that just repeat
Hoping soon that it will feel complete
How can we believe in what we see?
How can we believe in what we read?
Always empty
(It’s loud, it’s loud)
Always not me
(It’s loud, it’s loud)
Always empty
Always not me
Moving through the motion step by step
(oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Keeping strong opinions and regret
