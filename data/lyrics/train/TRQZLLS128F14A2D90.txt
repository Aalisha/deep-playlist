I can't take this anymore
and I'm almost pretty sure
I've been here before
I can't take this any longer
I won't heal until I'm stronger
strong enough to not be afraid
of what anybody thinks
of what anybody says
about the way
about the way I am
I'll wait until the day
when those feelings fade away
then I'll make my break

I can't take this anymore
and I'm almost pretty sure
I've been here before
I can't take this any longer
I won't heal until I'm stronger
...
