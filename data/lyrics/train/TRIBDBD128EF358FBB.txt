We've been broken falling out again.
I'll hold my armor close right there next to you.
We will stand, holding ourselves, I need you here and I need your help

When I look around, there's no one beside me,
all I hear, is my breathing, from my chest,
I'm crawling around, searching... escaping... death...

I will not surrender
