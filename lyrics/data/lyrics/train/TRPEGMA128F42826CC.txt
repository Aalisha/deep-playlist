Eddie's Gun

Album Version:
Did you see the way she looked at me?
Honey bee got two lies and she's got me

I tried to love her back
And then I shrunk back into my wrap
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I'm not the only one

Yes I see the way she looked at me
Oh shes got an eye for an awkward guy like me

I tried to love her back (she's just a girl)
And then I shrunk back into my wrap (she's just a girl)
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I'm not the only one
And in the barrel of my gun
I hope I'm not the only one
