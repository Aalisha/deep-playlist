It's late at night, and I can't sleep
Missing you just runs too deep
Oh I can't breathe, thinking of your smile

Every kiss I can't forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God, I wish I could make you see

'Cause I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying

Baby you know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cause I ain't giving up on love
You know that maybe it's time for miracles
...
