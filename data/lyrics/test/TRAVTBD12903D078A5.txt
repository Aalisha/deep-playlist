Kiss me she said you're so dangerous
Don't pull me away, don't pull away
Kiss me she said to that girl again
You're dangerous so hazardous to me
Yeah! The Drama queen the cat walk
You're so obscene you're FABULOUS
It's you're life don't shout it up!

I am a Drug that you need
Shoot me up, shoot me up
