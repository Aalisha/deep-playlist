Was born alone, a bastard son unto the world
Given a family that called me their own
It gave me something
It gave me something called hope

Twenty years away, a life of opportunity
But emptiness eclipsed the man I should be
Inside was nothing,
I need something to fill the holes
And am I alone?

Fuck no, Are we alone?
Fuck no, Do we believe in you?
Fuck no, Are we below?
