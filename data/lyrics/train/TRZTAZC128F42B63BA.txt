Girl you know I got a thing for you
That's right, I'm talking to you, you sexy thing, so fascinating
Girl you know how much you want me to
Don't lie, that's why you call my phone in the early mornin'

Let me take you home tonight
Going in the candle light
Ooh In my room, its' me you need girl

If you're looking for a man to take care of you
Do the things that you want me to
I'm the right guy, ooh, I'm the right guy for you

If all you need's good company
Look no further come to me
I'm the right guy, ooh, I'm the right guy for you

Girl you know I got my eyes on you
That's right, I'm talking to you, it's a fantasy what you do to me
And girl you know I got to be with you
Since shivers is running down my spine when I think of how you could be mine

Let me take you home tonight
Going in the candle light
Ooh In my room, it's me you need girl
