Go on and treat me like a jerk
Well, when he comes to play
Girl, if I'm so bad
Why don't you go his way?

Aw, but there's nothin' like your lovin'
Can't wait to hear you say
There ain't no one can move me
In this whole world like you do

Baby, if I cause you pain
Why don't you go his way?

It's all right, if tonight should be the last
It's all right, you're already in my past
It's all right, go ahead and come home late now
It's all right, girl it's all right

Can't take it anymore
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, the way you mess around
