Victory by vehemence... the conquerd shall feel our steel
Implode the structures of religion
All faith in god collapses
Your shrine of gold has rusted away

Worthless to the masses... come and worship
The fading image through his merciless eyes
Watching as you waste away... inside your concrete tomb
Heaven denied as the flesh will now decay

Loyalty has turned to betrayal
Angels raped of duty
God is banished
For he is no longer in you

The infidel within me
Forever unbelieving
Purgate the stain of thy blessings
Obscure the light of eden

Bedarken the sight of paradise
Mourn the thought of hope departing
To walk the path of the righteous slave
Forever dragging the chains of torment
