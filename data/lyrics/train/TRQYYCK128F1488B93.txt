Boys like you were born to waste
You never listen to what I say
And if you think you're here to mess around
You're making a big mistake

'Cos you're gonna find out the hard wa
(You can take the hard way)
You can take the hard way
(You can take the hard way)

No matter what I do or say
You're much too dumb to educate
One day life's going to come around and
Slap you in the face

You can run back the hard way
