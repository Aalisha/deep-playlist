Pack up your freeins and hold your own there is a storm to come
Pack up your rockin' chair... (pack up your rockin' chair)
Wait for the river like some captive home in your mind
Baby go back where you come from
Sister, brother hope there's somethin' here to learn

All the money we been brewin' never havin' nothin' come true
Lay down the chosen share... (lay down the chosen share)
...
