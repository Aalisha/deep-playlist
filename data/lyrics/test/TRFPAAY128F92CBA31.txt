Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm?
For I've got my love to keep me warm
I can't remember a worse December
Just watch those icicles form
Oh, what do I care if icicles form?
Oh, I've got my love to keep me warm
