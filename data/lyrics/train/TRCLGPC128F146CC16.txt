I've been waiting,
Pacing along the halls ever since you left here...

I've been cleaning, scrubbing the plates and weeding out the garden dear

I can't fall asleep to your mystery
Slowly blowing from the shore
I have not failed to be what you'd expect of me
Swallowing glass just to stay pure

All the birds are heading down south
But you're staying up north you say
I've got jackets, blankets, and sheets
It's going to be a cold December
