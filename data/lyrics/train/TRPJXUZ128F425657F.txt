How do,
Shit, shit, shit
I will miss you
Will i see you
Down and done
Down and done
Down and done
Your new barg is dead
There is a town there
And now, come toghether
I got yo unify, to unify
I got to beat the batle
When i was down then long, long
I am not anymore
Have the body to hold
I will see a nother day
Is that a sin there that i love you
