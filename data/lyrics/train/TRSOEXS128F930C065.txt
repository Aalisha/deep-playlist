Soul Mate Number Nine,
 You say that I'm the only one,
 But I know it's just a lie.
 
 Soul Mate Number Nine,
 You're living in a fantasy,
 In your mind.
 
 You live in a made up world,
 You think that I don't see,
 It's a world of make believe.
 
 You spin a tangled web,
 Just like a fairy tail,
 It's all in your head.
 
 You promised me the world,
 You promise me the sun,
 You promise me heaven,
 That you're gonna turn it 'round.
 
 Soul Mate Number Nine,
...
