They will lock you up and throw away the key
where no one will ever find you.
You were sent to destroy the world,
you were meant to be the end 
of hope for all mankind.
I'd been wasting away.

I let you get away so cleanly,
without a trace, without a sound.
By now my hope for you has fleeted me.

They will dig a hole and bury you.
I wasted away so many days in hell, 
...
