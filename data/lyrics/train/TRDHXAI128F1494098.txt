I caught you romancing in another mans arms,
it hurt me so much,
my whole life fell apart,
how could this be,
your cheating on me,
at first i was sad,
but now i am glad.

You couldn't be the girl for me,
couldn't be the girl for me,
couldn't be the girl for me,
couldn't be the girl for me.

Love make you blind as a bat,
...
