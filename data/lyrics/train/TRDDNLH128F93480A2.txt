I keep drinkin' malted milk, try'n to drive my blues away
I keep drinkin' malted milk, try'n to drive my blues away
Honey, you just as welcome to my lovin', as the flower is in May

Malted milk, malted milk, keep on rushin' to my head
Malted milk, malted milk, keep on rushin' to my head
I got a funny, funny feelin' and I'm talkin' all out my head
