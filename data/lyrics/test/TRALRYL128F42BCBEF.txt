Please don't go
Please don't go

Don't you know that I love you so
Say you're mine
And give me tonight
Let's stay together

Please don't go
Please don't go

You're the only angel, I know
You were sent from heaven above
To love me forever

Don't go
Don't go

If you leave me, you'll let a good thing fall apart
If you deceive me, you'll leave a pain inside my heart
I really need you, just like the air I need to breathe
I'll stand beside you, I'll never leave

Please don't go
Please don't go
