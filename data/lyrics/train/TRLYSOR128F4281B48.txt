Your body may be gone, I'm gonna carry you in.
In my head, in my heart, in my soul.
And maybe we'll get lucky and we'll both live again.
Well I don't know. I don't know. I Don't think so.

Well that is that and this is this.
You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get.
You get away from me.
Collected my belongings and I left the jail.
Well thanks for the time, I had to think a spell.
I had to think awhile.

And the ocean breathes salty, won't you carry it in?
In your head, in your mouth, in your soul.
