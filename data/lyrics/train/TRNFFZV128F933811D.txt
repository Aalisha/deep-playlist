Ow, fine lady
Ow

I like the way she walks
I like the way she talks
she turns me on with a special concern
now I'm a different guy
and I don't compare to many
but next to her I'm plain ordinary
Not many can see the light blue aura
that surrounds the girl wherever in the world
she's a 9, a 10 a 25th
she's bittersweet and ...

and I like it
...
