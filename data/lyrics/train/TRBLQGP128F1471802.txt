I get the shivers when you talk to me,
But I like it,
It's so rediculous this fantasy,
So you fight it,
Forget the big romance,
Forget we had the chance,
You're gonna find me sitting out this dance,
Somebody better call an ambulance

Cause instead of you talking,
The shit you don't want it,
It's 3 in the morning,
Every day I know when,
But you're crazy in bed,
When you on me again,
And everyone's talking about you and me,
Can't you see?

Girl my imagination gets,
Better with every cigarette,
It's getting light outside,
So come and take a walk with me,
Girl my infatuation's got,
Desparate for this cigarette,
I'm getting butterflies,
So come and take a walk outside with me

They say it's all about the chemistry,
...
