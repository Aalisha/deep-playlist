Baby, I know it's late
But I just couldn't sleep
I got up to go for a drive
And I wound up on your street

I know that we said
We shouldn't do this anymore
Ah, but lonely is prone to forget
So, I'm standing at your door
Well, maybe it's not right
Maybe that don't matter tonight

How 'bout one more goodbye
Play with fire just one more time
Let it burn till the morning light
...
