Emotions inside us, troubling
The hatred inside us, escalating
The sickness inside us, keeps you weak
The masses inside of us
Suffering, they are bleeding

The calling inside us, sick with greed
The voices calling to us
Deafening, we're not listening

Cannot receive the obvious
Line up cattle and cut the neck
Swat at the flies omit disgust

The leaders inside us posturing
The pollution inside of us, suffocating me
The science inside us menacing
The will that's inside of us
It's dying, end is coming

Cannot receive the obvious
Line up cattle and cut the neck
