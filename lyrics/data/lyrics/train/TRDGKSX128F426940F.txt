Make me believe in you
Honestly, for real, one thing true
Take me in, in your arms
Wandering alone, seems so far

Let me know that you made it as far as forever, woah
Let me know that you hear when I cry if you can

You're far away from me
You're far away from me
You're far away from me
Come a little closer
Just a little, oh

Let me know heaven sees
Shines on life our memories
