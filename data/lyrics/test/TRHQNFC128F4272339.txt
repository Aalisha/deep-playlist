Well, the house is a rockin', don't bother knockin'
Yeah the house is a rockin', don't bother knockin'
Yeah the house is a rockin', don't bother, come on in

Kick off your shoes, start losin' the blues
This old house ain't got nothin' to lose
Seen it all for years, start spreadin' the news
We got room on the floor, come on baby, shake somethin' loose
