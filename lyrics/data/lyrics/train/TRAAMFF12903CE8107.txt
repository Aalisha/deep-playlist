I'm sitting here and I'm waiting patiently
For the clock to turn, it's not all that fast today
So, I'm on my own but I know I'm not alone
I'll be witnessing a happy ending

I'm sitting here in silence, I'm waiting here patiently
And I'm wondering if you're waiting too
I'm sitting here alone now and I'm waiting here on my own
I'm wondering if you're waiting for me too

I'm watching now and I'm seeing others as they pass me by
