High in the hills there's an angel and the ghost in chains
Here in your arms there's a desert where it always rains
As your legs begin to spread how I wish I was not dead
Standing backwards to the blood of man

Babies in jars, luxury cars, seasons that don't come true
Happiness waits outside the gates, watching each thing we do
Ocean mother, ocean child, are you mine or are you wild?
Are you calling for the blood of man?

I'll keep my dreams in the river tonight
Under the rocks and stones they will be alright
