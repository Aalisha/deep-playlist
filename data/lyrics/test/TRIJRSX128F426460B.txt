Yo peace and love, I wanna tell yall about the beautiful love experience (hope you have time, hope you don't mind)

To my cousin I'm hoping you can hear this rhyme
When I ride through the bricks yeah
I think about you all the time
That cold day I got that phone call
It plays back in my mind
I can still hear your mother cry

Well at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

And to my first girlfriend
I know you probably married now
Reminiscing on our prom date
The way I did you yo was kind of foul
But I guess I had to wise up
So now I know better now (but at least I can say)

But at least I can say I had my first experience of love through you

Like how it feels
When it comes
What its like
...
