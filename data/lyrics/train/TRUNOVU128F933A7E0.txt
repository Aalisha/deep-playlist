There are things that I've seen in my head while I'm sleeping in bed
They do not wither in the morning light
I'm taken back, oh I'm taken back to the dry grass and the shadows

Thinking I'd like to look at your teeth lined up in perfect rows
A maze of children feeding orchard trees
Where the flat lands stretch inside your mouth
...
