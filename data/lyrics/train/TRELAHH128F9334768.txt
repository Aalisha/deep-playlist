Some men get up every morning
And put on a pre-pressed suit
And in some stately office
Behind a desk they pay their dues

Some men make an honest buck
Some hustle kids out on the street
Some men only know the feel of earth
That gives beneath their feet
They only know the feel of earth
That gives beneath their feet

Land to land, Father to son
Soil or sand, pass it on
Trust to trust, gold to dust
Keep the faith till the battle's won
Pass it on, pass it on, pass it on

Fortune blesses us with virtue
But you must learn to use your will
Or they'll snatch it out from under you
The minute you stand still
...
