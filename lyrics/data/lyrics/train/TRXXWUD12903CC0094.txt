Put it all to music (X4)
Makes you feel exactly like
Makes you feel exactly like
Makes you feel exactly like
Don't it drive you crazy
I usually fall asleep on it and wake up to it
In the morning draw plans in the day up to it
And make it easy to cope and say just do it
Like all I hear is c-notes it's cake up music
Get your weight up work out and shape up to it
It make me hype for ladies like to shake butt to it
We crank up music just to make us lose it
(Don't it drive you crazy)
And nothing can match the brain rush you get
And save plush you flip when playing something to sick
You can bug to it or make love to it
Sometimes we break up to it just to make up to it
