I got a song been on my mind
and the tune can be sung, and the words all rhyme
deede-ee deet deet deet deet deet deet deedle dee dee
Though it don't say much, and it won't offend
if you sang it at school, they're liable to send you home
never knowin' what you're showin'
think you're growin' your own tea
good lord
Let me hear that, let me near that
crunchy granola suite
drop your shrink, and stop your drinkin'
crunchy granola's neat
...
