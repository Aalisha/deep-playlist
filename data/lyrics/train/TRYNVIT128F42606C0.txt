I could of sworn that I saw you knee bent on the bedside
Arms stretching like a kite
That time will eventually grow, I'm so sure of it

I've got a reason to long for songs
That tells why your legs and arms
Are actually able

'Cause I confide in wolves at night
Well, have you seen my baby girl?
She's lonely, yeah, oh, oh, oh

I've got to crucify myself if I am gonna believe you
