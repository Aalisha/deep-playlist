In the smoke of this evening - It's getting hard to see the clear,
Ch ch ch choked on this feeling - that someone's thieving my death stares,
Oh and I picked a listener - someone waiting with eager eyes,
Button lipped or hisser - someone always wants to steal the surprise

Tongues get quiet and tied today (Souls are fired to take away),
And souls get tired and dry today (Tongues get tired and break away),
My thoughts on trial but not displayed (Souls are fired to take away),
My arms are mine and I want to trade (Tongues get tired and break away)

We're getting on the list - they're finally on the way hide out,
...
