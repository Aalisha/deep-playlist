I saw you sliding out the bar
I saw you slipping out the back door, baby
Don't even try and find a line this time, it's fine
Darling, you're still divine

You don't love me at all, oh
But don't think that it bothers me at all
You're a bad-hearted boy-trap, baby doll
But you're so damn hot, yeah, you're so damn hot
...
Yeah, you're so damn hot, yeah, you're so damn hot

...
Oh
So now you're headed to your car
...
