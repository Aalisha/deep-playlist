Easy, back it up
Yeah yeah yeah the reel to reel
Easy, back it up
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie, Alamo
Easy, back it up

Kid Capri flippin' shit the way it's 'sposed to be
Easy, back it up
Back it up
And this how we gon' bump this off yo
Back it up, huh, easy back it up"

Hey! Kid Capri, here's the resume for the day
Check the prognosis, here's your daily dosage
Check the 411 on how we flip it
Grab a bag of boom, and a 40, and just sip it
Grand Puba, Kid Capri is on that new shit
In ninety-two aiyyo this is how we flip shit

Don't be alarmed if we start to drop a bomb
Drop a bomb
Drop a bomb like some shit in Vietnam
Prepare yourself, 'cause here we come, if you ready or not
Cold bouncin' in the joint, makin' hotties hot
Grand Puba comes to hit it on the right spot
Kid Capri, cashin' in on the jackpot

So here we go
Flip the show
Get the dough?
Get the dough?
Get the dough?
Yo, you know how that shit go

Back it up, huh, easy, back it up
Back it up, huh, easy, back it up
Back it up
Back it up, huh, easy back it up
