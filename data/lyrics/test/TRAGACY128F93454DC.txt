You need a little bit of poison
You need a little bit of poison
You need a little bit of poison
To keep you strong

First time is the hardest
Cut you like a knife
If it doesn't kill you
You get on with your life
Wind and rain and stormy weather
Love and pain just run together

You need a little bit of poison
