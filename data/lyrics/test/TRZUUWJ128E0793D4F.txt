I'm like a freight train, feeling no pain
I never turn back, one track, better step aside
Like a shotgun, I'm really someone
You'll feel my heatwave, won't save, anyone near to me

I'm steel, so come and try to bend me if you can, ha
I don't feel, before you know it it's over
Get out of my way
I'm street walking, street walking
Night stalking, I'm street walking

No reputation, you better quick run
...
