Goldie Loc, remember this last shit
All these bitches wanting their bills paid
And just calling niggaz scrubs and shit
Shit we need to slide over 99 before the R2G
You know we got to come back on these hoes my nigga... That's real
With the DPGC Dogghouse Style... Eastside up, check this out babe

[Hook]
When I wake up in the morning
You give me breakfast in my bed
And when I need a little loving
You know you're quick to give me head

[Goldie Loc]
I woke up, gave it a good stretch
Call my nigga so I can see what's next
Big movie racking Goldie Loc slack-a-lackin'
Bump head in the morning had a nigga crack-a-lackin
So I call my nigga Clean Right
I know he gon have some bomb hoes tonight
But I got to get this work done don't trip the Loc is all one
Watch me get this second? bread with my? on
