You can't blame it on anybody
Some things they don't last
You can't blame it on anybody
I thought I'd entertain you
Let me take you to the heart of the city
Let me misunderstand you

Fallin' down I couldn't notice
She had some glasses on
Few broken bones in the process
I try to keep my attitude

Words of love in broken English
They have a lonesome tone
Didn't understand must be Italian
Must be good looking undressed
