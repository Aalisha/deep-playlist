Just before I tell you standing in the rain
I would have loved you like no other babe
But a poet needs his pain
And sometimes life can be so cruel
It will pick you up and drop you down again

So if you try to love me darling please refrain
I'm still searching for the pieces
Someone else once took away
You know I used to love with all my heart
But how the times they can change.

Oh my babyâ€™s been calling and I want you to know
I'm not letting him down i'm just letting him go
