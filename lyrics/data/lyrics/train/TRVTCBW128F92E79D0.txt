As I have only my convictions I've made some mistakes
Trial and error is not an answer or even a break
So I cling to the only treasure I've pleasured to know
I can't believe
That these precious things are ever worth letting go
In my time, I've been blessed
With a powerful love very few ever get
It's a pain and a plea
To possess this desire which comes over me
So I fight while holding on for dear life
I'm holding on for dear life
Empty daybreaks have been replacing my generous nights
I lose sight of things we've created and have put them aside
To go forward with just one motion is all I can do
