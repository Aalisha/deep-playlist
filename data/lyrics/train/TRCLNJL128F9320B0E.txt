eyes burning from the sun shining bright
i hide from the light
choke down a smoke and wait for the night
hooray for all the progress we? e made
the hollow inventions and rigid conversations
and rules we? e obeyed
watch them fall, watch them all fade away

hooray for the gun, hooray for the chair
hooray for the prisons and poisonous air
maybe it matters and maybe it don?
i think it matters to me
