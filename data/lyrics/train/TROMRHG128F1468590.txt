Careful what you're wishing for
You just might get your heart's desire
Is what you want exactly what you need
I don't think so

'Cos you and I
We know what's going on
You and I
We got the viva las blues

Germ free attitudes in my food
Really make me horny
Looking out for God and money
That's evolution for you

You and I
We know what's going on
You won't see me cry
I'm gonna take you to the other side

For a little joy
A little joy
For a little joy
Want a little joy
Joy

Careful what you're living for
You just might set your house on fire
Is what you want exactly what you need?
I don't think so
