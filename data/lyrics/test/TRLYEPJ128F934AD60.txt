Johnny can you hear me
Turn that music down
Your making too much noise
I mean it, do it now
All that stuff is evil
Ozzy, Judas Priest
Theres backwards messages in that stuff
That lead you to the beast

Johnny can you hear me
Open up that door
I've been calling you for hours
I won't say it anymore
Just wait until your dad gets home
And sees what you have done
Kicked out of school, you've got no job
You useless deliquent scum

Oh my god it Johnny
Hanging by his neck
