Mamma, where's your pretty little girl tonight?
She's tryin' to run before she can walk, that's right
She's growin' up, she's got a young man waitin'
She's growin' up, she's got a young man waitin'

She's wide-eyed, she'll be streetwise
To the lies and the jive talk
But she'll find true love
And tenderness on the block, yeah

Now daddy, don't you ask her when she's comin' home
And when she's back, don't ask her where she's been, no, no
She's goin' out, she's got a young man waitin', yeah
She's goin' out, she's got a young man waitin', mmm, hmm

And she'll be okay, let her have her way
'Cause it's a long way, it's a long walk
But she'll find true love, oh
And tenderness on the block

[Incomprehensible], she's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
She's gonna find true love
And tenderness on the block, mmm, hey
...
