Everyday things change
And the world puts on a new face
Certain things rearrange
And this whole world seems like a new place

Oh yeah, secretly I've been trailin' you
Like a fox that prays on the rabbit
I had to get you and so I knew
I had to learn your ways and your habits

Ooooh, you were the catch that I was after
But I looked up, and I was in your arms
And I knew I had been captured
