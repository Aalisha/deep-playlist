You always got your hand in the candy jar, trying to sneak a piece or two
But even though you think nobody's watching, ev'rybody's watching you
I want some candy, give me some candy, I want some candy too
You're always taking but you're never giving, girls like having candy too

Your mamma never told you too much candy just might make you sick
You always want the best peace for yourself but this time you don't get to pick
I want some candy, give me some candy, I want some candy too
