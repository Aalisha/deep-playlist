The Honeycombs
Miscellaneous
Have I The Right?
Have I The Right?
The Honeycombs
Have I the right to hold you? You know I've always told you
That we must never ever part oh ooh ooh oh
Have I the right to kiss you? You know I'll always miss you
I've loved you from the very start
Come right back I just can't bear it
I've got this love and I long to share it
