I got a case of bad love
From a bad man
I need you to set me free
If you can

Well I'm a love doctor baby
Aint no heartache I cant cure
I said I'm a love doctor baby
Aint no heartache I can't cure
If your heart needs mendin' baby
I could fix it up for sure

Well I may not be a young man but I been all round the world
