Visions from above
Father's son on high
Sharing all his love
He's the one to make you fly

Christ the redeemer - an icon for mankind
Atop the corcovado mountain sky

Both his arms are open wide
Inviting you to see the light
open-heartedness - old virtues come alive

There is magic in the air
Enter on a higher sphere
Existential interlink between yourself and holy god
