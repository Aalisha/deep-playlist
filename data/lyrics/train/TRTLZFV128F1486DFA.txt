[Verse 1:]
Ooh, such a beautiful night
It's time to party... time to party
Put that dress on that you know I like
The one that fitted right... that fitted right

[Bridge:]
Let's go baby yeah (come on baby)
Come on baby (let's go baby)
The car is waitin' (the car is waitin', car is waitin', car is waitin')
It's you and me tonight, just put your glass with mine
Let's toast to love and reach the sky

[Chorus:]
