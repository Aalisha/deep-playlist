Dappled in blue like a midnight moon,
Over the mountain,
And God we would ride down the steepest side,
To the beat of a love drum,

Never knew what we got into,
always the running,
Now we find that there's all the signs, change is a coming,

Now it seems it was history,
thoughts from a past life,
Now it seems only memories,
life making fast time.

Come on along and it wont take long, those were the last words,
lay in the trees where you'll always be, over the pasture.

Never knew what we got into,
always the running,
Now we find that there's all the signs, change is a coming
...
