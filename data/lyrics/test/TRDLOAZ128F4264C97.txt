Shadows turn to shape
As another day slips away
Without a thought of you
I knew that this was to good to be true

I can't believe my eyes
At's been seven months and still you cry
The thought of me singing you to sleep

Time passes by and still we try
To rewrite the past and make our future plans
And if we'd only noticed that
Right nows the only time we have complete control
...
