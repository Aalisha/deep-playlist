This is a movement, a real movement, La Coka Nostra
You motherfuckers talk like you a movement
But none of you's are moving

I walk the hills, I had to climb with these legs of my own
My hard days and dark nights put my head in the zone
Hustled for blood money, left my wife pregnant at home
We're on the television, everyone's regularly stoned

I flash back to a 70's song in a [Incomprehensible]
Picture the future seeing everything gone
My wife is asking me, is anything wrong?
I tell her Erica, everything is, you better be strong

America, where I was born, city blocks are where I was raised
I seed from the land of the greed, home of the craze
I never burn them unafraid, I'm known to be brave
Till my bitch dig me a ditch and she stone me a grave

Seven weeks in utero, you grow and don't be a slave
Just build your hunger and your power from your loneliest days
There were many before me who molded me and showed me the way
But I'm my own man, there's nobody that told me to say what I say

Hate will fuel your rage, drugs will get you high
Money buys respect, love will get you by
Hate will fuel your rage, drugs will get you high
