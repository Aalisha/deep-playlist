Sweep over my soul
Sweep over my soul
Though the roving life get rough
Jah Jah sweep over my soul
Bingi vibes sweep over my soul
Sweep over my soul
Though the builderâ€™s roll tempers blow
(Sweep over my soul)
Jah Jah sweep over my soul

Every day every moment
I will sing a song of praise to HIM
Hail the king of kings (Hail the king of kings)
Every day I will rise, every morning I will sing
Every evening I will lift my voice
