I can feel a fire starting and I think it's lost control
I can feel her eyes burning through me
With a steady, steady hand she'll try to take it all

Take cover oh, take cover
I hold my head as I hit the floor
No wonder, doubt she'll go under
She'll stop at nothing just to say that she wants more

I'm over my head much more than I've been
And I can't let her in, she's more than I need
...
