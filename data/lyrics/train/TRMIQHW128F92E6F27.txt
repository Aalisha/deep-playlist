Oh, watching me hanging by a string this time
don't, easily, the climax of the perfect lie
Oh, watching me hanging by a string this time
Don't, easily, smile worth a hundred lies

If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first
So tell you something that I've found
That the worlds a better place when it's upside down, boy

If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first
So when you're playing with desire
Don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy
...
