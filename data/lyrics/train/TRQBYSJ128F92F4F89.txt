When I was a kid about half past three
My ma said "Daughter, come here to me"
Said things may come, and things may go
But this is one thing you ought to know...
Oh 't ain't what you do it's the way that you do it
'T ain't what you do it's the way that you do it
'T ain't what you do it's the way that you do it
That's what gets results
'T ain't what you do it's the time that you do it
'T ain't what you do it's the time that you do it
'T ain't what you do it's the time that you do it
That's what gets results
You can try hard
Don't mean a thing
...
