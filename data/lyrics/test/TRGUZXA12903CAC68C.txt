Promenade
---------

Lead me from tortured dreams
Childhood themes of nights alone,
Wipe away endless years,
childhood tears as dry as stone.

From seeds of confusion,
illusions darks blossoms have grown.
Even now in furrows of sorrow
the dance still is sung.

My life's course is guided
decided by limits drawn
on charts of my past days
and pathways since I was born.

The Sage
--------

I carry the dust of a journey
that cannot be shaken away
It lives deep within me
For I breathe it every day.
