I've got a message for you
But wonder what's the chance it ever gets through
You've got bad habits
As bad as your skin
Don't you suffer from the shape that I'm in

Well, I'm sure that it thrills you when you pull my strings like a puppet, but
I can think for myself and
I'm not so sure about you, but
Whatever, blah blah blah, I guess it's all the same to you

You spent a lifetime just calling on me
No guts, no hunger for originality
I'm something you only imagine to be
Your dirty shame has you to blame for your fucked up personality

Maybe I'm just very paranoid
