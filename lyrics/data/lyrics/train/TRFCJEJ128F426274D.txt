Where did it begin?
The skip in time, or the spark of sin.
Where corrupted minds were let to stand with
a head and tongue intact.

All I ask is how we carry on.
Tricked and blind, raped and robbed.
Shutting our mouths so not to speak,
and falling down to our knees.

All heads down to bow.
All heads down to bow to nothing
...
