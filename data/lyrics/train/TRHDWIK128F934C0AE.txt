Plundering SS-units
Prisoners rot in camps
The old and weak were shot
Defeatist got hanged
Nationwide extortion
No one can survive
A starving population
Miserably dies

Silently they disappeared
At night
Joined the other hungry
Wolves to fight
To slay and maim and kill
The fascist beast
The cutthroat invaders
...
