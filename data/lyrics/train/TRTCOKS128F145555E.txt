Now my name is Adrock I've got a story to tell
When I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
And when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well

Oh you didn't know I got the flow
I could sing, rap, dance in just one show
With the cornbread stuffin' with the Blimpie Bluffin
Mother fuckin' Yosi with the goddamn muffins
Hey could you please pass me the peas
And let me get a tissue if you think your're gonna sneeze
I'm the player and the coach I'm no roach
I bought my grandma a brand new broach

Well I'm MCA with a story to tell
