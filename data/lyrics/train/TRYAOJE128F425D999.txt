Guess who's back in town
Stompin' around in my old stompin' ground
Too much time away, I'm back to stay
But I ain't settlin' down

Tonight we'll burn it down
Let's tear the roof off of this place
Tell everyone you know
They'll see a lot more of my face

It's good to be here
Long time no see dear
But I had to give it a go
Took the show on the road
Doin' it everybody's way but my own

Good to be home
Been gone away too long
Stickin' to my guns, makin' a good run
Takin' the right track
Hey y'all, it's good to be back

Welcome everyone
