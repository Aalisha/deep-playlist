(Verse 1)
I try to make the best of a bad situation
Always gave too much; You never gave in return
Never could convince you to meet your obligations
Guess it took me walking out before you could learn

(Bridge 1)
Now you wonder why I've changed
And if any love remains
You try to make it right with all your hugs and kisses
But you just can't understand
A man needs more from his woman
It's not just money but the honey that is minning

(Chorus)
If you ask if I still love you
Then I'd have to say I do
If you ask why am I leaving
I'd say what am I supposed to do
