She wanna be a bad girl, She wanna be a bad girl
She running from her past life,
Looking for the spotlight
She wanna be a bad girl, She wanna be a bad girl
She's all up in the street light, looking for the spot light
(She wanna be)

Verse 1
I chase up she got me running every light
She see me coming got me swerving left and right
She in a tight spot checking all her blind spots
Cause I know you want me there when the lights out
She got the pedal to the floor in the rain
In and out of rain like its some kind of game
I'm thinking that I gotta speed up
Cause I know that she don't wanna slow down

Chorus
