One more margarita was one bad idea
Now you don't know where you left your car
And the rent's overdue, well, imagine that
And you think you might die from a broken heart
Well, you've told us all your life's a total wreck
Then you might not want to hear what's comin' next, 'cause

(CHORUS)
This is a honky tonk song
One of those get another beer, bend another ear
Somebody did somebody wrong songs
Between the pain and the pinin', cussin' and the cryin'
It might be ten minutes long
Hey, but that's okay
