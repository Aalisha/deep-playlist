Ooh baby i want you to listen to what i have to say
Baby, yeah
It's so easy for someone to tell you something bad about me,
Because that's what that's what your ears want to hear
Then for someone to tell you
That i'm being a good woman
And loving you, loving you only my dear
But i'm gonna do the very best i can
To get you to try and understand
That when you look for trouble
You're gonna find it somewhere
And what i want to say hey
Is that

You can't
You can't
You can't see
For looking hey hey hey hey
