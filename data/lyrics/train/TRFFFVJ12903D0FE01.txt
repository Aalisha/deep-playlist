[Chorus:]
Im talking about this ghetto girl (Ghetto girl)
No matta tek sey she simple
Not because she smile you see har dimple
You have this ghetto girl (Ghetto girl)
No badda check sey she soft,
Write down who dah tek har autograph
[Repeat]

[Verse 1:]
She only need a break life
So you can see what she can do
Shes conscious and polite and ambitious too
Yet she so decent, she so quiet
