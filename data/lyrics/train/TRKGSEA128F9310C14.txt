I'll watch you crumble, Like a very old wall (ooh)
And I'll see you stranded (yeah), You took me for a fool (ooh)
I'll have my revenge (ooh, oohm, yeah)
'Cause I owe you nothing, nothing at all
I owe you nothing, no, nothing at all
I owe you nothing, nothing, nothing at all
Nothing, nothing at all, all, no, no
I'll watch you suffer, With no feelings, No feelings at all (ooh)
And I'll see you desperate (yeah), You won't hear my call
