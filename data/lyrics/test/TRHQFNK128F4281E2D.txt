A single shot then silence springs
An alarm that blew my whole world apart
Infection spread like a hornet sting
The mark of Cain on a bullet

Shot through a poisoned heart
I could feel the taste of bile come up
Then drop like fire washed with gasoline
Too much just ain't enough when bloodied hands come clean
