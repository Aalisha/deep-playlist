So many rivers I've got to cross
There is so many rivers still left to cross
And I've got to get over â€” some way, somehow
I've got to get over

Jordan River's gonna roll
Roll River Jordan roll
Meet me at the bank of the beautiful river
Meet me at the bank of the beautiful river

There will be trial and tribulation along the way
And I'm makin' way for a better day
