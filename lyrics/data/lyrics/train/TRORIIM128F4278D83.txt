I stand in line
That kids not right
Some line of sight
Still got the hype

Hurricanes gone to school
la la la ooh la la la ooh la la la
Hurricane breaks the rules
la la la ooh la la la ooh la
Hurricane makes it good
la la la ooh la la la ooh la la la
Hurricane knew you would
Knew you would, yeah
Knew you would

I've got new shoes
Intelligence included
I fit right in
Still i somehow feel deluded

Hurricanes gone to school
