I'm sorry
For the times that I made you scream
For the times that I killed your dreams

For the times that I made your whole world rumble
For the times that I made you cry
For the times that I told you lies

For the times that I watched and let you stumble
It's too bad, but that's me
What goes around comes around, and you'll see

That I can carry the burden of pain
'Cause it ain't the first time that a man goes insane
And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life
