Rising from my deadly tomb I've got
maddened eyes with fright
fingers bleeding fast heart beating
the moons my only light
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If God won't have me, then the Devil must

we will raise the dead
we will raise the dead
we will raise the dead

stop at nothing raise the dead
Gaze across the blackened yard
...
