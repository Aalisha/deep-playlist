Step inside the Technicolor dream machine
And listen to the fury of a world you've never seen
Hellfire's all around in Sensurround sound
Once you get a taste of it, you're never coming down
Tune in, turn on
While you've still got a soul to sell
Tune in, turn on
We'll take you straight to Hell
Wrap yourself in psychotropic ecstasy
