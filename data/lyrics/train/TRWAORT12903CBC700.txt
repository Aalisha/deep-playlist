Ooohhhhhhhh
In the heart
Of the night
Where is dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor
Ohhhh Ohhhhh
I looked down
And my shirts turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice in my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Ohhhh
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it
Ohhhh
No I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
