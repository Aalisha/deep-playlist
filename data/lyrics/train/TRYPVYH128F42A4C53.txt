Leave your worries all behind
'Cause my love is calling you
The room is dark, nothin' to find
Can you hear my heartbeat screamin'?

Leave your bad thoughts all behind
'Cause my love is calling you
So close your eyes, follow the sound
Of my heartbeat that is screamin'

Leave your worries all behind
The room is dark, nothin' to find
