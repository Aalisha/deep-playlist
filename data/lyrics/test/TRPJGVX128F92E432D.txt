I will never get to touch you so I wrote this song instead
Thinking about you lying in bed, it's gonna get inside your head
And it's the best that I can do, this is the closest I could get
So let it penetrate your consciousness
Oh oh oh oh yes

Turn it up, turn me on, I'm feeling good but don't get me wrong
I know it's just a song
