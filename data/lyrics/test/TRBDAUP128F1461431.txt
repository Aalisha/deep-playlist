Hmm, oh yeah
It will never end, no
Never never end

You and I share a lifetime
Laughter, sunshine and rain
So secure
Yet sometimes with life comes change
Close my eyes
You'll be there and I know our love will never end
Hmm

Living alone can be lonely
Imagine living without you
By myself with no one and no place to run to
Once before, but never again
'Coz I know our love will never end

Even if you're far away, miles apart
...
