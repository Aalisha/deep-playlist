[] [Chaundon talking]:
Man, I never liked Monday. She was always too stressful for me. Tuesday was cute, Wednesday was the real freak. Hump day. Know what I'm sayin'? Keep in the Rolodex. Thursday, she was fine but I always wanted to jump off for Friday and Saturday. But God duced me to Sunday. And I knew Sunday was special.

[ One] [Keisha Shontelle]:
On Sundays
I always
Watched the ballgames
Or stayed all day
Ch-ch-chilling at the park with
A couple of my homies
Watchin' people walkin'
Everybody's talkin', laughin', runnin'
It's funny
Who you bump into when you take the long way
Everybody's hungry
Propane's got the grill smokin'
It feels like a 100
But it's okay
It's lovely (how we) that way (until) Sunday

[] [Keisha Shontelle]:
We at the car wash, trippin'
Got the chrome wheels, spinnin'
Lemonade, we sippin'
All the kids, skippin'
Granny is cookin'
Can't wait till Sunday
Parlay, all day
Sunday
