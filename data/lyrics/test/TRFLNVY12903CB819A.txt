You've heard a life of luxury is every girl's dream
Lookin' for a millionaire to build her self esteem
But my interest don't fall in monetary desires
Just a steady dose of passion baby's all I require

CHORUS:
Nothin' special
I'll take what you've got and be satisfied
Nothin' special
Don't claim to be greedy or dignified
