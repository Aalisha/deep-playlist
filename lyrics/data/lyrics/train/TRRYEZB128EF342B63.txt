Now my room has got two windows,
But the sunshine never comes thru
You know it's always dark and dreary,
Since I broke off, baby, with you

I live on Lonely Avenue
My little girl wouldn't say 'I do'
So I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
Yes I'll cry, I'll cry, I'll cry
(Someone hear me, Lord)
(Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm)
(Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm)

Now my covers, they feel like lead
And my pillow, it feels like stone
Well I've tossed and turned so every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on Lonely Avenue
My little girl wouldn't say 'I do'
