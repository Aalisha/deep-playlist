Whoa, I need a man to love me.
Don't you understand me, baby?
Why, I need a man to love.
I gotta find him, I gotta have him like the air I breathe.
One lovin' man to understand can't be too much to need.

You know it
Can't be now
Oh no
Can't be now
Oh no
Can't be now
Oh no
Can't be now
Oh no
Can't be now
Oh no
Can't be this loneliness
Baby, surrounding me.

No, no, know it just can't be
No it just can't be
There's got to be some kind of answer.
No it just can't be
And everywhere I look, there's none around
No it just can't be
Whoa, it can't be
No it just can't be, oh no!
Whoa, hear me now.
