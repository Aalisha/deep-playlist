I've been run down
And I've been lied to
And I don't know why,
I let that mean woman make me out a fool
She took all my money
Wrecked my new car
Now she's with one of my good time buddies
Drinkin' in some cross town bar

Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel
Oh like I've been tied
To the whipping post
Well tied to the whipping post
Oh tied to the whipping post
...
