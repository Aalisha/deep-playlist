You called me to tell me goodbye
I told you that I was some other guy
You said that you'd phone when he got home
You told me to tell him that you'd called
Now you don't have to tell me goodbye
You don't have to hear me cry
You don't have to tell me to go
'Cos baby
baby I know
The phone rang again for some time
I knew it was you on the line
