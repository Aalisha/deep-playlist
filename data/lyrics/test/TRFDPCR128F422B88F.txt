Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
Town to keep me movin'
Keep me groovin' with some energy.
Well, I talk about it, Talk about it

Talk about it, Talk about it
Talk about, Talk about
Talk about movin
Gotta move on.
Gotta move on.
Gotta move on.

Won't you take me to
Funkytown.
Won't you take me to

Funkytown.
