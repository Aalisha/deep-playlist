Well I know the world's turning over again
And I'll be there while everyone is out getting bent over this,
and of that; I can't believe that we still can't begin to control what we have
And I know that this is quite the sorriest state
We all feel it, we're coming out 'cause we can relate
Turn it up, play it loud, don't end the song
'till we're all involved is what it's all about

So come on and sing it just as loud as you can
...
