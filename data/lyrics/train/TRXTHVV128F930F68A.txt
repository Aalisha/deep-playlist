Ooh, ooh, oh, when I got the mood
Ooh, ooh, oh, when I got the mood
Ooh...
I've been searchin' so much baby
But nothing seems to show out fine
You came into my life for nowhere
Talkin' sweet it ain't no lie, no

When you drive me to the top
Boy you take my breath away
No complainin' for me no, while we waitin'
If you tell me once again, no, no
...
