All of the day, all of the night
You do the things that make me feel so right
My shining star, my guiding light (my shining light)
And that's the day and night, babe

I just ain't the same when you're away
You are my inspiration
I'm hanging on to every word you say
'cos you are my motivation
You make me feel so right
Every day and night

'cos the only time i think of you
Is every day and all night through
Whenever i breathe you're on my mind
Every day and night, babe
All of the day, all of the night
You do the things that make me feel so right
...
