Gonna find it hard to sleep through it all
This rain veil's gonna fall
Walk behind him, sweet duress
Try to conduct yourself

Behind royal walls, blacked out eyes
A solitary bird, high tension line
Dreaming of a pure white sky
Did somebody stop the time?

(Twisting in)
Twisting in, twisting out the knife
(Paying for)
Paying for your past crime
(She'll make)
She'll make a darling bride
Reached in, pulled out your life
