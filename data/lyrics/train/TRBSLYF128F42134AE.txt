We getting' ready, to start the set

It's clockwork, got work
Put it in like doctors with awkwardness
Mopped your whole flock up
And walked toward ya
Scattered all up on the chalkboard
Socrates self is thoughtless
From farmers to Metropolis
I get these process all twisted
Form mental visual optics
My job description rock wiz
Clock ticks
I'm toxic giving oxygen to the thoughtless
Intoxicant knocking the planet off it's axis
Like oxes chappin(?)
Boxing compin (?) it up out though
Peepin it loose
Seeped in to you
...
