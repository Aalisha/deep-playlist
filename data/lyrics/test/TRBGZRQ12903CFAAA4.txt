Let me be the one to walk with you when you want somebody to talk with you
Anything that makes you happy I wanna do oh darling let me be the one
Let me be the one who means the most the one you wanna love and call your own
And when you choose your partner I wanna be the choice oh please let me be the one
Let me be the one to sit with you
