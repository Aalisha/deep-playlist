Babies makin' babies-babies makin' babies-babies makin' babies
Babies makin' babies-oh yes slr- babies makin' babies
From the womb to the tomb
Babies makin' babies
What you say-babies makin' babies
After birth for what it's worth
Oh babies makin' babies

Babies makin' babies-babies makin' babies-babies makin' babies
Babies makin' babies-babies makin' babies-babies makin' babies
Twos and twos paying dues
