Long about an hour before sunrise
she drags his body down to the edge of the swollen river
wrapped in a red velvet curtain
stolen from the movie theater where she works.
Quiet as a whisper, under the stanchions of a washed-out bridge she cuts him loose...
and watches as the flood waters spin him around once, then carry him away.
Then she removes the golden ring upon her finger... and she throws it in.
And I wonder; Baby why don't you cry? Baby why don't you... Baby why don't you cry?
And I wonder; Baby why don't you cry? Baby why don't you... Baby why don't you cry?
