I still think about how it used to be
So entwined in my own lies
Surrounded by this make believe
I've been held by despondency
I should have known the road I chose
Would run out on me, oh no

I could've faded, been jaded
By every consequence
Every word that you hurdled
Was part of my defense
You can hurt me, desert me
It makes no difference
I give as good as I get

Like a weight falling from my shoulders
I'm not going to go that way again
(Never going back)
When everybody said that my days were over
Wouldn't get the time to comprehend
(You should've known that)

You should've known it would make me stronger
I was never gonna fade away
(Don't you know that)
I keep it coming, my destiny ain't running away from me
And it's all so bittersweet

In my life, I had no room for compromise
The things I've done have been
The ones I have had to leave behind
Look in my eyes, you barely recognize
The woman who depended on you
To sing a little praise or criticize, oh no
...
