Santa's got a brand new helper, you're the first one to be told.
He wears a hat that's trimmed with fur and his boots are made of gold.
His name is Christy Christmas, he's cute as he can be.
He's made of wood cause Santa carved him from a Christmas tree

Christy Christmas is loading Santa's sleigh
He'll hitch up all the reindeer and will soon be on their way
Christy Christmas is Santa's pride and joy
He picks out all the presents fro each little girl and boy
