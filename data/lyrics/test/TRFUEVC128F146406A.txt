Oh
Love's fever comin' on strong
I don't want the fire without the flame, no
Mother Nature gave me two hands to hold you
I'm not talkin' pressure or material gains

M-O-N-E-Y never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I'll never understand what peoples heads are in, oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
Just a little time

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
Just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do (Just a little love)
Just a little lovin', this will do (La-la-la-la)
Just a little lovin', this will do (L-O-V-E, love)
Just a little lovin', this will do

Love's karma, so glad you're mine
I don't want your rhythm without your rhyme, no
Easy feelings, ooh, your love keeps getting better
Say you'll leave me never and together we'll fly

'Cause M-O-N-E-Y never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feel it in my bones that you and I can win, oh
Ask me what I need
