You know my momma said
There's only two things in life that are constant
That's change and change

It feels like something's missing but I just don't know
It's like I'm not the same man that I was, no more
And all these crazy places that I usually know
Are just not as exciting as they were before

I think about you constantly, it surprises me how I've changed
My friends are coming down on me
Saying a playa never changes the game

Those fellows live in Never Never Land
Right next to Peter Pan 'cause nobody wants to grow old
Those fellows live in Never Never Land
They'll never understand what it's like to be in love

Never Never Land
Right next to Peter Pan 'cause nobody wants to grow old
Those fellows live in Never Never Land
They'll never understand what it's like to be in love
