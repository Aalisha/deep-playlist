At slow speed we all seem focused
In motion we seem wrong wrong
In summer we can taste the rain

I want you to be free
Don't worry about me
And just like the movies
We play out our last scene

Two can play at this game
We both want power
In winter we can taste the pain
In our short years
We come long way
To treat it bad and throw it
