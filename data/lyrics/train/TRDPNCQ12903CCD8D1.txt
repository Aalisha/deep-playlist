My inhibition
Your indifference
Are almost finished
I wait until the end

In the end you say nothing
Can't lend a hand
You must see me suffering
Or is the distance deeper than that?

Deeper than that
Is my love for you
Even if it never gets back to you

Back to the drawing board
Picture yourself in a new light
