Endless Sleep


The night was black, rain fallin' down
Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around
Traced her footsteps down to the shore
? fraid she's gone forever more
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say
? I took your baby from you away.?
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep
? Come join me, baby, in my endless sleep.?
