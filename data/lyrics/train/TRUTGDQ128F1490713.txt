Time after time, when I'm feelin low
Something inside of me, lets me know
It's alright, love's on my side
When the world, seems a lonely place
I've got a dream that won't leave a trace, of the blues
I just think of you, baby I know

I've got a real thing, here by my side
Someone who needs me, holding me tight
And these special feelings, won't ever fade
Cause I knew, I knew from the start
You put a move on my heart

Baby our love's, like a melody
Playing for us in the sweetest key
You could find, the music of life
And when we touch
There's the warmest glow
Heat in the passion that heaven knows, is a dream
Just for you, you and me
And baby I know
