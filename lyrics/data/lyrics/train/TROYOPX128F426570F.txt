Oh, oh, yeah

It's been almost a year since we first met
And that's the day that I'll never forget
Got me all caught up in your web
But I knew what was comin' next

'Cause you're the type of guy girls like to sweat
Just so they can see how far they'll get
Maybe, take a ride up in your 6
And where in that picture could I fit?

Ghetto love and heartbreak
Is always a mistake
Trust your heart to someone
When you think you're in love
'Cause you think you're in love

They gon' do their own thing
Ghetto thoughts, they don't change
So don't give your heart away
'Cause you think you're in love
When you think you're in love

As the days went on, I knew
That you were more than sexy, more than cute
Had a little look inside your eyes
That no girl could ever say no to

Much personality
A living game for every girl you see
Know just what to say and how to please
But there's no room there for me
