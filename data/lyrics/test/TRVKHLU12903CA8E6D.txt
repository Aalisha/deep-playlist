17 Cents is a whale of a lot
17 Cents is what I got
Grocery bills, heat and the rent
All i have left is 17 cents
19, 18, 17 cents, dirty old dime and a penny's bent
Ain't seen m'noth'in of my darlin since
Left me here with 17 cents.
Well down the road and around the bend
Lookin for gold the the rainbow end
over the field and under the fence.
pockets are lined with 17 cents
19, 18, 17 cents
Dirty old dime and the penny's bent
Ain't seen nothing of m'darlin' since
...
