You and I were cool
But every one that you pursue
Can see that I was dumb
And you would do me wrong

I was real depressed
And only you
And you addressed
And now the truth is I confess
That I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong

You pretend that you were caring
I believed that you were best
I was so misunderstanding
