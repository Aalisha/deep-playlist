Girl
You make me step my game up
Shit, 'cause women come, women go
Until we all mature, we ain't really tryin' to grow
With the girl we seein' we ain't really tryin' though
Try and beat it up fast on the livin' room flo'
Got a little older, had to spend a little dough
Kept somethin' in the pocket just in case I had to show
Shorties how I did it when I took 'em to the sto'
Took a few to the mo', lot'll vouch for that
Nigga bounce to the fact things I did was dumb
I account all of that to bein' young
Got a little age, got some understandin'
The older women get the more concerned with companionship
It took me a while to get to this point
I don't expect all of y'all to understand this shit
Read between the bass snares and kick
Everybody gettin' judged by who they standin' with, f'real
You make me step my game up, game up
