MOURNING INTO DANCING
(Psalm 30, 11-12)
He’s turned my mourning
Into dancing again
He’s lifted my sorrows
I can’t stay silent
I must sing
for His joy has come
(Repeat chorus)
Where there once
Was only hurt
He gave His healing hand
Where there once
Was only pain
He brought comfort
Like a friend
I feel the sweetness
