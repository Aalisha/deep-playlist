My boss is the bosses son
And that makes for a real long day
And when that day is finally done
I'm facin' forty-thousand cars on the interstate
Feelin' lower than a well digger's shoes
Knee deep in a mess of blues
But those blues just fade away when I hear my baby say,

It ain't nothin' a little bit of love won't fix
It ain't nothin' but a scratch a little bit of love can stitch
It ain't nothin' a little bit of love can't heal
Your love makes me feel,
No matter what (man I've been) these words are not correct
...
