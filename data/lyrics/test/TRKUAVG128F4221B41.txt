Somebody called and you’re the servant.
Somebody called though not your name.
The table’s turned now have you heard this,
You’re gonna be the receiving end…

Your legs are numb, but you’re still standing.
Your brain is dumb, but it’s still clear.
And if you’re tied up I’m still walking…
I’m really in though it’s too weird…
