There's an all night Chinese take-out
Where the diner used to be
And the bar we used to hang in
Was right across the street

Should have gone for something different
Should have tried for something new
But I always find a way out
Of what I talk myself into

And I haven't seen my friends
All summer long
No there's nothing much that I care to recall
...
