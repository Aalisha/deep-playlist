I lost at love before
Gave up and closed the door
But you said try just once more

I chose you for the one
Now I'm having so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

The others were untrue
But when it came to you
I'd spend my whole life with you
