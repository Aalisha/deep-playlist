It's getting close to sundown
Over the sierra
Stranded on the heatwave
Burning with desire

She was on the sidewalk
Looking for a nightlight
We talked about the real things
And drove into the fire

Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Are spilling with the rain

Candy apple red dress
Bleedin' when she kissed me
Heaven in a ragtop
Take away my, my pain

When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
(Joyride)
Move across the night
Like a separate wind
...
