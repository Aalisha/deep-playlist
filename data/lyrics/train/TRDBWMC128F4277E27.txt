And so now
Now that you realized that planets are spheres
With oil on the inside
And your god is only a catapult waiting for the right time to let you go
Into the unknown
Just to watch you hold your breath
Yeah and surrender your fortress
And your thoughts will tumble like rocks do
Over the valleys of factory oceans
The Turkish carpets are flapping as the wind
Drops you down to the surface
Yeah you're looking for the sweethearts

And you're, you're the kind to hide your eyes from the sun
And in your world, the strong survive
But I won't take my body down
