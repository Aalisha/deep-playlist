I woke her up cause I could barely sleep
At 2 A.M. and contemplating faith
I made my way right out her door
The street lights, shine bright
I run away while she sleeps through the night

Was it fate that brought us here?
My mistakes I made in fear
Is it too late to change my mind?
Who have I been?

Stepping back to where I used to be
Incomplete and helpless so it seems
The fog's like a wall and it's hard to see
It's feelings' meanings
...
