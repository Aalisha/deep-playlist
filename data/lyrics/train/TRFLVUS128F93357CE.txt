These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos

As soon as I love her it's been too long
Talks of future with you caves me in
Swallow my sugar kiss and eat it alone
Hearts collide and smash any dreams of love

These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos
These girls fall like dominos, dominos, dominos
