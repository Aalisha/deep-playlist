Maybe I'm the joker
Maybe I'm the fool in your eyes
Maybe I'm the weak one
Maybe I'm a lie in disguise
Maybe I'm angry
Cause I'm the one whose always wrong
Maybe I'm not the one whose so strong
But did you think about it
Did you pull it in and pull out
Could you live without me
Did you ever really have a doubt
But do you understand it baby
When you say it's over it's done
Maybe I'm not the one

So If you're gonna Leave
Yeah you better get going
Cause I ain't wasting no more time
What you did and what you didn't
...
