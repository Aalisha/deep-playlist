Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long

Before we knew we could, yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles

You can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
