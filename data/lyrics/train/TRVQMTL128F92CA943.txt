I'm a mean machine, I'm the kind you don't wanna meet
My middle name is trouble, I'm a danger in the street
My motor's in overdrive, I got my pedal to the floor
Never get enough, always comin' back for more - yeah yeah

Here I come, better step aside
Here I come, I'm comin' atcha live, comin' atcha live

I'm the one you want, I never give a warning twice
