I crashed into the jungle while trying to keep a date
With my little girl who was-a back in the States
I was stranded in the jungle afraid alone
Trying to figure a way to get a message back home
But how was I to know that the wreckage of my plane
Had been picked up and spotted, and my girl in Lover's Lane?

You know, your old-time lover hasn't got a chance
He's stranded in the jungle, as mad as he can be
So, come on pretty baby, just you and me

An' meanwhile, back in the jungle

The boys in the jungle had me on the run
When somethin' heavy hit me like an atomic bomb
When I woke up and my head started to clear
