WAR! War of the ages, warwind, ironwind, deathwind.
Blood that flows so fucking sweet, decapitation of human minds.
Blood of the ages, bloodwind, plaguewind, faminewind.
For Satan's glory we will fight.
Like a battlecry for victory, we'll scream forth.
The manifestation for eternal war.
The manifestation for the blood of man.
The manifestation for supremacy.
The manifestation for massive death.
