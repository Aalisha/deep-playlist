Take me 'round the city on the back of your bike
It's sunny out and we can do whatever we like
Spend a moment in the park watching folks get naked
Then hit the flea market just to find a dope record
I'll break it down for you, it's simple and plain
This is one of those days when all the stress and the strain
Has got to go out the door, down the drain, off your back
Take a journey, try to focus on the train, not the track

Now play it back
The day is at its peak, and at the market
The vendor's shouting "Get it while it's fresh!"
And we're a target
Get some carrots in a bunch and strawberries in a box
And top it off with ice cream and macadamia nuts
Seeing that we're lazy and it's hot
Let's find a shady spot
Pull out a picnic blanket and just drop
Now it's strictly forbidden
To make even the smallest move
Heat is rising from the concrete
But here all is cool

If the town is hot, and you've found the spot
...
