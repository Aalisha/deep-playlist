Break out the blindfolds
There's teens cloaked in sheepskin
And we are the wolves at bay

Put her to bed with the big ones and we? ll charge them at the door
The devil soon was a vagabond and we dressed him for the prom
And now the chorus sings filth hymns
As the next horseman will transform

Show me a swollen-headed hotshot son of a bitch
Who licks his lips caked with glory
And ghosts in fine suits will go dancing with contracts in their hands
...
