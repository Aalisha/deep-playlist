You better open the door
Before I take a hammer to the walls around it
I cannot let you inside my cell
For fear I'll sink the ship and drag us both down

Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in
Our hell ends every weekend
But it's all I have to believe in

Matt makes his murderous demand
Foreign films, I take a stand
And it's all uphill from here
At least I hope so

Kate claims she can't depend on me
For anything and I agree
It's crystal clear
