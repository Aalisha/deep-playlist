If I walk down this hallway
Tonight it's too quiet
So I pat through the dark
And call you on the phone
Push your old nummer
And let your house ring
Till I wake your ghost

Let him walk down your hallway
It's not this quiet
Slide down your receiver
Stand across the wire
Follow my number
Slide into my hand

It's the blaze across my nightgown
It's the phone's ring
...
