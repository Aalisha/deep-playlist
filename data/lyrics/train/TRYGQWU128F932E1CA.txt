I see you there, don't know where you come from
Unaware of a stare from someone
Don't appear to care that I saw you and I want you
What's your name, cause I have to know it
You let me in and begin to show it
We're terrified cause we're heading straight for it, might get it
You've been the song playing on the background
All along but you're turning up now
And everyone is rising to meet you, to greet you
Turn around and you're walking toward me
I'm breaking down and you're breathing slowly
You say the word and I will be your man, your man

Say when and my own two hands
Will comfort you tonight, tonight
Say when and my own two arms
Will carry you tonight, tonight
