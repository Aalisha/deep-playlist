Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Every time I think about the
Way you feel I get excited, so excited
The thought of you right next to me
There are no words that
Can describe it, can describe it

I can't hide this feeling I feel
When I'm close to you
When I'm close to you
When I'm close to you

Stop wasting time playing games
Girl, just give me all of you
Give me all of you
Right now, right this way

I just can't help
But you keep my eyes on you
Girl, I got to have it
I got to have it
I got to have it

Baby, I got to have it
Because I want
Your eyes are so sexy
Girl, you got to

Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me

Girl, the way you look
...
