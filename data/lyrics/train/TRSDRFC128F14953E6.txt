You know I chose her to be mine
Your one and only... that's what she told me
But there is something on my mind
You know it's how she...
Never looks at me

She is walking upside down
She holds a mirror
So the ceiling is her ground
Sees her reflection

While she's walking upside down
But never what surrounds
...
