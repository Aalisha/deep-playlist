OoohOooh
Oooh ooh ohh yeah
Ohh no
Yeah.

Shorty ain't got cable,
She don't even got a radio, way more than able.
What kinda girl should I take her for?
The perfect kind, just what I like,
exactly what I had in my mind, a dream...
She's a dream... yeah.

Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,
I'm first class every flight.
If she takes the time to open her eyes,
she can realize that she's a dream...
cause she knows me...

Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,
cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.
cause every time I take her out, we're always in the VIP.
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me...
That's why I make her say... Ooh
Make her say... Aaah
...
