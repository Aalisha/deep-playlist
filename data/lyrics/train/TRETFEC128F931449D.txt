In a daydream, I once had
You were standing, oh, so sad
But the way you smiled at me
Made me laugh so awkwardly

If you ever feel uptight
I'll make you wholesome and I'll make you right
And if you ever fall on your knees
Give me comfort in a bottle please
Give me comfort in a bottle please

Though I can't recall your name
I remember just the same
And you seem so far away
