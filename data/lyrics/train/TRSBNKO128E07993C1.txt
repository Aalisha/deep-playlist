See all the rain on the street
The way the cars shine
And the scotch that she drinks
With her lips so fine
And her shoulders go weak
As she closes her eyes
Oh my God, when she was mine

See how she moves through the door
How she loses her keys
How she loses her cool
Watching blackbirds scatter through the trees
How she flips from the back to the front
Reading magazines
Oh my God, I miss those things
