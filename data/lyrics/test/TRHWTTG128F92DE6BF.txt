Shining city on the plain
No more sorrow, no more pain
City of rescue, I don't know
Is that where all good people go?

If that's where all good people go

Nary there an honest face

The seer and the imbecile there in the garden meet
What comes about as they nut it out there in the bower seat
One of them picks the others brain, the other picks his feet
The city enters into night, the day is fleet

Well, I already know how to walk the line
