Starry days, sunny nights
All you do is, think about yourself
Walk around, head in hands
All you do is, think about yourself

Though you tried to rearrange
People in their place

All the things that you created
Were about yourself
All the lines you spent relating
Were about yourself

Hide behind those pretty eyes
...
