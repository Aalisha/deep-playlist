Beware, I'm here to despise your master
I am the human machine filled up with hate
You are crawling under his eyes
Your ignorance makes you suck his lies

I don't care if your god rejects me
I'm already failed in front of his eyes
I've lost my faith in religion,
in excuses and lies

I don't believe in those twisted tales
how Jesus is paying our sins with his blood
Amen! I owe you nothing
you sick, old and weak nazarene
