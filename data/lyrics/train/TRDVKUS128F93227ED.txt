Lover you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's your old friendship ring
I can't wear it no more
Here's your old love letters
I can't read them any more

Lover you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

Here's that old teddy bear
(Come and get 'em)
That you won from me at the state
Here's some old valentine cards
(Come and get 'em)
...
