Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
I'll tell you my story man, I wish I'd never been born
I'm loose at the seams, I've broken my dreams
And my hand, it shakes the pen
Come on, come on, now, baby, let the good times roll again, yeah

Where did our sweet love go, who stole away our time?
Why do the stars above refuse to shine?
The harder I try to paint a picture of the way it was back then
The more I miss the good times, baby, let it roll again
