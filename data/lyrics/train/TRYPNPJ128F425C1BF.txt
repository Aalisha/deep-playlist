Too good to last too long in love
Too pretty for a world like us to love
Too much like anything just out of reach

Does he act like me? Or does he even know
The things I did to you to win you over
Does he say the things that make you feel a special little gift?

To pretty for a world like us to love
Too much like anything just out of reach
Too much, you're too much like a special little gift

Does he stand a chance when you flash the eyes?
