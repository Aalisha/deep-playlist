Verse 1

I Woke This Mornin Soooo Happy
I can smell in the air
Of the sweet perfume you left in my room
You make me so happy yea yea
And you're gonna be my bride soon
You are my shining star
The one that's around when my world's coming down
When the rain wash away my cloud
All I gotta do is look Up high
There's my pink sky

Chourus
