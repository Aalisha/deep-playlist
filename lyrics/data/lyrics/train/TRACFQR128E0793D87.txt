What it's like to let the feeling flow
It shakes me cold
In the morning when you're feeling low
You're worth your weight in gold
I can see through
I can see right through you
What's it like to stop and just let go
No heart, no soul
I'm sinking deep I need to feel that glow
You're worth your weight in gold
I need to feel you
I need to feel right through you
Everything here is above board
