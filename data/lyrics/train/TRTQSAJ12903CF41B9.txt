Oh! Alive?!

Vivified by the reek of depravity
A cesspool of existence
Emotive, I'm a wreck!

Breathing through a Test Tube
- Only to realize
ed to Apparatus
- Drilled into my core
Horrible muted stench,
With rotting flesh
I am adorn

Alive?
Or subsequently a function to maintain
In this cesspool of existence
Creative, I am a wreck!
On the frontier of insanity
Awoken now clearly my eyes see red
The Chondrin Enigma... Unfolds
...
