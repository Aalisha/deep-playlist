Sky's on fire, It's blazing up into the sun
Shouting red on everyone, but you're blue
Oh, I, I? m better than I used to be
Finally got up off my knees, I can't save you

Don't let it bring you downstream
You're drinking all of that cold dark river, yeah
Oh, love come down on me
Tell my heart to set me free
Oh, love come down on me
