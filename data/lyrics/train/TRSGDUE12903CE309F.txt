Nobody ever thought I'd make it in this town
They all said I should leave my truck packed and turn right back around
They said I didn't have what it takes,
I needed money and a pretty face
But I just look at them and say:

[Chorus]
I use what I got
Take what I get
Give till I ain't got nothin' left
Then I give it some more
Keep on climbin up that mountain
...
