One love
One love
You're living in darkness
You've got to come to know the truth
You're living in darkness
You've got to come to see the light

Attention! Attention! My name is Albatjov
Mi come for tell you 'bout a thing called "One Love"
We have a lot of jealousy, so you see
Today's friends are tomorrow's enemy
A lot of them are sleep a mi say lot of them are work
Jah know Jah know Jah know you have to reap what you sow
We used to be friends but now we go apart
We used to be cool but now we don't talk
Ask me why boy, I don't know
Maybe's jealousy between me and you
Maybe it's my progress nor is it my dollarsis
I've always been thinking that you are the chosen one
But your attitude problems I can't explain
I keep wondering how you can go so far
One day you might end up being having no friends
Count me out 'cause Jah Jah says so

No more wicked people
What is left? One love
No more wicked people
What is left? One love
No more wicked people
What is left? One love
No more wicked people
What is left? One love
