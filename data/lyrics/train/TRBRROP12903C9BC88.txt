Fucking new romantics
it's only rock-n-roll
this is our religion as heaven we'll never know.
No, I'm not delivered.

Architects as militants, architects as crystal bones
metal hearts as oil cans, metal shoulders, knees and toes
in the spaces in our teeth lie the weapons of our youth
bring them down without a sound
bring them down and burn their towns.
