[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
Yea, ha ha
That nigga half dead in this motherfucker
Know what im saying, For the 1996 bitch
Way back in the day

[Lil' 1/2 Dead]
Way back in the day what I was told
Nigga every thing shining and just aint gold
Every thing I touched is just the gangsta shit
That's why I come with these cavi hit's
And H.D dogg will always stay an G
Coming from the Eastside of the L.B.C
Always watch my back and I handle my biz
And all yall sucka ass niggaz know what time it iz
You better watch your back and you better not trip
Because I always got my strap and my extra clip
H.D dogg always been an man
Every single day I smoke an fat ass sack
I like smoking weed and a gain of beer
I been doing this gangsta shit for an gain of years
I can I break it down in an gain of ways
