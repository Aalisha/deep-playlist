It doesnt matter who you are
Or what youre gonna be
People from all walks of life
You gotta have diversity
Were all in this together
And together we shall be
You gotta be a friendly neighbor
If youre gonna live next to me
Were all

Livin on the same side
Same side of town
Walkin down the same streets
