Give to the wind, your fear
Hope and be undismayed
God hears your sighs and counts your tears
God will lift up, God will lift up

Lift up your head
 (God will lift up your head)
He will lift your head
 (God will lift up your head)

God will lift up your head
 (God will lift up your head)
Lift up your head
 (God will lift up)
He will lift up, He'll lift up your head

Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command
Then shall we wandering on His way
Know how wise, how strong

How wise and how strong
 (God will lift up your head)
