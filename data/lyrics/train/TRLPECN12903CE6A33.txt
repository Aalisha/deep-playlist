Welcome to the night
And you will see you've got the magic power
I am on my way, I keep the key to your tower

You can serve me someting really hot
Call it love or madness
But you'll get the best of what I've got

Work your magic
I never wanna lose this feeling
I am able and I'm willing
Yes, I'm willing

Work your magic
You set my beating heart in motion
When you cast your loving potion
Loving potion

Work your magic
I never wanna lose this feeling
I am able and I'm willing
...
