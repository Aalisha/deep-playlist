Fire... Damage, who decides what is right

Crowded by all that is lost, it's hard to find positives
Taken by blunt ignorance I give you no forgiveness
Don't try to block out all the memories, it's the pain that binds us
All to this cause we unite to burn the cancer

Fire... Damage, who decides what is right

Battle rages day to day, fought by our sons and daughters
All support is fading, it raises speculation
It's not just one man, but a fungus that is slowly closing in on the world
