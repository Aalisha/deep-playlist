Watch out! 
He's always up to something
Cause he's so devious
And he's so cynical

And it makes me laugh
He's trying so hard to pretend
Acting oh so original
When he's simply following the trends

The book that you read, it is upside down
The book that you read, it is upside down
The book that you read, it is upside down
The book that you read, it is upside down

He's always saying that he's oh so right
And won't admit when he's wrong
