I see black, i see red
All the other shades are giving dead
Your pure crystal tempting sin
Can't you see that i am giving in, to you...

This is the state you left me breathing in
Struggling between this guilt and suffering

Come shake the leeches off me
And help me see through blood-shot eyes
Don't close the circle around me
For hallow, will be my name
