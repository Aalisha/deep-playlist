Yeah
G-U-Y 2-K-4, yeah
2 0 0 4

In the year 2004
(2 0 0 4)
Life will be like one big party
(2 0 0 4)
The sensation of cultural unity
 (2 0 0 4)
Hatin' is over and there's positivity
 (2 0 0 4)

This is a new world, some things haven't changed
 (2 0 0 4)
Yo, a party is a party, no matter what day
 (2 0 0 4)
There are angels laced in platinum robes
 (2 0 0 4)
And a Benz is still a Benz, wheels dipped in chrome
...
