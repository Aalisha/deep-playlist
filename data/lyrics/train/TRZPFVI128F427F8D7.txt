You think you haven't changed
You think I'm being sentimental
You've finally reached that age
Security is fundamental

You think you haven't changed
You think that you're just growing older
You wanted to be safe
But it turned you into someone colder

You're so busy these days
Rearranging your place
Can you still find some space for yourself
...
