If I could make it to my funeral, I'd scan the crowd for you
While all the speeches spill my life as suicide
I'd buy a ticket from the scalper just to show I hate the system
And you soon know I didn't really care at all

Now I'm alive

So you can watch me from the heavens as I rain down on your head
Tell me what you've always wanted and I'll give you love instead
And when I wake up from this dream, it's you that I'll regret
If I have to break a promise to you, I'll break my hand instead
