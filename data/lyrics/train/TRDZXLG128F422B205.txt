The patience of eternity
The greatest gift I could ever get
You give me life
And you take from your own
I could only wish
To be more like you
If you put your hand on my chest
You'll feel your soul
It's in my heartbeat and it drives me on
I know I'm not what you imagined me to be
I'm barely a fraction carved out of your heart

I'll make you proud
I'll stand my ground
I know I disappointed you
I'll make it right
...
