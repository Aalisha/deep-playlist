[Originally By Anti-Nowhere League]

For you... I shall give

We laugh.but no-one's laughing
We kiss.and no-one cares
So we shout.but no-one's listening
So we live.like no-one dares

For you
Well I'll be your soldier
For you
I'll bury friends
For you
Well I'll be your saviour
For you
I'll play and pretend

So we laugh.but no-one's laughing
...
