I've seen the girl who'll pick up where I leave off 
She's already smoothing her hands for the pictures 
I've seen her sorting through my memories 
What's sweet? What's bitter? 
She wants what I can't give her. 

I've seen the girl who'll chew up what I bite off 
She's devising a better mouth just to kiss you 
Any minute I'll have to surrender to her wishes 
What to take and what to set free? 
I wonder if she'll miss me. 

I've seen the girl who'll be brave when I run off 
She's been picking her fights like she knows how to win them 
I've seen her sorting through my memories 
What's sweet? What's bitter? 
...
