GREEN: Now I know to love you
FEMALE: Is not to know you
GREEN: Oh I got too near to you
Oh, in the court of contempt
I have to tell you
FEMALE: One thing I'm certain
GREEN: I've been overtaken, girl
Oh, by the need to be loved

We don't have forever
FEMALE: To find a reason
GREEN: How I lost the will to love you
Out in the way of the world
Maybe I could see you
FEMALE: When this is over
GREEN: Maybe when our hearts are healed
Oh what a day to behold

FEMALE: There'll be a day, lovers away
(You can) call me and mend a broken heart
There'll be a time long after mine
(He will) call you and mend a broken heart
