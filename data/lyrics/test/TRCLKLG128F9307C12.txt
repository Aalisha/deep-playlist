We're gonna break out the wine my dear
We're gonna break out the wine my dear
We're gonna break out the wine my dear, I know
'Cause there's a hangman there with all his charms
And he's waiting for me with open arms
We're gonna break out the wine when I get back to shore

And the sun's gonna shine, my dear
Oh yeah, the sun's gonna shine, my dear
Oh yeah, the sun's gonna shine, my dear I know
