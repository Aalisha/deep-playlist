Verse 1
Yet another early morning and you walking like its nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts ain't no coffee
see i know you seen me callin and callin
I should crack ya right in ya forehead

Pre-Chorus
Let me take a breathe (Let me take a breathe)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)
If you f'd up its over.
When its gone, its gone, its gone, its gone, its gone
You dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo do do doot baby

Chorus
Its a wrap for you baby (It's A Wrap)
Its a wrap for you boy (It's A Wrap)
Oh baby
