Stiff collar, corner locker
Left brain with a right wing influence

You were everything I dreamed
Wanna undo you at the seams
Fray those neatly sewn edges
Push your face down in the hedges

New car in the wrecking yard
Left stranded by a right wing incidence

You are everything I freed
Those chains are everything they need
Make peace with the challengings
You're gonna need â€˜em when the bell rings
