Here comes the cool air, the light chill of the fall
Blowing from either direction
Blowing across the yard it's crisp and it's cool
Dogs like it, as they sit around in the sun
And stubbornly i remain under a tree
The wind gusts up stronger from time to time
We're supposed to grow cold as the day wears on
I'm'a looking for the future, today, today, today, today

And at the same time i am dreading the outcome of our actions
Fall makes me feel a little sad sometimes
Whip out the sweater and the second layer and it's time for a change
And surely it's the way,
Oh boy, Oh shit!
