(Part I - Echoes On The Wind)

(Tom Englund:) It's the calm before the storm
It's the quiet before the war
It's the time when all will be decided
(Steve Lee:) All will be decided
(Tom Englund:) If nobody heeds the echoes on the wind

(Tom Englund:) It's the end of the chain
(Steve Lee:) Destruction of the fittest
(Tom Englund:) It's the end of our reign
(Steve Lee:) We've seen it all before
(Tom Englund:) It's the end of man's evolution
(Steve Lee:) The end of the evolution
(Tom Englund:) For nobody heeds the echoes on the wind

(Part II - Radioactive Grave)

(Hansi Kürsch:) Do you hear the sirens?
(Daniel Gildenlöw:) Do you see the burst?
(Steve Lee:) Do you feel the fire?
(Jonas Renkse:) All the world's a radioactive grave!
(Tom Englund:) I can hear them crying!
(Bob Catley:) I can see the fear!
(Jørn Lande:) I can feel them dying!
(Jonas Renkse And Floor Jansen:) Washed away by deadly gamma waves!
(Hansi Kürsch:) Do you hear them calling?
(Daniel Gildenlöw:) Do you see the hurt?
(Steve Lee:) Do you feel them failing?
(Jonas Renkse and Floor Jansen:) All the world's a blazing funeral pyre!
(Tom Englund:) I can hear the wailing!
(Bob Catley:) I can see the wrath!
(Jørn Lande:) I can feel them failing!
(Jonas Renkse And Floor Jansen:) Washed away by a scorching sea of fire!

(Hansi Kürsch:) Do you hear the sirens?
(Daniel Gildenlöw:) Do you see the burst?
(Steve Lee:) Do you feel the fire?
(Jonas Renkse And Floor Jansen:) All the world's a radioactive grave!
(Tom Englund:) I can hear them crying
(Bob Catley:) I can see the fear
(Jørn Lande:) I can see them dying
(Jonas Renkse And Floor Jansen:) Washed away by deadly gamma waves!

(Part III - 2085)

(Jonas Renkse:)
Silence so loud, not a soul... left alive
Darkness a shroud… 2085
