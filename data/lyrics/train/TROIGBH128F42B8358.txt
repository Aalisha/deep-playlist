Oh, Lord thank You, thank you baby
Oh, that's what I'm talking 'bout

Lovely as summertime always been a friend of mine
Slicker than banana peels
Cooler than a three pair of high heels
You'll always be the highlight of my life, yeah

Loved you like I loved my fellas on the block
More valuable than Coca-Cola stock, oh
If I had my way, this love will never stop
You're the only thing that matters
Oh since I lost my pops, girl you are

More than a girl, more than a friend
Someone I can depend on 'til the end
...
