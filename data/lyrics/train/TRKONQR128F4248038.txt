This is the sign
I use to wear
This is the line
It says I care
I found a reason
I found a tear
Last year
I am a boy
You want a man
I am indifferent
You want a plan
I'm getting out
I'm getting there
Next year

We are in love
We are at war
I feed myself
You feed the poor
I write the fiction
You write the lore
