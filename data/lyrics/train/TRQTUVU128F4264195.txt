Girl, you and I've been together
For as long as I can remember
We've come too far to throw it all away
But you tell me that you're leavin'
Oh, and I just can't believe it
You know, I'd do anything if only you would stay
So if you love me, then don't leave me
Don't throw it all away
Baby, I'm beggin' you, please

Don't walk away
Don't leave and break my heart
'Coz it hurts, because I love you
It's tearin' me apart
Never too late to say we're sorry
Try another way
Baby, I'm down on my knees
I need you baby
Don't walk away
...
