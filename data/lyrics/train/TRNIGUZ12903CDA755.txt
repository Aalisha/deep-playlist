Like the sun, your mood will rise
Open up your autumn eyes
It's up and down and around to you
It's up and down and around to you

Don't be shy to murder Jude
When it comes back, it will fall on you
There's something else that you cannot hide
Medical student, why?

Jape
I'm walkin' out soon
I'm walkin' out soon
