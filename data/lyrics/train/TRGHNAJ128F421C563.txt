You'll get accepted into yale
But they'll excuse you when you fail
You'll get a scholarship to brown
But that color brings you down
You'll go to colgate for a year
In the fresh air up there
You'll grow a habit hard to please
From a semester overseas

You're really not quite well
You know that
And everyone can tell
