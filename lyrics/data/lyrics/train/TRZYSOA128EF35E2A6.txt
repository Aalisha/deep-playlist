Want to, but I can't help it
I love the way it feels
This got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't

I got a problem and I (don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it; I'm
Taken by the thought of it

And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move, but I like it

So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
So, then it's all because of you (all because of you)
