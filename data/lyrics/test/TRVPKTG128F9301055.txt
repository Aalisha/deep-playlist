The music surrounds us
the lights all aglow,
it's our persuasion

The way that we're dancing
how can I resist so much temptation?

And can you imagine
the heaven I've dreamed about
Together we'll find that magical land of love
This sensual feeling
is more than just fantasy
It's everything paradise promised to be!
