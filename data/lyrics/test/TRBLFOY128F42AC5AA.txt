My grandma and your grandma
Were sittin' by the fire
My grandma told your grandma
"I'm gonna set your flag on fire"

Talk 'bout, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now
Iko iko un-day, hey, hey, hey
Jock-a-mo fee-na ai na-ne, jock-a-mo fee na-ne

Look at my king all dressed in red
Iko, iko, un-day
I betcha five dollars he'll kill you dead
Jock-a-mo fee na-ne
