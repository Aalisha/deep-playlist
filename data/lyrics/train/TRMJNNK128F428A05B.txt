You borrowed my favorite dress
I borrowed your best perfume
We're looking good, I guess
We've turned every head in the room
But the best thing I've ever seen,
Is looking at you
And girl, I'd give anything
To be in your shoes

'Cause I'd love to be out of your shoes tonight
To be the one turnin' him on
