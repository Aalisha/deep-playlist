Everything I have said to you 
You could not take away 
And everything I've done to you 
You let me seep beneath your skin 

But you try and you try to burn me 
Oh, let me black malice 
You'll see your darkness, rusted gun to your head 
Won't let you love again 

Time won't heal these wounds 
Won't love 
Yeah, I promised you I would not do it 
...
