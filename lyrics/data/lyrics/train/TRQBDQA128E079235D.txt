Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends

I seen ya, I seen ya
I seen ya 'round for a long long time
I really, I really
I really remember when you drank my wine

Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends

I seen ya, I seen ya
I seen ya walking down to China Town
I called ya, I called ya
I called ya but you did not look around, yeah, yeah
I paid my, I paid my
I paid my money to the welfare line
I seen ya, I seen ya
I seen ya standing in it everytime

Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends
Why can't we be friends

The color, the color
The color of your skin don't matter to me
As long as, as long as
As long as we can live in harmony, yeah, yeah
I kinda, I kinda
I kinda like to be the president
Then I could, then I could
Then I could show you how your money's spent
