The sky is falling
'Cause the cities are burning
And the high road to freedom
Is paved with poverty
All gods children are screaming
'Cause the angels are demons
And they stand just like statues
'Cause there ain't no liberty
Not for you and me
In your third world
In your third world
In your third world
Burn all the temples to the ground
Make sure there ain't no gods around
...
