Come on my friend and leave your caution to the wind
I know we used to keep that feeling out of sight
It's getting stronger, I feel it burning in my mind
Slowly teasing me it's growing deep inside

Come on and lay your tender lips down on my skin
Show me how sweet and easy it can be
And let us stick together and make it happen

I won't think it over again
Take you to the top
Tell me every hidden thought
Come on let me love you again
Do the best I can
