Signs, signs are lost
Signs disappeared
Turn invisible
Got no sign
Somebody got busted
Got a face of stone and a
Ghostwritten biography

Dogs started rushin' in
Hungry for some food
Dogs started twitching
And they're looking at you

It was light by five
Torn all apart
All in the name of democracy
He's hurt, he's dying
Claimed he was a terrorist
Claimed to avert a catastrophe

Someone should've told him
That the buck stops here
No one ever said
That he was involved with thieves
