Its a long, long ride to a better destination
Is it for real or is it just an imitation
Are we gonna carry on chipping
Away at this rock
There must b a better way of livin
Or maybe it's time to stop
Chorus

But the thought of u slippin
Through my fingers it hurts me so
Everythingâ€™s gonna b alright
If u just hold me
Promise that you'll never let go
(promise you'll never let go)
