Possession of the mind is a terrible thing
It's a transformation with an urge to kill
Not the body of a man from earth
Not the face of the one you love

'Cause well
I turned into a martian
Woah oh oh
I can't even recall my name
Woah oh oh
Sometimes I never hardly sleep at night
Woah oh oh
Well I turned into a martian today
