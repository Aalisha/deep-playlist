As woke up in a nightmare
I can't stop this noise
And the fear it is leaking
With the poison of joy
Reaping hell with my system
The memory of the high it stays
Will I remember this tomorrow
As my mind fades to grey?

Now you know I spent my life
Always searching for the blame
It isn't easy
I'm a prisoner of shame
