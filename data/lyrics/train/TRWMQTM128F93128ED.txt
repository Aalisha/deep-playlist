Where are those happy days?
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind
What ever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice
It used to be so good

So when you're near me
Darling can't you hear me?
S.O.S.
The love you gave me
Nothing else can save me
S.O.S.

When you're gone
How can I even try to go on?
When you're gone
