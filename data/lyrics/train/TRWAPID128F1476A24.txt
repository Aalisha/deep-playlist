How peaceful it feels
Oh, how it feels against my face
Oh, what a long haul

You brought me here for this
I see nothing but disaster
Now I? m taking you with me
Taking you with me

A transparent scenery
That comes as fast as it leaves

Now my eyes flash with white
It? s settling in with all the flickering
Here again and again
