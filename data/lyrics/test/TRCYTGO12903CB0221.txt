It's the kind of day that starts bad in the morning
When I wake up to the feeling that nothing is quite right
But circumstance it forces me to make a smile
And so I head off to my destination fuming all the while

Cause I burn, I'm burning so fast
Burning up from the inside
And hiding bad emotions fuels the fire
So I burn
Burn all day long and the pain, it just never subsides
So I'm left with but one desire that

Tomorrow will come cause today is
Too much to take and I know this
That without you I'll break and it's showing
Tomorrow please come or I'm going
...
