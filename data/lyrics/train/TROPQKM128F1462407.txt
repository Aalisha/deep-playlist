Back with all her might
She carries a burnin' torch inside
She holds it firm and tight
She punches out the clock
While it keeps punchin' out her life
She's a flamethrower, red-hot glower
Flamethrower at night
The things she wears at work
They hang off her kinda loose
Her blouse don't fit, the pants ain't right
She ain't no front page news
But when her work is done
And the daytime turns to night
The headlines flash in neon
That the girl has taken flight
Chairman of the board
Won't look her in the eye
The fire of her vision
...
