Something about a black man with a machine gun make you wish you said your prayers,

In Apache Pass, Prince Rupert, Injun Jack puts a gun to my head
He said ‘how do you like it now gentlemen? How’s your blue eyed boy Mr Dead?
It was Canada this time, the year was 1971
I was performing at the club Zanzibar
In the neon world of knives and guns

Oh excuse me if I’m boring you dear listener, accept my humble apology.
You may think I’m just a folk singer, no, I’m a master in the art of criminology.

When Picasso died, the Indians cried in a Prince George motel room.
We were drunker than a thousand white men playing lumber camp saloon.
It was Canada again, the year was 1973
