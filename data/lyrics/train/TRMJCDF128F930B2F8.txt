Willingly they barter progress for distraction 
Unified by their nebulous agenda 
That with no need for sight will outgrow it's eyes 
Over Time, growing obsolete 
Devolving at great speeds 
And becoming what it feared most 
Amorphous Black Energy 
Cattle 
Batteries 
A Wavelength lacking static 
Concepts are incomplete
