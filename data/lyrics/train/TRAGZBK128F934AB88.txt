As the madman we all know who writhed on a crucifix
I too have been sacrificed by death and her tricks
Pursue the grail to make a wish and drink from the goblet of gore

In my anger ten more pills shall I gather seven hills?
Lock the horns into place call upon the human race
And I would pray: bitch which art in heaven above hallowed be thy name
