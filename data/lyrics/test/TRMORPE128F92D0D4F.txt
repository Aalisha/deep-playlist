You're far away from me my love, and just as sure my,
my baby as there are stars above,
I wanna say, I wanna say, I wanna say some day we'll be together;
Yes we will, yes we will say some day we'll be together.
I know, I know, I know, I know,
Long time ago my, my sweet thing, I made a big mistake, honey.
I say, I said goodbye.
Oh, Oh baby ever ever, ever since that day now,
now all I, all I wanna do awh is cry, cry.
Oh hey, hey, hey
