I don't wanna hear your voice anymore
I don't want you around
I don't wanna see you sitting in my favourite armchair
I hope we'll never meet in town
(Relax...)

I don't wanna hear your voice anymore
I don't want you around
And I never wanna see you sitting in my favourite armchair
I hope we'll never meet in town
