A Soopafly/Daz production
Suckers!

(Daz)
How many real homeboys y'all got out there?
Can y'all count on one hand? I can
Straight up, Dogg Pound Gangstas
Funky fresh in the flesh
Yeah
That's what I'm talking about
Yo Kurupt, kick that!

(Kurupt)
I ain't shit with out my homeboys
Although at times it seems
Trying to make it to different stages, lights and dreams
Different mistakes that was made during the time of the struggle
Two pits unleashed, but held by one muzzle
It's complicated like a puzzle
Puzzle pieces and money double
? really in trouble
I'ma hit the spot and snatch all the knots and pots
Then get ghost by the most of y'all get? gostic?
Get the fuck out of here!
Ain't no body else I can call(who dat?)
Besides my motherfucking doggs
I ain't shit without my homeboyz

(Daz)
When there's trouble who the fuck can you rely on to die on
On sight, me and my niggas do it wrong or right
I ignite, the fire, marijuana get's me higher
Always drinking and smoking Philly's
Getting a nigga wild
Gettin paid, that's my only desire
Big Style, Lil' Floss, Tray Dee and me
K-U-R-U-P-T, Soopafly and Crooked Eye
Until then
I hope God don't pass me by
Every day I work harder to try
Never to fall
But I often rise!
