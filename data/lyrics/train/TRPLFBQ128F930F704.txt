Kids with broken hearts, kids with broken bones
Kids with kidney stones giving birth to bloody stereos
Systems are all dripping wet with the gristle piss and the swizzlesticks
Mary got a bloody nose from sniffing margarita mix

She licked her lower lip and then she kissed that Hallelujah chick
She came off kind of spicy but she tasted like those pickle chips
Thought she was a dancer but her steps they made the records skip
She came off kind of crunchy but she went down like a chicken strip

Dripping wet with the special sauce
She had a confident smile and a nervous cough
And we got off
