I once knew a guy obsessed with the afterlife
Oh, what a terrible day that was, he realized he'd wasted all his
Time was ticking by, and he'd been left behind
And as the clock tick-tocked, his heart did stop and everything he had was fucked

And we know not what we do (Can you hear them call?)
Will we ever make it through?
As they watch us fall from the sky to the ground to the sea
Woe is me, woe is me, no one will save you now
We can only look away (Away!)
We'll not be victims there'll be no victims of to speak
And only then will we be free
and up will rise the meek

And when we fall we will fall together
No one will catch us, so we'll catch ourselves
And where we roam, we will roam forever
