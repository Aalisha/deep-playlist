We are the talk of the town
No need for negligence
We move so slow as the surface surfaces into focus
We're reflecting onto your face
Into your face into focus
We're reflecting into your face
Onto my lense into focus
You come out pale you say you want it that way
Don't close your eyes or we have to take it again
