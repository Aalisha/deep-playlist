I've been looking for about an hour, for a place to drink
Trouble with this town, everyone's asleep
Me and my girlfriend, had another fight
Now she's gone and left me, in the middle of the night

It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night
It's OK, it's alright, baby's staying one more night

If I've been looking for about an hour, for a place to drink
If I had a number, I'd give her a ring
