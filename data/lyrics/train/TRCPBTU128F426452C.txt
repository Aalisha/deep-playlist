Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful hurt I feel inside

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Live through the loneliness
The endless emptiness
I go through

And when you lose a little sleep at night
Cause you ain't been treated right
Then you know heartaches are sad
Sitting by the telephone
