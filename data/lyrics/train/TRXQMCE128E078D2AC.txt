(Carole King)

When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothin', nothin' is goin' right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night.

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I? ll come runnin' to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you've got to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will,
You've got a friend.
