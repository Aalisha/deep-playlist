I'M GONNA MAKE YOU MINE
Lou Christie

I'll try every trick in the book
With every step that you take, everywhere that you look
Just look and you'll find
I'll try to get to your soul, I'll try to get to your mind

I'm gonna make you mine
I know I'll never give up, I'm at the end of my rope
From the morning till suppertime, you'll find
I'll be waiting in line, I'll be waiting in line

I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine
Make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
Baby, I'm gonna make you mine, I'm gonna make you mine
