Ain't no use to keep taking abuse
From a friend who isn't kind
A friend in need or a friend that you need
Who can help you through the troubled times

So reach on out and take a hold of my hand
And let me know that you're ready to go
There ain't no dues and you can leave your blues behind

And have a little peace, just a little peace of mind
Give me some peace, peace of mind

There comes a time when your friends go blind
And their words become diseased
They threaten your life with the blade of a knife
...
