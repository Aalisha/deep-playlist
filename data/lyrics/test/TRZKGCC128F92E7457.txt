there's a fork in the road
ain't seem to make up my mind
don't know which way to go
i am sure running out of time
i am all alone with my suitcase in my hand
can't find my ticket to the promise land
there's a fork in the road
can't seem to make up my mind

-instrumental-

well, this? frost? full of pumpkin
it's taking on a chill
