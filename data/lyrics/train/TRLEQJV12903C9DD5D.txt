Whoa, huh
Whoa, huh, hey
Whoa, huh
Whoa, huh, hey

Whoa, huh
Whoa, huh, hey
Whoa, huh (Whoa, huh)
Whoa, huh, hey

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun
Well, do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun, hey

Ain't that right, ain't that right, woo

Do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun
Come on, people, do your dance to the rhythm
On the floor we're just havin' fun, hey

Well, there's a message for your body in this song
Can't you feel it, it's tellin' you, "Let's get it on"
