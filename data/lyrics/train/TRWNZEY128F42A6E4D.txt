Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you

So all of a sudden I'm facing the raging river that passed me by
Do I turn around, do I turn my eye to the sun
In the apex of the high, high noon
I'm on a flatbed yellow pickup underneath the half moon
Cut me, cut me, cut me some slack, Jack
And jump on the back, if you can handle the candle
Then you can't handle the wax
Your just going to get sacked
It's as simple as that.

But before I know it I'm going down this little bitty river
In a boat a little bigger than a bath tub
My bones begin to shiver 'cause I'm aching to deliver
This water that I must give her, can I get some?

Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Yeah Yeah, I think I heard you
Oh Lord, I think I heard you
(I think I heard you, yeah)
