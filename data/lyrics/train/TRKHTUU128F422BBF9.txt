Running through, I'm running through, these lands spread far apart.
Is it love? Is it, is it love, when heroes risk it all?
Is it true? Is it really true, there's a doubt set in her heart?
This love, this burning love could make this hero fall.

And it's not enough, is it not enough (possibly),
When you're dying for your love, dying for your love (beautifully)?
And hoping is a crutch, hoping is a crutch (wait and we'll see).
But until then,

I will not give up I'll make it through tonight.
Will you stay strong? Stay with me through the fight?
If the will's strong. You can not lose sight of what we wanted to be.
But if you do, just know you've got me. You've got me.
