There comes a time
A time in everyones life
Where nothing seems to go your way
Where nothing seems to turn out right

There may come a time
You just can't seem to find your place
For every door you open
Seems like you get two slammed in your face

Thats when you need someone
Someone that you you can call when all your faith is gone
It feels like you can't go on
Let it be me
Let it be me
