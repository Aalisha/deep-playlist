Find yourself in a situation
Can't talk your way out of
Stimulate the conversation
How do you rise above
You try to tell some one
But you can't describe it

We'll start a demonstration
Or we'll create a scene
Make noise from our frustration
Newspapers, magazines
We'll turn them on their heads
You can't deny it

For once
We'll do what comes naturally
We'll approach it casually
With no apology

For once
...
