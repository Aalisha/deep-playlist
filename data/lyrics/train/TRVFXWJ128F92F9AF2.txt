Under the pillow
I bury my head and try to shut Chicago out
As it turns out, there's a whole other world of sounds
Of perfect fifths low skids and Arctic howls

All saying are you going through something?
Are you going through something?

Under the pillow a little room to breathe
The early morning light's a pale cranberry
I hear the, aaa-aah-aah, not-wow-wow
Of a siren faraway and closing steadily

Saying Are you going through something?
Are you going through something?
'Cause I am too

Under the pillow
I can hear you whisperin' are you
Going through something?

Well honey are you going through something?
Are you going through something?
Then I am too, then I am too, then I am too

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme an opportunity, gimme, gimme
Put me, put me, put me, put me, put me
In the saddle, I'll ride, you'll see

There's new work in the Day Room
I can't lounge on line, don't you laugh
I'd sell a giraffe and I'd give you half
Just to occupy my mind
