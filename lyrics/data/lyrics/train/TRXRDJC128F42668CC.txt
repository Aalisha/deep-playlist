Me and Jimmy Crowder and a single cigarette
Crouched down in a stall out in the barn
Three puffs later we were sick as we could get
Prayin' we'd get better before we got home

I knew the minute that she looked at me

Mama knows, Mama knows
Sometimes I think she's got a window to my soul
Mama knows, Mama knows
Even when I think it doesn't show
