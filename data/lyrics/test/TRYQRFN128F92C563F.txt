Right!
What's to say? Heard you got roughed up
Once again you get left behind
Check yourself, don't get it twisted
Write yourself a formal good-bye

Fuck yourself, don't get it talked up
Got no qualms with taking your life
Quick to judge, quick to get tossed up
Dig yourself a formal good-bye

Suffocate, you're nothing to no one
Suffocate, you're living a lie

Suffocate, now you get nothing
No one left to help for your life
Got no love, get no love for you
No respect for you or your kind
