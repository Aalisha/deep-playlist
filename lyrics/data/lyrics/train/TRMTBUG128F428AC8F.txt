[Verse 1]
What do you do
When you just don't understand
And what do you do
When you just cannot explain
And what do you do say
When you just don't have the answers
Through it all, keep on trusting God
What do you do
When words can't ease the pain
And what do you do when you wake up
And things are just the same
Seems like it just won't get any better
Through it all, keep on trusting God

[Chorus:]
Yet will, yet will,
Yet will I trust Him
Yet will, yet will,
Yet will I trust'
