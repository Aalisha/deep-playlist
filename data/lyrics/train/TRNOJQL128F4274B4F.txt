A charming melody coming out
from a golden cave
You shiny diamond in the sea
Swinging swimmers, of skin and scales,
The smell of eternity, the sound of atrocity...

Bootyshaking on the beach, hidding your leach
You Serve us everything you got:
Your stupid laughes, kinkiest smiles...
Enslaving the world on doggystyle.

My heart is breaking,
Your lips are moving,
Your ass is shaking,
My mind is changing.
Hypnotizing witch
Can't crush my will!
