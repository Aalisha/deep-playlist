If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't want it
If there's a remedy
I'll run from it, from it

Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you

I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
The sweetest hangover

Yeah, I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get over
...
