I refuse, I resist
I refuse, I resist
I refuse
I resist

Take me to the higher reality
Take me to the higher reality
Take me to the higher reality
Bring me to the higher reality

This hurt
Chaos
Anarchy

This hurt
Chaos
Anarchy

Chaos A.D.
Tanks on the streets
Confronting police
Bleeding the plebs
Raging crowd
Burning cars
Bloodshed starts
Who'll be alive?

Chaos A.D.
Army in siege
