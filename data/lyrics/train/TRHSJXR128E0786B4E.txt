You've gone the same
From day one
Don't think you'll ever change
I have to laugh
Every time you screw it up
Funny how I take the blame
Why is everything designed
To try and get a rise out of me?
Can't believe you never guessed
Only playing second best to ya
You oughta know I'm in control

I ain't gonna just roll over
You think that I'm here to please ya
But you don't even know, oh baby
I got you wrapped around my finger

You're so predictable
Don't open your mouth
