You are close to me but still I am left alone
This is my compulsive solicitude
Like a fading flower waiting for the rain to fall
I'm barely craving for salvation

Deep tears of tragedy
Show me the way
Deep tears of tragedy
The pain won't go away

I hear your heart, your soul
I sense the pain inside of you,
but still my mind feels no sympathy
The skies are clear
...
