I feel
The skies open wide
SEE YOUR BLUE EYES
When worlds collide
You're by my side
It's hard to lie
Sometimes
I've CRIED...
Wished it was me
WISHED IT WAS ME WHO DIED...

I can see you in the sunshine
I FEEL YOU WHERE I STAND
I can see you in the bright lights
I FELL YOU HOLD MY HAND
Let your light surround me
IN LOVING MEMORY
Let your love surround me
SHINE DOWN ON ME
SHINE ON ME
...
