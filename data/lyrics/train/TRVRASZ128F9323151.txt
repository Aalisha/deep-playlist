I don't believe that God is a man with white hair
Sitting in a big chair
Judging the world and its morals
Forgiving today so we can sin again tomorrow

But I believe I need something to look up to
I believe I wanna pray but don't know what to

I'm not a born again preacher
My soul's too far gone to be saved
The world is wild and at this stage
We need a hymn for a new age

Oh have you heard the news
Bible bashers where are the queues
A saint played a gig but he got crap reviews
The punters didn't like the product or the venue
