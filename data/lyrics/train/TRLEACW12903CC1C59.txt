In the sunlight
In the starlight I'll search for you
On the highways
In the skyways
On the byways I'll search for you And when I find you
Just like in my dreams
I'm gonna love you
Out in the moonbeams
And even if it takes
A month or a year
I'm gonna make you
All mine my dear In the moonlight
In the sunlight
In the starlight I'll search for you
...
