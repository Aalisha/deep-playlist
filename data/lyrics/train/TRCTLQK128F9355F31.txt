Let me get them
Ohh's them Ahh's [x4]
Let me get them
Ohh's them Ahh's [x3]
Then we wake up in the morning we can do it again.

[Verse 1:]
Lights out... you bout to get it
Salute me... I'm your lieutenant
Baby girl you better stop making this here an obstacle
Cause I got the artilery I'll just lock and load
Look at them lips... I gotta kiss'em
You blow kush... come hit the swisher
Cause I'm gonna take you higher then mars and jupiter
Then we'll make love in the clouds and fall right down to the earth

[Chorus:]
Then we'll make raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops... fallin on our heads
Raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops
Let me get them
Ohh's them Ahh's [x4]
Let me get them
Ohh's them Ahh's [x3]
...
