You can cry but no one hears you screaming,
You cry but none will comprehend.
Maltreat, coerce with fatal intent,
Venomous incisions beyond this mortal gaze.
Asphyxiate, positioned to snuff you out, were falling.
Tidal waves roll back and forth until they cover this world entirely.
They will devour each and every living thing,
Especially those weak enough to be left behind/are you weak enough to be,
Blackness darkening the land Chaotic symbols of once peaceful culture.
