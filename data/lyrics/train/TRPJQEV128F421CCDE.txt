Roger Creager, Radney Foster

 

There's a warm breeze blowing from the South 
so I need to get going. 
The palm trees and the beaches call my name. 
There's a bar that I know well there. 
You can drink and breathe in the sea air, 
lay in the sun and dance in the rain. 
The kind of place where everyone knows your name.
