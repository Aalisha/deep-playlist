Red and blue make purple
and purple without red is how i feel
blue is how i feel
running faster chasin' after something
that was never there takes gumption
is how i feel
You wanna know how I feel

Well, I feel like a naked albino
and I'm dancin' in the sun
You are my number one
My one and only one

Two strong arms to wrap around I got 'em
...
