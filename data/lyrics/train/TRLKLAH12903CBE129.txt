Who what, The Black nation

Ohh woh woh, oh woh woh
From di day mi born mi did dun know sey
My color a di first, I nuh last
So how yuh expect I fi duh certain things
Ohh woh woh, Oh woh woh

Chorus
Black woman and child, yeh yeh yeah
For you I really have so much love
Dollar bills and coins will fade away
They could never make I so proud
Black woman and child, yeh yeh yeah
For you I really have so much love
