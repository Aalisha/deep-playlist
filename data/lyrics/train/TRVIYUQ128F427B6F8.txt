Super summer, sugar coppin'
In the mornin'
Do your shoppin' baby, oh
I love my love thing
Super ride inside my lovething

You may disappear
But you'll be back, I swear

Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby, now
Would you love to love me baby?
I would love to love you baby, now baby now
No, no it's not pain

Super summer, sugar croppin'
In the mornin'
...
