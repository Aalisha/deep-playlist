Well let me tell you darlin' I've been high most of my life, 
And a dream is just a wish that a heart makes, 
I used to sell ya, sell ya, sell ya,
Only things you could find in a drug store. 
People used to tell me, tell me, tell me, 
Just what kinda high they were lookin' for. 
Take a ride on a purple airplane, 
Honey I don't know when I'll be back again.

Cause I got broken bones, 
Not from the sticks and stones 
But from the names that you call me. 
I got broken bones, 
Not from the sticks and stones 
But from the names that you call me.

Hey you got the picture do you know what I mean,
