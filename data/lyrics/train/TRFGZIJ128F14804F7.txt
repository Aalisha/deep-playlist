She's used to stare at an empty spot
'Cause that's the only place
Where everything's how it should be
There's no evil to be seen

In the evening, in the light of the streetlamps
The soldiers take off their helmets
And start to dance
And everything's fine
There's no evil to be seen

And everything's quiet
And everything's silent
And everything's perfect
Everything's fine

Never did I close my eyes, she says
Never did I lose my sunsets
But the melody of purple light
Is the only thing I was to find
