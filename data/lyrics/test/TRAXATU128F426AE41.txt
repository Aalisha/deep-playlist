[(J Christie)]

Fifteen hundred miles is a long, long way
And I wish that I could be with you especially today
Standing right beside me is a man with a gun
And he's waiting for the chance to shoot me down if I should run
'Cos I'm on the inside looking out
And don't you know there's nothing I can do

Chorus
