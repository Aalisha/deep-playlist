God knows I've tried to bridge the gap,
I've tried to be me and time after time I've lied,
Just to say the things you wanted to hear,
Look, look what I've done, look what I do,
I'm starting to pull myself through.

Hell could feasibly freeze,
But in your eyes I'll always be,
The fountainhead,
The boy whose thoughts keep running away,
And you know I'm right.
