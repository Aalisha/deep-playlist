The mirror watches
He's hiding
Yet knows he's everywhere
A swarm of faithful flies
That unconditionally love Him
Like a festering fruit
He creates the void in his eyes
Paints Himself by shades of red
With drops of absinthe
And laudanum
In that wretched Sundays
That fast become violet then black
...
