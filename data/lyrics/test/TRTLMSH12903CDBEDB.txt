Days bunch up in weeks, collaborate in months against me
The sheets are stained with evidence
That our remains are now, drifting away

I share with complete strangers my most personal of pleasures
I scribble tidbits of useless mind info trash, treasure
Spend hours, at my leisure, like sharpened precise tweezers

Shifting through in the frame by frame
I walk the same path, I'll say the same lines
I do this every time, do this every time

Shifting through in the frame by frame
I walk the same path, I'll say the same lines
I do this, I do this
