We tried and we tried, but it's over
Guess I didn't fit the image in your mind
Now you tell me to find another lover
Oh, but baby, aren't you gettin' out of line

Don't tell me what to do
You've already said we are through
I'm a page that you have turned
I'm no longer your concern
So, don't tell me what to do
...
