Gotta get some inspiration
Believe me, release me
And I don´t mean no conversation
So reach me, retrieve me

I want somebody to set my soul on fire
So give me someone who´ll love me down
I need someone divine

[Chorus:]
Send me an angel
Tonight, tonight
Alright
Send me an angel
Tonight, tonight
Alright
