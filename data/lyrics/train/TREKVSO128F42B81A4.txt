I've done my girl so wrong and I don't know what I was thinking
now she's gone cause she was fed up with me
(this is a portrait of a woman)
then why do we treat women so cold when we come from one
because you wouldn't do your mother wrong
(this is a portrait of a woman)
and to the women out there struggling taking care of your kids alone
just hold on you deserve a life of love
(this is a portrait of a woman)
said a portrait of a woman your so beautiful la la la la la laa ooh yeah
(this is a portrait of a woman)

this is the portrait of a woman, of a woman yeah yeah yeah ooh mmm yea
(this is a portrait of a woman)
