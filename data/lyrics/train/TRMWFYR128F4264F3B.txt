(J. Jett/R. Byrd/R. Browde)

All I hear is what you're worth
With all those things you had before
All I see is what you are
With all your talks you got you for
Take your time to face the truth
You got no class you got no couth

(What is it that you're trying to prove)
(Can you tell me)
Yeah can you back it up
Who're you trying to fool
