A woman is a mystery
A man just can't understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand

An' other times you gotta take it slow
An' hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways

Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
Ya lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need-you eyes

Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
