Hearts and flowers, forget love letters
pain and anger, forget forgiveness
love ain't waiting for a guy like me

Debutants and champaign, diamonds and cocaine
I ain't the son of outrageous fortune
cash ain't status for a guy like me

Put me on a cool river
take my worries from me
fly me high on a big blue sky
well, there's no one here but me, just me

Long black limousine, pictures in magazines
all night parties, beautiful people
...
