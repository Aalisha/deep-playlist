I believe that love is that for giving
I believe there's love enough to share
There's no need for sadness while we're living
There's a need to love and need to care

We believe that love is there for giving
We believe there's love enough to share
There's no need for sadness while we're living
There's a need to love and need to care

Give your heart away to some-one else
And make a friend, you know you can
(You know that you can do it)
Just in giving love away
...
