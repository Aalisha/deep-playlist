How does it feel to be alone?
(I see inside your eyes)
You wanna be here with me and my own
(See inside your eyes)
It's cause a lie, the truth, that's fine, we never know
The truth is what I'm after
And I know the sign I'm searching for won't show
And I sing about what I dream about
And my dream's loving you tonight
And I have no doubt the words that I shout
And scream so loudly late at night

CHORUS:
When I don't take what I can handle
Know I think that you'll be fine
I've never met another lover who would love me the way that you did
Baby girl, you're different X2
