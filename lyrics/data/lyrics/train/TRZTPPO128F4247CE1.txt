Fortunes
Miscellaneous
You've Got Your Troubles
I see that worried look upon your face
You've got your troubles, I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place
You've got your troubles, I've got mine

I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away

Now just like you I sit and wonder why
