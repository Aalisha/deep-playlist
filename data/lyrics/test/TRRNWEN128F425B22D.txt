Sweet Jesus I swear that I love you, no matter what the chariot says.
I'm biased and by this I'll judge you on weakness wrapped up in my own innocence
And I think that's fine.

My God you look so much different. From mirrors you looked like fool.
And your skin taste much better with aging not sweet like it was back in our Sunday school.

Just wait, don't go. We're gonna see if this bad boy can fly
