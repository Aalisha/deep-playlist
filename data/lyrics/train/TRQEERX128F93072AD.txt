Can you remember
How you use to jab your fingers into my chest
And tell me how stupid you thought I was
And how I'd grow up to be worthless?

I was only 9 and I can recall every single time
You raised your hand to me
No matter how hard I try to forget
I can't erase it from my memory

To this day you seem to think that
You never did anything wrong
And even though I've tried to look past your ignorance
The hate was too strong

But you were to blind to see how much anger
Was growing inside of me
And everything revolved around you
Do what you say, do what you want, do as you do

As the years passed I never knew what was to come
'Cause you were never there
But the day will come when we'll cross paths
But this time I'll be there to let you know that

All I ever wanted was was for you to believe in me
And everyday I prayed for, lived the day for
Was a chance to throw it back in your face
