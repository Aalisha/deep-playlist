I want you to know that I will always fight
I will continue to wonder
And I can hear you when you can't see the light
Shadow in the night shadow in the night

So you know where I've been turn it over again
What comes next can we wonder
I want you to know that I will always fight
Shadow in the night shadow in the night

Can we start again?
Your ship still isn't sinking
And the stars are out the moon is full

Can we start again?
And how hard am I thinking?
Can the time still pass without a toll?
