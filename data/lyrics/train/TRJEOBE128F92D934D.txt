I remember when the days were young
Summertime had only just begun
Hello Nadine, hello Nadine, hello
Hey Nadine, hello

Well we used to go out every afternoon
Swim together in the blue lagoon
Hello Nadine, hello Nadine, hello
Hey Nadine, hello

Ah! now the nights are drawin' in
I'll be 'round to see you
No more days out in the sun
