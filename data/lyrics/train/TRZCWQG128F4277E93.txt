I hope you're comfortable
Just sit down, sit down
Where to start, where to start
I have no idea
We'll try to find shelter from this pouring rain
I think i see it

Home isn't where you make it anymore

Who would have thought we'd make it this far
Now I don't know where to go, where to go

So I escape, escape to where I need to be,
The water's getting higher and I need to breath
...
