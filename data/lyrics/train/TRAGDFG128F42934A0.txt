I used to wake up everyday
I used to go my perfect way
I used to laugh at my mistakes
Few as they were
But not today
Now I'm wiping off my grin
A widow's spider's web I'm in
There's none so blind as he who sees
With hindsight
Twenty twenty

You think you know it all
But there's always something more

You're exactly what I needed
But how was I to know
Now that I've discovered it
I have to let it go
...
