Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

There's a cast of thousands here, livin' in my head,
All tryin' to talk at once, saying I'm better off better off,
As I tread the tightrope, between demons and saints,
They gather round, but I fix my gaze.

Straight ahead, through the storm,
Let it rage, let it pour down,
Straight ahead, somehow
I'll walk on, and I won't turn back now

OOH ooh ooh ooh ooh, OOH ooh ooh ooh ooh
OOH ooh ooh ooh ooh, OOH ooh ooh ooh ooh
