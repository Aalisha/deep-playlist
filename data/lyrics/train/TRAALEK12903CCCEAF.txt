We've Got Great Big Bunches Of Love
People What A Feeling
It Reaches Clear Up To The Ceiling
And Out Through The Roof
And That's The Truth
And We've Got 44 Acres Of Sunshine
20 Miles South Of The County Line
And People If That Don't Blow Your Mind
There's Something Wrong With You
Now I Ain't Even Been Down To Macon
In Nigh Unto A Year
In Fact I Ain't Done Much Of Nothin' At All
That Can't Be Done Right Here
I Guess You Might Say I've Been Keepin' Myself
Pretty Close To Home
