Three chalk outlines sleep in the dirty street
And in our beds
Under the sheets
They're the halo of guilt hanging around your neck
Next to the rosary
You count, falling asleep
And we're praying to treat the symptoms of letting go of all our hope
Since we can't compete with martyred saints
We'll douse ourselves in gasoline
And hang our bodies from the lampposts
So that our shadows turn into bright lights
White light
White heat
We'll make as we're blacking out in the center lane
We swerve to the beat
...
