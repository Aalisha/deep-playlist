Corroding is our iron will
This nation's tears weakens us
Bloodied are these once strong hands
The heartless acts and dreams getting crushed

Daylight won't show our true face
Get rid of a war, start a few more
Sacrifice is such a small word
For what it truly withholds

Bring them out against their will
Infect them all and stay until
Their bodies twitch and start to bleed
A ruthless act for none to see
Bring them out against their will
Fool them to the top of the hill
Infect them all and stay until
...
