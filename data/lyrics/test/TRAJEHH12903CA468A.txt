Where is god in suffering?
The die is cast, may vengeance yield me
Only a man who's felt despair
Feels what life's really bringing

Life is a war, leaves you all torn
Drew me out of nothingness
It made me be what I am now
Incapable of feeling bliss

Now it's time to settle the score
The string chokes me more
The farther I fall the more I see
The farther I sink the safer I feel

I'm here to prove I'm worthy to
Be the one to challenge you
I can now stop trying
I can see you dying

The hope destroyed, the spirit crushed
...
