Since you came into my life
It's the same old situation
Empty days and lonely nights
Filled with bitterness and frustration.

Walking lonely in the cold
Trying to find the answer
Spend my money on a crystal ball
And the charms of a gypsy dancer
Trying to break the spell you hold on me.

Chorus:
You're miss misery
That song you lay on me
Set me free, set me free
