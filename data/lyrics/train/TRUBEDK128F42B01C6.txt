It's bordering on insanity
So blurred
So unclear
Then suddenly eyes focus and realize that
This man should be here
It's funny how there's no remorse in the moment
But after it's over you wish you could disown it
And as you get up to tell this stranger to leave
The love of your life walks in and sees . . . everything

Chorus:
And of all the things that you could have said
What was in your head?
I didn't mean to
All the thoughts running through your mind
All that you could find
I didn't mean to
And the pain of losing everything comes over you
I didn't mean to
All you can say is that 'you didn't mean to'
I didn't mean to
