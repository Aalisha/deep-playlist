Ain't it funny
The turns life puts you through
Don? t know what? s round the bend
Lord you don? t know where it? s leading you

Close your eyes, say a prayer
Take it on the chin
It? s the darnedest thing
Who comes round again

Baby, I thought that love was
Over and gone forever
Never gonna come back to me
Never gonna hold me again

But your love
...
