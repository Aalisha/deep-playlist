Hey!

Well, my temperature's rising, and my feet on the floor
Crazy people knocking 'cause they're wanting some more
Let me in, baby, I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy, this place is hot

And I'm so glad we made it
So glad we made it
You got gimme some-a lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some-a lovin' (Gimme gimme some lovin')
Gimme some-a lovin' every day
