The city, so quiet, deserted, forgotten
I see my window open the sun
The morning, the moment of people awaking
down in the street, a day has begun
and I fell no other rest, with help of my mind
and all the turnin', walkin' through the night
won't help me to unwind.

Or sleep won't help me,
lose the losing,
and sleep won't take away the pain.
