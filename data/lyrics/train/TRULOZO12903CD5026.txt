There's big pieces of a life she can't remember
Her mind shuts down, it's trying to protect her
Might be for the best to forget but it seems like
They always reappear when she least expects
Late nights we lay awake, drowning in the lake that pours out of her face
Years later she's still not safe
Memories live out in the time, in the place
The way he smelled, the way he smiled
The evil she even recognized as a child
Hand on her throat, sting of a fist
Instead of her first kiss she got this
Shameful feeling, painful secret
Lonely knowin' that nobody would believe it
Heavy wound that escapes the time capsule
It hurts like the day it was born and it's brand new

I wasn't there, babygirl, but I'm here
I don't know what to say I just hear
If there's one wish I could make sure
I would shoulder that pain and take it off you
Don't run, babygirl, don't run
You gotta' face what you fighting, head on
Only one thing I could say in truth
Gotta' deal with the demons before they deal with you
