A wouldn't it be nice
To get on with me neighbors
But they make it very clear
They've got no room for ravers

They stop me from groovin'
They bang on me wall
They doing me crust in
It's no good at all, ah

Lazy Sunday afternoon
I've got no mind to worry
I close my eyes and drift away-a

Here we all are sittin' in a rainbow
Go blimey hello Mrs. Jones
