Listen as the wind blows
From across the great divide
Voices trapped in yearning
Memories trapped in time

The night is my companion
And solitude my guide
Would I spend forever here

Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away
And after I'd wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

Through this world I've stumbled
