The slime looks so good on your face
One for charm, one for disgrace
CUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNT!

And in the back of the truck I'll find the antidote
All the passengers know it's time to jump the boat
Your children will remember every word you say
Never doubt that you're leading them astray

But you're welcome
You're welcome

But he cannot console cos he swallowed it whole

The millions will cry at the cut of his schpiel
...
