Maybe lack of sleep, or last nights drinks
Now my eyes twitching, if that prick coughs again
In the back of my head
I'll smash your fucking face in

Ok, that's it, take a deep breath
I've got to get out of here
I've got to clear my head
I've got to clear my head

It's all these words, ideas and different arguments
Someone's always talking when I try to make some sense
From all this stress that is constantly going on
I just drift along with no focus or meaning
Lean back, stare up at the ceiling
I just drift along with no focus or meaning
...
