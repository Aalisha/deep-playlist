[chorus: tek (steele)]
When the booms bye close (yo we got to keep it movin)
When your shorties act up (aiyo, we got to keep it movin)
When the spilly get hot (straight up, we got to keep it movin)
When shit just don't stop (yo, son, yo we just got to keep it movin)

[steele]
Whose that knockin at my door?
Hope it's a friend of me, cuz we at war wit the enemy
We keep eyes out for spies, out in our cipher
All man trifler, if i'mma take a life, then i'ma die of lifer
Unless i control the stress, ease off roll off the set, get wit tek
Walk around again wit mr. brown and his jamaican friend
Never to sleep again, unless i want my life to end

[tek]
Take a rest blood, let me take watch of the battlefield
Mr. ripper mp, do these'll kill
Any and every enemy befriended we
Don't believe the forefront of the industry
Cuz your man makes the brain feel soothin
Constant elevation, so we gotta keep it movin
