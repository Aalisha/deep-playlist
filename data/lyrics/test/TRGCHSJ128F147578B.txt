I'm the hunter, who's killed by his dog.
I'm the statue, burned down into lead.
I'm the problem, you don't want to solve.
I'm the lover, who dies in his bed.

So rain on the pretty ones.
Your useless lifes don't speak to us.
Rain on the pretty ones.
You leave no footprints in the dust.
Adventurous, you used to be.
But now you seem so dead to me.
