Lalalalalalala la la
we gon' put some people back together today ha
Lalalalalalala la la
somebody gon' thank me after this song man
Lalalalala la la
Matter of fact, I'ma thank me right now
Lalalalala la la ohhhhhhh

Girl I apologize I'm to blame
And I can't sympathise with your pain
If I could I'd make it go away
But I can't
So I concentrate on more realistic things
Like questioning:
Is there anything here worth salvaging?

BRIDGE
Is it over?
How do we go about deciding?
Do we add up all the good times then divide them
By how many times we hurt each other?
Or do we just ignore the numbers and vow right now to never ever take asunder?

CHORUS
Let's stay together
Can we agree to just disagree?
Let's stay together
Don't do it for the kids do it for me
Let's stay together
I'm tired of all this making up and breaking up
Let's stay together (together)
Let's stay together yeah

Girl I can't justify what I've done
...
