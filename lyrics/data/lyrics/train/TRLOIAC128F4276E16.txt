Talk a wicked game
But when it comes on down to play,
I seem to hold on to my own
And it has always been that way.
You give a lash or two by tongue
But it ain't quite the same,
'Cause you're the sweet little thing
Under my arm and no one knows your name.
But that's okay,
(We'll make the finish line)
And anyway.
(We're gonna finish fine)
Hey what you say?
(This ought to blow my mind)
You're bad, bad, bad, baby, please.
(Want you to stay with me)
I'm on my knees.
(Want you to play with me)
Like birds and bees.
(Get home and play with me)
I'll be a sad, sad sack, girl.
I'm not you and you're not me,
...
