Take that night train to Memphis
Take that night train to Memphis
And when you arrive at the station
I'll be right there to meet you
I'll be right there to greet you
So don't turn down my invitation

Halleluiah, halleluiah
I'll be shoutin' halleluiah, all the day
Oh, we'll have a jubilee
Down in Memphis, Tennessee
And I'll shout halleluiah, all the way

Take that night train to Memphis
Take that night train to Memphis
...
