See the turning of the hands, hear the tolling of the bell
When you cross the burning sand you'll find water in the well
So you gave away your heart, you gave it all away
Still you figured from the start it might turn out that way
You'll find water in the well when all hope is lost
And your tears are all gone you'll find water in the well
