LIVIN' ON LOVE (4'13)
John Berry (1996)



* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
I didn't know I was getting into
When I got my first taste of you
You were just what I was lookin' for
And once I had a little I had to have more
'Cause I'd wake up moanin' in the middle of the night
The sound of your name was all that sounded right
Ran back to your door all soaked with sweat
Had to have your kiss before I starved to death

When you're livin' on love, it's all you need
