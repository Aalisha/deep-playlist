Ooh boy I love you so never ever, ever, gonna let you go once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so never ever, ever, gonna let you go I hope you feel the same way too

I watch you walk by my window and I don't even know your name
Well my heart skips a beat and I feel weak when my eyes tell me here he comes again
There's so many things I wanna to say, but each time I see you boy, the words just seems to fade away infatuation love at first site I don't know I just wanna be in his heart

Ooh boy I love you so never ever, ever, gonna let you go once I get my hands on you
