We were born forever
We are twinned in a fugitive mind
Friends should stay together and
Light the world with the fugitive kind.

So you keep talking in many languages
Telling us the wav you feel
Don't stop confiding in the road you're on
Don't quit, you're walking Satellites

I just saw you walking
lce was reading fortunes in the moonlight
Things he could not tell you
You'll never read it more than you will tonight
