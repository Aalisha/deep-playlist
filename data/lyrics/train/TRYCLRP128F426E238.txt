When I was a boy on my daddys knee
thats when he said these words to me,
said listen to what I'm gonna tell you son,
and you can help the world go round.
dont climb no mountain cause you might slip,
and i know you'll drown if saving ships,
heres a gutair all shiny and red,
and it makes a magic sound.

roll, roll, let it roll,
let it flood down to your soul,
let it talk, let it swing,
play that music, let it ring.

now you can pick buddy holly,
...
