I'm in outer space on my side of the bed
On a floating mattress my eyes stare ahead
You don't sleep here anymore

Hovering alarm clock is my, satellite
Under little specks of starlight, on a flight
You don't sleep here anymore
You don't sleep here anymore

I don't know where i am
I am so lost
I'm just drifting around
Since you've been gone
I'm just wasting time away
I'm just wasting time in space
