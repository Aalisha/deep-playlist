The Lord is my temple, God is by my side
You pay rates on that temple build materials at the side
He gives reasons, to get through the day
He doesn't have rinse action, he just says

Whoah, oh
Don't wanna see you back here again
Whoah, oh, whoah, oh
Don't wanna see you back here again
Whoah, oh

Girls are not smiling, the stars have gone out
