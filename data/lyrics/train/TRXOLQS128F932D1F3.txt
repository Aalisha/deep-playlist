I woke up and called this morning
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore
I made up the bed we sleep in
I looked at the clock when you creep in
It's 6 a.m. and I'm alone

Did you know when you go it's the perfect ending
To the bad day I was just beginning
When you go all I know is you're my favorite mistake

Now your friends are sorry for me
They watch you pretend to adore me
