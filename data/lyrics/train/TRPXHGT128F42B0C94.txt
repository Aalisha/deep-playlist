You say that I'm over the top 
You say that I couldn't feel... 
That wa-a-a-ay 
From the back of your automobile 
I say that I know it's real 
So never ever stray 

You were happy but that changed from day to day 
Whenever you were under, whenever it was over 
Think it's over then 
You're living on a fancy street 
But you're not complete 
You are not complete 

They can't kill kill kill you anymore 
...
