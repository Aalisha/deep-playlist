I take my hands from all the things now
I just let them move beside me
I don't let them bother me no more.

Another day comes scarily close to
nearly be the day that
nearly be the day
that leads the way.

somethings got to start me up

so come on come on
please shake me
something's got to make me move
come on come on please shake me
something's got to make me move

I take my hands from all the things now
I just let them move beside me
I don't let them bother me no more.
