Since when did you become so cold,
And such a life-less piece of work?
I can't take the sound of you anymore,
Or the thought of you.

Don't worry,
Take what you need,
I left you and your dying breed.
But before we forget,
When the lights burn out,
Don't come home crying to me.
I will,
Surrender myself,
For the better health,
Of someone who really cares.

Why would you throw it away so fast?
