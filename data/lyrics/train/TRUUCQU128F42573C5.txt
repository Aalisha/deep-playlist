Can you see this predilection
Rushing through my head
Was a morning full of circumstance
I was seeing red
Put my blues away

Navigation gone astray
Went any way I could
Haven't got the time of day
Cannot see why I should
Put my blues away

I can hope
I can pray
Until you
Find me
Someday

Always had my reservations
Who am I to blame
Walked into the ring of fire
Heart in a wall of flames
Put my blues away

My emotion running riot
