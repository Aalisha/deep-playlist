Bob Marley
African Herbsman
Don't Rock The Boat
Huh, please don't you rock my boat
'cause i don't want my boat to be rockin' anyhow
Please don't you rock my boat, no
'cause i don't want my boat to be rockin'

I'm tellin' you that, oh, ooh-aah, i like it a-like a-this
Can you miss?
And you should know, ooh-aah, when i like it a-like a-this
Am i really it? ooh yeah
You satis- satis- satisfy my soul, morning time
Evening cold, -fy my soul
Yes, i've been a-tellin' you, bake me the sweetest cakes
I'm happy inside all the time
Oh, can't you see what you've done for me? yeah
