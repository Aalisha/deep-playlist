Yeah ooh yeah
Last Valentine, I gave you candy
And you smiled so big that day
We walked the park I picked you flowers
And we never chilled that way
You know what happened bout a week ago
You said you loved me too and
Now you tell me that you just don't know
And what am I to do when it's.
Stuff like this that makes me feel this way
Stuff like that, that makes it all go away
I get the feeling that you don't want to say
Stuff like that will make me runaway
Last Christmas I was there beside you
When you didn't feel ok
You told me I was the best friend that
A friend could ever make
