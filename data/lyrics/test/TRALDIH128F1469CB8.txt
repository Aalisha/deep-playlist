There might be a question
That you ask before too long
I won't have the answer
But I promise to be stronger

You lied to me, you lied to me
Like I was some fool, yes you did
You lied to me, you cried for me
I told you to keep your cool

I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
But your love has gone
I asked for love
And to be strong, to be stronger
...
