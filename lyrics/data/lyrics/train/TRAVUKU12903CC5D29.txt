The following is a list of things to do
if I ever go
Followed by, a list of people I love in my book of life
so if you're listenin'
party for your boy
if i ever go
Big Krizz Kaliko

[Verse 1]
Now I Krizz Kaliko hear bein' the sound mind and body
duly command you to party
and toast to that guy
that made ya see fat guys
in a different light
leap with the beat when he touched the mic
now listen closely cuz I won't repeat myself
and if you're close to me
peep in and a keep a peace for yourself
I make it easy if a people grievin' and livin' in hell
Jesus got me sleepin' peacefully
livin' somewhere else
I ain't got much
some cars and some jewls
and some fools
who love me
fans that's just waitin' to hug me
a wife and a son
who I'm absent from
and my mama who raised
...
