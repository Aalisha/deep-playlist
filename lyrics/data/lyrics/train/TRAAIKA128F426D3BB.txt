My eyes burn from these tears
You think you'd learn over these years
Good things won't last forever

So what the hell am I supposed to do
You only wanted the things that I couldn't give to you
And you had it all anyway

So take take everything and leave me scrambling
Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place
So take take everything and leave me scrambling
Reaching for something that wasn't there in the first place
