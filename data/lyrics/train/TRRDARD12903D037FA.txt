People are in big confusion
they don't like their constitutions
Everyday they draw conclusions
And they're still prepared for war

Some can say what's ineffective
Some make up themselves attractive
Build up things they call protective
Well your life seems quite bizarre

In the sky a mighty eagle
Doesn't care 'bout what's illegal
On its wings the rainbow's light
It's flying to eternity

Eagle fly free
Let people see
Just make it your own way
Leave time behind
