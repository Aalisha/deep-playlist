Oh mama don't walk away
I'm a goddamn sore loser
I ain't too proud to say
That I'm still thinking 'bout you
And I'm so lonesome without you
And I can't get you out of my mind

Oh mama don't leave me alone
With my soul shut down so tight
Just like a stone cold tomb
Ain't it clear when I'm near you
I'm just dying to hear you
...
