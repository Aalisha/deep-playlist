You can take away the money
Take away the flame
Take away the things that I possess

You can take all my dreams away
The things that I need to survive
You can have it all

(Chorus)
Don't ever, don't ever take your love away
Don't ever, don't ever take your love away
Don't ever, don't ever take your love away
Don't, take your love away
