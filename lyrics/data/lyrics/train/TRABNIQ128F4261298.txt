(Vamp:)
I'm gettin' off about six
I'm rollin' through the hood so anxious
Hitting up a party without a care
I told my girls, "I'll meet ya there!"

(Verse 1:)
Tell me what sitting at home has done for you lately
Pick up your rump, shake a leg, bounce to the beat
Don't know why your posted up on your feet
'Cause it's so hot in here I know you can feel the heat

(Pre Hook:)
I'm feeling good
I'm looking good
I'm pedicured
I think I'm ready
We're the fliest chicks
Up in the spot
From coast to coast
We hold it down fa sho

(Hook:)
My money, my hair, my nails fixed
My walk, my clothes, my limp
My girls, no man, don't need shit
And I can tell you want a taste of this

You wanna taste of this
You wanna taste of this
I can tell you really wanna taste of this

(Bridge:)
(Better get on up)
I'ma make you dance
Jump out ya seat and clap clap yo' hands
I'm fin to make you dance
This junk in da trunk will put a bump in ya pants

I know you wanna taste of this
I can read your mind
I can read your lips
