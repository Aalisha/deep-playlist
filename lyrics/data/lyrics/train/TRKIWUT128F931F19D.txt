(Intro)
is this for real
this cant be real
are you for real
i must be dreaming
is this for real
this cant be real
woahhhhhhhhhh

(Chorus)
ya so bad to di bone
cant leave you alone
it's like yo inside my dreams
a perfect fantasy (X2)

(Verse 1)
cuz every kiss, every touch
boy you got me blushing
you blew mind roll in lika a russian
im on a double baby inna rush
boy you put your spell on me
cuz every minute, every day
boy you got me senseless
i put my gaurd down playin' my defenses
im inna loop boy lost in you love
boy you know me need it so much

(Chorus)
ya so bad to di bone
cant leave you alone
