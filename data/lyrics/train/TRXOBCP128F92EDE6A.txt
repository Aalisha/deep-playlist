Oh you're a precious little pearl
But tell me true now
Have you ever had a care in the world?
Oh, tell me what's it all about?

You say - oh, you're so uptight
Well you'll never be so right

Oh you can cry yourself dry
But I'd be surprised if you can muster up a single crocodile
You'll never be a hopeless child
