Dear eye, don't cry until it's over.
You're fine and your looks won't grow older.
Don't kill what runs up and down your hill before you're sure,
Just fill you own imagination with the thrill from before.

If I'd let you fall behind,
Would you still wanna be mine, would you like to resign
If I'd let you cross my mind, would you mind?
