Got so much salt from your lies
Poured into me
You didn't see yourself
Dead already
So full of it with every breath that you breathe

But you forgot that in your fairy tale
I'm the wolf
All this attention got you thinking
That you're a queen
You think that everything you're doing
Isn't a dream,
Long as it feels alright.

I had gotten frozen by the way that you walk,
By the love that you gave,
By that look on your face
It's a cover up
I know everything

I had gotten frozen by the way that you walk,
By the love that you gave,
By that look on your face
It's a cover up
I know everything
I know everything

You're made from four letter fame
Regret is part of your name
It's something you couldn't tell
...
