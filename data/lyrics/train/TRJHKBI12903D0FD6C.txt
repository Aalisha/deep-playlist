Yea you know
Only you, only you

Only you can make me feel
Just like a king
Love you give to me so real
Makes me give in

Girl, just like magnet to steel
Your love keeps pulling me in
If it's a battle I'll fight for you
I have to win

To prove to you my love
Is so deep within
It's even getting deeper
Since I reach prison

Longing for
My baby to love me more
What am I longing for?
Babylon release the Cure

What am I longing for?
