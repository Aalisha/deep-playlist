Polly, I know just where you been
I know who you've been seeing
And I think that you should stop it right away
Polly, I don't want you to think
I'm completely in the dark
As to why you don't come round here anymore
Polly, I could stop this right away
I could tell you not to stay
But you'd never listen to anything that I would say

Oh you hold me
And you kiss me
And you tell me
That you don't know what's wrong
Oh you hold me
And you kiss me
...
