I can't say your name, I can't play the game
I can't mess around and end up down again
'cause you gave me the perfect surprise
and it's hard to let go of the look in your eyes

I can't fake or hide I can't believe the lies
the past I can't face when your on my case again
and I wanted to show so much more, 
but I know that we'll fall if we open the door
