It's like the darkest veil
Pulled over my head
No one can see me deep inside
Who I am

Beneath the skin the answer lies
Innocence will be sacrificed
And the truth will be revealed
It's all said and done thousands of times

My journey through the ages
Has taken it's toll
The face of truth
Scars that'll never fad away

It's all said and done thousands of times
...
