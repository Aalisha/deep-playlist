(Voice)

(Sighs)
Yea
How can you forget about us?
All the sacrifices we made
Everything we've been through . . .
I'm sorry . . .

v 1

You gave your love to me
When I didn't have a thing
to offer you but dreams
And you believed and now you think that I'm gon' dip
But I know you ain't gon' trip
Don't act like you don't know just what this is

chorus

I can tell when we kiss, when we touch
When we making sweet love
(You know this thing is forever)
You know the drill, keep it real
Nothing will ever come between us
And I won't leave you never

And I'll put that on everything I love
I'll put that on my mama
Baby you can trust in us
I'll put that on everything I own
And all my life I promise that you'll never be alone

I'll put that on everything I am
You gotta understand, I'll always be your man
And I'll put that on everything I know
I'll never let you go
Cause girl I love you so
And I'll put that on . . .
