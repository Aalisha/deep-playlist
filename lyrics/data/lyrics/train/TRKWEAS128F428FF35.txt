Rise, taste the air, lock and load, pull the trigger,
Climb, to new heights, and tell me, tell me what you hear...

A whisper from the wind, and I can't help but listen,
It warns us of disaster, and I can't help but wonder,
Can anyone hear the same distress call?

So this is a quest to save the world,
And he'll always be here for another,
Another day, another chance to rescue

(OK Jonny, lock and load)

This is all I need to feel alive,
...
