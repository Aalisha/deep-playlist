You push my buttons and open these scars
Just to watch me bleed what I've already bled a thousand times before
Agonizing... you make me scream and shout
I owe this all to you
You're the reason that I'm always coming down

I'm just a bruised and broken heart
But the memories you left are of a girl who's lost and broken
Now it's a shame you've lost your touch and you can't control your lust
I was only a heartbeat away from forgiving you...
(Let the past be)

I'm learning lessons while you're still breaking hearts
...
