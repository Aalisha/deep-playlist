Oooooh, yeeeah, yeah, yeaaah

I feel it deep, deep inside of me
Our bodies one telepathy
Collide strong as we get involved
Fantasy now reality

I'm breaking free from all these chains
I feel the rhythm running through my veins
Alone with you at night
It's a feeling I don't wanna fight

(Chorus)
Now I'm alive - touch me, need me, show me the meaning
I'm alive - closer, deeper, burning fever
I'm alive - now I'm believing
I'm complete, so complete, I'm alive

I need more of your energy
