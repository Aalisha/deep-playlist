The kids are out, and they just wanna dance (oh yeah)
They're so frantic, they'll jump out of their pants (oh yeah)
Cause it's the new sensation, so get into the groove
We'll storm the streets, now the kids are on the move

We are gonna do what we feel is right (oh yeah)
We'll get no rest cause we're gonna have fun tonight (oh yeah)
Cause it's the new sensation, and it's here to stay
