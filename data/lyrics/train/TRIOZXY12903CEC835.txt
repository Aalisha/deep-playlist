Wasted time, wasted words
Pent-up thoughts until it hurts
I fake a smile and I try to find my way out
It feels so bad, so bad to see
That you are way different from me
I can see myself watching you vanish in the crowd

And you ask me what it's all about
I don't know the answer
Keep staring right against the wall
I bite my lips and cut my tongue
Words are so damn useless
You just don't understand at all
You just don't understand at all
