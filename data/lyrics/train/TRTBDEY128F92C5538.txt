Well the best defence is the bright lights
Underneath which you commit that dark crime
Look I was there
I watched it all go down
And I still can't believe my eyes
Nice try it's so wild
Nice try it's so wild

It's like a car burning on the side of the road
Well someone got torched for not doing what they're told
It's like a paid vacation when they change your name
It's like yesterday's news is the same again
