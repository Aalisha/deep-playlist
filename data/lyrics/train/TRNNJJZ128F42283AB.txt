Up here on this tightrope
Tryin' not to fall
The spotlight is on me tonight
I want to have it all
Feelin' stronger
I'm a wild beast in my prime
I need to feed my appetite
I've got to make you mine
And you can't fight this obsession
It's a dam that's bound to break
I was born with this aggression
There is no escape, cause...
