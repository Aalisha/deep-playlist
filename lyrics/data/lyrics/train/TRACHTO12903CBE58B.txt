Now let's hear the story of Bo Diddley
And the rock 'n' roll scene in general
Bo Diddley was born Ellis McDaniels
In a place called McCoom
Mississipi about 1926
He moved to Chicago about 1938
Where his name was eventually changed
To Bo Diddley
He practiced the guitar everyday and sometimes into the night
Till his papa's hair began to turn white
His pa said, "Son, listen hear, I know
You can stay but that guitar has just gotta go"
So he pulled his hat down over his eyes
Headed out for them western skies
I think Bob Dylan said that
He hit New York City
He began to play at the Apollo in Harlem
Good scene there, everybody raving
One day, one night, came a Cadillac with four head lights
Came a man with a big, long, fat, cigar
Said, "C'mere son, I'm gonna make you a star"
Bo Diddley said, "Uh, what's in it for me?"
Man said, "Shut your mouth son
Play the guitar and you just wait and see"
Well, that boy made it, he made it real big
And so did the rest of the rock 'n' roll scene along with him
