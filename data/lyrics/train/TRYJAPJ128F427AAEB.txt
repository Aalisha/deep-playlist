"All We Are"

I tried to paint you a picture, the colors were all wrong
Black and white didn't fit you and all along,
You were shaded with patience, your strokes of everything
That I need just to make it, but I can see that...

Lord knows I failed you time and again,
But you and me are alright

We won't say our goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We won't break, we won't die
It's just a moment of change

All we are, all we are is everything that's right
All we need, all we need, a lover's alibi, yeah.

I walked a minute in your shoes â€“
They never would've fit
