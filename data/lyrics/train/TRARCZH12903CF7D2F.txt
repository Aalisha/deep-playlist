Well, when I...
Want to rock steady
Yeah
I'll know...
I got to get ready
Close my eyes and let myself go
Listen to..., oh
Baby let the music flow, yeah

Turn on your light and stay with me awhile
And ease your worried mind
Turn on your light now baby
And stay with me awhile
And rock steady
Yeah...
Oh
Now rock steady, yeah
Rock, rock steady now
...
