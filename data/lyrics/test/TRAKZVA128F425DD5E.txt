Lost it
And you felt it
You're a hypocrite
And I'll gladly hurt you now
There's no action in the veins I have
But words might just do good

Now I heard a "GO!"
And it felt a bit amusing
Still I'm running with no
Sympathy at all
(We move along, on a line)
If you could see love
You'd see it in my eyes
But clearly you're malfunctioning
...
