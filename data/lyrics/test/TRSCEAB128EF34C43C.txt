While some folks row way up to heaven 
I'm gonna sing The Pirate's Gospel 
I'm gonna sow these feet for dancin' 
I'm gonna keep my eyes wide open 

Yo ho yo ho 
Yo ho ho 
Yo ho yo ho ho 
Yo ho yo ho 
Sing The Pirate's Gospel 

Add another flame 
To our forest 
Where big bellied whales 
Keep us chanting 
We're slapping fireflies 
For tiny dancers 
...
