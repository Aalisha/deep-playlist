I remember, trying not to stare the night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later in the front porch light
Taking forty five minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet, but I thought I loved you then

And now you're my whole life, now you're my whole world
And I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been
We've come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then
