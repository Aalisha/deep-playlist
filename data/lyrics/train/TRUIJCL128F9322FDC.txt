Well she's 6 foot 2 and her eyes are blue
And you ain't got a chance if she looks at you
There's nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
You won't have nothin' when she gets done
She'll lift you up just to watch you fall
She's a big bad Barbie doll

Big bad Barbie doll
Big bad Barbie doll
Big bad Barbie doll
She's a big bad Barbie doll
She's got no heart, and she's got no soul
And the color of her love is black as coal

I had a girl and her name was Sue
She hurt me so bad, made my heart turn blue
She took all my love, she took all my money
I guess I could laugh, but it ain't that funny
Nothing I could do about it after all
