Well, I have been down to Memphis
I couldn't find no peace
Well my soul is feeling restless
Like I need some relief

Heading for the desert
See what I can find

Take me down
To the levee where the women sing
Lay me down
Like an angel with a broken wing

Take me down
To the levee where the river flows
