Down at the arsenal they keep the nerve gases
Guarded day and night by caged white rabbits
Been sitting there for years, now I'm gonna have at it
I cut through the fence, run right in, and grab it
Go crazy

Now I got my own mustard gas in my pocket
Climb on a tree on a branch and drop it
On a country club full of Saturday golfers
So I can watch them die
Chokin', shakin' in convulsions
Go crazy
