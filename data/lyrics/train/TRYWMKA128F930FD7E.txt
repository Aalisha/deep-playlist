(Townes Van Zandt)
Columbine Music ASCAP

Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But I'm going to get you babe
and I will not do you wrong
Living's mostly wasting time
and I waste my share of mine
but it never feels too good
so let's not take too long
I'm as soft as glass and You're a gentle man
we got the sky to talk about
and the world to lie upon

Days up and down they come
like rain on a conga drum
...
