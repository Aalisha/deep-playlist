Stop the press, everything a mess
You can look alive but you are not at rest
And I, ideas are flowing through your head
A million miles an hour while lying in your bed

A lucid life you never thought you'd lead
Are you working everyday?
Are you working just to bleed?
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

You're staring at the names of the famed
That are dipped in gold
The feeling you deserve what you heard
But it doesn't go that way

Oh, the tongues of men and angels
I speak but lack love
Oh, love will it stab you in the back?

Working everyday
I'm afraid I forgot to show
