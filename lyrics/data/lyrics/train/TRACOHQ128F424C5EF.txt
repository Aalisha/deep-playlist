Her eyes opened
After that terrible night
Would she ever be the same
A revelation of her own demise
No one left but herself to blame

Her silence only
Fueled the flame
And now the angels
Have lost their wings
In daddy's playground
Nothing is what it seems

This was the last time
hat he'd see her
That he'd touch her
That he'd make his little
Girl scream out loud

I'm gonna pound you into oblivion
I will make you fucking bleed
There is no escaping me
This is your destiny
