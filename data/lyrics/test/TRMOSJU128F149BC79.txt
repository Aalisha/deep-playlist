How do you feel when you lie?
Straight faced while people cry
How do you feel when you promise something
That you know you'll never do
Giving false hope to the people
Giving false hope to the underpriviledged
Do you really sleep at night?
When you know you're living a lie
To you it is just a job 
To the people it hurts to the bone
