You gave me your hand so long ago
But now our house is burning
You're never home
I feel sick looking at our picture frames
I turned them down and turned you away
I wanted to hear your words my whole life
But now they cut me like a knife
Hiding under the covers
Crushing dreams
Am I lover your enemy?

And at the end of the day
I never wanted it to be this way
You sure it's what you wanna do?
I'll leave it up to you
