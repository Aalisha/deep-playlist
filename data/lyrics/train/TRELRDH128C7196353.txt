Tired of living like my days are bad
When I open up my eyes, I'm glad
And I can't complain 'bout yesterday
'Cause today's a brand new day
Comb my hair and throw some black and run
Jump in my ride because it's on and I'm gone, I'm gone

I woke up this morning
Opened up my eyes and prayed
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
Even though it's cloudy, I can see the sunray
Lord 'cause it's a beautiful day
No matter what nobody say
'Cause it's a beautiful day, a beautiful day

Life just can't get no better than this
Mother nature's given another kiss
There's more room, glad I didn't miss
Let's take advantage of days like this
When the night time does finally here
There be no reason for guns, it will be fun, fun, fun, fun

I woke up this morning
