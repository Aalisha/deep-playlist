Eleven o' clock, too late for cartoons
I'm going back to bed, there's nothing to do
I've got my dreams on my mind, they seem so real
Gotta try to bring 'em back 'cuz they were sick as hell

I was the first in line, I had all kinds of time
All the drags of the world were far, far behind
I had a peaceful tone with everyone I know
Didn't have to take a number just to get a cup of coffee

Here I go, here I go, here I go
Falling back, falling back, falling back
Falling back to sleep
