You only see me when I laugh, never hear me when I cry
And I'm tired of fearing these days
I'm sitting here on my own, talking to myself alone
And I'm tired of fearing these days

All I needed was an, an explanation
Why you treat me so mean
You always play the part with no, no hesitation
That's the other side I've seen

Please don't fail me, don't fail me
Please don't let me fall
Please don't fail me, don't fail me
Please don't let me fall
...
