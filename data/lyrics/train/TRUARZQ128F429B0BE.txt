Compete, Compete
Let the blood fill the streets
Hear the cries of the fallen denying defeat
Comply, Comply
You don't deserve to know why
Forced to push on 'til the day that you die
My respect tied to the tracks, train's on my back
These ropes are too tight
And those headlights look like home

Holding my breath waiting
I'm searching for a sign
Just a bitter ending
Reciting all these lines
Holding my breath waiting
Need a reason or a rhyme
Just bitter ending
...
