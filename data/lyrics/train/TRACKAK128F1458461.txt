Allright!

Let me tell you 'bout a place I know.
The kind of place where the kids all go.
Come along baby you can shake off your blues.
Don't be shy, you've got nothin' to lose.

We'll be rockin' every night,
Rollin' till the break of day.
Rockin' every night,
Rollin' till the break of day.
Yeah-yeah-yeah.

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I met.
She made it hard for me to forget.
She said "Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies."
So I gave it to her straight between the eyes.
