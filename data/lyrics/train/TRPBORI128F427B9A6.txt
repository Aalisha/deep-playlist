I know that everything's alright, when she's with me tonight
Me and my girl, we're the modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Oh it's just the two of us
Sitting around we like to talk about
Getting married one day
Kids runnin' around
But I never knew, it pains me to see
That all this time I've been sleeping with the enemy

It was me and my girl
(It was me and my girl)
It was me and my girl
(It was me and my girl)

Now things are all fucked up
Instead of kissing her lips I wanna staple them shut
Me and my girl are done 'cause nobody tried
Oh it's just the two of us
