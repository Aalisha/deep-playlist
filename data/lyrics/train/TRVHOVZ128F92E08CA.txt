a hundred thousand set for bail
so I sit in county jail
taking all the news that I am given
letters wanting autographs
tv interview requests
questions about the time I face in prison

our fame it spreads across the land
everybody knows the band
who talks to ghosts and holds up banks for money
taco stands and spelling bees
everybody can't believe
the details of our trip
