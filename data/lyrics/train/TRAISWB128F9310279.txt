The cradle of civilization sparks my fascination
Truth ignites our generation to change what's been programmed
Inside my mind

Don't you turn a blind eye
Change what's been programmed inside
Don't you turn a blind eye

Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Cause the change is permanent!
Change is permanent
