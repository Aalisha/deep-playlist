Rain down the pavement
To line up in our metal coffins
Main line our stations
to ship out the mass destructions
Green eyes in fountains
from the toxins that pollute our insides

We're drowning (we're drowning)

We're watching sunlight burn
as it's slipping through the starlit canopy
(we're watching the world light up lifeless)
the daylight insults the beauty of her majesty
(the night is taking control) [x3]
