What were you thinking?
What was going on inside your head?
Tell me were you drinking?
Or just plain insane?
How were you feeling?
With another couple thousand dead
Or were you lying?
Just playing games

Placing your bet
Russian roulette
Well on your way
To ending our days

You'll leave us all behind
Broken with precision
Blind leading the blind
Have it your way
You've left us all behind
Riddled with deception
Pepper us with lime
Have it your way

Was it for your father?
