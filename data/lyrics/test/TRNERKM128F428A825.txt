This is the last party before I die
Well I won't die, well, I'll just feel like shit
If someone offers me another drink
Dig my grave and just throw me in

This is the last party before I die
I won't die, well, I'll just feel like shit
This is the last party before I die
Dig my grave and just throw me in

Well I've been here since five p.m.
And I've been up all night
Then some girl walks up to me
And I can't say things right

A pain in my head, my eyes are blood red
The police are at the door
I'd better run and try to hide
...
