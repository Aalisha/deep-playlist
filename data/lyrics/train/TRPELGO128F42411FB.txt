{INTRO}

[VERSE 1]
You Say, You Say
There's Something Wrong With Me
You Say, Why Can't I Be Right?
Im All Dried Out Inside
But Your Squeezing Me Tight
I Can Still Remember
Once It Was Me In Love
Now Your Here Squeezing Me
Wanting Me To Be
An Image Of You


[CHORUS]
The Love, The Envy, The Hate
All We've Been Through
Just So You'll See
The Image Of You
The Love, The Envy, The Hate
