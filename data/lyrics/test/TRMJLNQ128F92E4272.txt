Your eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could
Recall the moments that once have
Retract the footsteps that brought us to this favor
I wouldn't ask this of you

Good eye, sniper
Here I'll shoot, and you run
The words you scribbled on the walls
With the loss of friends you didn't have
I call you when the time is right
Are you in or are you out?
For them all to know the end of us all, all

Run quick, they're behind us
Didn't think we'd ever make it
This close to safety in one piece
Now you wanna kill me in the act of what could maybe
