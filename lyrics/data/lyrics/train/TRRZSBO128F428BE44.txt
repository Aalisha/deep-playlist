What cha doing?
Really?
You know I'm coming over right?
(now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
Now you got it hot for me already baby?
Okay.
I'll be there in about uh, give me 10 minutes.
Be ready.
Hey.
Wear that little thing I like.
Bye.
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
It's 7: 00
On the dot
I'm in my drop top
Cruisin' the streets, Oh yeah
I gotta real pretty, pretty little thing that's waiting for me
I pull up
Anticipating, good love
Don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I've never seen, girl you know what I mean.
Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
