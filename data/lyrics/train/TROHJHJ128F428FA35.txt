Baby, I think that I'm dying
I wish I could see your face
One more time, before I'm gone
Forever from this place

It's not what I wanted
It's not what I planned
It's not where I thought I'd be
Hurricane glass

I've driven up and down the coast
Just looking for a reason
To wake up in the morning
Now I'm in the Florida Keys
And I just gave away my car
...
