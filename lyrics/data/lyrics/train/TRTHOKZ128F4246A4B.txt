You have crossed the line
Your suicide, the final ride
You ignored the signs
A helpless fight it ends tonight
Your souls traveling on

All the twisted things you've done
You thought you had the master plan
Now it's all caught up to you
And still you wonder why
I can see right through you brother
You're not fooling anyone
Now you pay the final price
It's time for you to die
It's time for you to die

Time is all but out
...
