Ho...
Mmm... hmm... hmm... hmm... hmm...
Yeah... yeah...

It? s never too late
Don? t wait? fore we lose it all
(Hoo... hoo... ooh... ooh...)
It? s never too late (Yeah)
Don? t wait? fore we lose it all (Oh,
na-na-na-na-na-na-na)

Yesterday don? t seem so far away
Used to just kick it, you and me, how in love we used
to be
Still remember how it was holdin? your hand
Makin? future plans

So happy were we that things are changin? over the
time
Sadly we drifted away with hopes that you? d come back
someday
We? d stay cool, me and you, talk on the phone once in
awhile now and again
Found yourself a new friend, thinkin? this might be
the end

It? s never too late (It? s never)
Don? t wait (Yeah)? fore we lose it all (You? re my
love, the only one I? m thinkin? of)
