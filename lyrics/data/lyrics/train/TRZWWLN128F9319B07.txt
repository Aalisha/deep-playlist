Hey give us a rise... give us the rise

Hey give us a rise our thirsty fields are waitin' the willow sags
Let's stop the disguise of shallow lifeless baitin'
I want you now well strengthen the ties give us the rise
I don't want to know all... the ways you're callin' to
Been up what's been brought through you findin' myself already free to blow
