I've sure enjoyed the rain
But I'm looking forward to the sun
You have to feel the pain
When you loose the love you gave someone

I thought by now the time
Would take away these lonely tears
I hope you're doing fine all alone
But where do I go from here?

'Cause without you I'm not okay
And without you I've lost my way
My heart's stuck in second place
