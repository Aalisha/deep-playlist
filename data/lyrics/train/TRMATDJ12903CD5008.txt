(Verse 1 - Brother Ali)
Ant check this out I'm the luckiest son of a bitch that ever lived,
I spend life doin shit I love
Got the world's most beautiful kids and don't nobody do it like us
Sunday morning play Al Green,
make pancakes and watch cartoons
Sometimes get to change that scene,
catch a plane and see somewhere new
Just got married last year,
treated so good that it ain't even fair
Already got a boy,
now the baby girl's here,
bought us a house like the Berenstain Bears
Not two years ago I was homeless,
I mean crashin on the couch of my homies
Now I'm crashin on the couch with Conan,
signed a mortgage and bought my home, shit
Should of seen when they handed me the keys,
I still couldn't believe that it was mine
Like "baby hurry up let's leave, before these damn people change their mind"
Ha, and shit what can I say? I would have made these damn songs anyway
Some of y'all still listen to 'em everyday, beautiful thing, I bow my hand and pray
