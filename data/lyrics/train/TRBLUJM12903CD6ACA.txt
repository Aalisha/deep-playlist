Give me attention
I need it now
Too much distance
To measure it out - out loud
Tracing patterns across a personal map and
Making pictures where the lines overlap
Where the lines overlap

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but we already won
No one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Call me over, and tell me how
