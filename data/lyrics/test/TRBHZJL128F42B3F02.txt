Well I'll open my eyes and a new day will come
I'll see red colored stars in the sky and in your eyes

Fast away the ugly, just one more bill to pay
All the past will be moondust that flies from where we lie
Oh I can feel it
Oh I can feel

Red Colored Stars in my hand are the stones that were cast
They left us with scars, reminders

There's a wall in my way
There's a war in my way
...
