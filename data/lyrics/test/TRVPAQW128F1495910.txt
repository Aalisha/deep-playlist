Oh lady luck turned her back on me
Now I'm full of misery
There's only one thing left for me to do
Try not to think about you

I'm just as blue as a sad old song
Night and day everything go wrong
There's only one thing left for me to do
Try not to think about you

I'm just as blue as a sad old song
Night and day everything go wrong
...
