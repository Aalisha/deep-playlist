One hundred million times I said it to you
There's nothing else I will do for you
How many times do you have to hear from me
There's nothing you can do to keep me here
All violations and degradations
All confrontations are decimating

I feel so sick inside, I feel so undermined
You hold me to the edge of a knife
You make me suffer inside
