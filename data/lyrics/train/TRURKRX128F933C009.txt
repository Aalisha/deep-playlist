Falling down,
One by One in a satellite town,
Underground,
and we rise and we fall,
get undercover,
something creeping in the back of your mind?
Run and hide,
Where are we heading for?
Where are we heading for?

And we hope, well c'mon
For some peace of mind
One by One, there you go
And I'll leave it all behind.
