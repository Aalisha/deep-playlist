(Yung Joc)
Alright boys and girls
You finally made it to the end of the album
I hope you learned somethin
But the best is yet to come
(WELCOME TO HUSTLENOMIC$)

(Chorus One: Yung Joc)
Who would've imagined that life would be so good nigga; now I'm on
Cause I'm tired of all the games nigga; now I'm grown
Tell you what the game's missing; right from wrong
Respect game young nigga, tell them haters so long

(Yung Joc)
You can call me Malcolm X, I hustle by any means
Take the blow, break it down, weigh it on triple beams
I'll cook it, I'll whip it, I'll ship it, I'll flip it
I'll rock 'til the motherf**kin feds come knockin
The owner of the hand, I can be the middleman
Best if you don't know the man, I just tax an extra grand
I get you what'cha want we call that captain and the booker
Hustlenomic$ yeah I'll chop you one, I got it if you want it
I'm from the slums, and the sticks, turned crumbs, into bricks
