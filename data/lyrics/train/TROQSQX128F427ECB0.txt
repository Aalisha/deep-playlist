I'm just a walkin' my dog
singin' my song
strollin' along
It's just me and my dog
catchin' some sun
we can't go wrong

My life was lonely and blue
yeah I was sad as a sailor
I was an angry 'un too
Then there was you
appeared, when I was entangled
with youth, and fear, and nerves
jingle jangled
vermouth and beer
were gettin' me mangled up

But then I looked in your eyes
and I was no more a failure
you looked so wacky and wise
and I said, lord I'm happy
'cause I'm just a walkin' my dog
...
