You're like my homie
'Cause you can chill with me
You're my best friend
'Cause you keep it real with me
You're my lady
Girl, you know you're so sexy
You hold the ground
'Cause you hold me down
I got you, please believe

Ma I'm right here, whatchu wanna do
(Wanna do)
Hold on tight now, watch how I do
(How I do)
Don't be scared girl, 'cause I got you
That's my word
Ma I'm right here, whatchu wanna do
(Wanna do)
Hold on tight now, watch how I do
(How I do)
Don't be scared girl, 'cause I got you
I'll put that on everything

You're my wifey
'Cause you give me all I need
You're my road dog
'Cause you down to grind with me
You're my future
And I'm 'bout to plant the seed
So meet me at home
Take it all off
I'm comin' with the key
