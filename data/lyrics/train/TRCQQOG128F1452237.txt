Yeah

Gotta get me some
Gotta get me instant gratification
Gimme new kicks
Won't you show me new tricks
Without the ramifications

Give it a try, don't be shy
Well, you know you might like it
Never been to keen a timekeeper
But I'm a pure new pleasure seeker

All the way from Venus
Invading from Mars
Don't let that come between us
It's written in the stars

Save me from fading afraid
The tears of a fool on parade
Quietly turn into stone
Make me flesh and bone

Well, come on, oh
You know that you want it now
Well, come on, yeah
You know that you want it and how

Stimulation in body and cell
For the good and misguided
Desperation I'm under your spell
Misunderstood and derided

Speculation they kiss and they tell
Misjudged and misquoted
Fell into the abyss
I must have wanted this
