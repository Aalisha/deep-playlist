Here comes the hot feeling again
When i hear his name
I clearly have no control
Can't help wondering

If herein gone like a wave
I forget but then, start rememberin'
The devil in my mind, why can't he go home
Are we on our way

I do not want to be in this song
So while the summer rats and their hats high

Where is the wind
Why does it feel still again
...
