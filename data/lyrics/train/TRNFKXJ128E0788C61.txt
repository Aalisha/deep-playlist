I don't need to need you
Tell me what to do, tell me what to say
Don't you wanna help me?
Tell me what to do, help me find a way

If I was not me
I would hate me too just like you do
I don't need to need you
Tell me what to do, tell me what to say

It's all made worse by a simple scheme
You're slipping away from me
Can't decide sometimes if it's worth the point
The point is the struggle, insecurity

Hopefully, you make no mistake
If you learn from what you've got to take
Good or bad, it's all gonna add up in the end
But you can never win
