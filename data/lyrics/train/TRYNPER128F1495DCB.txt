lilly was the girl who lived in my world like a sweetheart dream
she was the child drivin me wild since we were both sixteen
lillys worth a forture sittin on her poarch and just lookin good
so she said good bye gonna give it all a try out in hollywood
so she left me behind went drivin of to find california
she left me flat never came back i let her get away
so i'm sittin here fishin watchin television and i can't believe
see liily puttin on the glitz kissin brad pitt on reality tv
