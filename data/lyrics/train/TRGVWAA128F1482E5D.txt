What is going on
In my head these days
It's like everything I know
Keeps slipping away

And I'm left with my last
Drop of gas
To get me on my way
To the ocean

10 O'Clock
I should be at my shitty job
And I can't bring myself
To stop giving up
What's the point of living
If I ain't living it up?
Jump, jump into my car

Roll the windows down
Turn the stereo up so loud
I can't hear you now

I'm never coming back
Never coming back
To reality
