I recognized your scars, because I have them too
It cured my contamination to speak of each other's misery
Can't deny that you were a substitute of a greater loss
But after all you reminded me of

You're someone to the world
And you're the world for someone
You really think you have a future without me?
There's a place not far away
Where I want to take you
The first snowfall is always the whitest

Alone again in my broken dreams
What is love if not a psychic suicide
Alone again in my restless dreams
Love is nothing but a psychic suicide
