at the end of the day i do just what i want
at the end of the day i play just when i want
at the end of the day i do just what i want
at the end of the day i play just when i want

go

who the fuck are you to say
what I can or cannot do?
you talk shit about me constantly
with your weakless metal crew.

spreading lies about me, cry about me
like it's your god given task
if you spent more time thinking about me
i'd have your head right up my ass
