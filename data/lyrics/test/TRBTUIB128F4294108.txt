Like water wears away a stone,
time gently erodes memories
And when love's been replaced
by a bitter aftertaste
It's hard to recall
just what started it all

But
I remembered what I thought I'd forgotten
when I saw you again today
I resisted and I can be stubborn
but my resistance just crumbled away
and now I'm falling backwards
into your arms again
