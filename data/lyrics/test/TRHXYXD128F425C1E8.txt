I can tell you things nobody knows
I've been everywhere nobody goes
Nothing gets me off the way that you do
You drive me crazy when you step in the room

Something 'bout your lips, something 'bout your kiss
Something 'bout your eyes keeps you on my mind
Thought it was nothing, turns out it's something
You're the one that keeps me up every night

Who, who
Who, who loves you?
Who, who
Who, who loves you?

I think I do
Yeah, yeah
Well I think, I do

You crawled under my skin and I feel you there
You're with me all the time, you come everywhere
But when I needed space, I pushed you away
But then I want you back, you're hard to erase
