You've always been this way since high school
Flirtatious and quite loud
I find your sense of humour spiteful
It shouldn't make you proud
And I know your pretty face gets far with guys
But your make-up ain't good enough to hide the lies

[Chorus:]

Are you sure that you're mine
Aren't you dating other guys
You're so cheap
And I'm not blind
You're not worthy of my time
Somebody saw, you sleep around the town
And I've got proof because the word's going around

(Don't know you)
You left your phone so I invaded
I hated what I saw
