Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Wrapped up in a leather jacket
Rock rock rock with me
Roll with me

Looking cool after school
Got to find a girl
Who wants to fool fool fool with me
Oh, fool with me
Roll roll roll with me
We've got to move on till we reach the top
Roll roll roll with me

You know you'll never never never ever
