His hands are clenched
His knuckles white
He got a gun
And gave up the fight
When i found out
I couldn't even cry
Well i am now
And i'm tryin' to figure out why
I'll save it for you
You save me from me
And the hole in my head i can see
Tell her i love her
Tell the kids that i loved them
Oh, it's a bad dream
