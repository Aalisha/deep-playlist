Nowhere to run, to hide.
Justice, revenge FOR THEIR CRIMES.
Bloodshed without warning.
Now they must all PAY THE PRICE.
The ultimate in justice, reprisal for their crimes. Assassinate, eliminate, the rule of an eye for an eye.
The moral question, to take another's life.
Political necessity when justice has been denied. TERRORIZED for crimes that often go untried.
SPREADING FEAR throughtout their victims, ultimate sacrifice.
CRITICIZED for killing any hope for peace.
VIOLENCE no matter what the consequence.
Who pays the price?
All for a place that they call home.
Conflict will never end, all for a place that they call home.
