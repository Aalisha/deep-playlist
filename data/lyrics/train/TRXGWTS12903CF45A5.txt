I'm going insane in my cell they say I've been already been
Bars at the window chains on my wrists my lost life in sin
Don't know how many times I hammered my fists against the wall
But the bleeding knuckles don't bother me I feel no pain at all

Cowering all night in the corner of my cell
Whetting my fingernails on the cold and blackened stone
Visions of a war start spinning through my head
Scratching out my eyes my lost life in red

The creeping lord painting my world in pale
...
