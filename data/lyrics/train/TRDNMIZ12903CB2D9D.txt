(Michael Omartian - Vince Gill)

Love sure is something no one can explain
It can bring you such joy it can bring you pain
And with every emotion love puts us through
There's nothing you can say when love finds you.

Love is the power that makes your heart beat
It can make you move mountains make you drop to your knees
