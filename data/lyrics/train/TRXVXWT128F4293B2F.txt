Where is this paradise?
This heaven you call my life!
Don't test my patience
Just to give it one more chance...
To believe that destiny could change...
To believe that I can tame this rage
I'm lost inside this world...
I'm lost inside myself...

No more... resistance. No more... truthful essence
No more... substance. No more... meaningful lessons

Don't try to justify the life you crucified
All the lies are written in the skies
...
