So I say, is that all that matters anymore?
Who happened to like that band first
And who likes them more

Why do you compensate for the fact that you are clearly, oh so very silly
By walking around my town
Like a fallowfield hillbilly?

You know who you are

I've seen the way that you're looking at all of the normal kids
You think that they've just come out Strangeways because they won't bat both eyelids
