The sun that's shining through the shattered window
Is breaking into colors in the car
Through the heat the dust blows 'round the pueblo
The sounds of people drift in from afar

Can we really lose everything
On a matter of pride?
Is this really the end of our love?
How am I to decide?

Are you ever coming back?
Are you ever coming back?
Are you ever coming back?
Are you ever coming back?
