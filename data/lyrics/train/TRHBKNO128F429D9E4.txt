I can see you´re somewhere far away
Caught in another place
Where nothings going right
Shouldn´t worry about
The worst that could be
When you´re here beside me
Don´t look for troubled times
Now when everything is fine

So you need to feel the bad to see the good
And that´s the thing you do
But don´t let it spoil the view
Of what´s around you

Chorus:
There´s no rain, there´s no storm
...
