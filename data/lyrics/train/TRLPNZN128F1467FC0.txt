Say what you want, 
I'm happy to guess, 
Ignoring the clock, 
To believing answers, 
There's nothing left. 

I will never be sober, 
It's hard enough being friends, 
The end of that birthday party, 
Counting cigarettes at 7am 

But some of them don't know, 
And some of them won't ever know. 

Then love comes in 
It's easy now 
...
