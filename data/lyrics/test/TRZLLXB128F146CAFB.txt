It's a sign of devotion
You made everybody else seem insane
You filled my head with your notions
You made everybody else seem so tame
In your bed I lay reeling
You made everybody else seem a shame
I knew from the way I was feeling
Nothing could ever be quite the same

I moved straight into your shoes
I took up your cause and answered your phone
I couldn't really imagine
What life was like when I was alone
Then I started to worry (then I started to worry)
I thought of our lives left on the shelf
Too much TV and curry
