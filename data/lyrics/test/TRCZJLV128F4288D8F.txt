I Don't Know If It's Right
Evelyn "Champagne" King
(T. Life/J.H. Fitch)


I don't know if it's right
To let you make love to me tonight
I don't know if I should
Give my love to you when I know you're no good

I've got to make sure it's alright
If I should let you love me tonight
Before I let you kiss me I got to get the situation in hand
? Cause I don't want you just to be another man, whoa, whoa, whoa
