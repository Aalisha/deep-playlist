My footsteps on the ceiling never leave a trace
A thousand little thoughts I wanted to erase
I'd sleep under the rug if I can find the space
My mind is blown in stereo and dripping down my face

Go dancing on the ceiling, put my headache on the floor
And I still can't find the feeling with my bones all cracking, hearts attacking

Doors are all rusted, I can hear em creek
I'm on a rocket ride, I'm on a losing streak
A solar flare could not prepare me for the heat
I'm antiseptic and I slept for one more than a week
