I see you all the time
I can? t go anywhere without you walking by me
And I think I must have lost my mind
? Cause that coincidence could
Never happen every single day

I? ll be leaving outta town on Tuesday
I? ll be leaving but I wish I could stay
And I only wish I had the nerve to say

I want you to know however things may go
That you were always on my mind
It doesn? t matter where I? m at
I want you to say that you feel the same way
? Cause I know I? ll see you sometimes
You know I never have come back

I wonder if you think about me
Like I think about you right before I go to sleep
It? s obvious to me that this is fate
And I know every time I see you on the street
