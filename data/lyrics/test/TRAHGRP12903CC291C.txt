I'm in love I'm in love
like this for the first time
I'm inlove I'm in love with a girl like you
I'm in love I'm in love like this for the first time
I'm in love I'm in love with a boy just like
you Don't you know don't you know that you'd be mine
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful girl
I'm in love I'm in love with a boy just like you
