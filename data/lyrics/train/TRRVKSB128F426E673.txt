Glorious

I'll let the whole world know
That You are holy
I'll let my lifestlye show
That You're the only

Lord, I am not ashamed
To say I live for You
And I will live to proclaim
Your name to anyone
I'll let the whole world know
That You are holy
And I am not afraid
To be a light unto You
And I will let my light shine
Bright before everyone

I'll let the whole world know
