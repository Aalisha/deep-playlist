Twisted on destiny, fate and three wishes
We fuck and we fight, someone else does the dishes,
And meantime my memory reminisces and twists,
There was a time when we were filled with laughter,
Haplessly hoping happy ever after,
Did we string up a heart, let it swing from the rafters
And bleed.

There's blood on your legs, I love you
There's blood on your legs, I love you
