we are the good, and we're gonna come a long way
baby
so lets get it on, come on
we are the good, we're gonna beat you at your
own game baby
so lets get it on... come on come on come on

i love u baby, the way you shake it
you drive me crazy, but we can make it
we1re like a team now, and all you gotta do
is to reach out.

i never feel lonely when im with you
you make me feel your sweet love coming through

we are the good, and we're gonna come a long way
baby
so lets get it on, come on
we are the good, we're gonna beat you at your
own game baby
so lets get it on... come on come on come on

they call me crazy, but i can take it
i take a look at my baby, and i can make it
go all the way now, and all we gotta do
is sing it out loud.

i never feel lonely when im with you
you make me feel your sweet love coming through
