Go on, make me feel it's useless
When in fact it's you that need to have me near
So now, keep me at safe distance
And with a little persistence
I'll make it crystal clear

That I'll be around only if you want me to
Be there by your side, I'm ready for you
So don't be afraid
'Cause I know what you're going through
So when you think it's time, I'm ready for you
