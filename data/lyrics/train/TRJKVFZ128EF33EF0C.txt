Waiting for the time you come by
Waiting for the time you comply
You said you still can look me in the eye
This can of worms is all I can buy
The one you love is the one you hurt the most
In my heart I feel like a ghost
If only you could see right through my eyes
Than you'd see it's the end of the line
I say it one more time, two wrongs don't make a right
I believe there's no chance to make it all worthwhile
I'd rather have some fun when you are not around
I'm turning down the light, I turn you down
When you call on me again
