Gotta break out find something else to do
I can't stand being stuck in here with you
Gonna have a laugh
Gonna break into a store
I'm so bored that I don't care anymore
Told our mate to keep dog eye
But he went and told a lie
They took us down the station
They done us for theft
Now my life's in ruins
I ain't got nothing left

I'm not so ignorant I'm not a fool
