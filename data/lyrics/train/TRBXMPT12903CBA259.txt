Today I'm dragging ass, because last night I stayed up late.
I was reading Superman, DC Comics fifty-eight
And when I saw his X-Ray vision, now I want some, too.
So I turned to page forty-three, and I found out what to do.
Now don't you mess with me, cause I'm a superhero now. (well I'm a superhero now)
And I can see your underwear, so why see through solid lead?

Cause I can see through your bullshit with my X-Ray specs.
