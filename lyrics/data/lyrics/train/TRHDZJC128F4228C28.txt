There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away, if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Ooh

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get, while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neon's turn to wood

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
...
