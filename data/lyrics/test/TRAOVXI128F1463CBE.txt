Baby, ya know
I been thinkin? about you
And I been thinkin?
We should get togetha

But I know you got somebody
And I do too
But I got 1 question
Can ya get away?

I been lookin? to get away from him
I been lookin? to get away from her
Oh, we gots to find a way, babe
I been lookin? to get away
Since I found you

Say whatever it is you need to say
'Cuz I? m thinkin? bout headin? my way
This relationship is getting? crazy
Lately, lately, lately

I, been feelin? this way from back when
Now it? s time I turned you in
Maybe now baby we can be friends
Baby, baby, baby

I been lookin? to get away from him
I been lookin? to get away from her
Oh, we gots to find a way, babe
I been lookin? to get away
Since I found you

I been lookin? to get away from her
I been lookin? to get away from him
Oh, we gots to find a way, babe
I been lookin? to get away
Since I found you
