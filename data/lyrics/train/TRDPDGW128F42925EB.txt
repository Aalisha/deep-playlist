Hear my story, hear my words, they might speak truth about this world
Hear me opening my heart, I've seen the years passing by
Seen them wither before they die
Only to be born again
Close your eyes, descend with me
Into the dream that we believe
That's the best we've ever had
Let your mind go with the flow
Let it fly high and low
Throw yourself into the memories
Higher, reach higher
Where all our fantasies will come true

We are heading back to out innocence
We're falling in to oblivion
Back to our innocence
