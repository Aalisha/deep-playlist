brains on your head
shoes on your feet
life still living [why still live?] from week to week
and cheek to cheek
waitin' for the phone to blink

waitin' for the blow to snow
skating around
the only place you know
prayin' for your hair to grow
now your mama say
back before the war
everything was sugar free
everything was sugar free
a girl's heart
was filled with stars
