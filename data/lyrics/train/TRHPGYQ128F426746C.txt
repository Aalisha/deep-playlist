Lover when you hold me
can't you feel what you have done
This body aches for relief
As if the only one

from your lips your soul I kiss
I feel your love through your finger tips
Oh lover lover, what have you done?

All of my love
Know that I ve bled
Oh so ceaselessly
Return all of my heart
Know that you ll be
Oh how you ll always be
...
