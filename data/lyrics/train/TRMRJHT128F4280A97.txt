J.R.
Sean Kingston

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over

Damn all these beautiful girls
They only want to do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

See it started at the park
We used to chill after dark
Oh, when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
Because we both thought that love lasts forever

They say we too young to get ourselves sprung
Oh, we didn't care, we made it very clear
And they also said that we couldn't last together

See, it's very divine
Yeah, one of a kind
