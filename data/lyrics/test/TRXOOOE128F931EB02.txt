Smiles that'll disappear with the morning sun
Miles of laps that we were made to run
And when the lights dim, I think about myself with no one else around
And I believe there's a way to describe the silence as sound
And it's fading, so let's smother it, 'cause it won't burn out
And I was taken by the arms that dealt the clout
And you will look to the clouds and you will wear the crown!
