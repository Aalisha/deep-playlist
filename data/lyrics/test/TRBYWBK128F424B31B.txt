I declare war, war against human nature. I demand more, more from this
dilemma you call life. You're so blind, you cannot see that with our mind
controlling solutions we have controlled your "superior" specie. You have
been living in a lie, we've been able to create you a never ending
hallucination.

And you think that you know what is fear, but how can you be afraid of
something that you don't even know to exist.

In your mind you think that you are safe. Your life is as fragile as a
sculpture made of glass. Mankind is blessed with ignorance.
