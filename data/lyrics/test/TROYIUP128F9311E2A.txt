Well now I ain't gonna tell nobody,
that I ain't gonna drink no more
I just can't feel welcome, no place I go
Y'know I just keep on drinkin',
be tryin' to drink my blues away

The little girl that I'm lovin',
she's really bittersweet,
She's got everything that grateful Pinetop needs
Y'know I just keep on drinkin',
be tryin' to drink my blues away
...
