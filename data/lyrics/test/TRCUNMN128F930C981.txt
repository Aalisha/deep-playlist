Where have you been? What happened out there that night?
I was taken...
Taken?
What do you mean, taken?

I was paralyzed
I could not speak
But only listen

I was not alone
There were six others
Assigned to the mission

We were not bound but
We could not move
While they spoke

Don't look at me that way
This is not a joke

Their eyes were black, a soul they lack
...
