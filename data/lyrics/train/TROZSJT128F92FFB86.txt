No na, na na na na na na
You're into my thoughts like a dream on the run
You're a vision of hope in a world come undone
When the feeling is strong and you know that you love someone
Make it tonight, make it forever and a day
Baby reach out to me, baby reach out to me
And tell me when it's right

Chorus:
Say when, when love can steal your soul
Say when, when love can take control
Say when, when love can make you whole
...
