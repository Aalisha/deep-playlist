If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew left the passengers to die under the sea

Countdown to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we wont extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
Its time you firmly secure your place in hell
