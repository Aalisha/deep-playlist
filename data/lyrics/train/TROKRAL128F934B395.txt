i awaken -- deep in the grasp of frozen pines
not a shred of clothing, yet i feel no cold
the woods envelope my soul
perception multiplies
my senses heighten to extremes

my heart beat ever increasing
the only sound aside from the wailing of the wind through the trees

i know no fear
boundaries of mortal human flesh have abandoned me as i am renewed
i dreamt of such a mutation for countless winter nights
my essence became that of a beast
i gracefully cut through the forest
free of my former husk
unfettered by the hindrances of past

my purpose manifests, i am void of delusion
i am born into this wolven form in seek of human flesh

lead by vampiric hunger
i will to feast upon the bones of the meek
the marrow of my enemies
