Save me a mountain to climb
Save me a river to cross
At midnight the sound of the stockyard trains
Wail in the distance and rattle my chains

Save me a valley like the one in the distance
Save me a canyon to swallow this jail
I wanna stand outside and feel the rain when it falls
Breathe the air on the other side of these walls

Save a mountain for me
Save a mountain for me
It sounds like a choir when the chaingangs shout
Save me a mountain for when I get out

Save me a desert, just me and the sand
Save me a sea to sail
In my heart I know I'm too weak to be strong
...
