When I was young, I was invincible
I found myself not thinking twice
I never thought about no future
It's just a roll of the dice

But the day may come when you've got something to lose
And just when you think you're done paying dues
You say to yourself "Dear God, what have I done?"
And hope it's not too late 'cause tomorrow may never come

Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.
Reach for the sky, 'cause tomorrow may never come.
