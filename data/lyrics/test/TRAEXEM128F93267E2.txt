Safri Duo - Rise

(Hey Heyyy, yeah.)

Did you really, love me? (oh yea you love me)
Did you really, need me? (yea, you need me)
Or were you, just using me?
Or were you, just using me?
I never felt so used,
I wont go back to you.
So leave me alone
I wasn't good enough,
it was never about us
So leave me alone
(Alone, alone)
So leave me alone
(Alone, alone)
I've had enough of your kiss
The touch of your hand, I won't miss
I've been wrapped up in all your crazy ways
