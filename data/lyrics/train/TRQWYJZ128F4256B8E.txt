Through all the pain and misery
You were supposed to bring us back the smile
We lay screaming in agony for too many years now
Through all the pain and misery
You were supposed to bring us back the smile
We lay screaming in agony for too many years now
Mankind is nothing more than an empty name
I closed my brothers' eyes tonight
All your pretty faces hide demons inside
We lay screaming in agony for too many years now
Take me from this hell or take the hell away from me
Like the decaying babylon your empires shall burn
And now you cry for freedom
Like the decaying babylon your empires shall burn
And now you cry for freedom
