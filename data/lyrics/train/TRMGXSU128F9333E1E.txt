This world's not my home
I'm a stranger to the storm
Save me, save me
Where the race is quickest
The tide runs strong
Save me, save me
A big sky above my
West winds blow
Sailing long distance
Breaking the foam

There's a lighthouse
Shining in the dark
A lighthouse
Standing in the black
All the world's a ship
Shipwrecked on the seas
Breaking up in pieces
We're clinging to the reef
There's a lighthouse

There's a sky full of trouble
Lifetimes and fear
...
