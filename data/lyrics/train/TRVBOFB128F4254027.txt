BORIS

I'd like to take I like to feel wanted
Taken up and take them tall
I like to make a lot of generate the one eyed mouse
Build 'em up and let 'em fall
Just lay 'em on and leave the linen tight
Taken up and take them tall
Generate, lay them flat like monkey man
Leave 'em built, right, stand 'em tie them down
It's like sin
