Come, smash up your seats tonight
Sippin'on wine
I'm fine
The music keeps me up all night
Cause I'm full of lust
Come with us
Run for your lives

I'm only lonely when the music's over
Lonely when you're going home

We don't celebrate Sundays anymore
(we don't celebrate Sundays)
My good church is not open on Sundays
(we don't celebrate Sundays)
