Who would have known: that a boy like him
would have entered me lightly restoring my blisses

Who would have known: that a boy like him
after sharing my core would stay going nowhere

Who would have known: a beauty this immense
Who would have known: a saintly trance
Who would have known: miraculous breath
To inhale a beard loaded with courage

Who would have known: that a boy like him
possessed of magical sensitivity
would approach a girl like me
