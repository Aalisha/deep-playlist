Early morning, pack my bags
Atlanta airport driver please
Lockheed tristar, runway four
Don't you know I hate to leave.

Lazy acres, five slow days
That georgia farm gave me release
Tequila sunrise lay me down
As the warm winds comb the trees.

But you know I'll return
For atlanta I burn
Atlanta you're my home
