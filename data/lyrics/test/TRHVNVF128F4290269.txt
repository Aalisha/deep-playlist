C'mon everybody and let's get together tonight
Got some money in my jeans and I'm really gonna spend it right
No more movies for a week or two
No more running 'round with the usual crew

Ah, who cares?
C'mon everybody

Well, my baby's number one but I gotta dance with three or four
The place is really shaking form the bare feet slapping on the floor
