Sometimes I lock myself inside your closet
Breathe in the scent of your clothes
Take home a T-shirt and pretend I lost it
Hide it under my pillow, call me

Crazy, I'm crazy that way
Boy, I must be insane
Crazy, I'm in need, don't care what people say
I'm crazy that way, I'm crazy that way

Baby, I don't wanna talk about it
