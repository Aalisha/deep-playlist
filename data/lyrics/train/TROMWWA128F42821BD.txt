She can capture your heart
When they start the music playin'
Sparkle in her eyes, you better be wise
Or you will end up losin' your mind

I said baby, pretty baby
Got to get my hands on you

Somethin' is got a hold on, somethin' is got a hold on me
Somethin' is got a hold on, somethin' is got a hold on me
She was born with it in her soul, Lord she knows how to rock and roll
She was born with it in her soul, Lord she knows how to rock and roll
