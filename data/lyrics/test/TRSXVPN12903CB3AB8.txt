(Dee doody doom doom)
(Dee doody doom doom, DOOM)
Seven little girls sittin' in the back seat
Huggin and a'kissin with Fred
I said, why don't one of you come up and sit beside me
And this is what the seven girls said
(All together now, one, two, three)
(Keep you mind on your drivin')
(Keep you hands on the wheel)
(Keep your snoopy eyes on the road ahead)
(We're havin' fun sittin' in the back seat)
(Kissin' and a'huggin with Fred)
(Dee doody doom doom, dee doody doom doom)
(Dee doody doom doom, DOOM)
