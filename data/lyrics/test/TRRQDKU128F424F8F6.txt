Somewhere Beyond the Frozen Moors in the Highest North
Where only the Falling Snow from the Sky managed to Enter
A Kingdom Forever Deserted since it's Birth
Forgotten in the Extremest of Storms and Cold
A Landscape in Ancient Sleep of Deathlike Silence
Yet Breathing in the Growing Wastelands of Frost

[Voice:] "...At the End of this Bitter Winter Eternity
Laid the Ultimate Overshadowed Ice Forest on Earth...
Once the Northern Lightning Struck the Skies
It became a Shape in the Entangeling Ice...
