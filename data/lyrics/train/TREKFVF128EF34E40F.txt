I'm not comin' back
I'm not gonna' react
I'm not doin' shit for you
I'm not sitting around
While you're tearing it down around us
I'm not living a lie
While you swim in denial
'Cause you're already dead and gone
You'll leave me out on the curb
Just like everyone else before you

Welcome to my world
Where everyone I ever need
Always ends up leaving me alone
Another lesson burned
And I'm drowning in the ashes
Kicking
Screaming
Welcome to my world
