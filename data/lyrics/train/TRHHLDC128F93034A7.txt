No more pretending now, the albatross is dying in its nest
The company is crippling me
The worst trying to ruin the best, the best

Their promotion's so lame
They could never ever take it to the real ball game
Maybe they think I'm a pet
Well I've got all the diseases
I'm breaking out in sweat, you bet, 'cause

I got, mercury poisoning
It's fatal and it don't get better
I got, mercury poisoning
The best kept secret in the west

The boys and me are getting real well known around town
But every time we try to spread the action
Someone always brings it down, down
