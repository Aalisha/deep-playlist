Then you said a little more about your dreams like that was my call (My call)
"If you would only listen"
Bypassed everything and went straight for the neck
(I study)
We're studied
(Up nightly)
Dragged you out into the streets before you buckled at your knees (You buckled at your knees)

"What's it feel like to be a ghost?"
(Louder now, louder now)
"What's it feel like to be a ghost?" Ahh
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for...)
Are you up for, are you up for this?
(Well, are you up for, are you up for...)

This is quick but not quite painless,
...
