One day, I'll take a bottle
With a good strong base and a cork that fits it
No label, no marker's mark

I'll shout the bile and anger
And plain disappointment in until I've almost filled it
And then I'll squeeze the cork down hard

I'll need a boat with a good strong sail
To weather all the storms and the gales
I'll grab that bottle, grip the rail and say my prayers

And then I'll hail that bottle out
Into the deep blue sea
And then I'll sail away, yeah

I'll hurl that bottle out
So far, it can't hurt me
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
