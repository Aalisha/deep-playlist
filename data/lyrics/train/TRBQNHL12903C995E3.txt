Embracing, the thought of tasting
My mind's a labyrinth, my heart is racing
I am waiting to escape in
A strange reality, a page I wanna paste in

Why don't you hold my hand
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel baby
la la la la la la la
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel

Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel baby
la la la la la la la
Don't you wanna feel what I wanna feel

What I wanna, what I wanna feel, feel

Surrender, I won't defend ya'
