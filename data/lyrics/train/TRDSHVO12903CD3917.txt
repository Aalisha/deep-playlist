We're starting it over, we're making way for destiny
A time to turn over, a better life for you and me
A new recreation, to channel all this energy, hmmm
Let's solve the equation, I need to keep you close to me

So baby let your conscience go
There's no turning back when love takes hold

Hold me baby, drive me crazy
Touch me all night long
Make me love you, kiss and hug you
Touch me all night long

The more that I see you
The more I know that love belongs
