Tryin’ to build a bridge across my hearts divide
Caught between two opposite signs
I want it all and I can’t decide
If I should leave you here or stay with you a while

I love you I love her
I need you I need her
I’m always gonna love you
I’m always gonna love her
I guess I should just let this thing die
Cause I am a man of two minds
