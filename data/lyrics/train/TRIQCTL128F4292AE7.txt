Yeah, Yeah
Well, oh oh baby won't you come to me
I love you only
Come to me, I'm so lonely
Come to me, I love you only baby
Well, you just said you could come
Whenever I need you and you can bet I'm a gonna please you
So come a runnin' 'cause now I need you baby
Hey hey, you know I miss you baby

Well, a just come when the lights are burnin low
I want to hear your knock on my door
