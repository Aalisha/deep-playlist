You'd never imagine us bringing a loaded gun to the ballroom
this party is about to kick off
tonight is the wrong night
the devil's own are only starting up the first round of the fight
so hang on tight

dear mother,
the needle is jabbing the womb draw back and release this child of disease
this mob is a riot
the outlaw youth are only emptying the first round of the night
'cause everything's not alright

I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs
...
