I shouldn't be alone with you tonight,
desire was to strong to put up a fight,
I don't understand the way I feel
although it feels so right,
I really shouldn't be...
here tonight

In your eyes there's a sign of intensity
I sense an atmosphere
no need to hide from the way that you feel inside
there's nothing left to fear

(chorus)
If only for tonight
(don't be a stranger)
...
