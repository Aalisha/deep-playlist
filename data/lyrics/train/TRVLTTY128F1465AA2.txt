[Big Boi]
Boi stop
It's about to be a what?
Girlfight!

[Chorus]
We bout to throw them bows
We bout to swang them thangs
We bout to throw them bows
We bout to swang them thangs
It's bout to be a what?
Girlfight!

There she goes, talkin' her mess
All around town, makin' me stressed
I need to get this off my chest
And if her friend wants some, then she'll be next
It really ain't all that complicated
Y'all walkin' round, lookin' all frustrated
Want some Tex, come on, let's make it
Ya actin' real hard, but I know you're fakin'

I know you really don't wanna step to this
Really don't know why you talk that shit
You about to catch one right in ya lip
It's bout to be a what?
Girlfight!
[2x]

[Chorus]
We bout to throw them bows
We bout to swang them thangs
We bout to throw them bows
