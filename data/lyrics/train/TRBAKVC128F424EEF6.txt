She will awake from the dance of silence
She will awake in whispers of violence
Her bed is a grave in a sleeping garden
I'll suffer, implore for her eyes to open
She will awake, she will awake
She will awake from this inner destruction
She will awake from devil's infection
Her breath is a wind in a dying tornado
I'll defy the storm for another tomorrow
