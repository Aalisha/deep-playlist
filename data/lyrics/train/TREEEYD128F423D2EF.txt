Take me now my love and set me free
Bless me with your energy
Give me one good reason why you can`t Spread your wings and fly with me I`m just as frightend as you
But only this time is true Through fire and rain
I will shelter you
Take all the pain
And turn it to pleasure
Until the stars collide
Our hearts will fly together Close your eyes unchain your mind
It`s amazing what you`ll see
