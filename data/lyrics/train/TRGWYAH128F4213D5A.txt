Sometimes I just look em in the eyes and say, we here

Take the good, the bad, all we had
We here, we here, we here, we here
We laugh, we cry, we gon' defy
We here, we here, we here, we here (Put em up)
Yeah we here, we here we here, we here we here
We here, we here we here, we here we here

Always in attendence, even when I'm absent
Haters see you present, try to leave a nigga absent
Fishes on my ride, kleenex golds, that's in the cabinet
Shorty in my ride but she should be in a pageant
