You can't keep a grown woman waiting
Boy you can't be wasting her time
It's only silly girls that will run game
With a woman boy you cant cross the line
It's easy if we both want the same thing
Or even maybe try compromise

Bridge:
Tell me what you want
Is this what you want
Let me know â€˜cause if it's not
Then I'm not the one
I'll be happy on my own

Chorus:
I don't know why
But boy you're not eazy
...
