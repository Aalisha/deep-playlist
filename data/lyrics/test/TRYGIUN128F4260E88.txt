Come to the water
You who thirst and you'll thirst no more.
Come to the Father
You who work and you'll work no more.

And all you who labor in vain
And to the broken and shamed:

Love is here.
Love is now.
Love is pouring from
His hands, from his brows
Love is near, it satisfies.
Streams of mercy flowing from his side.

Cause love is here.
Come to the treasure
...
