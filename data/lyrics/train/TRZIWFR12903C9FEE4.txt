Plant the germ of terror
Sow the seed of hate
Penetrate receptive minds
Scatter terminate
Silent without warning
Awake the sleeping cell
A suicideology
A nihilistic hell

You are my wall of silence
You are my tool of violence
You are my death alliance
Through you I scream defiance

Seeds of hate, seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, I'm planting seeds of hate
Seeds of hate, seeds of hate
...
