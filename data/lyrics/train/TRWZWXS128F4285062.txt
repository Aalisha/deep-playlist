You were headed in another direction
And then you saw me
I knew that
You were ready for the connection
And I could feel your desire

Slow down
I think you’re scaring me
You’re really getting me and
Everything is moving too fast

Hold on
Don’t leave me now
I can’t let you leave
Because I want you so bad

You’re just an operator
Oh, you could make a
Girl do things she’d never done
Operator, motivator
You’re one of a kind
