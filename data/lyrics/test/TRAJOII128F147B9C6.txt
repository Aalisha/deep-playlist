Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on m my knees
I'm begging you please to come home

Cecilia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia, I'm down on m my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home

Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
