A change of heart couldn't hurt nobody
The way she goes around won't change your mind
A change of heart couldn't hurt nobody
The way she goes around won't make you smile

I live in style but life gets me down
And when a little high she climbed inside and said
"Don't go changing, no don't change me
Because it feels like comin' down"

A change of luck couldn't hurt nobody
The way she goes around won't change your mind
A change of luck couldn't hurt nobody
