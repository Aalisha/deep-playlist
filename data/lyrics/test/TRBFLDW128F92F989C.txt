We all have secret lives, in our secret rooms
Living in our movies, humming our own tunes
Living life in camera, when the night is closing down
Sliding into darkness, you could be like me

Where are you going? What are you doing?
Why are you looking at the cameras eye?
Where are you staying? why are you leaving?
We watch you breathing through the cameras eye

We all make up our faces, the make-up of the clown
Happy leaving traces of our childish background
