I gave you flowers and you gave me faith
We are minds and hearts that move as one
Chameleon, warrior, gypsy and brave
Turn our eyes to the heart of the rising sun

You and me, we are blood brothers
You and me, we are blood brothers
Blood brother, lay down your life for me
Lay down your love for me

Kiss by kiss, touch by touch
We talk of clouds that walked
You took my hand and walked me through the rain
An act of love, mission and tender mercy
