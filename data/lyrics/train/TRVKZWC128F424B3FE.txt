It's about time, ready to break it
When I walk about I battle to make it
Doing what they call the best I can
You starfucker type caviar daydream
I'm gonna get away I say I said maybe
Blooming in the meadow
Think I'm leaving... and that's why
I'm going out of my head
I wish I was dead... I'm feeling Lo-Fi
I bottle up and explode
My engines have blown
...
