Well, c'mon darlin'
The stars are burning bright
C'mon now darlin'
Our lick is good tonight

'Cause we're the all time winners
In the all time loser's game
Yea we're the all time winners
And here we go again

The king and queen of America

Yeah, it's the king of nothing
And the queen of rage
With a pile of confusion
...
