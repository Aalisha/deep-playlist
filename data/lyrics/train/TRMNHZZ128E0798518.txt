I’ve been obnoxious, I’ve been unconscious,
I’ve been all kinds of things that are hard to spell.
I’ve been unruly, speaking truly,
I’ve been so cool I could barely even stand myself.
I’ve been a monster, without a sponsor,
I’ve been Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
I’ve been a goner, I’ve been a loner,
And when my mixture was right,
And I’m a nice bunch of guys.

I am what I am cause I ain’t what I used to be.
Cause it is what it is but it ain’t what it used to be.

I’ve been a mover, I was a shaker,
He had a girlfriend, I tried to snake her.
