For all nations
New combination
DJ Kore Phoenix EMC
And the girl Amerie
One thing for sure...
It's Ra√Ø'n'b fever

I see you in the crowd
Look over my shoulder
Maybe I'll tell you now
Tell you that it's over
I know you wanna talk
You call my phone 3 times
But I can't take you now,
Yes I've made up my mind

No! I won't take you back
I gave you many chances
No! I won't change my mind
