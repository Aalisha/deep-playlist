Born like everyone with a slate as clean
Baby grew into a boy and started building steam
Boy learned how to blow it off in a dangerous kind of way
Well fellas here he comes that runaway train

Now hear his lonesome cry barrelin' down the track
Out of control his soul dressed in black
Sound to every man that's broken the chain
Rollin rollin rollin like a runaway train 
...
