You bum right here and you
Bounce over there Sponji Reggae
I say you bum right here and
You bounce over there
Sponji Reggae
I say you rock right here and
You rock over there Sponji Reggae
I say you punch right here and you
Punch over there Sponji Reggae

A keep trying very hard to succeed
I almost lost my reflex
My bare feet was burn
That i almost lost my nerves
My fingers are shaking as the
Day start breaking
I could a never keep it no longer
I had to tell it to one another

I say you bum right here,
And you bounce over there, sponji reggae.
