All alone in bridge of silence
I suppose you shouldn't stay
All alone in dream's asylum
Don't you know we've come a long way

In places on the run

What a dream I had
Dressed in colored shawls
Though the night was so warm
And a nightingale
Sat on a castle wall
While the river ran on

Calling, hearing you call
