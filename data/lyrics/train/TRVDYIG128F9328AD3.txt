heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, ha ha ha ha
heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, ha ha ha ha

the autumn came in like concrete at my face
location hasn't changed but i'm not living in the
same place

it's useless to respond respond to
anything i've said i've said
i hate to quote this song all wrong but
why can't we still be friends

aiming to upset me but you're baffling me with your actions
i am wrong, you are wrong, we subdivide into two fractions
it's made me retarded, i wish i didn't let it
everything is upside down
i want those times I can't forget

everything is always falling apart
everything is always falling apart
you know i'd amputate my flaws if it meant that I could be with you
