("bad, let's start the fuckin show, ah?")
[sen dog]
Freak to the funk that no-one else is bringing
sen dog with the funky bilenge
yeah that's the nombre, heard the homey
peace to mellow and frost, and the deporte
sen dog is not kid from the telano
i'm down, another fried hispano
one of the many of the latin deseyano [de-say-ahnyo]
and i got plenty for the jennies tryin to hound dog
but wait, they're clownin on me cause of my language
i have to tell em straight up, it's called spanglish
now who's on the fiend, gala gringo
tryin to get paid, from the funky bilingual
Chorus: b-real and sen dog
Latin lingo baby (funky bilingual) funky bilingual
yeah, funky bilingual!
latin lingo baby (funky bilingual) funky bilingual
it's the latin lingo!
[sen dog]
From the entro, when i come in, suckers fronted
they mida, another bilingual from bein a
banga, como ejemplo, check the tempo
ahh, it's that chingonla instrumental
ya no usted, como somos
