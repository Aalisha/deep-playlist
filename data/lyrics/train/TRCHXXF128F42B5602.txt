You took me to the city baby
From a little country town
Got me way up here in the city baby
And now you want to put me down
Said come on boy let's leave here
This place ain't where it's at
So I packed up my clothes
And I took to the road
Now I can't get back

You've got me knockin' baby
You won't let me in
You've got me knockin' baby
You won't let me in
