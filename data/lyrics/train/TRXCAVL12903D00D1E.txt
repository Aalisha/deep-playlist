Your satin skin
Has been rubbed in faint
What is her name?
What is your name?

You're more than fine
Oh, you're bigger than life
What is your name?
Your real name?

Please tell me!
Harmony!
Just between you and me!

Oh, I took a hard hit today
Oh, and the laws makes my noice!
it makes my noice!
And I shiver in this cold, cold hearth!

You smile like someone I once knew
It's that look in your eyes,
In your eyes.
Oh, Harmony!
Its like a door to a vast unknown
