Eye of newt for gods of love and hate and war before us
We pray and dance and scheme
And conjure pagan ritual lust

We cast our spell into the sky
We sacrifice a life to live/ some one must die
He's calling, he's calling, he's calling

There will be blood tonight
A sacrifical lamb in white
There will be blood tonight
The cermony flames ignite
There will be blood tonight
A virgin drowns in the sea of light

Come all you faithful while the moon's full
Just believe and thy work will be done here
