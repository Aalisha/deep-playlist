rap 1:
baby's in the parlour
waiting for the rain
beating like a hammer
washing out her pain
clearing like the one
seven years ago
when her first big love
melted like snow

back then she doubet
if she would ever find a man
who could love her that way
the same way again
and just when she thought
she's living in vain
the man of her dreams
came like the rain

refrain:
when love is the price
freedom is the cost
love is the price
...
