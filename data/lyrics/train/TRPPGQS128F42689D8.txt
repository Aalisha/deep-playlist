Hey you, follow with a force-fed plastic hype.
Hey you, shallow like the rest of your empty life.
Hey you, claiming that you're real from back in the day.
Hey you, everybody knows that you're really just fake.

Set it off right with a bright light coming through.
Set it off right with a fist-fight attitude.
Set it off right with a hate you dicipline.
Set it off right when we get the truth back again.
