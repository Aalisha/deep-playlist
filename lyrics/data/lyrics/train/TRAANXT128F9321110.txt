(Alecia Elliott/Gary Baker/Frank J.Myers)

I've heard your voice, I've felt your touch
But only in dreams have I felt this much
I've not seen your face, I don't know your name
But here in my heart you have a place
I'm not for sure, but I believe
You're out there waiting for me

I'm waiting for you, biding my time
Keeping my heart from crossing over the line
Counting the days until my dreams come true
