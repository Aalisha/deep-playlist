Five friendly aliens rode into town
Far off pavillions have crumbled down
Don't call me heavy, i'm not heavy
Don't call me heavy, and lay me down
I won't be heavy
I'm waiting for the ship to come down
And take me to a place
Far out in space
Where i'm un-usual
Don't even try to drag, a lake, for my soul
And even if you try, to track me down
I'll be un-trackable
I'll be where i wont feel alien no no

Five wasted decades of you and me
...
