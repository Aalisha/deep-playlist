I am
I am searching
I am searching for faith, beauty and hip-hop
I am searching for all those who died between hip hop and heaven
And all souls set adrift and free from bedlam
With headstrong lyrics that rise like smoke from silver incense burners
I wonder who stole the thunder with the rasping edge
And who banged for baptisms with butterflies, serpentine roads and sunsets broken by cicadas
Have we really lost our century in an hour?
Are we devoured by blind faith in the powers that be?
Are these words as tense as drawn bow strings?
Shall we rebuild the tears like sap from rubber trees?
Answer me!
