Girl and the Sea

Tonight the
Tonight the hills are watching her
As she runs towards the sea
Yeah she runs so she be free

And of all the friends and enemies sheâ€™s made along the way
They are no where in her thoughts
As she dives beneath the waves

And he's the one that you've seen sometimes on TV
And his shirt is on the ground
While he's tackled by police
And the parcel that he throws across the bridge into the creek
It'll flow towards the sea
...
