Desires in conquest to murder her, maim her
Progress possession in blackmail entrails to
Pursuit your end for regret with shame no end to shade
Bait her in comfort complete then move to kill

Red ink, spills from her veins
Your quill still draws her in
Red ink, spills from her veins
In curses, in cursive

This is regret in it's purest, a simple plan here
You're on the trail of the hunted, haunted now
Smiling and nodding, she'll go without a fight
To your delight, she's unaware, she's helpless in your sights

Red ink, spills from her veins
...
