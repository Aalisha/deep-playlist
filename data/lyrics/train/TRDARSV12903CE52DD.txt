I know that hope weighs on your mind, lost within the seams
It seems like we lose ourselves in between.
But the harder things become, the harder you push away.
Oh baby, yeah baby, it kills me.

You said it, you said it
I'll take you at your word.
Promises that you can't keep
It's getting harder to hold on.
You said it, you said it
Don't ever let me fall.
Don't give up because you're losing
(you haven't lost).

In time you'll find that we can sober up
Clean up any dirt so we can open up.
These wounds have been open for forever now.
Come on, be strong.
