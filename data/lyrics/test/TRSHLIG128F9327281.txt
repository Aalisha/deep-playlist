The snow is falling like I knew it would
Carolers are already singing
Last year is all that I can think about
Every time I hear sleigh bells ringing

But I know
That when summer came I pushed you away
I should have never let you go, no
Now all I'm really trying to say is

I want you to come home
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
I miss you so much, you're all that I want
I know that there won't be a Christmas without you
I miss you, come home

I remember all the love we made
I miss your stocking on the fireplace
