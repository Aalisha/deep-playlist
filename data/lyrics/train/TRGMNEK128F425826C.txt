She looks like the type of girl who could ride a dirt bike
She looks like the type of girl who'd go wherever I like
We could talk about Freud and motorcycle leather
No matter what I say she'll laugh and think I'm clever
And all I gotta do is get the guts to walk up and see
If she's the type of girl who'd talk to me...

She looks like the type of girl who could skate a half pipe
She looks like the type of girl, who could win a cat fight
...
