I've found the sweet haven of sunshine at last
Jesus abiding above
His pure arms around me are lovingly cast
Sweetly He tells His love

refrain:
The tempest is o'er
(The danger, the tempest forever is o'er)
I'm safe evermore
(My anchor is holding, I'm safe ever more)
What gladness, what rapture is mine, the danger is past
(The water is peaceful, the danger is past)
I'm anchored at last
...
