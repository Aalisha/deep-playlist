Doomsday party is starting out

Silhouettes flicking in dead lights
Ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit
We burst in solid centigrade
Heat transfer amplified

Kinetic figures all around
Dangerous girls in overdrive
Blood pressure widening our eyes
Ecstatic, polarized

Watch now, the sun i s fading away
And still the skyline is glowing in bright white
Let's drown in such an assembly
Let's yell until it all turn to black
(Doomsday party is starting out)
