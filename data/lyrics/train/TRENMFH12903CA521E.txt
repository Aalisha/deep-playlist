"Searching"

Ad lib:
You're... mine
You're... mine
You're... mine
You're... mine

Searching,
For that something that I'll never find
In another place, another time
Searching
For that something that I can believe
And without a doubt that I can see

All the many roads I've travelled
Gone so far and done so much
...
