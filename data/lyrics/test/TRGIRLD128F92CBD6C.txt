With a tender love
You filled my lonely days
You made me need you, darling
In so many ways

But you no longer
Come around very much
And lately there's no
Tenderness in your touch

Where did it go
That warm and tender feeling
Where did it go
That love that I believed in

You filled my life
With so much meaning
It's empty now
Now that you're leaving me

[CHORUS]
Just look what you've done
You've turned my dreams to dust
