I can't sleep when I think about the times we're living in
I can't sleep when I think about the future I was born into
Outsiders dressed up like Sunday morning
With no Berlin wall, what the hell you gonna do?

It's a new year, I'm glad to be here
It's a fresh spring, so let's sing
In 2080 I'll surely be dead
So don't look ahead, ever look ahead
It's a new year, I'm glad to be here
It's a fresh spring, so let's sing
And the moon shines bright on the water tonight
So we won't drown in the summer sound

If you find me, I'll be sitting by the water fountain
Picket signs, letdowns, meltdown on Monday morning
But it's all right, yeah, it's all right, yeah, it's all right, yeah, it's all right
It's all right
'Cause in no time, they'll be gone, I guess I'll still be standing here
