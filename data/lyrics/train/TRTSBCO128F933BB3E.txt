Everyone knows that I'm rightfully yours
So bring out your dirt from your previous wars
So lay thee to rest 'cause I'm chasing away
All the dust that you're leaving behind

Because love ain't gonna let you down
Love ain't gonna let you down no more
Because love ain't gonna let you down
Love ain't gonna let you down no more
'Cause I'll turn your world around
And love ain't gonna let you down

So you wear your heart like a brooch for all to see
But the blood that pumps through, so will you save that for me?
I've sweetened my tongue and I've sharpened my words and my wit
...
