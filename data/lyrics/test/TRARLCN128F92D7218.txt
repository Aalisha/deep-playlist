Girl and boy
Everythin' in full swing
Heads or tails
Doesn't make a difference

Beneath the glamour
There was always gonna be
Amateur dramatics
Alot of bad behavior

I would see
Glasses on the table
One, two, three
Only you and me

Wearing nothin'
In the lap of luxury
Sip it slowly
Not a leg to stand on

Take my money
Twist our paper
Leave the table
Bad behaviour

I got my spies
Swift to every consultlate
Be my eyes
Tell me what i never see

Cos a ghost
Dont fear a lover
Nothin' teath blank ah
Get ready for the credit clubber

Secret moore
Gettin' it together
With a big fat bowl
...
