The poets say that all who love are blind.
But I'm in love and I know what time it is.
The good book says go seek and ye shall find.
Well I have sought and my what a climb it is.
My life(or love?) is just like the weather, it changes with the hour
when he's near I'm fair and warmer and when he's gone,
i'm cloudy with showers.
An emotion like the ocean, it's either sink or swim.
When a women loves a man like I love him.

Never treats me, sweet and gentle, the way he should.
