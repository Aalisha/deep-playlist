Days are growing shorter the night is closing in
time is so much older and hope is getting thin

We seem quite content believing nothing can go wrong so we go on, we go on

Lost in some euphoria we dream our lives away
Certain that tomorrow will be better than today

We seem quite content to do exactly as we please
Let it set our minds at ease and we go on

So we look to the Miracle of Love
So we look to the Miracle of Love

Truth is our deception and pleasure is our friend
