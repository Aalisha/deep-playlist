It's one step to slip
Off the edge, to trip
And roll tumbling over everything standing in the way
That's bled dry and decayed

All and all, we walk or crawl, either way still covering ground
In banners or bandages
All and all, we walk or crawl, dressed up right or naked and plain
In banners or bandages

I'll call up fears to meet
...
