I've got to find some feelin' in my skin and bones
(I've got to find some feelin' that I've never known)
I can't hide, hide, hide when I'm close to home
(I can't run for cover when I'm close to home)

There's no day like tomorrow, there's no time like today
(There's no time like the present yeah, that's what they say)
There's no joy only sorrow when you choose to escape
(There's no joy only sorrow, yeah, we need to get away)

Sometimes I climb high above the streets and signs
Clean air, sunshine, how strange this feeling fine
Wake me early, I don't want to waste the day
Come now, let's go on escape
...
