Sworn I would not return here
Now that has proved untrue
I don't know why?
I hold this deep inside me and I'll let no one through
Defy me... deny me... I need you to end this
I look to myself to see and the years have grown so long
Am I weak and now I feel pulverized
Consequences I reap by myself
Those of you who don't know what I see.endless fight for my beliefs
I am alone here
Here's the place where I take my stand
I'll not be held down again
Broken no longer with no regrets, I am my own
Once you would watch me cry but never would you intervene
Now it's my turn to be free from all this pain
You cannot pretend to like what I am
You cannot change the past... do not even care
You won't ever take me, You cannot see, break me
