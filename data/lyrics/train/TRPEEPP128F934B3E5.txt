It came from dismal shadows
Creeping, sudden, from behind.
fell upon my merry whistle
darkened me at heart and sight.
Back with me, one again with the memory
Again I behold the ruins
that I left when I was all devoured by wrath.

Last night out in the timber
a thousand torrent's vehemence
came rushing through my veins
Up my throat and filled the eyes,
And then that I knew
all pain will be undone
When I pack my bags
And depart for lonely roads

And with courageous verve I stride
chop the heads off flowers aside, still wondering

How come you never bleed
...
