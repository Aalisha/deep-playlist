You super sexy real thing
Turn me on
You super sexy real thing
Do me good
Turn me on
Im looking out for something wild
To take away my bitter sweet desire
Its physical, funky, magical
You're my dirty dream
So make it come true
You got no reason to be
So offended by me
Please excuse me if im coming on strong
I dont care if friends are
People in high places
Just you come on strong
You super sexy real thing
