Facing ice in the wind
Brace yourself for the fall
Neon lights, all colours will bleed
Gotta fight for it all

In the circle we dance to be free
Wait relentlessly, please let me be
Music protects me in tonight
Rise to the call

[X2]
Whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa
Whoa oh whoa
Now my back's to the wall

Endless nights, they begin
Side by side, see them fall
Takes your mind on a mystical spin
Full of life curtain calls
