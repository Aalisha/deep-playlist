Mary's standing at his door
She knocks, he lets her in
The flame that flickered long before
When they were only kids

Just one thing
A thought inside her head
She turns to him
He looks at her and says

Every moment in your life
Comes down to what you hold inside
Looking back on days gone by
I'd always think of you

Take a picture from our past
We tried to make the moment last
I wish I would have told you
I just wanna hold you tonight

Tonight
