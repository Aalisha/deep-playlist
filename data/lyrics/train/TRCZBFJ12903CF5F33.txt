Like a rose in winter
Cause your soul to splinter
Tear you down
Until your body cannot fight
So I carry on
Through the icy fog I feel the night
Though my journey's long
I'll fly the skull and bones and hold on tight
Haven't long to live before we die
Then suddenly we step into the night
Where shadows fool your eyes
...
