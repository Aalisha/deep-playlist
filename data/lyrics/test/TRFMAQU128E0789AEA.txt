I thought I was moving but my legs were broken
Words were coming out but they were left unspoken
Maybe I was dreaming in my head, in my head.

Memories were noted but I hadn't lived them

Funny how the hurtful voices seem to slip away.

Where Am I Now
I don't know how
I wound up in this place again.
How Am I now
