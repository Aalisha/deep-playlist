I just wanna remember you
The way you're standin' there
With that 'hurry home'-look in your eyes
And flowers on the table

Sometimes I see too much
Sometimes I see too little
Sometimes shadows fall, darken all
And cover up the fable

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Everytime that I see your face
...
