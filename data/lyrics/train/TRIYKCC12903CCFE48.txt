Bang bang you're dead
Did not, did too
Stop diddy-bopping buddy
Bouncing Betty on you

Bang bang you're dead
Did not, did too
Stop diddy-bopping buddy
Bouncing Betty on you

I try to tell you but you just don't understand
You've got my entire life in your hands
Vive le rock, vive le rock
Oh well, you don't know what you're missing
'Cos you don't know what you got

And if the enemy don't see it your way
Be smart, play dead, live to fight a new day
And vive le rock, vive le rock
Oh well you don't know what you're missing
