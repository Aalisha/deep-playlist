I can feel you wantin' to fall whenever I'm with you
I can tell you wanna give in the same way that I do
Love can be a hurtin' thing when faithless hearts deceive
I know you've been the fool before but baby you won't with me.

If only you believe, if only you believe
In love, it's what we make it
In love, we've got to be strong
In love, it's where I believe that we belong.

I find a reason for believing dreams come true
And I know enough to know I'm in love with you
