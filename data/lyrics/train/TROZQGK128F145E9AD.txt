We met Monday night
Where my friend bartends
And always gives me drinks for free
I caught you starin
Were you comparing the guy youre talking with to me?
Then you said, "This place is dead"
"And this drink's going to my head (Take me home)"
I will if you chill
There's still time to kill and this night just started looking better

chorus:
She bought herself a guitar
She learned a few chords
She wrote me a song and it goes like this
Get out, Get dressed your just like the rest
There's only one thing your after
