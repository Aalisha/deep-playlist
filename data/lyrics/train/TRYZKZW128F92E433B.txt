So you? re leaving in the morning
On the early train
I could say everything? s alright
I could pretend and say goodbye

Got your ticket, got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that? s the way it goes
I could pretend and you won? t know that I was lying

? Cause I can? t stop loving you
