This is a mean old world, try livin' by yourself
This is a mean old world, try livin' by yourself
Can't get the one your lovin' have to use somebody else
I got the blues, gonna pack my bags and go
Yes, I got the blues, gonna pack my bags and go
Yes, I guess you really don't love me
I'm just an unlucky so and so.
Solo
Sometimes I wonder why - can your love be so cool
Yeah, sometimes I wonder why - can your love be so cool
Yes, I guess you don't really don't love me
I'm just an unlucky so and so
