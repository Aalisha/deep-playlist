No, don't stop
Just feel me all the way to the top
With your love there's no ending
Just give me everything that you've got

All alone, I don't want to be, without you
Just be near me
Making love to you's a habit
I've just gotta have it
Don't even think about leaving me

No, because
I can't get enough
I can't get enough no, no, no
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
No once is not enough
