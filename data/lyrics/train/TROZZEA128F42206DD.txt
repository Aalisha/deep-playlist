They're throwing people on the backs of trucks
then they drive them to the edge of town
where they make them dye their hair jet black
and they push them in a club of sound
where they play the un-american charts
there's no chance of going home alone
you're as likely as a headache
and everybody knows
you've taken off your clothes once before
still you think that you're a nightingale
because you wanna sing the songs of night
but the strings that you're connected to
have got you trapped in this car crash tight
...
