Once was a thought inside my head,
'Fore I'd reach thirty I'd be dead.
Now somehow on and on I go-o-o.
I keep on rollin' with the flow.

Folks said that I would change my mind.
I'd straighten up and do just fine.
Ahh, but I still love rock and ro-o-oll.
I keep on rollin' with the flow.

While guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did.
I've got a lot of crazy friends,
And they forgive me of my sins.
