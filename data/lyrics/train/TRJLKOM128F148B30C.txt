Well everytime I move Every step I make
You know I just can't seem to take the right direction

I'm always wrong I'm never right
Right or wrong there always seems to be a correction

And I give everything I got
And they take Take Take Take Take everything I'm giving

My back is tired My legs both ache
In this life There is no cake This life I'm livin'

CHORUS:
I stand alone today WHY YOU FEEL Don't ask me why I feel
...
