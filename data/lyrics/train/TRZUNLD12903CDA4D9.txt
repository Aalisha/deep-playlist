Misery likes company
I like the way that sounds
I've been trying to find the meaning
So I can write it down

Starin' out the window
It's such a long way down
I'd like to jump
But I'm afraid to hit the ground

I can't write a love song the way I feel today
And I can't sing no song of hope, I got nothing to say
Life is feeling kind of strange, since you went away
I sing this song to you, wherever you are
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

I'm tired of watching TV
It makes me want to scream
Outside the world is burning
Man it's so hard to believe
