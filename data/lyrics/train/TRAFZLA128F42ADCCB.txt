I gotta keep dancing'
Smiling
To keep from breaking apart
I gotta keep dancing'
Smiling
To cover up my broken heart
I began to spin
Please help me pretend, that I don't see
Just walked in the door
I'm weak in the knees
But I gotta make believe
That I'm hurt-free
I just can't let him know
That my heart is, breaking apart
Music rescue me
I gotta keep dancing'
Smiling
To keep from breaking apart
I gotta keep dancing'
Smiling
