Something in your eyes
makes me want to lose myself
makes me want to lose myself
in your arms
there's something in your voice

makes my heart beat fast
hope this feeling lasts
the rest of my life
if you knew how lonely my life has been

and how long i've been so alone
if you knew how i wanted someone to come along
and change my life the way you've done
...
