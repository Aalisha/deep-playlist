Down south, the banjos cry too,
Everybody whose sayin' hidee hi too,
While the moon beams danced on the Bayou,
That's how rhythm was born

They've praised the mighty forgiver,
They've washed their sins in the river,
Cold water made 'em all shiver,
That's how rhythm was born

Folks came down,
Gathered round that old swiney shore,
Caught the craze and sang his praise,
They all cried why don't you give us some more

Down south, the banjos cry too,
Everybody's singin' hidee hi too,
While the moon beams danced on the Bayou,
That's how rhythm was born
...
