Get in!
Let's go!
We've still got such a long way to go
We got a 10 hour drive
And a half tank of gas
We got seven people stuffed
In the back of the van
We wonder why we do it
Well it's just cuz we haven't got a better plan

What can you do
When you got nothing to lose?
I'm tellin you
I do what I wanna do
I always knew
I won't stop until I'm through!
