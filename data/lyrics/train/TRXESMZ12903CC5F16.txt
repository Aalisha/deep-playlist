Let's forget the big cold buttons
And see if we can track through with warm boots
With shock ivory helmet eyes
We'll watch storming through keyholes in your living room
And there we'll listen to the chatter of our inner architecture
Now

You swear that photosynthesis
Was never an intention of the selfish sun
But all the months that start with "J"
Should be replaced with under-represented ones
