"Holy son please save us all
Rise up and do not fall
Brought from the light to rule the earth
Burning angel screaming since birth
No use to fight the strongest will
Tempting powers from the dark side

Burn the cross!
Break the chains that hold you down
Burn the cross!
To set you free, to free your will
Burn the cross!
Light the night!
Burn the cross!
Burn the cross forevermore
