I remember careless days on the waterfront
Birds and sidewalks, ice-cream parlors to slow us off
We had everything we needed
and the air was filled with gasoline and dust

We would walk back home again on deserted streets
Slept with open windows keeping our nightmares clean
We were ignorant and beautiful
and blinded by the brightly shining light

Will it ever be repeated
Will it follow anywhere
...
