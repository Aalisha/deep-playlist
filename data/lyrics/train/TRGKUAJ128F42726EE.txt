Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
If you believe that you get out what you put in
You better move on 'cause there's no time to fool around
All the right intentions and promises don't mean a thing
If you can't get the job done
If you insist on makin' life a compromise
You're gonna wake up to find your world has come undone
All the right intentions and promises are never enough
And soon you find it all gone
Now time has come, make up your mind to be real
Baby, baby, baby
Good love, precious and gifted
Can't stand waitin' forever
Good love, no greater feelin'
No one could ever deny
Stop wastin' all the good love
You're takin' your time comin' around to let me know
Now you better decide 'cause there's a limit to your games
