I get up and look outside
Not a cloud up in the sky
The flowers are just coming into bloom
All the lovers walk together hand in hand
But paradise is nothing without you

I didn't move your coffee cup
The cigarettes that you gave up
All memories of things we used to do
Now I don't even bother with my make-up
I just wanna turn around and wake up with you

To hold on forever
A lifetime you said
So you can see it came as a surprise
After all the promises you made
...
