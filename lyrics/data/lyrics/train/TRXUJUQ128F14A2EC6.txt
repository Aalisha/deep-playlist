In the dark there ain't no distractions
Take it off the mask won't let you see
Ain't lettin' up till you unleash all your emotions
I'll be here waiting got love, if you want it
Aw, we'll take it as it comes

Touch by touch, little by little
I'll unchain your heart don't be afraid of the dark
Take my hand, little by little
We'll break down these walls don't be afraid of the dark
No, don't be afraid of the dark
