Sometimes I cry when you don't call
I'm beginnin' to think you don't love me at all
But you are still my baby I want the whole world to know
I just love love love love love you love you so
Friends are tryin' to tell me that I'm just a fool your love don't mean a thing
But I keep hoping someday if you'll see same things my way
