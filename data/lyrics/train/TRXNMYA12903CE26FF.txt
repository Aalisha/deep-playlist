They say that Bush could be my president,
but really InI don't care.
They say Cheney makes my decisions,
but he don't, so I'm just not there.
and I'm gonna see the same lies
coming in the next 4 years,
so pardon me if I don't cry when
your election goes the way it did.

Chorus
I need some peace in a time of war,
