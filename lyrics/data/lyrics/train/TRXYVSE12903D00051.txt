Got no fuckin' birds 
Ain't got no fuckin' money 
The dog don't fuckin' recognise me 
Get chucked outta my fuckin' house next week 

Well I take myself from my dirty bed 
Can't find my clothes, can't find my head 
And the DT's all over me 
My eyes are bloodshot, I can't see 
Well who's gonna make me happy 
Feeling so down again 
Who's gonna make me happy 
Feeling down again 

So I run through the streets 
I gotta find my man 
I make my cash the best I can 
...
