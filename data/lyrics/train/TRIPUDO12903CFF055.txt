[Verse 1]
Mama wanna play by the rules... G
Gets out the pin
Boy... yah lookinhealthy
Wanna live large
Take charge that's priority
Who's the man in front of me?
Who's my authority?
Get past that and live another day
But the wrong way
Uhh... Yah family went the other way
Gots to be down and stops clownin
Well I did my dirt
Bet cha did yah dirty?
Skirt to the next episode
Tell me! Tell me!
Waz goin down... Are still my buddy
Or just another bosa
Let me now I gotta go
Hit my next flow
And then I'm out the do
And as a matter a fact
I'm feelinshady
I think I'm goin crazy
Uhh! The room just faded me
Best thinkintah get a grip
Or else I'm gonna pass out
Or better yet I'm gonna blackout
