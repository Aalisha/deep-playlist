I like tight jeans, dark shades,
When I walk the ground shakes (boom)
Like an 808 (boom)
You appreciate my lean
Body nice shape,
Wanna take me on a date (move)
You've got what it takes (move)
You better have some cake.

I like, how I'm catching your eyes,
I like, how I don't even try,
I like you, I like you boy,
I like you, boy.

You might mistake me for heart breaker,
'cause there's blood on the floor,
I'm hoping you will see, there's something good in me,
Never seen before,
Might mistake me for a heart breaker,
'cause there's blood on the floor,
I know you're shaking me,
My heart is there for keeps, there's an open door.

I know I can be a good, good girl,
