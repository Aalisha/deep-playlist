Featuring gangsta blac

[playa fly]

You rather see me abolished then see lil flizy demolished
And do some damage and punish and do away with your garbage
To many stairs and mugs instead of smiles and hugs
Like womack looking for love for us wherever it was
With darker faces of hate who wait and prey that i banish

And if they could man they would take mr.flizy and banish
Or just eradicate ibn eternal breathing suspension
Nor be the blood in my heart in lines of chalk on position
Then know so many would laugh and say thats good for his ass
But what would minnie and bill do?, if fly lay for they pass
My circumstances and chances, i take affallies and fumbles
When fly stay flat on my feet, i hear no giggles and mumbles
You sit more silent then lambs, i blind shine the land
But not as hard as i can, cause its to fatal to stand
And this beneficent gift from g.o.d fly keep
Without him givin me speech ill blow my brains to my feet.
And playa

Chorus:
Fly write sum bump to take the pain out
Cause if he wasn't high he probably blow his brains out
He's hopeless, this shit was in us as a baby
Taylor b and minnie may mafia gone crazy
(repeat 2x)
