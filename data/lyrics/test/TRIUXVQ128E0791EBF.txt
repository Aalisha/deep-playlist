Listen uh I met this guy and uh you know I don't get down like that but we were together for a while and you know things
didn't work out but I can't be mad with him you know cause we had some moments Yo I'll explain listen

We wrote fairy tales of how we'll live in castles tight like Hansel and Gretal and grow old and settle in a town that we'll
tighten with our marry day we got a love like that like everyday like everyway
I cannot stay at yours tonight we can hold tight love bite and share some soul we can pick and roll lose control and let me
take it like how I let you break it don't forget We can get high on each other insert a time for it through the night and
back into the morning can't crack the habit you see I'm feening I'm needing some more and you got me grinning like it's
money that I'm winning No way is this ending cause you got me feeling purer than thou show me how you do this thing cause
you got me singing like, Yo, for real...

He had me singing like some kinda opera shit I don't know where we went with it, it was like... I used to turn to him
