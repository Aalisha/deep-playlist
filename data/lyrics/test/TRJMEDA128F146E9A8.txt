Day one
i stumbled through hello on 5th avenue
day two
we grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
caught a movie on day fourteen
and day sixty-seven she said i love you to me
Oh what a feeling
what a wonderful emotion
yeah what a life
counting my blessings and knowing...
ooh we had our ups and downs
all along the way
she had a chance to leave but chose to stay
what a beautiful day
...
