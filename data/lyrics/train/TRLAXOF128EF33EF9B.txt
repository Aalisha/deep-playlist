Your head seems out of faze
And I've seen so many ways
How you made apologies
I felt disgusted

All the gifts you gave to me
It was plain for me to see
You leave no stone unturned
To win affection

To be my friend 'til the bitter end
Where we shall stand with each other
And dream of days and dream of ways
When we shall be one

You stalk me on the phone
