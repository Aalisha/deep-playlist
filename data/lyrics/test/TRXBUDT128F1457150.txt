Tell me, just one more time, the reason why you must leave;
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me
Tell me again but don't think you'll convince me.

You said, about fallin' in love again you'd rather be dead;
When someone breaks your heart you cry your eyes red
There's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.
