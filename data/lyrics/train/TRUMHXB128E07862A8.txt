Ah Redman, do you feel that the blacks in your community
Are still mad at the racial situation? Yeah they still mad
And if you don't take that funny smirk off your face
I'ma kick your over three hundred ghetto-related crimes happened
In New York, New Jersey alone still the saga continues

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up, I got the jammie to your vest punk
Don't make a move, before I choose to make your guts run
All over the block, 'cause my stomach's in a knot
And it growls twenty-four hours a day around the tick-tock

I got roaches and vats of the rats carryin' bats and gats
So I 'fore I snack jack
Because I'm not down with water from the hydrant
My moms takin' a bath and my brother's next arrivin'

I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I haven't had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squat up, 'cause I'ma set up this kid, carryin' loot out
From burger king and what I'ma do is

Run up on him, snatch the bag of money, then bust the dummy
'Cause my man when I think of a plan there's no shorts take
'Cause I pack jammies inside of my nordface, coat
Had the black brother on scope
No joke's what I am 'cause the man's a pure pro

Yo my man you got a light?
Yeah, give me the effin' money too G, yo stop stop stop

Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well so I got down to the business
