Hate is what I am
Cuz underneath this heart
There beats the heart of man

You'll wear your crown
When you're lyin' 6 feet underground

Don'tcha think it's odd
Man was created in the image of God

All you martyrs and saviours
Go through the same door
Listen all you butchers, saints and sinners
We've all been here before
