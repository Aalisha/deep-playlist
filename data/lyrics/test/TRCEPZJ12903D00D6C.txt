Another day dies in the world I've made
It's a tragic and unsung passing
The zero sum of the time I've left
Claims another victim
Looking at all of the things I broke
Thinking that things could be different
If I'd only tried

Hand trembling
Sweat breaking on this brow
Exhausted now but the
Nightmares just won't let me sleep

Another night falls on the world you've made
And it's as black as a hate-filled heart
Strangle the love and reject the call
To rebuild this place
...
