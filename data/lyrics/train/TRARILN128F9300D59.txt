Precious Loretta Lee Jones
I wanna take you on home, I gotta take ya
Lord I never do you wrong

I wanna take you to the seashore
I'd like to take you back to my house
Ain't gotta a house by the seashore
Gonna figure a way to take you anyhow

Precious Loretta Lee Jones
I wanna take you on home, I gotta take ya
Lord I never do you wrong

I wanna take you to the seashore
