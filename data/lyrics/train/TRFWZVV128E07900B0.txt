How many times must I get up
Look out and see the same old view
How many times must I wear the same old things
And hear the same old things that I do, I do
How many times must I clean this face my face
And how many times must I shine my shoes, oh Lord
How many times must I drink the same old drink
And dream the same old dreams that I do
