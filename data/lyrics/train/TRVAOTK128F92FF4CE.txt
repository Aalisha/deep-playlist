He sends her roses and lines he composes
things a lady loves.
Well he's there to hold her
when she needs a shoulder
if life gets too rough
Oh now that she's left
I keep kicking myself whenever
I start thinking back
He says he needs her,
tells her he loves her,
why didn't I think of that?

When she gets down
Well he's always around her,
he makes her smile again.
He mends her heartaches,
remembers her birthday,
and tries to be a friend.
Now that she's gone
I know what I did wrong,
it's all so simple in fact.
Well he says he wants her,
can't live without her,
