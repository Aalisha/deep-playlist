Lay down, sleep my little darling
I'll be nothing when you're gone
Lay down just like in a coffin
Then I'll have nothing but a song
Could I leave you in a coffin for real
And just leave you in a church

Lay down, Leave you'll be lonely
I know I won't go
Lay down
Sleep you'll be lonely
I know I won't go
It's not my turn
...
