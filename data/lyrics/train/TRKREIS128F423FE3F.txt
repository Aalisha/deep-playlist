He's got it all
He's got it all
Listen to me

I just got finished
Giving the hotel manager
Back the room key
And I paid my bill

You see, I was outside in the car
In the shadows of the parking lot
Telling this woman that I was with
How happy she had made me
And she had made me feel real good

Kissing and hugging
And all of a sudden
Another car pulled up
On the parking lot

And, people
I couldn't believe my eyes
'Cause the woman that was
Sitting in the front seat
Besides another dude
Turned out to be my old lady

There she was with another man
Oh, oh, it hurt me so bad
And the only thing I could say about it

Oh, I was checking out
And my old lady
She was checking in

You see, I was with my other woman
What hurt me so bad
...
