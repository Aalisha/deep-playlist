Striking down the enemy
Fighting hand to hand
Troops are thrusting onwards
Time to take command
Ready to devour
On the attack
Bodies lie dismembered
Maimed, killed, and hacked

Draw fast, cut first
Live hard, die hard
Feel the point of the blade

Lunging like an animal, killing all in sight
Going for the throat, living for the fight
In a bath of bloodshed, mixing with the sweat
Crawling through the barbwire, put it to the test
