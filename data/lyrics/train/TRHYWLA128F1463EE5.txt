Any time love is on the table the stakes are high
But I thought this was love so I laid it all on the line
You nearly took everything I had
Never knew I could hurt so bad
But I least I left with every pieace of this heart of mine

(Chorus)
Im walking away a winner
Im walking away from a losing game
With my pride intact and my vision back I can say
I know where Im going and I know I'll be alright
Im walking away a winner
Walking back into my life
