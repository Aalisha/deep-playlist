Too, too many
There's so, so many
There's too, too many
Too many of us
And Everyone's hoping
To be the one spun
Straw into gold
And outshine the sun

It's fool's gold glowing
Nothing is growing
Nothing is flowing
From these taps

It's fool's gold glowing
Nothing is flowing
We're just seagulls
Pulling at scraps

Leave, gotta leave today
...
