Darkness had us covered when we split from Minnesota in the morning
In the rain
Black as I was feeling and the street was slick and shiny as a snake
Each of us was a-humming to a half forgotten echo
Hangin' over in the brain
Tappin' time and thinking of the time we never had the time to take

Losing to the rising cost of living high and loving hard
And leavin' every yesterday behind
Learning every bridge you cross, is burning down before you're off and
running
