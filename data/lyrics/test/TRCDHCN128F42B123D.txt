Now all crew come get some sunshine
summer time vibes come back again
tell all your friends man!

Groovin' on a summer afternoon.
Groovin' couldn't get away too soon.

Now every woman every man come listen this one
from the heartical dan Mr. Pato Banton.
Me comin' in c-comin' in c-comin' in strong
with a positive summer time vibration.
Cause in the winter me can't take the cold
body start shiver when the breeze start blow.
Car can't start cause the engine froze
can't move me fingers, can't feel me toes.
