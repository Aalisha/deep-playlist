Take, Take 'til there's nothing
Nothing to turn to
Nothing when you get through
Won't you break?
Scatter pieces of all I've been
Bowing to all I've been
Running to
Where are you?
Where are you?

Did
Did you leave me unbreakable?
You leave me frozen
I've never felt so cold
I thought you were silent
...
