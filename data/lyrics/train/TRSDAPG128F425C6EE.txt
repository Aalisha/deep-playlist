Yo, this is mood control (yo-ho!)
Saying you might as well pay attention (this is mood control)
You can't afford free speech
(mood, mood, mood, someone's funking with the mood!)

Mood control is designed to render funkable
Ideas brought to you by the makers of Mr. Prolong
Better known as Urge Overkill
The pimping of the Pleasure Principle

Oh, but we'll be pecking lightly
Like a woodpecker with a headache
'Cause it's cheaper to funk
Than it is to pay attention
You dig?
Huck-a-buck
A-Lo and behold, someone's funking with the mood control

When you're taking every kind of pill
(deprogram, program)
Nothing seems to ever cure your ill
(peck me lightly like a woodpecker with a headache)

When you're taking every kind of pill
(Funk! The nonprofit organization)
Nothing seems to ever cure your ill
Where'd you get your funk from (where'd you get that funk from?)

Heh! Name that feeling!
Would you trade your funk for what's behind the third door?
The big deal!
Heads I win, tails you lose!

How do you spell relief?
Huck-a-buck, sucker!

When you're taking every kind of pill
(Ho! The bigger the headache, the bigger the pill)
Nothing seems to ever cure your ill

When you're taking every kind of pill
(You deserve a break today)
Nothing seems to ever cure your ill
(Have it your way)
Where'd you get that funk from?
(Ooh, who was that? ha ha ha ha ha ha, ohh ohh ohh)

The salvation of inspiration is the motivation
Fasten your safety belt
While I take you face-to-face with the nosiest computer I know
Where'd you get that funk from?
When I count to ten I want you to jump up! Stay there!
Oh, ho! But don't come down til I Flash the Light.
You deserve a break today, have it your way
Funk is not domestically produced. Ho!
There's nothing that the proper attitude won't render... funkable.
Where'd you get your funk from? Funktism! Hey!

When you're taking every kind of pill
(Mood control!)
Nothing seems to ever cure your ill

When you're taking every kind of pill
(Urge overkill!)
Nothing seems to ever cure your ill
(yeah, ho!)
Where'd you get that funk from?
(Program)
Where'd you get that funk from?
(Deprogram)
(And reprogram)
