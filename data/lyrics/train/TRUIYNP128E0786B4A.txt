I'm here if you want to
I got what you're into
There ain't something so new
That told me it ain't true

Let me be, let me through
'Cos I don't know what to do
I can move, what I mean
But you gotta set me free
Let me be, let me through
Cos I don't know what to do
I can move, what I mean
But I gotta get me
