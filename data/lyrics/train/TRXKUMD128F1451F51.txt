When I go to sleep I pray
I'm waking up to I got you, babe
Like the guy from Groundhog Day
Just wanna live forever this way

Flash back to seventeen
I got my ass kicked by the football team
Another loser on the scene
Editor of the chess club Fanzine

I asked you out for losing truth or dare
The guys were cracking up 'til you said yeah

Pinch me, is this real?
I'm on a one way ticket out of Loserville
Now I'm off the social flat line
Things are so good that I'm
Taking down my star trek shrine

And you're more than just my valentine
You're my ticket outta Loserville
