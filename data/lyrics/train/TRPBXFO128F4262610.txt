city sky comes down like rain
through all the alleys to the sea
i hear footsteps getting louder
drowning in my sleep
painted lies on painted lips
that promise heaven tastes like this
i don't believe that i believed in you
all that money wants

all that money wants
all that money wants

sunday's child will fall through faith
i feel i'm falling out of grace
grey city sky comes down like rain
...
