Look at me, I have to be honest
This isn't a catastrophe, I promise
You and I think differently, it's obvious
Let me help you understand
Remember how you said you'd wait here for me?
Well maybe I just took your word, sorry
Then I hear my father's voice about true friends
You can count them on one hand

Well I got five friends who want me
And I got five friends who need me
If you got five friends you're lucky
