ascend as empires burn
conquistadors ov the promised land
like the sons ov Anak
They shall rise from beyond the dawn
rise as victorious trumpets call
Chimera, Geryon and Thee oh Sphinx!
accompanied by Mars
Jupiter's rays in fearless eyes unrestrained

Astareth!
bring forth the iron rain!
Hekate!
bring forth plagues on an ever failing race!

lead: Nergal

Thou shalt restore the splendor ov Sodom
personification ov Gommorah art Thou
iron-willed marching on ahead
...
