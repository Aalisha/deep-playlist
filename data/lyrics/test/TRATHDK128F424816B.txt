Good intentions pave the way of the human child
Heading for the fork as you walk the path of life
A spell cast from the hiding woods, don't you close your eyes
The snake is waiting anytime to penetrate your mind
Don't you hear voices whispering, incline to walk down

Don't you see the shadow on the wall, angel eyes... the one cast out to fall
Calling me to look up to the sky we follow but we never know oh why

A vision revealing a child down where I've sure never been
An angel who's touching the flame, oh the angel is me
