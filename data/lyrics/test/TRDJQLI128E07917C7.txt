We hear you're leavin'
That's okay
I thought our little wild time
Had just begun

I guessed you kind of scared yourself
You turn and run
But if you have a change of heart
Rikki don't lose that number

You don't wanna call nobody else
Send it off in a letter to yourself
Rikki don't lose that number

It's the only one you own
You might use it if you feel better
When you get home
...
