What is that name on your lips
Is it from the other side don't lie
As the weather sheds it's worst rain
It marks the December when I left her pale and alone

Her last breath gave in so fast
She led me to believe she was the one for me

I am coming for you
You can run, but you cannot hide
I am coming for you, for you

Now you've made a mess out of things and I can't live with this on my mind

I never wanted this
