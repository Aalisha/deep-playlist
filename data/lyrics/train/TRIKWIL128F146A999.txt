You're wasting your time
If you think I can change myself
Cause it looks to me
You'd be better with someone else
So now it's up to you

Leave if you must or
stay if you want
Just make up your mind
I don't want to waste the rest of my life
It's your turn to decide

What you see is what you get
There is no more
If you have to leave
There's no regrets
Just close the door

Take me as I am
