So make sure you love
Like you've never been hurt
And when you dance, dance
Like there's no one watching you

'Cuz You can waste your time
(Redefining the day that music died)
Or you can spend your life
(Guilt free and ostracized)
'Cuz all the fashion
(In the world cannot save you now)
(It's something, I'll write it down for you)
