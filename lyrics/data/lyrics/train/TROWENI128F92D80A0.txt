com'on make a move on me
com'on make a move on me
com'on make a move on me
com'on make a move on me now boy

I've been watching you watching me
what you gonna do?
let's stop playing these silly games
do what you gonna todo

oh you gotta
feel me, heal me chase me chase me
move me sooth me tease me
leave me, trim me, grim me
grill me feel me take me make me
leave me leave me

com'on make a move on me
make a move on me
com'on make a move on me
com'on make a move on me
oh make a move on me
