Be my husband man I be your wife
Be my husband man I be your wife
Be my husband man I be your wife
Loving all of you the rest of your life yeah

If you promise me you'll be my man
If you promise me you'll be my man
If you promise me you'll be my man
I will love you the best I can yeah

Stick the promise man you made me
