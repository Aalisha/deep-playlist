I need another one for the cryin', the cryin'
Be sure about it girls, even though you're singin' it soft and it's pretty
Put it right on the notes, right on the notes, go ahead
I use to cry like a baby
When I did not hear from you
(Cry)
But that's okay, yes, it is, yes, it is
'Cause I'm a big girl now
(She's a big girl now)
I still love you but until you
Make up your mind that you'd be true
(Be true)
