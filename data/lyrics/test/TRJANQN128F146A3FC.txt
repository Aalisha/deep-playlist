We dream the same dream
We want the same thing ...ooh...
We dream the same dream
We want the same thing ...ooh...

Here is my case
We've got no time to waste
Cuz we want the same thing

We're fighting a war
But we don't know what for
Cuz we want the same thing

I know we're different now
Different as night and day
But still I want you
I just want you to stay

I wanna take this chance
I want to be with you
Cuz what you're looking for
I am looking for too

We dream the same dream
...
