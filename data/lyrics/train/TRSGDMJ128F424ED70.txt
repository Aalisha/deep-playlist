Take me to the electric jungle where the animals prowl in the neon night.
We're like rhinestones to rags. Like treasure to trash. Gypsies of the night.
The mask in a masquerade. Rebels and renegades. We're breaking all the rules.
The way we rock. Shock. Rock. Shock. Yeah yeah.

We're rock n' roll outlaws. Always on the run. Rock n' roll outlaws.
We're just having fun. We're rock n' roll outlaws.
There's terror in the town tonight. It's me and you baby.

Glares and stares. We don't care. We just keep walking proud.
We'll shine our colors.
