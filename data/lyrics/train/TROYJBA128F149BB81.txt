If you see my girlfriend cry,
Just keep walking pass her by.
Cos I'm not allowed to talk to her,

Cause who sold her out, Yeah we sold her out!
Who sold her out? Yeah we sold her out!

If you see my girlfriend stop,
Just don't tell her I forgot.
Cause I'm not the one to let her know,

Cause who sold her out, Yeah we sold her out!
Who sold her out? Yeah we sold her out!
