There is a man inside a room in the forest
He sits alone upon the chair his father left him
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark with the radio on

The voice crackles when he says that God will save you

The man stands and pours himself another bourbon
He stops and watches the birds through the winter windows
And the light, and the light from the morning dew
