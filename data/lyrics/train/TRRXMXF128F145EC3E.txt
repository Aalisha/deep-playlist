Pleasure is my thing, I want to tell you.
I'll do what you want me to, or I'll do nothing at all!

(chorus 1)
I just want to be what you want me to be.
Wind it up and see what you want me to be.
I just want to be what you want me to be.
A get me hot and see what you want me to be.

(chorus 2)
If you want me to, I'll do it.
If you want to dance lets get to it.
Let's not take too long let's move it.
Cause if you take too long, you lose it.

(chorus 3)
Who said that funk was done just by one.
Who said that it was never ever done?
Who said the two of us couldn't groove.
