Come on, everybody
It feels like Sunday morning in here

Whenever I think of all that He's done for me
How He came from heaven and He gave me the victory
He's been so good to me, I just can't thank Him enough
When I think of His goodness, I just wanna to praise Him

If I had ten thousand tongues, I still couldn't tell it all
Everytime I stumble, He's there to break my fall
He's made a way for me, opened doors I couldn't see
When I think of His goodness, I just wanna praise Him

(He's been a constant help)
He's been a constant help
 (That's been a constant friend)
A constant friend, is He
 (He's got my every step)
He got every one of my footsteps
 (And yes He'll step right in)

If you don't believe all that He's done for me
Just look at my praise and you'll be able to see
Don't know how you can sit there, I gotta express myself
When I think of His goodness, I gotta praise Him

Now, this is your final chance to give my God some glory
You better stand on your feet and tell the world your story
Clap your hands, do your dance and chime, Hallelujah
When you think of His goodness, then you'll praise Him

(He's been a constant help)
He's been a constant help
 (That's been a constant friend)
Took every breath in Him in a time of need
 (He's got my every step)
He's got every one of my footsteps
 (And yes, He steps right in)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wonder, I wonder, is there anybody here
Who'll help me give God praise
I will bless the Lord, at all times
His praises shall continually be in my mouth
