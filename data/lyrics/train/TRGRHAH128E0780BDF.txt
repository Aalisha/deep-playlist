[2x]
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh

Temperature's Rising
My body's screamin for you
Your eyes pulled me in my soul
Its trembling
As we move closer
Your innocent no longer
Temptations takin over
I wanna feel you inside of me

Let me take off your clothes
Tear up your bodys soul
Hold on and dont let go
I'm losin all control
I wanna hold you close
Capture your mind and soul
Indearing words we told
Im losin all control

I'm losin all control (all control)

[Chorus]
I wantcha body badly baby
