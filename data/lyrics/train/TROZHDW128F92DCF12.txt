When I take you out tonight with me,
honey, here's the way it's gotta be.
You will sit behind a team of snow white horses,
in the slickest rig you've ever seen.

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
when I take you out in my surrey.
When I take you out in my surrey with the fringe on top.

Watch that fringe and see how it flutters,
when I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosy pokes will peek through the shutters
...
