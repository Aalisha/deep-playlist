Feels like some kinda rush
Yeah yeah, so good
Wanna show you how I feel
Can't get enough
Turn it up

It's like some kinda drug
Irresistable lust
It flows through my body
It's lifting me up
So outta control
Taking over my soul
I can't escape it
'Cause I'm caught in the zone

My pulse flows to the tempo
Oh I
(I just can't escape, feeling tied and tied again)
Can't stop 'cause I've never felt so alive

Feels like some kinda rush
Yeah yeah, so good
Wanna show you how I feel
Can't get enough
Turn it up

Feels like some kinda rush
