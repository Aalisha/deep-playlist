Empty house far away, lost in lonely space.
You know you've felt the same.
From the shallows in love to the depths of your scars.
You know you want to change.
In the rafters, a vate,
fixed and spinning late, there's a certain fear.
Even light with control,
lights outside our homes, wait for every tear.

So exit the fall and now it's over.
You're learning it's all before your heart.
