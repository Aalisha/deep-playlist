Skulking in the mean streets whispering in the halls
Redlight bandits on the corner give no quarter calls
Infectious garbage fills the streets and in their eyes you know
A thin blue line bends and breaks stop the overflow

* fan the flames of the city's heat
In dark corners that you never seen
Desperation when the trouble flares
/alarm guns ring/ [well I'm gonna scream] running scared

And you're long gone, down in this hell
Long gone down in this hell
So baby won't you hold me tight
Let your softness fill my night
...
