Fight it back!

On them white horses,
we come marching through the fields
We think we're kings,
when we come across the field of deeds
But we should know,
that the trophy that we carry is the head,
of mi brother that has paid with his life,
and now he is dead
We got a typhoon on the rise
Typhoon on the rise
We got a typhoon on the rise
Typhoon on the rise

We gotta fight it back
We gotta get it on the run
We gotta fight it back
Here comes the future,
the fire that's burning as bright as the sun
Fight it back!
