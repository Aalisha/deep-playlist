What's happenin' tonight?
Your love is so unreal
I'm the airbag in your fast car, honey
And you're the steering wheel

I'm sicker than a dog
A dog that's lost its bite
The toys are out the kennel, baby
Bitch, you're outta sight

Je suis un funky homme
Je suis un funky homme
Je suis un funky homme
Du hast der grosse schwitzen

I love the way you shake that
Shake that, use that, move that
Push in, pull back, twist this, twist that
Shake that, shake that, use that, move that
Push in, pull back, twist this, twist that
