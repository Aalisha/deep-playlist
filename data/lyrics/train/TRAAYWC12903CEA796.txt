I was hanging with a girl I know
She was telling me a week ago
That I’m the only one
That she's really ever loved
I was talking with a friend of hers
Telling her I know that what a friend deserves
Is more than I can give
It’s more than I can give

You know that I would give it all away
If I knew I could get it back
No need to question all the things I say
