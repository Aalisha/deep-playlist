In the distant
Far away
Trying to figure it out
But I can't explain
Now we see it
Now we don't
We're floating around
In the unknown zone

Watch the starlight
Shooting for the sky
Reaching out to catch
A piece of Paradise
Is it true
Or just imaginations
Visions twist around my mind
And brings me shelter from the night

Where do we go
Where do we go from here
When do we finally disappear
