Well I can see by your eyes that you come from far away
You've been traveling all night and you'd like a place to stay
Well that's alright, baby leave your bags by the door
That's alright, honey you can even ask for more
I won't ask you where you're from
Where you're going or why you've come
For a lot of answers to all the questions on my tongue
No that's alright, baby leave your bags by the door
That's alright, honey you can even ask for more
