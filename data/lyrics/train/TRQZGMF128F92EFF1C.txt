Mr. Smith had an oldsmobile
Baby blue with them wire wheels
I took her home the day that she was adverstised

He said she leaked when, it would rain
And sounded like an aeroplane
But I knew she was a jewel in disguise

She had a 455 Rocket
The biggest block alive
I couldn't hardly wait just to take my turn

She was made for the straight aways
She grew up hating Chevrolets
She's a Rocket, she was made to burn
