Watch the world argue
argue with itself
who's going to teach me
peace and happiness
We could sit here forever
just never get old
listen to the world
letting gods tie us down
Hit cities sharp knives
the right clothing
dancing on the jetty
so our feet stay dry
Watch the world argue
argue with itself
who's going to teach me
peace and happiness
watch the world argue
argue with itself
