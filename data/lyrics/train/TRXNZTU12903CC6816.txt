Well I felt you drain the blood
from my left ventricle
anytime you said you would
change my heart into petrified wood

oh oh oh I'm really trying
to save you tonight
to save you tonight

oh oh oh I'm really trying
to make it through the night
to make it through the night

open your heart
open your hands
