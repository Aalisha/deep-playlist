If you could be anywhere at all--where would you be?
Would you be somewhere else, instead,
of being here with me?
'Cause one thing is certain:
I'm good at hurting the ones that I care about.

My bluejay, you won't sing.
I had to set you free.
So, I'll open up the door
and push you away from me.
My bluejay, you are free.
Fly far away from me.

Just like everybody else, you weren't meant to be with me.

Alone in your circle... I am not surprised.
It's time to spread your wings, yeah.
