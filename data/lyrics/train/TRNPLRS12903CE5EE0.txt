Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Is waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and you die
They don't even try to hear your cry

So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share of what is mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all

Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down
They're trying to drive me underground
