I cant beleive,
the years past,
seems like yesterday was that day
in septembre...

Yea, yea... oh yea yea
(i remember the day in september)

Verse 1:

It started,
off as the best of friends,
no intention,
of falling in love again,
he held me,
there in my time of needs,
my heart was set free,
what a sweet memory

Chorus:

The day I fell in love, (fell in love)
It was so beautiful, (ooh)
His hands, his tender touch
...
