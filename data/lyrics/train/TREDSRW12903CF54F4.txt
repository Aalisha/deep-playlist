Come on, fly with me!

Baby Blue, wind’s going through your hair.
Just tonight, I’ll take you everywhere.
Baby Blue, I’m blinded by your love.
And I swear, in love is not enough.
My love, I know, is endless and it’s true.
You’re always in my heart, you’re my ocean blue.

Fly with me on the wings of love.
Fly with me to the moon.
Behind the moon, we find love enough.
Don’t look back, come with me, Baby Blue.

Fly with me to the universe.
Fly with me through the night.
