I can't breathe
But I can take the heat
It takes a toll on me
I'm ready for you
Release, release me.

Better to be a pair
Through each and every stare
That glare behind your eyes
Told me to save you.

Is this what you call silence?
Inside the eye of every storm
Break away, break away
From this situation
Take away, take away
All the things that hold us down.

Can we break the silence?
