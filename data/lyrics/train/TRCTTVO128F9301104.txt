Your stitches are all out, but your scars are healing wrong
And the helium balloon inside your room has come undone
And it's pushing up at the ceiling and the flickering lights it cannot get beyond

Oh, everyone takes turns, now it's yours to play the part
And they're sitting all around you holding copies of your chart
And the misery inside their eyes is synchronized reflecting into yours

Hold on
