Out of here
We're out of here
Along with fear
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear

And cars speed fast
Out of here
And life goes past
Again so near
There goes the fear again
There goes the fear

Close your brown eyes
And lay down next to me
Close your eyes, lay down
'Cause there goes the fear
Let it go

You turn around and life's passed you by
You look to ones you love
to ask them why?
