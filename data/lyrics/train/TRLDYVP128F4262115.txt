I got tired of New York City, of its sidewalks and its heat
So I got myself a great big horse and I rode him down the street
And then I hollered, "Hi, ho, Silver" and, "Get 'em up, Scout"
But I suffered aggravation and a great humiliation
So I finally said I'd let the story out

You can't call out, "Hi, ho, Silver" as you scoot across the floor
Twenty big Italians had me bent down on my knees
And I cried, "Oh, ouch, help Lord" and, "Mama Mia, please"
