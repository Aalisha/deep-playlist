Thrash till the death feeling the force deep inside
Violence and pain on the power of metal we thrive
Aural assault pounding your ears till they bleed
Unholy sound thrashes till death is our breed

Leather and metal the forces are slamming the sky
Louder than hell the thrashers are screaming to die

Thrash till the death! {4x}
