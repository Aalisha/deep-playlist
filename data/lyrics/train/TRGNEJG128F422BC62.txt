It's crazy how slow it goes, when you're waiting for something more
to warm you up when you feel cold, to calm you down and bring peace to your soul
it's funny how fast it goes, love comes right when you don't wait anymore
its power takes over all, and you surrender you let go…

oh…this frailty makes us so strong
oh. this fire will melt all the ice
and it's all I want, all I need
a prayer of freedom, a prayer of love
a prayer of freedom, a prayer of love
a prayer of freedom, a prayer of love

precious gifts, given in silence, look like the pieces of an unsolved puzzle
...
