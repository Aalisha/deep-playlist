We talk a little relationshit
While listening in to 'Lover's spit'
My thoughts go like... (toetoetoetoetoe)
And every time we avoid a kiss
We're talking all but relationship
And when you bring some common sense
My eyes go like... (toetoetoetoetoe)

Everyday I work on the road
I pave it until it turns to gold
And every day that I am away
You say you miss me
Every second I'm away, yeah, it hits me
The giggles and the scent and the need make me dizzy
Maybe one day we'll awake
and it will fall into place

So finally we talk common sense
It doesn't work out, we'll act like friends
We smile a little(toetoetoetoetoe)

If you still mean it
...
