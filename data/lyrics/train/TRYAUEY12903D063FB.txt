The first time I saw you I couldn't believe
How you looked and how you played your part
You looked like an angel and I, just a stranger,
Was hooked by the second we talked
Almost tears in my eyes I just stared at your smile
How you lifted my spirit up high
Lost in the moment I stumbled and crawled
See I almost went out of my mind

Feeling you
Touching you

Was all I wanted to do
Before the night is over
I'm begging you please

Valerie
I get lost in your eyes
How I fall for your smile
It takes me away
So please won't you stay
Valerie
We've got night on our side
We can cross that line
...
