There are places in Havana
That remind me of Savanna
Parts of West Virginia
That might as well be Kenya

Parts of New York City
Parts of Mississippi, parts of Miami
Parts of Tennessee
Look like another world to me

Ghetto, might as well be another country
Hurry oh oh oh, might as well be another country
When you look around
You live in another country too, too, too

To be hungry in LA
Is just like starving in Bombay
Homeless in Morocco
Is a shelter in Chicago
