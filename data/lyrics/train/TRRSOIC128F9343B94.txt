Analog

Through the coolest haze
of this dreamlike maze
it has begun
and all I wanted you near

With these wounds I bled
a perfect tone of red
in isolation
through the swollen eyes

Of the dying, and my waking dreams
we're all dying to become what we swore we never would

Now I watch and mourn in bloom
...
