Sick of this shit
Been as low as I go
Now the tables will turn
Now everyone must know
The hunter's become the hunted
I will take you down one by one
No quarter will be given
Until this judgement is done

The last time that you stopped to think
You forgot to start back up again
Then you wonder why it is
I view you with so much ridicule
Well, all the seeds
