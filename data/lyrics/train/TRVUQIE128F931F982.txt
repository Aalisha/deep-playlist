I know it's not enough to say I'm wrong
You know that I will miss you now you're gone
I know it's not your life to see this through
Just know that in my heart it beats for you
So leave a little note for me behind

I'd spend every night waking up to the beat I hear inside
Telling me to be your only one
But if you fall back into my life
