The morning light comes stealing
To start a new day
Out there the world is waiting
To take us far away
And it's time to make the final break
But the memory will linger forever

If I never see you again
And think of me now and then
Though it hurts so sweetly
They say all good things come to an end
You've changed my life completely
I'm touched by your love
Even if I never see you again

The night is so unforgiven, yeah
