(Chorus (x3):)
Play the game, get cash, get paid,
Get your money, get your power, get your bitches man!

(Ice:)
It's simple easy don't rock to vote,
Get your guns get your dope, that's all she wrote.
Lock your blocks cock your glocks get your gang in check
Fuck the copsget your money snatch that street respect
Get your cars on them big rims, chrome a must,
Keep your straps on you hips nigga ready to bust.
