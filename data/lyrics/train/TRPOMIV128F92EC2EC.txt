If you love somebody enough
You'll follow wherever they go
That's how I got to memphis
That's how I got to memphis

If you love somebody enough
You'll go where your heart wants to go
That's how I got to memphis
That's how I got to memphis
I know if you'd seen her you'd tell me 'cause you are my friend
I've got to find her and find out the trouble she's in
