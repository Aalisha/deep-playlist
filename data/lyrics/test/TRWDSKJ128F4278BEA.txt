(Opio)
Remember Tabitha Smith
That's been my hard on since the fifth grade
Used to tell me nigga get paid
So we could be chillin'
Knew she'd be a millionaire
Feelin' 'em squares, stayin' up late
Doing her homework
Till he bones hurt
Solid as steel
Real as a day of atonement
Never live for the moment
That's why suckers they couldn't bone shit
Fool that body's a temple
Plus her older brothers just might lynch you
If you slippin'
Dreams of tinted windows in a benz-o
Graduated valedictorian, still smokin' indo
She was a whiz though
And I admire it
Finished up grad school
Now she mob a jaguar too
She never led she'd get maniacal
Kept her eyes on true ambition
That's how she livin' fat
Educated herself
Now she in a rack with six figures
Stacks of cashola I told her

Chorus (Opio):

Stay hustlin'
Watch for your enemies
Fool don't sneeze
You might blink for a second
Stay alert they like green berets
Checkin' your traps
With impeccable accuracy
Know where you at & where you be
