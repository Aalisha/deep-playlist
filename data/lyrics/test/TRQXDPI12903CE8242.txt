Glory, glory, hallelujah, when I lay my burdens down,
Glory, glory, hallelujah, when I lay my burdens down.

I wanna see, see my father, when I lay my burdens down,
I wanna see, see my father, when I lay my burdens down.

Glory, glory, hallelujah, when I lay my burdens down,
Glory, glory, hallelujah, when I lay my burdens down.
