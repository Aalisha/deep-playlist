Gather the wind
Though the wind won't help you fly at all
Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun
And it tears away to face you as you run
You run, you run

Behind the smile
There's danger and a promise to be told
You'll never get old, ha
Life's fantasy
To be locked away and still to think you're free
...
