Starting all over again is gonna be rough, so rough
but we're gonna make it
starting all over as friends is gonna be rough, on us
but we gotta face it
We lost what we had, that's why it hurt so bad.
it set us back a thousand years.
we're gonna make it up, though it's gonna be rough
to erase all the hurt and tears
starting all over again is gonna be hard
