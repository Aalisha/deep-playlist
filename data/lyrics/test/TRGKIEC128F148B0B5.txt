There's got to be a way that I can dream
Simply close my eyes and see
The worlds I've never known 
What places that my soul has been

Sometimes I need to run away and hide
And soar above the clouds and ride
I sail along so high
Till nothing's in my sky
Except the stars that fill my eyes

And I will live for love
Where ever it may lead
It's written from the start
I know it's face by heart
I will live for love


I'm searching for the one who holds the key
