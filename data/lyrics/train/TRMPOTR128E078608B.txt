The heat is on, are y'all really ready to fly?
The heat is on, are y'all really ready to die?
The heat is on, have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on high
The heat is on, you know

The heat is on, what's my next move
Do I stick with the score or get with the door
Feds got the drop in the back of the U haul
Snipers on the roof, chance of getting away, too small
Tell 'em like this look, it's gonna be a shoot out
Whoever make it ou, t meet back at the new house, good luck
If I don't see you again, peace

Let's handle our business with these government police
You and you, go out the front, you take the back
You cover the first two and I'll take the sack
Boomer didn't make it, neither did Stan
Now it's three niggaz splitin' four hundred grand
We all feel the loss but enjoy the profit
The game is the same and nothin' gonna stop it
Most times you make it, one time you won't
All a nigga could really do is have a vest under the coat, c'mon

The heat is on, are y'all really ready to fly?
The heat is on, are y'all really ready to die?
The heat is on, have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on high
The heat is on, you know

The heat is on, are y'all really ready to fly?
The heat is on, are y'all really ready to die?
