Don't you know that one day, you'll be found out?
Faulty explanations, changing colors all breed doubt
You push your thoughts away from the day when you must pay
When the storm becomes a blizzard, don't play dead like a lizard

Pull it out, wash it off
With the blade of deception sheathed the wounds can heal
Though you like the darker climes, they shade you from the real

Don't pull it off, cut it off
A game is fair when the players abide by the rules
