The blues the come and the blues they go
Don't hold your breath, they'll be coming back
Make you step outside that life you lead
Feel the blues fade to black
You watch yourself like in a dream
You're standin' still, the world is screamin' past

Sittin' in the driveway of my own house
The lights are on, nobody's home
