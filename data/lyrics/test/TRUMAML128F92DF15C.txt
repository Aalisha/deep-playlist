Raw metallic hours
Hard blaze of gold from the twilight vault
Catastrophe, yeah itÂ'll come youÂ'll see
WeÂ'll bring you the serpents time to be
Inebriant pythonic pulsation
The spawn of one great massive frustration
Prostrated by the stream of dread
Aggressive expressions as the ground turns red

And the burning coal
And the voice of the wind
Blends with the screams of rapture
Soul exile
