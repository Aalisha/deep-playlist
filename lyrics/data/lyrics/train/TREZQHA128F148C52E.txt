I couldn't be more confused
but more than that I'm upset
we once stood side by side
we were young when we met
we'd always stand together
that's how we had it planned
now where do we stand oh
I can't stand the pain
I guess I don't understand
I just don't understand this stand off
there's a lot I don't understand
we're apart and don't have to be
