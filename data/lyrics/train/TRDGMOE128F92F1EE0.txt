Plannin' my attack just before you come back around
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't know how to back down,
I never fit it, I don't belong
But you know it doesn't matter when we feel strong
Cause I'm a vampire y'all, we toast the blood of our enemies,
You're still scarin' me no, you're scarin' me no
And we don't fit in

(We don't fit in)

Wonder what it's like when you're livin' with someone like me
I'm a freak and I'm nervous when it's easy,
Feral days and I'm sex crazed
I put it in with my animal ways and,
That's the sign I was born to be livin' in
I ran around and gave the finger to the Ritalin
You can calm me down andI can't say why
...
