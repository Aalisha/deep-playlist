What we’ve learnt from our bad dream
Is that no one will ever know
Why a smile is so fragile?
How a word can make you cry?

I’ve been searching in my soul for
Those sad words to say goodbye
My world begins and ends with you
Stand by me ‘till candles die

We are face to face
With starry eyes
We are heart to heart
Please don’t lie
Love me tonight
I can’t live
