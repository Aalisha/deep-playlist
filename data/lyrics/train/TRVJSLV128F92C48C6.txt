I must admit there are two of me
Who I am and who want to be
one is strong, the other weak
Flesh and bone trying to believe

Show me who You are
want to see Your face, want to see Your face
Shine a ligth on this cold heart in this dark, dark place
Oh, You are the son, I am the moon
And reflect You
I reflect You
