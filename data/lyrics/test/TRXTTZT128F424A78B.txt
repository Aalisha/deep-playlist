See di yout' dem a chant an' prance
Dem a ready to play dis dance
Running from the hill like a burning lance
To the valley of abundance

So many voices on the same riddim
Singing louder than the sound system
So many colors comin' out of concrete
Come we go downtown, come we go shout on mainstreet

Push! Push! Fi give justice a chance
Push! Push! Fi mek turn di balance

See dem are scornin' on that movement
Dem think we don' t know the rules we just can' t understand
But we know We are firm an' confident
We know for which battle we stand

Dem will not deceive us again with false pretence
...
