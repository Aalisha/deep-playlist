I was driving along in my big cadillac
Saw a thumb going up, I said Driver go back
Played her a track from my latest LP
Getting bad vibes she hadn't recognized me

She said she didn't know me but my name's been in lights
Giant size neons on the strip every night
The camera man did the best that he can
Still she said I don't know you I just can't understand

I'm a star, yeah
