See the people walking down the street
Fall in line just watchin' all their feet
They don't know where they're want to go
But their walking in time

They got the beat
They got the beat
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat

See the kids just gettin' out of school
They can't wait to hang out and be cool
Hang around 'til quarter after twelve
That's when they fall in line
