That limousine
In which you made the scene
Suits you to a tee
If all that you want to be
Is somebody that don't never walk, nothin'

That big chateau
Where you wanna go
In the south of France
Gonna end our big romance
Don't you do it

Honey don't leave L.A.
That Riviera is so far away
Begging you s'il vous plait
S'il vous plait, baby
