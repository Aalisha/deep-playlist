[VERSE 1]
You know I had to go there right, that's water baby
Ay yo shorty got the badonkadonk, look right
Hangin of the edge of dat Kawasaki bike

They be in salons, restaurants and stores
They come in all shapes sizes, fashions and colors
It might be your sister, aunts or your mothers
Or your baby mama and they aunts and they cousins
They roam in droves of half a dozens

All you gotta do is hit up your local ave
lookin at the female anatomy

Excuse me miss no disrespect miss (you drop somethin)
Sike but that thing is da beautifulist
