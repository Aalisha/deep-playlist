Sometimes I wish I could run
Home to mama's lovin' arms
In the springtime when the weather's fine

Sittin' with her on the porch
Glass of tea and nothin' more
Than her smile, for just a little while

When I don't know where to go
I think of home and how she used to sing to me
She sang

? Que Sera, Sera? life goes on
Whatever's meant to be will always be
And baby, what don't kill you will make you strong
...
