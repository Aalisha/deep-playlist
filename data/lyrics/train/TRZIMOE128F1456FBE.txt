Shell Shock
ALBUM ' Heart (1985)

I can snap my fingers and get quick results
I can wink my eyes and melt their little hearts
Something hit me brought me to my knees
Something hit me, no remedies

You came out shooting, you left me stunned
I know I'm losing it, look what you have done
Shell shock shell shock
You got me in your love lock
Shell shock shell shock
I can't escape it no I can't shake it
