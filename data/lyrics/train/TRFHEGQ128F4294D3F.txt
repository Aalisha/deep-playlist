He lays a sheet if white paper
On a gravy stained table
He wipes the palms of his hands on his jeans.
He turns "Imagine" up loud
He knows that face and that cloud
And he don't stop counting
While he's spilling the beans.

Cos now he's going to tell us all
The truth about John
Tho' he needs a little help
To speed up the prose.
He was taken on trust
But that wasn't enough
You lose some friends this way
