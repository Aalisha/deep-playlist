So yeah you re into taking all the credit in your preppy clothes
We don t get a single word you bought us out that s how it goes
Would you like a ticket to our next support show?
Of then with this song and yeah ya might get good (oh)
Not that your a problem just an aggravation when you re here
So we'll move to small talk and we ll do so through the act of care
It s a lovely setting for the purely perfect wedding
And to claim they were inventing would be nothing but consenting

What a mistake, to talk you down like that and I m sorry
