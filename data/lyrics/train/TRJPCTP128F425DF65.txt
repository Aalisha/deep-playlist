Clean up your eyes, and I'll dance alone with you in daylight
Your skin reminds me of sleeping on clouds in my mind
Clean up your eyes this time
Clean up your eyes this time

You breathe in when I breathe out
It's not likely I'd ever feel this far
From someone, from anyone at all
If you leave now you leave with a piece of me, and a piece of us
It's not likely I'd ever feel at all

All things aside, I'm not sure if I can help you this time
You show your eyes, and I see your face for the first time
But let's not hide this time
Let's not hide this time
