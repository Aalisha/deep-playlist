Well you must be a girl with shoes like that
She said you know me well
I seen you and little steven and Joanna
Round the back of my hotel oh yeah

Someone said you was asking after me
But I know you best as a blagger
I said tell me your name is it sweet?

She said my boy it's dagger oh yeah
I was good she was hot
Stealin' everything she got
I was bold she was over the worst of it
