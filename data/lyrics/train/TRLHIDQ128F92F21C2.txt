I think you are living in denial
Oh can't you see she's pretty wild?
And every night I pray that you don't knock her up
'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child

They say "l'amour est né à Paris"
So she's planned a little trip to France
while she's in anxious anticipation
I really hope you have a horrible vacation

And so you think of me when you arrive.
Hope the french fleas eat you both alive.
And your room smells
And the toilet doesn't flush
And locals treat you mean
And the service takes too long

'Cause I'm fragile and you broke my heart in two
But you just smile
Like it's all the same to you, to you

But when you learn your lesson
Come like a prodigal son
Read the big sign at the airport
Bienvenue from Hell, mon amour
