I got love for ya'll
Don't think I'm a hater
Cause most of my songs
Are talkin' bout that drama
I'm just wipin' scars
For me and all my niggaz
But this one's for ya'll,
This one's for my ladies that
Hold me down
And don't get all offended
Of my rugged mouth
Well ya'll know what the deal is
Don't be buggin' out
When I call ladies bitches
If you know you not one
But if you are take it offensive
Biatch!
By the time you've heard this I'm
Sure you formed your own opinion
But have you really listened
