Come with me
And we shall run across the sky
And illuminate the night
Oh-oh-oh, I will try and guide you
To better times and brighter days

Don't be afraid
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can see heaven much better
Come up the ladder to the roof
Where we can be (Where we can be)
(Where we can be) Closer to heaven
(To heaven, stay)

Stay with me
And we shall let expression sing
Can't you hear 'em ring?
