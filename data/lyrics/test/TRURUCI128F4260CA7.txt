Head on to the other side
No-one will stand us by
Dismantle me tonight and bury my arms right
Here on the other side
Don't mind the rising tide
Watch as I gently lead the both of us astray

Reach for the children first
Drowning of their own thirst
This is the outcome but is this the outlook
Sound of the waterfall
Seems so unbearable
Pay no attention to the things that might

Appear out of time and place
This is the last trace
I'll ever leave behind; I'll ever mention
So out of time and place
This is the last trace
I'll ever leave behind; I'll ever mention
...
