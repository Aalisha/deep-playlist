I don't know how the days escape
Leaving nothing in their wake
Except the taste of regretting yesterday
I thought about the tears your cried and the miles that you drive

Just for me, just to see if I'm alive and breathing
So far, so good, so what happens to us now?
Something about the way you looked at me tonight
Makes me wonder what is going on

Will it be this way tomorrow?
