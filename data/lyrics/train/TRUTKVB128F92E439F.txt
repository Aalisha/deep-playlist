I love you like I want you and kiss you like I need you (every night)
You come to me, I tell you that I want you (it's my delight)
Darling, I've grown to love you more every day, uh huh
I've got a song to sing each lonely night, oh yeah oh yeah

Stronger than the northwinds, higher than the mountains
That's my love for you
I will never hurt you, nor will I forsake you
Darling, be true
