And it go a little something like this
Hit it

Shiggity shoz bots, hots, I rocks
I kiggity kicks the drama like a farmer picks the crops
Hops, I diggity digs more wigs than John the Baptist
They call me Mr. Rapper, so I guess I be the rappist

No practice, yo Krayzie
(Diggity yes?)
Knocker
Don't bolo like Han Solo, come work like Chewbacca

So ease back, slick or get kicked in the tush
Yep, I call ya Snaggle if your puss
Ee Gads, I rip shop, until the roof fell in
And plus I piggity pop your shit like [unverified]

But, umm, rarely does my crew get into beefus
I fliggity flips the mould like the gold that's on my cheebas
Oh Jesus, I'm the youngest, Flipsy, be the eldest
I'm hipper than the hip bone connected to your pelvis
So Hickory Dickory Dock, diggity don't your wish

If only it sounded like this, like this
If only it sounded like this, like this
Like this, like this

If only it sounded like this, like this
...
