A destined pattern to the complex man
One single faith, to billions of individuals?

It makes no sense, I cannot gamble on the expected
Trapped in under the wings of mortality

Only the dead will know
What is right for you is wrong for me
The personal truth is many folded

Only the dead will know
Immortality would give life no sense
I don't care about death
It never cared about me
...
