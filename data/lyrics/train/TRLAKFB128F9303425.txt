In that room where you sit,
Where you live,
I know it's good to you
God, i know it's good to you
In your fear where you lay,
Where you think
It eases all the pain
All the pain of what you made

One last night at the lonely wheel
One last taste of the sin we feel
One hope in the fear that drives us on
One last drink to kill the pain
One last breath, before i say your name

I'm giving into you
I'm giving into you
If you could see in me
