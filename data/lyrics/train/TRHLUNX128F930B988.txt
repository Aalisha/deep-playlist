Left the big city think it was yesterday Got in some trouble there but that's the price you pay for living underground just stay put and believe in the good times you can have right down the street You go to the show cause you know that your friends are there watching your face for any trace or hint of fear parking lot packed to the max the people in the back are smoking phat sacks of big buds and getting whack 



Stomp your steel tip boots some more Not enough movement on the dance floor
