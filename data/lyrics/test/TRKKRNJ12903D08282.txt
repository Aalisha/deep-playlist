Stand beside it
We can't hide the way it makes us glow
It's no good unless it grows
Feel this burning love of mine

Deep inside the ever-spinning
Tell me, does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real
Hillsides burning, wild-eyed turning
Till we're running from it

I'd take care of you
If you'd ask me to
In a year or two
Oh

You say swimming in the lake
...
