feels like fire 
i`m so in love with you 
dreams are like angels 
they keep bad at bay - bad at bay 
love is the light 
scaring darkness away - yeah 
i`m so in love with you 
purge the soul 
make love your goal 
the power of love 
a force from above 
cleaning my soul 
flame on burn desire 
love with tongues of fire 
purge the soul 
make love your goal 
i`ll protect you from the hooded claw 
keep the vampires from your door 
...
