(Who does she think she is)
(I dunno)
(Do you reckon they're real?)
(Nah)
(Hi, girls)
(Hi, Louise, you look great)

Ow, ow, twisted and deceitful
All those two-faced people
Taking me for some kind of fool
Ow, ow, pretending to be so nice
Let me give you my advice
I don't need you, ooh
Friends in disguise
Dressed up in lies
It's an act that you're playing
Ow, ow, first you recognise me
Then you criticise me, what's goin on

Stop your bitchin'
'Coz you're so sad
Bitchin' behind my back
Honey, I don't need that
So kick it to the curb
Because I heard you're two-faced
Tryin' to get in my place
Work too hard to make mistakes
So stop your bitchin' on me

Ow, ow, they're so narrow-minded
Truth is so one-sided
