(Craig Lee Fuller)

I can see why you think you belong to me
I never tried to make you think
Or make you see one thing for yourself
But now your off with someone else and I'm alone
You see I thought that I might keep you for my own.

Amie, what you wanna do?
I think I could stay with you
For a while maybe longer if I do.

Don't you think the time was right for us to find
All the things we thought weren't proper
Could be right in time
And can't you see which way
