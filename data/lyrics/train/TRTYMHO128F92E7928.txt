5. because it keeps on working
I want to lay down, but i got no home
is there a better place?
cast into the open, with nowhere else to go
i feel right now that i could rest my bones
or should i stay awake?
tired of going in circles, trying to stay alive
Because it keeps on working
don't make it right
I'll try anything, that could someow free me from
the ball and chain
