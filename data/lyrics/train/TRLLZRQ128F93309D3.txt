I hear the clock, it's 6am
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs and I've got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots off all the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore
Cause
Dreams last so long
Even after you're gone
I know, that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
...
