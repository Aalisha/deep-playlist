J.B. Lenoir, vocal & guitar; Sunnyland Slim, piano; unknown bass;
Alfred Wallace, drums. Chicago, late 1952

I wants to know how much more longer is
I just gonn1 have to wait on you?
I wants to know how much more longer is
I just gonn' have to wait on you?
You know that I love you,
shouldn't do the way you do.

How long? How much more long,
how long?
How long? How much more long.
