I've been looking around,
Some people can't be found,
As if they´ve locked in solitude,
It's hard to get by,
on a handfull on dimes,
it´s impossible for positive attitude...

Unscarred Underdog... Hardcore is life

It's a fight to the top of the system son,
So suck it up and be a man,
Before your vision is dead...
...
