La Dum da da dum
Take the cup of delusion
This empty soul inside
Drinks the wine of remorse
And giving cause to stumble
It's Sobering, It changes

*Chorus*
Don't turn around
Don't Walk away
Don't try to lead
When you don't know

La Dum da da dum
Blotting out the stains of nonsense
And drenched in this desire
Spilling from an empty cup
You bury guilt like sin
Hurling smiles and judgments
...
