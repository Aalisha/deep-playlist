Aah
Glowing eyes, staring eyes
Manifest of evil presence
With entities swept in disease of betrayal
A fall from paradise beyond redemption
Wrath child's afterglow

He who speaks of nightly treasures
He who wraps the serpent around my neck
He who pours poisonous wine in my chalice
He who lets me serve and slip away

And so I will take shelter
In the absence of the light
