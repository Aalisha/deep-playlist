Tom j is in the house (repeat 2x)
Rap is outta control (repeat 6x)

Verse one: erick sermon

G, man, do I have the power like he-man
To crack a wack mc's head, open like a pea can
Damn, my name should become sam
But I prefer, a grand royal for the jam
I'm putting heads out, the guns I use to pump lead out
Hey son, I suggest that you head out
I total, cremate, strikin mic flakes
I won't break, I make more nerds than a earthquake
Strong, got more strength than king kong
I'm worldwide, I'm interviewed like kaity chung
I'm on now, live at 12, it's so dope
All the way to 4 o'clock, there no soaps
I'm able to rock the mic nice and stable
It's a chance that you might see me on cable
Vision, showtime or hbo with the flow
Getting more play than rambo
...
