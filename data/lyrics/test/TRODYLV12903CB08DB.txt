Give me a reason to cool you down, an explanation
I'm gonna lift you to up a crown, a great location

I try to hit it hard
Give me a reason
This ain't no heart attack
No moderation

Give me a reason to cool you down, an explanation
I'm gonna lift you to up a crown, a great location

I try to hit it hard
Give me a reason
This ain't no heart attack
No moderation

Give me a reason to cool you down, an explanation
I'm gonna lift you to up a crown, a great location

I'm gonna beat you to the ground, no conversation
