The grass is always greener
On the other side of the fence, yeah, yeah
But the dog over there might be meaner
On the other side of the fence, yeah, yeah

The car in the driveway looks longer
On the other side of the street, yeah, yeah
Does anything ever go wrong there
On the other side of the street, yeah, yeah?

Stay in your own yard, stay in your own yard
Be happy in your own yard
'Cause everything glitters that really ain't gold, yeah
...
