Hurry up we're gonna be late
I can't wait to see this place
And if we leave now
We could be there soon

On the drive, you did not care
You're sun-tired and your stomach's bare
When your eyes light up
And out of the blue you scream

It's a miracle
And I'm here to say
It's a miracle
And I'm here to tell you now

Wake up, we're almost there
Ten more miles it was such an affair
...
