I love you in the worst way
The only way I know
They say the clearer the water
The more that it shows

See the deeper the river
Then the stronger the love
Your eyes don't lie to me
And your smile is worth its weight in gold

This life, this life aches and this life moans
This life, this life is great
And it's better when you're
Not alone, not alone
...
