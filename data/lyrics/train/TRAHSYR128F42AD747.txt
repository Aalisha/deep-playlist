Double or nothing you've gotta have a partner or your heart'll never come of age,
Takin' and givin' it's time we started livin' love will get us through the awkward stage,
Let your heart run free,
Let it run to me yeah,
We were meant to be, darlin' stay with me.

You stepped out of the night full of lonely,
We stepped into a world full of light,
You said i was your one and your only,
We made love for a lifetime tonight.
