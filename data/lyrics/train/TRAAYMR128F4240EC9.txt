I like burning houses down, and factories as well.
I like burning anything, it's the truth I tell.
Libraries and museums, both of them have fell,
I like burning things, burning things is swell.

I would like to start it as a fashion trend,
Amongst the young people, then the world might end.
Wouldn't it be fun, to ring the funeral bell,
On our civilization, and watch it burn in Hell.

Start a fire, start a fire, start a fire today.
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it all away.
