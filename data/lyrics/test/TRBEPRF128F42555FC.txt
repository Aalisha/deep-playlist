Oh, now, want to be free
Tired fe lick weed in a bush
Tired fe lick pipe in a gully
We want to come out in the open
Where the breeze can blow it so far away
To the North, to the South, to the East
And to the West, to the West
Talkin' about Jones town
Trench town, concrete jungle too
From Waterhouse, that's the West
That's the best, that's the West
From St. Ann's it comes to you
The best kali weed you ever drew
...
