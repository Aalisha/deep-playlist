Intro:
Oooh, yeah yeah
Baby I'm ready,
Don't you know that I'm ready this time

After all of the hard work
And all of the things I sacrificed
Now I finally know my worth
The whole of me it has no price
I thought I'd never make it this far
I underestimated myself
And though my life has truly been hard
Now I know the greatness of my wealth

I'm rich in love (ooh yeah yes in love)
I'm rich in peace (i'm rich in peace)
I'm rich in hope yeah (hope yeah)
