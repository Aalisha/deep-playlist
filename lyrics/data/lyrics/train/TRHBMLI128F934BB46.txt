Raping signs of virtue
Enslave the creatures of apathy
Deny the souls of majority
Beyond this point of destiny
With poisoned tears from all thy heavens
All tyrants to their knees
Execute the cancer
Penetrate the living
Invade the dead
For every sin not sinned
A flock to all holes
For blessing hypocrisy
Megatons of doom
...
