Here she comes again (you want her, want her)
Goddess to all men (she's got it, got it)
Working undercover
She's gonna get you in the end

How far you gonna go
Take a chance or you'll never know
On this mission there's one condition
You've just gotta lose control

And her lips make you wanna stop and stare
But her eyes they tell you to beware
Then she makes her move, and with one last look
She says catch me if you can

See her tail lights vanish in the dark
Now a time bomb's ticking in your heart
And she's got you good, like she knew she would
She says catch me, catch me if you can

Another beautiful disguise
