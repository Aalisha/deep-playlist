I was at the bar with my drinkin team,
It was me Jack Daniels and my homey Jim Bean.
We were kinda blitzed and we were trying to behave Y'all
when in walked a soldier he was from the fuzzy naval.
We were fallin, stumblin, crawlin
her come da police, Captain Tom Collins,
and the rapper said freeze
he said "hands in the air and hand over your keys"
now we did, and that was kinda simple,
now here came Marguarita and her friend Shirley Temple.
I asked my friend 'bout Marguarita,
he said Shirley was a virgin an I wouldn't wanna meet her.
So I talked to Marguarita, cause yoh, she was flyer.
I took her to the coast cause I wanted to Screw Driver.
Now Im not one for a speech,
but there was plenty of Tequila and Sex On The Beach, Y'all.

Tequila
Te-Te-Te - Tequila
Tequila

Here we go again and Im not fussin,
...
