(Host Intro)
Let's meet contestant #1
He's a schitzophrenic serial killer clown,
Who says women love his sexy smile.
Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon.
Sharon, what's your question?

(Sharon)
Contestant #1, I believe first impressions last forever,
so let's say you were to come over to my parents' house
and have dinner with me and my family.
Tell me what you'd do to make that first impression really stay.

Let's see, hmm, well I'd have to think about it.
I might show up in a tux, ha! But I doubt it.
I'd probably just show up naked like I always do,
and look your mama in the eye and tell her fuck you!
Hurry up bitch I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti,
I'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her get the food ready!
Your dad would probably start trippin', and get me pissed.
I'd have to walk up and bust him in his fuckin lips!
It's dinner time, while hearin' grace from your mother.
I pull a 40 out and pour some for your little brother.
I'm steady, staring at your sister, I'll tell you this,
you know for only 13 she got some big tits!
After that, your dad would try to jump again,
and only this time I'd put the 40 to his chin!
After your mom does the dishes and the silverwear,
I'd dry fuck her 'till I nut in my underwear!
