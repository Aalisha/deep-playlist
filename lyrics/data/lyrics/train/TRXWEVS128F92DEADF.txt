Did you come here to kill or did you come here to die?
And did you really think that spaceships would descend from the sky?

Bending light and beaming forth across space-time
To see us scared in the reflection of their oil-black eyes
To stalk us like a predator
Like our movies imply

They're not the ones who've come to
Kill us
Come to fill us full of lead
They're not the ones who hate us

And they are not the ones who mutilate our animals
Or travel through the stars
They're not the ones who cause us harm
We are, we are, we are
