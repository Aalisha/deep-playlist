The one I love is lost without the least bit of explanation
Just goes to show the futility of self-preservation
Now all I seem to see is all this war, and goin' amongst our nations
What good will it do

Now everybody wants to know the secrets to our salvation
Forever reading on and on, from Genesis to Revelation
Never stopping for a second to examine situations
After all that we've been through
