("Drakkar Anni":)
We are servants of the night
Stalkers, hunters, miscreants
Creatures of a black domain
Sleepless, sunless revenants

("Alan Morton":)
I will defy the seperation
Of darkness and light, this I swear
Fuse them together, unite them as one
Power is mine!

("Aline Cedrac":)
Playing with fire, you're end up burning
Consequence for your mistake

("Drakkar Anni":)
We fear the day for the sun
Await the dusk, sacrifice
We roam the earth, take the flesh
Dwelling among satan's lair
