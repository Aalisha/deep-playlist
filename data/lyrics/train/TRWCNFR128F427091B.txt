Got those highway blues, can't you hear my motor runnin'?
Flyin' down the road with my foot on the floor
All the way in town they can hear me comin'
Ford's about to drop, she won't do no more

And I smell my motor burnin'
Underneath the hood is smoke
Can't stop, and I can't stop
Got to keep movin' on or I'll lose my mind

Oh, rockin' down the highway
Oh, rockin' down the highway
...
