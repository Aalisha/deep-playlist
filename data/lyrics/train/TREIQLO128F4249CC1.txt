I can't lose you in crowded rooms,
But this year we're not linking arms.
Slow walk out of the barfly,
Cold air and taxis and i'm biting my lip cos i know why we're dragged here.
If you think this is primitive,
I can dye my hair and you can call me tracey tracey.

Just me and her and a casio.

I got a plan, new maps everyday,
I have found a happy obsession.
I might be drunk but at least i'm standing up,
And in this place, gestures are all we've got.
I will wait for you outside carparks,
outside busy shopping centres,
I will wait for you at work when all your early shifts run late.
And sometimes in the bullring and always when you're sleeping,
I will look at yr hands and think, i could never explain what you had.
