Come Take Me Over

Is this a long range effort, cause I'll pitch a tent
I'm kinda used to feeling cold
Should I walk naked should I bear my sould
Won't you help me fill this hole

And what I'm trying to say is be the one
Love me anyway... though I'm too far gone

Come take me over - I'm riddled with my past
Come take me over - is that too much to ask
Before I leave this town - love me or put me down

Got semi heaven, I wanna fall in love
You said the walking wounded could
I know I've sent the 'morrows to an early grave
Is this the price I have to pay.

What I'm try'na say, if you could touch
The love I fantasize, is that too much

Come take me over - I'm riddled with my past
...
