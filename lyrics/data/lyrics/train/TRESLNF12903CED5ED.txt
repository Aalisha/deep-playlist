Hold up, wait a minute, What I'm feeling now
My world's spinning around got me freaking out
Hold up, wait a minute, you're my universe
Everything you say or do always seems to hurt
Eight hours, to the minute, since i left you place
You told me i should be thanking God that you came my way
Eight minutes to the second, since i realized
I know we don't suppose to feel like this
And it's time that I,
Let go of all the things you've been calling me
Let go of all the pain and the memories
I ain't about to break my beginning 
I'm starting now
And you showed me how

I don't need your love for charity,
Got everything i want in me,
Open your eyes and you will see,
That I, I, that I, I
Ain't a Victim, Ain't a Victim
