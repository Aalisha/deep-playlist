Turned to the hours of deepest despair
Ancient mystic world surrounds my mind
Hear the sweetest symphonies, betrayed by own dreams
Temptation of the beauty, I have tasted her tears
I? ve tasted her tears
She filled my dreams, surrounds be her grace
The gift of their life runs slowly through my veins
By darkness seducted, her cold veil of death
Malicious beauty, obsession of my sins
Craving hands crawls in my neck
