[Gabriel] 
Staring into the lake watching forever sake, 
Voices screaming in fear! 
Crying like at the stake, in the fiery waves

I can see all the sorrows and the suffering howl, an angel 
Of pain! 
Centaur's taking it's toll, live my life in Hades! 

On the souls they left they're mortal, flame It fits 
Beeing dead or not, 
All the deaf who did not heard the truth! 

Get ready for the Brimstone, get the blistress on the 
Ice. 
The power of the spirit was the final sacrifice. 
Get ready for the Brimstone, get the blistress on the 
Ice. 
The power of the spirit was the final sacrifice! 

[Jacob]
Ouughaa!
