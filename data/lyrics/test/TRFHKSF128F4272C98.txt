Here Comes the Judge
Hear ye him
God save the African king
Anyone have anything to say before this just judge
Come say it now and say it like you glad not like you mad
For this judge have no mercy

Silence in the court
The court is in session
Silence in the court
The court is in session
Silence in the court
The court is in session

Christopher Columbus
Francis Drake
Bartholomew De Los Casos
Vasco De Gama
Alexander so called the Great
John Hannon
James Grant
David Livingston
John Constantine
Henry Morgan
Marco Polo
Come say after me
I solemly swear
That the evidence I shall give shall be the whole truth
And nothing but the truth
