I got something to say little girl
You might not like my style
But we've been hanging around this town
Just a little too long a while
You say you're gonna get your act together
Gonna take it out on the road
But if I dont get outta here pretty soon
My head's going to explode

Sure I like country music
I like mandolins
But right now I need a telecaster
Through a vibro-lux turned up to ten

CHORUS:
Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

I need a little shot of that rhythm baby
Mixed up with these country blues
