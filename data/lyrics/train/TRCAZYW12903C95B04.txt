If you're like us
Calling all riders
Roll up beside us
No place to hide us

All freedom fighters
Let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous and
Let's go
Destination
For navigation
Man up your stations
Feel the sensation
Surround invasion
With communication
Move quick, we might avoid contamination

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet to this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud
Let me show 'em all how you move to this phenomenon
We'll open your soul
Maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go
And let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon
