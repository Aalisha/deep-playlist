In the midnight rain
Johnny throws a stance
Says "love me tender love me true"
And in the doorway there
She looks up at him
And she says
"you know I do"
But johnny's on the run
Cause he stole a gun
He needs to disappear
Johnny shot a man
And now he's scared
She whispers in his ear
Rebel say a prayer
That there's a place somewhere
Where rock and roll goes on
And we'll be free
There's glory waiting there
Can feel it in the air
Rebel say a prayer
(rebel say a prayer rebel say a prayer)
I'll meet you there
(rebel say a prayer)
Johnny pulls her close
Says I've got to go
Cause they'll come for me tonight
And he turns to leave
But she won't let go
