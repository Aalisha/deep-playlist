Standing at the end of the horizon
Looking at another setting sun
Nature gave us all these toys to play with
But we've abused them, each and every one

Lit the fuse but they can't retire

We're going to the wall of fire
Tip-toeing on the great high wire
Let's have a real fire

City slickers built the great illusion
