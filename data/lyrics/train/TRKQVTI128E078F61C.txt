She tries to erase
She tries to replace
How it feels but I
Know she can never go home

She tries to erase
She tries to replace
How it feels but I
Know she can never go home

Try to forget about
Living a good life
Free of positions
That make her feel vulnerable.
She's loved and she's lost
She's bearing the cost
She seeks to find the answer for.

Woke up today around
six in the morning,
violently shaking
Remembering what she once saw.
She bared it alone
Still she carried on
She seeks to find the answers for

The reason her life did not turn out
More like a movie
She's trying to forget it all

She tries to erase
She tries to replace
...
