I'm talking, you won't talk
You won't hear what I say
I'm walking you will not walk
Day after day,
You sit there blaming the world
Nobody owes you a thing
You say you're too young
To know what you like, well
Nobody gave it to me

It's alright get it out of the way
Just start again...
You can't keep running away

Oh no you can't keep running away
You will catch yourself up
At the end of the day
Cos you can't keep running away

Keep looking over your shoulder
That's where I'll stay
To catch you before you get old yeah!
And it's too late to change your ways
You're marking time
What are you waiting for
...
