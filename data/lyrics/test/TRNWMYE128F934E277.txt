Stained by your blood
And by the crowd that daze me
Invoking your weeps and my spear
Deep within your wounds
But what's this void in my veins...
This strange fear inside...
Why hell am I crying?
Why can I feel all your nails...
Feel all your thorns and all your pain?...
But why can I feel all your thirst
Feel all your sadness, hear all the voices in your brain?...
...
