Passin' the kind buds.
Kickin' back in the sand in the sun.
To be alive is lovin'.
Where the shore meets the sea
Man I'm hummin' I'm hummin

I'm free as I stare at the sea.
And I'm not comin' down.
The world is yours once you have found.
The good is to share.
Which is elsewhere.

The beauty
of green is where light is now broken
by what it touches.
Remembering
what you once had told me hit home.
And hasn't it always been so.

I'm free as I stare at the sea.
And I'm not comin' down.
The world is yours once you have found.
The good is to share.
Which is elsewhere.

Like I said before I'll say it once more.
Knew you would make me feel so good.
Wanna do you right.
