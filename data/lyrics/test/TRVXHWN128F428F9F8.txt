am i missing something in the way you said to me
"we're missing something, let's find the vacancy."
the object shouldn't be to be on top of things.
we agree that falling off is more interesting.

together we've come to the conclusion that all
is won even if we're losing. all is successful
just as long as we're smiling.
together we're lost in confusion.
which is fine, our perilous delusion.
camp fire, hill top excursion. explosions.
