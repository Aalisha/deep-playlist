(QuatroTuckey)
By the way he looks across his shoulder
And the way he sees things through his eyes
It's impossible to disguise
He's a Mama's Boy

So confusing to my sense of humour
Is the way he hurts so easily
Anyone can see he's a Mama's Boy

Firstly he holds me too softly
Then he touches me barely
Mama's Boy
Then he loves me too quickly
Always everything but manly
Mama's BoyMama's Boy

It's a funny kind of situation
