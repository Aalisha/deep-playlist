Advantage no love
People playing
Yes they're staying with their ego

In silence alone
All upheaval
Yes, still staying with my ego
With no resolve

Advantage feeding all your egos
Advantage meaningless as people
At last we're sucked into the evil life

Thanks for the worst of it
Thanks for the least of it
You never do it right
You never do it right
