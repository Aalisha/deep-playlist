Hey Sister Moon are you coming round soon
Hey Sister Moon, in your midnight blue
Hey Sister Moon, are you coming round soon
Hey Hey and Sister Moon, oh I've been missing you
Now if you take my heart you can take my hand
And I will be with you up in the big land

And groove on Sister, groove on Sister Moon
Groove on, my baby, grove on, groove on Sister Moon

Now Sister d'you remember all of those days
All those crazy nights seem lost in a haze
But every new moment that's a brand new start
When you got the nature down deep in your heart
And as the mountains move on the winds of change
...
