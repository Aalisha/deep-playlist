When I'm with you, the world is mine
I found true love, the feeling is fine
I'm helpless like a baby
And I look in your eyes
You said that you love me
Love me tonight.

Girl, I've been searching for so long time
For someone like you
We'll make it last 'till the end of time
I'm so glad I found you

I'm gonna sing a song of love, and dedicate to you
I'm gonna sing a song of love, girl I love you.
I'm gonna sing a song of love, and dedicate to you
...
