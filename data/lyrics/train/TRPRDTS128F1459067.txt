Everybody all around the world, stand up all my brothers
 Joining our hands, united we're stronger
 Fighting for peace, caring about our loved ones
 Trusting ourselves, sharing our feeling, believe me
 
 If Only I Could I'd make this world a better place
 If Only I Could I'd make this world a better place
 
 Oh believe me, believe
 Believe me, believe, If Only I Could
