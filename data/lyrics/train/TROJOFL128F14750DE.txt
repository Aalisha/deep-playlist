You know enough to know the way
Six billion people just one name
(I found)
I found tomorrow in today
Apocalyptic and insane, my dreams will never change

You wanna be the one in control
You wanna be the one who's alive
You wanna be the one who gets old
It's not a matter of luck, it's just a matter of time

Stand out on the edge of the earth
Stand out on the edge of the earth
Dive into the center of fate
...
