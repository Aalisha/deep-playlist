The square's a picture postcard
And it's just like on TV
The brasseries and sprawling pavement cafés
Casting lumiere onto the streets of Gay Paris
And the searchlight from the great tower hits the evening
As the white buildings sauté in the oil of the setting sun...
The doorway of the Gare Du Nord is a festival
Of commuters and tourists all on their beat
The hive of cars and trams and taxis
Leaving time-lapse ribbons hanging there, all down the street
...
