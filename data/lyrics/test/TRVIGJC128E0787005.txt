Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, I've found him
I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker in town (right on, right on, right on)
Who is it?
Well it's Grand Puba honey
With my man snug doogie love
Droppin' 2000, dig the way this go down
Check it
I hit a flow all dipped in lotion

Sit back and sip moe as I'm countin' my doe
Grand Puba macks well, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we might talk
Honies know 'cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then it's all cream and baby
I made this one for the brothers in the party
To find a hottie
And dance body to body
Step one: first you grab honey by the waist
Step two: then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three: then ya look her dead in the face
Step four: now it's time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's
The teasa's, the one who wants the money and the visa's
I'ma tell honies straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, Dig it
This ones designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time
