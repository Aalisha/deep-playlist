He's not sure what he should do,
She's 17 he's 22,
Is that too much of a difference?
So instead look what he done,
He found a girl who's 31,
Is that too much of a difference?

She's got everything he wants,
She's got everything he needs,
Take her back (x6)
To her place.

She's got everything he wants,
She's got everything he needs,
Take her back (x6)
To her place.

She's got a mate who said 'Behave, you're not too bad but twice her age!'
Does that really make any difference?
He's had a few,
We've all been there,
Just 17 but he don't care,
I don't think he knows the difference.
