He'd beat her up to come, she ran around
She shot him and they laid him in the ground
There's two children left without a home
Wondering what in world is going on

Guilty of murder first degree
Rushy mountain penitentiary
There's two children left without a home
Wondering what in world is going on

=CHORUS=
Who showed who
Who played it smart
