How could I let you get so attached
Before I knew you, you had us matched
A broken quartet plays your heartstrings
You're out of tune with everything
Nerve gas, nerve gas, no class
I get asphyxiated
Funny how fast you faded
Nerve gas...

Its cold in the kitchen my nicotine tongue
Is dry and sarcastic and blacker than lungs
