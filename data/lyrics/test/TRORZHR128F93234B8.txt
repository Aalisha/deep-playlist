Would believe me, if I told you that I'm sorry 
I didn't mean to make you sad 
When I heard that you were leaving home to travel 
I didn't get chance to take it back 
But what I wanna know is...

Did you spare a little thought for me? 

Do you remember when we queued outside forever? 
Just to go and get IDed
