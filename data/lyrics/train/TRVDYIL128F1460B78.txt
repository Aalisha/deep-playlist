(AZ) Baby bring that ashtray in here

Aiight

(AZ) And bring my mail it's on top of the counter

Here baby

(AZ) Check, what's this

I don't know some mail came thru today

(AZ) Fishscale, Professional, what's this about men
lemme see what this about

Anyway, the food will be ready in 20 minutes


Peace Allah, hope tha scribe reach ya hands in good health
As for self, no sense of worrying my cards been dealt
Sunk in a cell, fishscale, fifth year of my bid
Finally got a chance recent to connect with my kids
It's kinda hard thru carelessness I scared they moms
And temporary I was barred voluntary the bond
Nevertheless, it's issues I need to address
Pertaining the certain statements that made me confess
Faced with life, it bites when reality hit
And wit crime come a lot of technicality shit
Thru many co-defendants conspiracies linking
Like the court system designed to keep the mind from thinking
Fog ya vision, guess it's just the odds of living
But like me, most great men became god in prison
