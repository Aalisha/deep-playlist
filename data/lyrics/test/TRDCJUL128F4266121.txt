Baby, never have I ever wanted anyone
Like I want you babe
Come and, let me show you just how much I feel inside
I got so much love
Oh baby when I get near you, ooh
I can't control what I'm feeling, baby
I got so much love to give you
That I would probably want you all the time
1 - (Cari√±o, quedate conmigo carino)
I gotta have your love
