Feeling like I've come undone, hotter than a summer sun
Baby I can barely speak, this is what you do to me
Shivers send me wild, dancing down my spine, every part of me is sensitized
I've been here before, knew there could be more, baby you are what I've waited for
Tonight, we are incredible, natural

How did I get so incurable, breakable, weak inside
You make me feel supersensual
Oo oo oo oah, oo oo oo oah
