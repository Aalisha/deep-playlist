Your face is beaming
You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
...
