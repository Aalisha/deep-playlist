Well, I woke up this mornin' looked out my door
I thought I'd hear that milk cow, I can tell the way she lore
If you see my milk cow, please drive her on home
Ain't had no milk and butter, woo, since that cow got gone

Now you've gotta treat me right, day by day
Get out that little prayer book, get on your knees and pray
'Cause you're gonna need, yes, you're gonna need my help someday
