Just a stray little Gypsy boy, trying on the highway for size
A cowboy kid cracking 105, crossing the New Mexico line

(I believe) I believe we got a live one here, (hey hey) no inhibitions no fear

Chorus:
Hey you wanna play your hand
Or are you just playing for the girls in the grandstand
Don't you wanna roll them bones
Are you a tumbleweed or a rolling stone

Tag along with my little vagabond, as long as you got something to burn
We'll slide on over to old Antone's
...
