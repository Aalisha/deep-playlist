You won't wait a long time,
we will join you soon
It's a fateful crime
But it's the same for everyone
We live our life and then we go

(I) know you were suffering
Watching us a last time
Emotional torture
But it's the same for everyone
We live our life and then we go

Yes he was a good man,
He was the best among us
But God choose him to be back to his home
