Bikeage

Running out of time again
Where did you go wrong this time?
When your problems overwhelm you
Go get drunk it's party time
Take a quaalude, relax your mind
Relax your body too
Run from problems but
You'll never get away
No one loves you, and you
Wonder why?

Sitting there with your
Mouth full of beer
Your eyes are glazed, your face is red
