Written by: Dick Smith, Felix Bernard


Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
in the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
we're happy tonight,
walking in a winter wonderland.


Gone away ist he bluebird
here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song,
as we go along,
walking in a winter wonderland.
