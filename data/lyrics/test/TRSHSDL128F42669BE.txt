Well, these Highway Forty blues,
I've walked holes in both my shoes.
Counted the days since I've been gone,
And I'd love to see the lights of home.

Wasted time and money too;
Squandered youth in search of truth.
But in the end I had to lose,
Lord above, I've paid my dues.
Got the Highway Forty blues.
