The galaxy is open
So paint me on your right hand
Now let's fly off Superman style
You know it would be so good
I'd never look back
With every bit of breath I take
My thoughts say I want you
And there is nothing I can do
To control these natural instincts
If you're ready we can take it to the heights

And the Air We Breathe will take us
The Air We Breathe
And no, the loneliness won't break us
Coz I know all we need
Is the Air We Breathe
The Air We Breathe

Apollo's turned and twisted
(oh my god)
As you take me in your arms tonight
(take me in your arms tonight)
Oh, it feels so quiet
In turbulent times
(tur-bu-lent times)

Well I, I think I'll build a stairway
And like a Roman in your heart
...
