With no father, and no son
He's a Christian - but not the one
With a guidance, like a lemming
Fell so deep in the sea
There's a glory in the brain
It's so crass - it's so vain
Oh mother nature and tunnel vision
Back to back - oh sing to me
Take my heart, take my soul
Take my Jesus, take my dole
Kill my children, steal my home
I'm the one
I'm the one
...
