From the L, the O
The V to the E
With the guys
Are free
Love see
The L, the O and the V, the E
Love, love, love

The words love and life both have four letters
But there's two, different things all together
'Cuz I've liked many ladies in my day
But just like the wind, they've all blown away

You see, to love someone is atmosphere
But to both they'll share, when ones not there
There's no one way, it can be explained
I guess it's the way I smile, when I hear your name

It's the little things that you do, that mean so much
It's the care that you put, into every touch
It's the way I trust you, and you trust me
I guess some of us, are so lucky

I was known for having, the upper hand
I was known as a stone cold ladies man
If it wasn't for you, I'd be that way still
But lately there's a change, in Jalil

Thought my friends play games and teach me a lot
I know I'm more than happy, wit what I got
When I get up in the morning, and go to work
See all day long, I stay alert

'Til we come home at night and close your door
Two people sharing, one common cause
When I say one love, you can trust me
'Cuz never have I been so lucky

One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
