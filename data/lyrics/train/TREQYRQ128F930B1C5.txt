Dance to the beat
Of the living dead
Lose sleep baby
And stay away from bed
Raw power is sure to come
a runnin' to you

If you're alone
And you got the shakes
So am I baby
And I got what it takes
Raw power will surely come
Running to you

Raw power got a healin' hand
Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power is more than soul
It's got a son called rock and roll
Raw power honey just won't quit
Raw power I can feel it
Raw power baby can't be beat
