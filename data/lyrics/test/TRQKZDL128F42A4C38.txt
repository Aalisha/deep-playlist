It's like, I care about you, I think about you all the time
it's like, we friends and shit?
which means we treat each other right
you'll be there for me when you gonna be there for me

Verse 1: (Vast Aire Kramer)
yo it wasn't even like that
I wanted my cardiovascular to fight back
cupid had me runnin' circles blindfolded
in the daytime with a flashlight looking for her
yo, sit back, relax and smell the roses
a fly girl by any other name would still be that
but the trick is to see that
I'm caught in between future's fantasies and memories I played back
told my man I started sword fighting
'cause fencing was similar to tongue kissing
if you wait too long you gonna end up confessin'
all I think about is you undressin'
I extended my thoughts in a relationship
but they sunk like the titanic relation-ships
she was in a love triangle
but it wasn't like my feelings weren't there to make it a square
penny's for her thoughts
she's my very own American Beauty, red petals when we talk
...the f word

Chorus 1: (Vordul Megalon)
She like music, got me heavily booted(?)
when I'm out with her feelings be mixin'
...
