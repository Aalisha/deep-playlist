I'm glad Jesus came glory to his name of what a friend is he
He's so freely gave his own love to save from all the sins set free
I've got that old time religion in my heart it's way down inside
I've got that new kind of feeling in my heart real lullabies
Nobody knows what it means to me, nobody knows but my God and me
