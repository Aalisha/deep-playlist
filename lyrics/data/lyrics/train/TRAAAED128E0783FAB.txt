Walking down to the water's edge
Where I have been before
If I don't find my love sometime
I'm walking out that door
Some may come and some may go
But no-one seems to be
The person I've been searching for
The one who's meant for me

Biding my time, trying to find a heart that's lonely
Looking for her, my love my one and only
Maybe I'll dream, tonight about the girl who'll be coming my way
So I'll take this chance and celebrate the day

When I'm making my way through an open door
I've got some love and so much more
And I'm ready to make someone mine
...
