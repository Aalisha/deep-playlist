When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
(You know it's hard, you know it gets so hard)
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone
