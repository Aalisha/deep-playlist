(Into my brain)

Something sinister sits in the corner
Ignore it if you want, but remember that we warned you
There in the basement, behind the furnace
Eating off all of your fears so I can flourish
Puts the shook in your bones
Making all my noise when your parents ain't home
And if the bulbs burnt out in my underground lair
Guarantee you're gonna sprint back up them stairs
Step by step by, let me get by
It's all in your mind, you do it every time
The dark you're scared, is anybody there?
Try to stay strong, pray for help
Well you can bring that fear, I survive on it
I thrive on it, I'm alive as you allow
When I climb out of your mind, to eat your time
You can redeem your fear now
And all the white girls sing along
