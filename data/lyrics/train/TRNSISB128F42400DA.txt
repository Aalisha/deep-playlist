They say the skies of Lebanon are burning
Those mighty cedars bleeding in the heat
They're showing puctures on the television
Women and children dying in the street
Ant we're still at it in our own place
Still trying to reach the future thru' the past
Still trying to care tomorrow from a tombstone.
But hey! Don't listen to me!
Cos this wasn't ment to be no sad song
We've heard to much of that before
Right now I only want to be here with you
