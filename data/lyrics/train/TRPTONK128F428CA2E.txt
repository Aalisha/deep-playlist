And now I'm getting bored of laughing out loud
We wear ego like a shroud
And we won't shut up
Yeah, we've got it figured out this time, we're sure

Put our minds to rest, onto the next term
November 7th was just another day for the world to laugh
It was just more of the same

The game being played shut out, the voices of sanity
