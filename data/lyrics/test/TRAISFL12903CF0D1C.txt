He got a rhinestone rocket ship and disco balls
Leaves glitter on the shitter when duty calls
What's cookin' good lookin'
No he ain't shy, down in your kitchen
Finger-lickin' in your hot pink pie

He's a bar star baby
How do we harness his energy
He's a bar star baby
Shine your light on me
Beneath the bar is a love bazaar
And at the center of the action
You will find the bar star

Got those planets in orbit
Some near, some far
Got those bodies in motion 'round and 'round
The bar star

In elliptical patterns hang onto your pride
It's a cosmic wonder how they never collide

He's a bar star baby
He's the king, king, king of the party scene
Lipstick stains all over his jeans
He's the bar star baby 'til it all implodes
...
