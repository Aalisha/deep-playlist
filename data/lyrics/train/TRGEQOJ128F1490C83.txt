Who's that walkin' round here? Mercy
Sounds like baby patter, baby elephant patter, that's what I call it
Say up in Harlem at a table for two
There were four of us, me, your big feet and you
From your ankles up, I'd say you sure look sweet
From there down there's just too much feet

Yes, your feet's too big
Don't want ya 'cause ya feet's too big
Can't use ya 'cause ya feet's too big
I really hate ya 'cause ya feet's too big
