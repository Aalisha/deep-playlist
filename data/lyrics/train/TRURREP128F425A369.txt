they want us to tell them
what to burn into the groove
we're just gonna sit
and let them make the first move
the radio obsession
doesn't mean a thing to me
i don't like first impressions
and i don't watch much tv

i don't want to think about it
who, what, when, or where
i don't want to think about it
i don't really care
i don't want to think about
creating something new
i don't want to think about it
because i've got much better
