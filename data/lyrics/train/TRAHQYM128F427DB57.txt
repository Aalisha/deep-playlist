We are the ones that you come to discover
You shall witness the truth
Bathed in moonlight we praise the earth mother
Soon you shall have your proof

We are the ones who rejoice the earth's power
Nature is our true friend
Our deeds of flesh will excite one another
We reach an orgasmic end

Feel the time start to slip away
To the ancient ones we will pray
