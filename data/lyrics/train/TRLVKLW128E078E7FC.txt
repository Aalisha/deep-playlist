There's so many places I wanna kiss you, baby
I cannot begin to start
I realize that I'm not the only man that made love to
You
But I'm the only man who knows how to keep you
Okay, baby, your bodys mine, believe it, mmm

All the, the places I will kiss you
Oh, baby, let me kiss you (Please let me kiss you) with
All my love (You
Know I love you, girl)
All the (Yeah), the places I will kiss you (All the
Places)
Oh, honey, let me kiss you (Let me, baby) with all my
Love (With all my
Love)

Here I am, I'm ready, baby
My desire is to please you, honey
I'll concentrate on you
There's no other who can do what I'll do to you

Lights down, the mood is right
Come on over here and hold me tight
Your body will be turned on till midnight
The spots that make you wet and hot, baby, surrender to
Me

All the, the places I will kiss you
Oh, baby, let me kiss you (Yeah, yeah, yeah) with all
My love
All the, the places I will kiss you
Oh, honey, let me kiss you (Yeah, yeah, yeah) with all
My love
