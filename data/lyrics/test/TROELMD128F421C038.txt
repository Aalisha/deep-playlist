If you're feeling sad and lonely
There's a service I can render
Tell the one who loves you only
I can be so warm and tender

Call me, don't be afraid
You can call me
Maybe it's late but just call me
Tell me and I'll be around

When it seems your friends desert you
There's somebody thinking of you
I'm the one who'll never hurt you
Maybe that's because I love you

Call me, don't be afraid
You can call me
...
