She thinks I'm much too thin
She asks me if I'm sick
What's a girl to do with friends like this?
She lets me drive her car so I can score an eighth
From the lesbians out west in Venice

Oh, California in the summer
Ah, and my hair is growing long
And fuck yeah, we can live like this

But if you left it up to me
Everyday would be a holiday from real
We'd waste our weeks beneath the sun
We'd fry our brains
And say it's so much fun out here
When it's all over
I'll come back for another year
