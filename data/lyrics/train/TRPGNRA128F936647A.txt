A new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Ciprianis
Like Beyonc√©, they're getting by or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce, a whole lot of tears
Rolling down her cheeks, crying till she's sound asleep (sleep)
Preach (preach), pray (pray) that today is not a lonely one
You gotta know you not the only one

You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
