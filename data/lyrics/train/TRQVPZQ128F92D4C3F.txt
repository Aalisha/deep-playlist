I, never thought I'd come running back to you, but I did
Yeah, yeah
I never thought you'd take me back but you did
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

(repeat twice)

This time around, I ain't gonna let you down
This time around
This time around, I ain't gonna let you down
This time around

Never thought you'd come running
Never thought you'd come running
