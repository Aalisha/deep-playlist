I was alone, blinded, unaware
Then their voices came near, now inside my mind they're always there
Telling me what to say and do
Guiding my path, carrying me through

Gospels of the night, sung under the northern light
The thing that once was me is no more human inside
I am lost, I am dead yet alive

[Chorus]
My eyes the mirror my soul
