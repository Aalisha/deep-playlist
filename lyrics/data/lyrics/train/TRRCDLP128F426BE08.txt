Somewhere in a market square
The cobblestone still shine
Glassy eyes behold the sight
Through another cup of wine...
The one eyed jester skips and turns
As he makes his way through the crowd
While the tavern's royalty try not to laugh aloud...
The jester does another spin
And then falls to the floor
...
