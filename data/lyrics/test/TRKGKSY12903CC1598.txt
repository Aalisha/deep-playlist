La la la (rich kids),
La la la.

Yo, turn that shit up.

I coulda went to college like rich kids do,
Buyin' weed with the money your mom sent you,
But I don't give a damn 'bout no higher degree,
'Cause you know in rock and roll, I got a PhD, bitch.

(That's right, kids.)

We got all that we need, packed it up in the van,
Put the pedal to the floor, gave the finger to the man.

I'm not a rich kid, maybe that's a good thing,
Ain't got shit, but I got this far.
Keepin it real and rhymin' and stealin'
Doing what I want.
