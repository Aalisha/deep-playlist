Words and music by roddy frame

Well you can get grades, toe the line,
Keep your behind above the water in the meantime,
Join the corporate pyramid,
I couldn't blame you if you did,
Until you sell out your brother while your sister falls,
Playin' daddy, doing the company crawl,
You don't deserve your daughter's kiss, I know it's sad,
That's how it is.
