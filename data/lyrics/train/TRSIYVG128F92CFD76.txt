Saw an old friend yesterday 
Who's a big success 
Got a Bentley and a Rolex 
And a Gucci dress 
Got the guys all lined up waitin 
For her to pull their string 
And she told me all about 
Her latest hot sweet thing 

She's got everything a girl could ever want or need 
All that money can afford 
But there's still a voice inside that keeps crying out 
For something more 

CHORUS 
Something emotional 
Something that's beautiful 
Something that stands the test of time 
...
