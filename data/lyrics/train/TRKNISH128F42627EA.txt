One thing that you've got to know
Don't want this damn misery
When you find out what I mean
We will both wash ashore

I thought you were stronger
I didn't even understand
Today I know I was wrong
I'm taking no more demand

Today's the day for finding out
Where the road begins to wind
Now I know what you're all about
Taking no more of this unkind

You put my heart in quarantine
Wish we could be like before
