Fullmoon staring at me tonight
time to feed my evil appetite
live or die at the strike of midnight
the choice is yours,
but you're running out of time

I have the touch everybody fears
my skin is poison ivy
I have the look that'll hypnotize
my eyes are lit with fire

My thirst grows stronger each night
no where to hide, I'll sense your
presence
near
this hatred burning so bright
I'll cum just to watch you drown in
...
