On this cold and windy Sunday
I'm sitting here alone... It's Autumn
I'm looking at a yellow picture
You have been gone forever

Oh it's so very hard, growing old on your own, alone
I'm trying to remember... the days...
When we were young

Since forever, I still remember your ways
Since forever, I still remember

I have been reading your letter, over and over again
I can't believe you're gonna be here today
I can't believe... this is Sunday
...
