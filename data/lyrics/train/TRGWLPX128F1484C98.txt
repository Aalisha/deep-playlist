Hear that whistle its 10 o'clock
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
Come on baby it's time to rock
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
I'm so glad I've got you here
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)

Oo-ee, mmm this feelin' is killin' me
Aaaw shucks
Well, I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
(I love you so)
Just hold me tight and don't let go

Thunder, lightnin', wind and rain
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
Love is formin' inside my brain
(Don't let go)
(Don't let go)
I'm so eager I'm nearly dyin'
(Don't let go)
...
