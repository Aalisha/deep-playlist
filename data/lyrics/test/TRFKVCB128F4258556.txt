Horrible memories are back again
My horrible memories
They haven't a friend
Sayin' it before
Now do it again
Memories of tragedies
Memories you scare me
I'm gonna inebriate them
I'm gonna inebriate them
I will get it
And I will use it
To my advantage
Right up to the brink
Of damage

I will suck from it
...
