How many times would I have to say it
And how long would it take for you to believe me
How long would it take you, girl

And how many letters in my name
If you can't say it right, would you still be with me
How long would you stay

Look at what you've done to me
We wreck love almost everyday
Nothing gets real sad
I never felt real bad
