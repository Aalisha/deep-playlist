oooooooooooooo

I will endure, all the time.
Hold together in the worst conditions.
For at birth, we knew it to be, one of a kind.
mmhmmmmmm
And as it grew into this love of a legend,
we both made sure this piece of heaven
would withstand any test,
for the strength was made of love, faith and trust.

And until all the glitter's gone,
We'll be adding on to make it even stronger.
True love will never die,
Long after the love has lost it's shine.
