I can feel the pressure coming down from all around
So many deadlines to meet
Life has gotten crazy again
So many people counting on me
I keep my nose pressed to the grindstone
I find comfort there
I work for a living and I get it done
I don't have a moment to spare

You think you've got me figured out
Well there's not really too much more
I work for a living and I get it done
