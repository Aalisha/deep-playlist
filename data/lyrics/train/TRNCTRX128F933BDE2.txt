[I. A Moment Frozen In Time]

When I long for the truth
When I search for my youth
That's when I call out your name, inside myself
Deep inside I know there's something to re-live

Day after day, life can be so hard
I need the strength to carry on
That's when I wait for you to come back
and turn wrong to right
With a word I'll be setting my spirit free
With a word I'll be where I am meant to be
And so I await for you to come back
Yes, I await for the spirit to rise

Rise! Rise!

When I long for the truth
When I search for my youth
That's when I call out your name, inside myself
Deep inside I know there's something to re-live
