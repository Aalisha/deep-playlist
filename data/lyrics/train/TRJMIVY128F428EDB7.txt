There’s something about her eyes when she stares
Nothing penetrates, seems she doesn’t care
There’s something about the way she moves her lips
When she talks to me it feels just like a kiss

There’s something that she does me that I can’t explain
But when she does what she does, oh my God
It’s like oh my God, here we go again, here we go again

She’s so complex
She’s got me in this voodoo hex
She’s so complex
I’m so perplexed I guess it’s the sex
