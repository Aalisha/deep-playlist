You're not to know you're not to know
What's set in stone what's set in stone
She says she's fine says she's fine and she likes it
She's coming over and changing it all around
She said to say she said to say is that okay is that okay
She says she's fine she's fine and she likes it
She's coming over and dancing with girls now

Never ever right never ever right I can't stand well
I can't stand the sight I can't stand the sight of you

There'll be no way there'll be no way
