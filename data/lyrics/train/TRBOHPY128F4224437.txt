I was your boyfriend when we were fifteen
It's the happiest that I've ever been
Even though we didn't understand
How to do much more than just hold hands
There's so much about you I miss
The clumsy way we used to kiss
I wish I convinced you, you've made a mistake
If memory serves, we're still on a break
Other girls went and other girls came
I can't get over my old flame
I'm still in love with Emily Kane

Every girl that I've seen since
Looks just like you when I squint
I know you said it's for the best
I still don't understand why you left
