Call me Kevin, Chris or Johnny, George,
whatever you choose
I'm in disguise telling lies
I got nothing to lose
You were looking out
for number one
Just having fun
You thought that
you could dump me
by the road when you were done
Just watch your back
You're leaving tracks
'cause you got mud on your shoes

'cause baby there is something you have missed
You've been playing a contortionist

And I'm coming after you
...
