Let it be soon don't hesitate
Make it now don't wait
Open your heart and let my love come in
I want the moment to start when I can fill your heart with
More love and more joy than age or time could ever destroy
Oh honey, now my love will be so sound
Gonna take about a hundred life times
To live it down, wear it down and tear it down

This is no fiction, this is no act
