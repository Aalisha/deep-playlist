Started ou-out last night, I was thinkin' of days gone by-y
Of the times I've had, And the things that I've left behi-ind
Some change, some die, Still we manage to survi-ive
It's knowin' when and what to do-oo, It's up to you-ou
Don't know what's goin' on, I can't wait 'til

One summer, I'll find a way-hay-ay-ay
One summer, will always remai-ai-ai-ain
One summer, remember the way-ay

Hauled down, turned around, Find myself facin' the wa-a-all
I think back to school, it's all the same, slightly different ru-u-ules
Ou-outside on your own, Watch yourself 'cause you're all alo-one
