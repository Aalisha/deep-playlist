Vanderpool, Vanderpool
Professor of the piano
Got himself a wavy do
Vanderpool, Vanderpool

From the ugly Madam's gilded room
The ivories tinkle out a merry tune
While out in the street the Reverend's gloom
Ain't saving nobody

Big Jim, Colossimo
Kissing his fist before rolling the bones
Crying, come on, seven, don't you know
Baby needs a new pair of shoes

Vanderpool, Vanderpool
A diamond ring on every finger
Well the papers assumed
He never stepped into the room
Without his velvet slippers

One legged pimps along the avenue
