The cards are stacking up against us
These days our luck is running low
It's hard to explain but a little bit of rain
Seems to follow us wherever we go

Black cat sittin' on a ladder
Broken mirror on the wall
We're not a bit superstitious
No need to worry at all

'Cause when we can't roll a seven
And our last lucky penny is gone
This world can be tough
...
