I Don't Know Enough About You

I know a little bit about alot of things
But I don't know enough about you
Just when I think you're mine you try a different line
Baby what can I do

I read the latest news
No buttons on my shoes
Baby I'm confused about you
You've got me in a spin
And what a spin I'm in
Cause I don't know enough about you

Jack of all trades
Master of none
