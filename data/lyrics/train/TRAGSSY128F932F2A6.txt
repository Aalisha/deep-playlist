Take me as I am
Someone you don't know
Even in the dark you may not be sure
Take me while you can
I can see you standing in the smoky entrance
Giving up your good intentions
Leave the shadows dancing
Dancing on their own
Let the moment free you now
Leave it all behind you
I'll know where you've gone
Let the world go on
Take me as I am
I may disappear, fade into the night
Lighter than your thoughts
Take me while you can
Never knowing who or what you are until you're
Living with the unfamiliar
Leave the shadows dancing
Dancing on their own
