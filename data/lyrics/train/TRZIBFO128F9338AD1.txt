You can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
She only wanted someone to play with
All I wanted was love to stay

If you get the wrong woman
There's only one thing you can do
Just dig a hole, jump right in it
And pull the ground right over you

You can have her, I don't want her
She didn't love me anyway
