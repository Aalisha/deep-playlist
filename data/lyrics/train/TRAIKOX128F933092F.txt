Footsteps echo on familiar streets
Crossing bridges, never burned
I am tired of playing hide and seek
Is this all that I have learned?

Looking for a diamond in the dark
I was sure you were the one
You held me spell bound
While you made your mark
Now, the damage has been done

Goodbye girl, it's a game
We play every time we say
Goodbye girl, you hypnotize
I can't say goodbye

I'm afraid when I turn out the light
Words you say while you're asleep
...
