She's a funky feline machine
Crazy cat inside your dream
She's a honey, she sting like a bee
You're the punk and she's the queen
She's an angel, she's a dove
With a taste for a villain's blood
Packin' heat, struttin' on the street
Chew you up and make you meat

Sexy feline machine
Sexy feline machine
Sexy feline machine
Sexy feline machine

She's a sexy feline machine
She's a sexy feline machine
