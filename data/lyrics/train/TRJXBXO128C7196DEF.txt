Look out ahead
I see danger come
I wanna pistol
I wanna gun
I'm scared baby
I wanna run
This world's crazy
Give me the gun

Baby, baby
Ain't it true
I'm immortal
When I 'm with you
But I want a pistol
In my hand
I wanna go to
A different land

I met a man
He told me straight
You gotta leave
It's getting late
