I know you're happy when you smile
I know it's taken me awhile
I know I'm going out of style
10, 000 miles from you
But everything is still O.K.
'Cause I'm closer everyday
Which is more than I would have to say
If I was next to you
Think of all the times and places
Step across the open spaces, that lead back to you

And you know that I won't let you go
Sometimes so near and now so far (now so far)
Retrack the paces that have brought me here
Close my eyes and move along

To where I belong

Thinking, looking, hoping that I'll find a way
...
