I would do just about anything (repeat)
Well I used to have what I would call
A very limited vocabulary
And the only two words
I could wrap my tongue around
Were i and me
But now I feel so clever
That you would swear I ate a dictionary
And the new word that I've added
Brings up my words to three
What am I gonna do
Word number three is you

*I would do anything, anything
I would do anything, anything
Anything to be with you
Anything you asked me to
I would do anything, anything
Just about anything, anything
