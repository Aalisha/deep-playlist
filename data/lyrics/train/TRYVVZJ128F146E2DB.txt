Boogie
Boogie down baby
Ooo-uh, boogie
Baby, lets boogie down

I'm bad enough to make an --other-bad lie
I'm gonna you on a natural high
And I know I can satisfy, hey
I wanna... love ya, kiss, and hold ya baby

Ooh-hoo, tonight
Boo-hoo-hoo, boogie down

Hey, hey
Boogie
Boogie down, baby
Ooo, boogie
Baby, lets boogie down

Lets get it on, girl, don't hesitate
Let my love flood your water gate
Sweet lover, don't make me wait, hey
I wanna... love ya, kiss, and hug ya, baby, tonight
