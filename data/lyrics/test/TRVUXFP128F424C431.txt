Members only, it's a private party
Don't need no money to qualify
Don't bring your checkbook, bring your broken heart
'Cause it's members only tonight

Say you lost your woman, say you lost your man
You got a lot of problems, oh, in your life
Well, they're throwing a party for the brokenhearted
And it's members only tonight
