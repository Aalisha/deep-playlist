My name is Jack and I live in the back
Of the Greta Garbo Home
With friends I will remember
Wherever I may roam

And my name's Jack and I live in the back
Of the 'Greta Garbo Home for Wayward Boys and Girls'
We all love Jack, we live in the back
Of the 'Greta Garbo Home for Wayward Boys and Girls'

There goes Fred with his hands on his head
'Cause he thinks he's heard the bomb
And here comes Superman
Who really puts it on

There's lots of fun and I love to run
Up and down the stairs
I make as much noise as I want
...
