I am a clown, I am a clown, clown.
You'll always see me smile you'll never see me frown.
Sometimes my scenes are good,
sometimes they're bad.
No funny ha ha, funny sad.

I am a clown, look at the clown, clown,
Always a laughing face whenever you're around.
Always the same routine, I never change.
Not funny ho ho funny strange.
