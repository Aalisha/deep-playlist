High stepper, hip dresser
High stepper, hip dresser

High steppin', hip dressin' fella
You got it together
High steppin', hip dressin' fella
You got it together

There's a guy in the neighborhood
And, oh Lord, if I could
I'd wrap him up and take him home

His machine is always clean
Whenever he's on the scene
And there's always a crowd around

Girls watch him like a hawk
Watchin' his body talk
Oh Lord
