I like the bullet in the water, yeah
I like the morning after pill, hello
Breathe in, lose control

I wanna f*** ya in fire, yeah
I wanna hold ya till you breathin' no more
Can't hide, oh

Meet me in the clouds
Let me work it out
Don't you take it personal, personal
Don't you like the control, yeah

Meet me in the clouds
(Meet me in the clouds)
Let me work it out
(Let me work it out)
And don't you take it personal, personal
Don't you like the control, yeah
(Don't you like the control)

Let's tell the people what we have to say
Let's tell the people till they can't hear no more
Can't cry more and more
...
