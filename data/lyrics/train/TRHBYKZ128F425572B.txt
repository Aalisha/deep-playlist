When you are down and feeling low
and you don't know which way to go
you just pick up your own telephone girl
If you get in-touch with me
I'll be there instantly,
It's a shame you can't belong to me, So

Whenever you're down (Look me up)
Whenever you're down (Look me up)
Because whenever you're down, just look around

Life too short to live along,
...
