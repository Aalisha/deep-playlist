I saw you walk into the store
Just as I was leaving.
I don't know why it should matter.
It's history repeating.
I heard my name ring out through the air.

I'm looking back, you're fixing your hair.
There's nothing left between us.

Blame it on, blame it on yourself.
Blame it on, blame it on yourself.

Through the streets and down the hill.
