Straight to the top and we won't stop 
No holding back prepare the attack 
We ain't gonna quit so don't give us shit
Our time has come to shine in the sun
The feeling is right it can't be wrong
Forge on ahead we will be strong
The mind is a tool makes us wise to the game
We're not in this for all the fortune and fame
Stop take a look and see what we've done
This is our fight where the battles shall be won
The time is right now don't think of the past
