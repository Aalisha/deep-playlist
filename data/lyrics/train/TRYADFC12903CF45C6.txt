tarnish the crowns, stone them judge and jury
upon the swerves reclaimed in slaved simplistics
refuse and render, defuse and repel
refuse the rue and force a panic in the creed
or devour the virus, suckle the seed, remain slayed
attached to an evil that bares the name
this is subversion - this is humanities coup
this symptomatic, rushed to certain demise, for us
...
