All the girls and the boys
And people making noise
Just let me hear you shout -
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!
Pump up your fist
If you twist like this
'Til the lights go out -
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!

All the girls and the boys
And people making noise
Just let me hear you shout
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!
Pump up your fist
If you twist like this
'Til the lights go out
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!

Katie,
I don't know why I even try
'Cause lately
You're always out with other the guys
Pretty baby
Don't you know I'll treat you right
I'll go crazy
If you pass me up tonight

Hey - Hey - Hey Hey!
Hey - Hey - Hey Hey Hey!

All this time can't get it off my mind
Dance the night away
Keep rocking with me
When the grooves alright
Rocking all night
I want to hear you say

All the girls and the boys
And people making noise
Just let me hear you shout
Bring 'em out! Bring 'em out!
Pump up your fist
