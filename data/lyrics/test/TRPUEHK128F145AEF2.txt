Whoa, whoa... ho...
You made me happy
This you can bet
You split right beside me, yeah
And I won't forget
And I really love you
You should know
I wanna make sure I'm right, girl
Before I let go
Now we've had our good time
That's what they say
We've hurtin' each other
Girl, it's a shame
I won't be foolish, no, no
I wanna know
I wanna make sure I'm right, girl, oh
Before I let go, yeah, uh
You know I thank God sun rises and shines on you
