Nuff respect to all the boys and girls
Ladies and gentlemen I go up early in the morning to work
Come down selector

Monday morning time to come along
Working at raggamuffin takes over
Seven to five PM everyday
We are tryin to make a livin - come on
Saturday is a rub-a-dub day
Is a lot of is to pay at the end
Sunday is a resting day
Back to work on the monday morning

I wanna girla - me a go see my money
I wanna girla - me a go see my money
