You're hot fog
I can feel you and you're not far off
I can taste you and you're what I want
But I can't know you even when you're in my arms.

You're burnt sky
A fever moon that makes the sun jealous at night
Your lava lips pour forth and branding iron eyes
Fix them unto me and bring me back to life.

You're quick sand
