(Verse One: Trife)
Baby listen, bets to believe
I can give you what you want and all that you need
Mackin' all the ladies, from the fly to the shady
Marquis diamonds, 600 Mercedes
I'll fly you across the seas in a private jet
Whisper shit in ya ear to get ya panties wet
Honey I'll show you how good life can get
Winin and dinin, non-chalant in the finest restaraunt
Feed you lobster cause I'm a true mobster
Lame niggaz bore ya, lay ya down in the Waldorf-Astoria
Victoria Secret; lingerie, I like the freak shit
Dim the lights, sex all through the night
King sized beds, Satin sheets gettin' right
Wear you out, leave my number by the phone
When you wake up in the morn', I'm gone

(Chorus: Aaliyah)
I wonder if I take you home will you still be in love baby
Because I need you tonight
Wonder if I take you home would you still be in love baby
Because I need you tonight
