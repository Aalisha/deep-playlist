Featuring Spice-1, King Tee] 
 Intro: 
 Yeah, Young jock up in this beezee 
 Claiming and representing that S-P geezee shit 
 Putting it down with my nigga the big bad ass 
 Spice 1 and King T 
 High siding and westside riding 
 Got my nigga from the feezee up in this beezee 
 We doing big thangs in the nine seezee 
 Kicking bitches in the booty and pointing out their 
 duty 
 Yeah any motherfucker that wanna try us knows where 
 to find us 
 Motherfucker 
 King Tee: 
 This shit couldn't get no harder 
 Niggas is about to make me flip and commit manslaughter 
 All my dreams result to nightmares 
 So I walk around the hood strapped like I don't care 
 Truth or dare, I dare you to dis the west coast 
 The truth is them niggas will split your vest loc 
 With hollowpoint slugs, Crips and Bloods, we come deep 
 And roll in those Range Rover Jeeps 
 I was a made man at fifteen years 
 Cuz momma didn't raise no faggotty queer 
 I got paid fronting bad colors in the ninth grade 
 And on the westside is where I play 
 Straight sick, when my big uncle smoked dip 
 And grabbed his four four and took me with him on a 
 lick 
 And sure as the sun will come up and just shine 
 The niggas couldn't believe the Rolex was all mine 
 Spice-1: 
 Yeah divine niggas the lexxy shine and the fetty 
 Motherfuckers ain't ready, see they won't hold their 
 heads steady 
 when we come with the fifty caliber Desert Eagle 
 Feeling you motherfuckers over slugs equal
