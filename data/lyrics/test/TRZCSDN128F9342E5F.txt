If I could turn back time I wouldn't keep a thing
I would change it all, and make it undone
I'd start a brand new life, swear I was born alive
This time around I'll constantly change
If I could turn back time I wouldn't keep a thing
I would ride my life like a horse with no name
Be on top of things, I'll be on top of the world
One thing's for sure I would love you some more

I will build up what my hands tore down
I will make proud this time around
