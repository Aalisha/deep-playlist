Well, I don't love you much, do I
Just more than human tongue can tell and that's all
I don't love you much, do I
Remember how I kissed you in the hall

See how it sparkles in my eyes
I couldn't hide it if I tried, that's right
I don't love you much, do I
Just more than anything else in this whole world

Well, I don't love you much, do I
Just more than all the stars in the sky
I don't love you much, do I
I think you hung the moon and that's alright
