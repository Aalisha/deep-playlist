Does it teach? Can it learn? Are you sure it's right?
One that's young sees the circled "R", does he buy it?
What the fuck! Can't he buy what he wants to hear?
You muzzle us, we'll muscle you! You'll live in demented fear.

Is it good for us or harmful? Does it enlighten or repress?
Our children need to know what's going on and that our world is a mess.
What the fuck! Can't we say what we think anymore?
Clean up the world, and we'll be singing praises forever more...
