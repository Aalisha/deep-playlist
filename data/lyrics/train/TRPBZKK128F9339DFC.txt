All the fallen leaves will find their branches again
Raindrops from the heavens I'll eventually swim
A river, an ocean, a wave in my heart
We got your money now we'll make a new start

All the fallen leaves will find their branches again
Raindrops in the heavens I'll eventually swim
River, an ocean, a wave in my heart
We got your money now we'll make a new start

In another week, promise?
In another year, promise?
