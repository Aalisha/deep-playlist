I'll run away with you
We can build a goldmine
We'll cross the Sahara child
Yes, I'll be the truth for you

Home life, no life, I've been livin' here without you
New home, New York, I've been livin' here without you
I've been awake, we can build our own world
We can run away from ourselves, if we knew who we were

Home life, no life, I've been livin' here without you
New home, New York, I've been livin' here without you
Blue eyes, blue hair, not going to leave here without you
...
