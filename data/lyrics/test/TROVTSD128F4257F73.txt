(Norma Sallitt)

Well the rain's fallin' down around you,
So you cry yourself to sleep.
I know love hurts when one doesn't love as deep.
You're feelin' lost and empty,
'Cause you gave yourself away.
But don't be ashamed to cry,
It's okay.
But you've got to Hang On In,
Baby, be strong,
Love will always find a way.
No, you can't give up,
You've just got to go on,
...
