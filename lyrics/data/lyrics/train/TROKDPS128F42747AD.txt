I know I can be a little stubborn sometimes
A little righteous and too proud
I just want to find a way to compromise
Cos I believe that we can work things out

I thought I had all the answers
Never giving in
But baby since you've gone
I admit that I was wrong

All I know is I'm lost without you
I'm not gonna lie
How am I gonna be strong without you
I need you by my side
If we ever said we'll never be together
and we ended with goodbye
Don't know what I'd do
I'm lost without you

I keep trying to find my way
but all I know
is I'm lost without you
I keep trying to face the day
Lost without you
...
