I'd like to think that you're thinking of me
So close to you, you just seem so far away
So far away, so far until I cannot see

By breaking away you've broken the rules
By breaking my heart you've loved like a fool
I'm breaking away, you made me give in
And making me loose what I thought I could win
Ohoho

You're just a man with a modern problem
Can rest his heart, has to be so far away
So far away, so far I'm loosing all believe
