I feel like burnin' this town
This fear is bringin' me down
I feel like breakin' this town
This fear is burnin' me now
How can you live with this shit goin' on
I feel like burnin' this town
My fear is walkin' around

How can you live X3
Now, now

To be there is all I could do
Is that so wrong
Just one care is all I could find
Now it's gone
I'd open my heart just to see
...
