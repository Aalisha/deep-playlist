There is something wrong and there is something right
When you can take me by the hands and I will close my eyes
When you laid down with me you took the other side
When you laid down with me you never slept that night

Are you working up to something, but you give me almost nothing
Keep me helpless up to something on my knees

Would you ever be my, would you be my f*cking boyfriend
Would you ever be my, would you be my f*cking boyfriend

Are you immature or is it that you're unkind
To torture all the other girls, you keep me by your side
Are you unsatisfied, you can't make up your mind
