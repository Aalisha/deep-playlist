Wake up, 7: 32 AM
Can't believe it's time to do it over again
Yesterday, it took all that you had
And you're wonderin' if you'll ever get it back
But the whole wide world is waiting for
Waiting for you to step out that door
Come on and let your life be heard today

You got something to say
If you're livin', if you're breathin'
You got something to say
And you know if your heart is beatin'
You got something to say
And no one can say it like you do
God is love and love speaks through
You got it, you got it
You got something to say

Yeah, yeah
Something to say
Yeah, oh

Listen up, I got a question here
Would anybody miss you if you disappeared?
