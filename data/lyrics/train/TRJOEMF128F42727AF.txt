Goodfellas Allstar check me

Now first of all let me say that I've been through it all, which simply means
that I seen it all and in between girl I done it all, ohh yeah and you can bet
that I know first hand the regret and the pain you feel when love is left
behind. Although nothing hurts as much as the pain that comes from knowing the
one you love the one you gave your very heart and soul to trust mmm hmm it's a
shame cause they don't feel the same. So tell me...

Whats a man to do, when you don't got love for me baby,
Whats a man to do, ohh how hard I tried to get through to you,
Whats a man to do, don't you see I got love for you baby
