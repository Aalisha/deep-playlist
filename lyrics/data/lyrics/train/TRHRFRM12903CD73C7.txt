YOU'RE THE REASON
Writers Bobby Edwards, Terry Fell, James F. Hanley, Mildred Imes

(Walking the floor feeling so blue losing sleep over you)
I lay here at night toss and I turn loving you so how my heart yearns
Honey you're the reason I don't sleep at night
Just walking the floor feeling so blue smoke cigarettes drink coffee too
Honey you're the reason I don't sleep at night
