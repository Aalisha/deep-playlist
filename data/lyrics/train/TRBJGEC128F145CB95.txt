She says think you're the only one who's had it rough
And the sky over you is the only one
That's not bright enough
Well some habits are hard to kick
Some people in life are hard to lick
They haunt your soul like a ghost, there for good

Feel too much
Hold too much
Feel too much
Shes says we're much the same
Born restless under a wild sign
Restless til the day we die
Restless since the day we die
Restless since the day you're born
Restless says it all
You're like a windy night in fall
I almost heard you call
I half prepared an answer
