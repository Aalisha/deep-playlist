You make me wanna scream.
Save today...
just break away.
What's making you want to stay?
Is it me?
You swear talk days are over.
I just can't be your lover.
Bury me in the back of the yard with dirt.
Raise a glass tip your hat and toast to the past.
Don't strike a deal with me go ahead and stay on your knees.
Last thing I'll say to you, Catch a cab, hop a train cause, you and me are through.
