Two-thirty on a Monday morning, I go
No particular worry or care
Down Santa Monica Boulevard, real slow
Just to see if that lady's still there
I don't know if I should
But maybe I could ask her something
I wonder 'bout the place she calls her home
You're not alone

Lady on the phone
Who are you calling
Who are you talking to now
...
