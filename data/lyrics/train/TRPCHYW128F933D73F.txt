In the fire, it was burning
Sweetheart, I know
I shoulda be learning

But my pockets
Were fill of money
Yes, they were
I had someone, yes, I did
To call my honey

But it's love (sweet love)
That makes a woman
(That makes a woman)
Yes, it's love (sweet love)
That makes a woman
(That makes a woman)

Something told me
That this wouldn't last
...
