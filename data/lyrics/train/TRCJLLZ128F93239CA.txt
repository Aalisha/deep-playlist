I been me, I been followin' my dreams
Tryin' to find the scene where you believed me
I been true, I been waiting here for you
I been patient, understanding and believing

Every time you turn around
I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But I won't let you down

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road baby
But I won't let you down every time you turn around
