Yo, I'm one of the chosen few, could dispose of you
And anybody else who think they flowin' too
Here's your last chance, brothers besta show 'n' prove
Why y'all in the vocal booth, but your flow is mute

Ain't no excuse, lot of niggaz thinkin' they cute
Drippin' they S-Curl juice on their gators and suits
Ain't it the truth, lot of cats gay and it's proof
Platinum rainbows and jewels on the necks of their crews

I'm bad news like obituary sections
The rhymes I write describe the loss of a life the previous night
At an open mic or any type of venue
There ain't no tellin' where I'm goin' 'cause of what I've been through

As I begin to attract the attention of fans
Will I be able to withstand the supply and demand?
Can I expand, turn mics in my hands to grands?
If you really ask me, dog, I think I can

Yo, we liven it up for the world to understand it
We do it for the fans that's all across the planet
Kenn Starr, Oddissee, Phonte's the answer
No question y'all take your chances

We liven it up for the world to understand it
We do it for the fans that's all across the planet
Kenn Starr, Oddissee, Phonte's the answer
No question, y'all take your chances

Yo, uh, yo, crackin' for miles and 'Te's in full effect
He's laughin' and browsin' over these wanna be cats
