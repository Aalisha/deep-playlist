I must be crazy, I feel like I've been here before
And all the signs have started to show and no change in just how I feel about you now.
Cant let it phase me when my heart is taking over my mind
And now I know its just a matter of time until I find a way of letting you know I need you near
[Chorus]
Ya harami ya habibi inta dularimi ana roohi bin edik
Yama diya amari bi dunak ya hayati al bibe inta lek
[X2]
