I cut my lip on broken bone
And who you are, isn't what you own
It pierced the skin
It's ripping through to my heart because of you

What is light? Where is laughter?
I'm confused and the sky is getting heavy tonight
You'll never know, you know tonight

What is music? Where is happiness?
Result please, don't let it rain tonight
