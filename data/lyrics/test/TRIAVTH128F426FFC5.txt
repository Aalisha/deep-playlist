Would you lay with me
In a field of stone
If my needs were strong
Would you lay with me

Should my lips grow dry
Would you wet them dear
In the midnight hour
If my lips were dry

Would you go away to another land
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
Wipe the blood away from my dying hands
...
