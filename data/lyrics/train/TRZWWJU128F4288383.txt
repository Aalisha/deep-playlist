The kids screaming, phone ringing
Dog barking at the mailman bringing
That stack of bills overdue
Good morning baby, how are you?

Got a half hour, quick shower
Take a drink of milk but the milk's gone sour
My funny face makes you laugh
Twist the top on and I put it back

There goes the washing machine
Baby, don't kick it
I promise I'll fix it
Long about a million other things

Well, it's okay, it's so nice
It's just another day in paradise
Well, there's no place that
I'd rather be

Well, it's two hearts
And one dream
I wouldn't trade it for anything
...
