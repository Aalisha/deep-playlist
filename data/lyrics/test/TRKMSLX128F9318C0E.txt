Give me something to laugh about
All this tenderness will wind me up.
You won? t come Independence Day
To watch the arrows fly so aimlessly

What has come to me?

The discovery
That everyone
Gets common
So strange
And perfect again

A life is full, a perfect form
Still we carry it hard in our arms
I? ve memorized the way of things
