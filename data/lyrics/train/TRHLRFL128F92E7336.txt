i wore my boots out walkin'
poured my heart out talkin'
i felt the pain & i broke the chain
but i still got a long way to go

been on the road Ã¢ til tomorrow
been through the joys & the sorrows
came through the flood
& i pulled through the mud
but i still got a long way to go

been in the back-room dealin'
been on a long hook reelin'
crashed in the shed
& i woke in a sunny bed
& i still got a long way to go

been on the rails & big muddy
...
