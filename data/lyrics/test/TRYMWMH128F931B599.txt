Hey, big daddy, what you doin' tonight?
I got so many honeys on my request line
Spendin' all their money for a taste of my time
I don't want 'em 'cause I want you, boo, you're lookin' so fine

And now I'm ready, so ready, baby, give me a sign
If you let me I might let you get a piece of my pie
So break me off, come get me at the front of the line
I got that big big heavy, what you got in mind?

Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I waited all night long
Don't you drop the ball, I'm waitin'
