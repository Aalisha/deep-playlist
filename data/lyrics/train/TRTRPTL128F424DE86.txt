Will there be another breakdown? (Lost in your words)
Communication is a let down (In your own world... speakeasy)
When you speak is it easy? (Lost in your words)
You're trying too hard to please me (In your own world)

Speakeasy, easy

I know what you think
I think the same things as you
And do the things that you do
Don't break the habit of a lifetime
You broke the habit of a lifetime
I see through everything you do
