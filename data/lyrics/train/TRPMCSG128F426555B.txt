Sitting in this old honky-tonk in Tulsa
Trying to drink her memory off my mind
If she only knew how much I loved her
She would be here by my side

It seems I spend a lot of time talking to myself
I even count the shadows on the walls
I guess there's a lesson to be learned in this
Never get so high that you can't take a fall

Now folks think I'm goin' crazy
