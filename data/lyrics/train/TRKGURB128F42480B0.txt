She's got, 'Honky Tonk Woman' on her license plat
She's got black, leather britches, long, long legs
She's got a booty tattoo, red lips and a tongue
Well, some girls just know how to have fun
Start me up sugar, let the tumbling dice roll
My baby rocks like the Rolling Stones

My little backstage beauty queen knows how to dance
She's got a backwood boogie and a Hollywood glance
Got it shake, shake, shake, shake, shaking baby all night long
