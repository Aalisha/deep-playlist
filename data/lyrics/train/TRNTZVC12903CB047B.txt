Oh, oh, oh, oh

I've been shot right out the sky
Navigating miles high
I'm just a ray of sound, yeah, look what I found
On my brand new journey into sound

I know you'll find piece of mind
On my punk paste race into space
I'm the silver surfer, hearin' Lucifer
Lay on the ground and nobody dies

Oh, oh

Paradise is the place where the devil does his damndest
I'm the catalyst, a psychedelic twist
Like a dynamite reefer, I'll make you sweat and curse
As we travel at magnificent speeds around the universe

As we travel at magnificent speeds
As we travel at magnificent speeds
I'll make you [Incomprehensible]
As we travel at magnificent speeds
As we travel at magnificent speeds
I'll make you [Incomprehensible]

As we travel at magnificent speeds
As we travel at magnificent speeds
I'll make you [Incomprehensible]
As we travel at magnificent speeds
As we travel at magnificent speeds
I'll make you [Incomprehensible]
