I used up your compassion
So I've come to make a trade
You can hate me
But just love me in return

And if I know where to find you
I'll stay out of your way
I won't come beg to borrow
All the happiness you've earned

I'll just slide back down to the bottom
While you make your place in the hills

There's nothing that the road cannot heal
There's nothing that the road cannot heal
Washed under the Blacktop, gone beneath my wheels
There's nothing that the road cannot heal
Vela Grazie
