Watch your head on that root
Got to let your eyes adjust
I'm sorry about your suit
Can't do nothing about the dust
Welcome down underground
Hunker down a spell
Gets to feel like home to me
Though I know it looks like hell
Down in the hole, Lord, it's deep
And the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole, light and love
And the world above, mean nothing to the mole
