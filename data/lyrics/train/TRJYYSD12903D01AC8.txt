My loneliness
Makes you feel insecure
My loneliness
Will never let you find a cure
My loneliness
Has no directions for me and you
My loneliness
Speaks the truth of what to do
Listen to what I say

Turn the end
You're going crazy
And I can't stand to feel
Your tears over me
Turn the end
It's not a crime to feel
The way that I do
Again and again
...
