Will you ever feel this fainting
Like i did as you said no
Like a free fall without a parachute
I fear this kind of attitude

Even you've tried to make me understand
That you're sorry - let me know
That i will have to comprehend
My crush on you will make me feel blue

Why why -you did not let me in?
Why why - you did not let me .
