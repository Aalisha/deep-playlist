The way she moves alone, so late at night
This woman knows, she's a mystery and she's mine tonight
That's all I want to know

Now what would I do without her? Who would I be, alone?
You see I love everything about her, and I'd never, ever let her go
The wind blows cold tonight, and I'm counting stars one by one
Holding her so close tonight, and I know she'll always be my warmest rising sun

Now I'm searching out her secret dreams
I wonder if she knows what her love means
...
