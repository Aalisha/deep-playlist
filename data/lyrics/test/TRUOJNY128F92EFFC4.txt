Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like boys play with toys
One warm December, our hearts will see
A world where men are free

And some day at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found out what life is really worth
Then there will be peace on earth
