I know a place my dear where all is cool
And if you let me I will take you there
The sun does shine and no-the rain don't fall
And when you get there you won't wanna leave
Forget the hate-leave the pain behind
No need for sorrow or tears there
All that you need is your heart and your mind
Be who you are and have no fear
Now if you're ready-put your hand in mine
And let me show you how things can be
Just leave your troubles and your cares behind
No need for worries-let your soul be free
