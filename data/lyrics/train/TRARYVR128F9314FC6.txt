I've always felt so scared of all this needing
Everyone that I've met has been somewhat mistreated
That's how it feels when you know that something's wrong
Then you came along like a swan over the lake
And flew across my eyes and out into space
And I ran and I crawled and I chased to get a taste
That's what I did--OH

If there's just one thing you've got to remember
It's to write down your name and your phone number
That way you'll have it and we'll make something out of this mess
And if all else fails and the ship won't set sail
God forbid, but I guess the both of us will bail
But as far as I can tell, I think things will be swell
