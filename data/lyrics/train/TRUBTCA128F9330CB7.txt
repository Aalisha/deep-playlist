Busted flat it baton rouge, headin' for the trains
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to new orleans.

I took my harpoon out of my old dirty red bandana
I was playin' sad while bobby sang the blues
With those windshield wipers slappin' time
And bobby's clappin' hands we finally
Sang up every song that driver knew.

Oh oh oh freedom's just another word
For nothin' left to lose
And nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free
...
