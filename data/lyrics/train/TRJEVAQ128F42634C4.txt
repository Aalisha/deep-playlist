I sit alone
Wishing that you were here
I pick up the phone and no one's even there
But I hear your voice
And it sounds so clear
And I'm telling you just how I feel
Wishing that you'd come and make it so real
(Are you just a vision in my mind?)
Have walked into my life?
Are you really right here tonight?
(Are you gonna make everything right?)
Why you standing here in my door
Are you the one that I wished for, yeah?

I wished upon a star tonight
That you will grant my wish tonight
And take me to the one in my imagination
I wish I may, I wish I might
Have a wish I wish tonight
Take me to the one in my imagination

Now you will mean more than the world to me
If we could be more than a fantasy
I do believe one day that you will be my reality
