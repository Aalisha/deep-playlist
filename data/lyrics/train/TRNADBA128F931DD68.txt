We are your friends
You'll never be alone again
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
We are your friends
You'll never be alone again
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
We are your friends
You'll never be alone again
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
Well come on
We are your friends
You'll never be alone again
Well come on
