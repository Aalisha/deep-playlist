Mountains wouldn't part for me
They have no uncertainty
I'm just a passing emotion
Just hoping they take notice
And you are an opportunity
Without an opportunity
Another passing emotion
And hope that someone will take notice

And did I hear you sing
That we exist without existing
Or did I hear you sing
That we'll land where we begin
