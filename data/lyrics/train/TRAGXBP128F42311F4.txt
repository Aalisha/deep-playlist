They said, "You're not normal
Why don't you sing R&B?"
I said, "I got no rhythm, and I got no blues
I'm as happy as can be"
They say, "How can you not bop to hip hop?"
I say, "I most certainly do
Did you not see me dancing the other night
Like the girls on Channel U?"
Yeah, I can wind down low
Be like the girls in the video
But for me, that's much too slow
Because I prefer rock n roll
I said yeah, I can wind down low
Dance like the girls in the video
But for me, that's a no no
Because I prefer rock n roll
They say, "Why do you wear a shirt and tie?
That's a bit bizarre"
