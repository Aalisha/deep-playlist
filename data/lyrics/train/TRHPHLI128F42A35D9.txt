Funny you should show up after all these years
Yeah, things sure have changed around here
Seen a lot of strangers since they put that interstate through
No this ain't the same town that we once knew

(Chorus)
They put up a plant where we used to park
That ol' drive-in's a new Walmart
The cafe is closed where our names were carved on that corner booth
Yeah, everything's changed except for the way I feel about you
