Climbing up the mountain
In the preasence of
Anger, pain, and hunger
The trek is never done

I'm not from, this time and place
I'm not of the human race
I've been watching till this time
My arrival is no crime

Eyes percieve the sigil
Shown upon my chest
The penece bearing reapers
Reject Lord Vulcan's quest
...
