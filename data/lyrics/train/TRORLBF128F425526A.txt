It is 4 a.m.
I'm waiting in our bed alone,
Dreaming of your embrace
Wishing you would come back home

But you don't call,
And you don't come,
And you don't say,
That you miss me
And you don't stop
To say hi
On your way by
I'm feeling crazy

It is 5 a.m.
And I'm waiting by the phone again
This is not how it's 'sposed to be
You're 'sposed to be here with me

But you're go'n now
You're just go'n now
You don't even think about the way I feel
You're just go'n now
...
