Waiting here for you, with good intentions.
I did agree to, it nearly never came.
Most of us are true, to one another-
Loyal to the end, and it always comes to
You are not alone;
We are not alone.

Come on, honey, don't be scared;
Take off your jacket, hands in the air.
Spin around and around and try to hold on;
First one to let go's the last one I'll count on.
The other hand, let it go- it's just fine;
You've made up your mind- it's not changing this time.
Spin around and around and try to hold on;
The last one to let go's the first one I'll count on.

I'm waiting there for you.
