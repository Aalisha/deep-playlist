Forever and ever we will sing Your praises
Forever and ever we will glorify Your name
Above all names
Every name
Merciful Lord Jesus
You took the cross to free us
You conquered death and sin
In a battle we could never win

You are the first, the last
Lord of future, Lord of past

You reign in glory as the king
You are worthy, so worthy
You reign in glory as the king
Receive the praise we sing

Forever and ever we will sing Your praises
Forever and ever we will glorify Your name
Forever and ever we will sing Your praises
Forever and ever we will glorify Your name
Above all names
Every name
