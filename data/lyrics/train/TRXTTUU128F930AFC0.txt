Goodnight, my love (wah-ooh)
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me

Before you go (wah-ooh)
There's just one thing I'd like to know (wah-ooh)
If you love is still warm for me
Or has it gone cold?

If you should awake in the still of the night
Please have no fear
