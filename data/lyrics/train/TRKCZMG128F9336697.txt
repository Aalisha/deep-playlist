I used to do okay on my own
Think I was made of stone
That I could carry a heavy load
Never thought that one day I'd be all alone
And then the road got long

And had no one to lean upon
But you kept me from falling far below
And taught me something I had ever known that

(chorus)
You Lord, You Lord
can hold my heart in Your hands
