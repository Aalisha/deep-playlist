I don't exist for you
You made that crystal clear
Your sweetest thing for 7 years
What did I do to deserve this

Don't think you own my life
I've still got my pride
Trying so hard to forget
I cannot help but hear your voice

This is love, just trust me baby
Other girls mean nothing to me
Why don't you keep your big mouth shut
