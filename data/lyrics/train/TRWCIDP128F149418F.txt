I live my life in a freezer
I live my life like millions of people
I left my heart in the freezer
I left my mind and I don't even know

And I've turned to stone
Yes, I've turned to stone
Well, I've turned to stone
Left out alone

I left my thoughts in a freezer
I left my thoughts where nobody goes
I lost my soul in a freezer
I lost my heart where it's forty below
