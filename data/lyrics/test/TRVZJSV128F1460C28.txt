No more than just a broken heart ago
I made a promise to myself I'd never trust someone again
Judging form my rough and rocky past
I wrote love off as just a game a fool will play and never win
And I felt certain I was right 'til I turned a corner in the night

And there was you
Like an angel you just suddenly appeared
Sent to me with a love so true
That it could make up for the lies and wasted years
Now I see there were other loves I knew
