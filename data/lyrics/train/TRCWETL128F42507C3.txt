I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me

I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me
Yeah, I'm a Hustler baby
That's what my daddy's made me

If I had
The money to go to a record store
I would
I-I would

If I had
The money to go to a record store
I would
I-I would

Go, to the record store
Go to the record store
(Go to the record store
Put records in my clothes)

Go, to the record store
Go to the record store
(Gotta walk out the record door
Past that record man)

Go to a record store
And put it in my clothes
And walk past that record man
