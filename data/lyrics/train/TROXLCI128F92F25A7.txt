I have a choice between the bat or the belt
Each time I hear about the hand you've been dealt
Spare me confession, it's confession you sell
Maybe I'll fall behind but I don't mind because I'll catch up
I want a song that indelible like manimal
I hope you never see me wind up
Will I be happy on the back of the shelf
Will you be happy when we're sharing a cell
