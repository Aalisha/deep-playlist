Under that burning ether that falls
Down on these walls
Burning my arms
I've been alone
When I sat by you
For every word I could undo
I've been uncrossed and I've been untrue
I've been the thorn
I've been the heart
But the heart of my own
Burn it down low
The light in your verse and the shadow between
The way that I was when I used to roam
If I go, what do I hold?
Oh, the maid or the mother I'll be
...
