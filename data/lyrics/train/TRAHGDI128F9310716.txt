Sometimes I recall what others have said:-
Love is for lovers in love and full grown,
Life's for the living and death's for the dead,
And the depth of a heart is a fathom unknown.

Sometimes when I get to thinking about you,
And all the things that we've never said
To each other, it seems such a shame to go blue
When there's so many years to lie silent and dead.

I know, you know, all about life.
