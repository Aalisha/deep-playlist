[Verse 1]
You looked me in my face
Have the nerve to say
That chick that called you on your cell phone wasn't at your place
The stupid things you do
You gotta be a fool
You took my love for granted, now I'm takin' it back from you

[Bridge]
How could you straight up lie (no, no, no, no)
I thought you were by my side (by my side)
Not I know what to think of you
Here's two words I'd like to say to you...

[Chorus]
Hell no!
