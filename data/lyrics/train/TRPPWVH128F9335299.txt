Welcome to this daydream
Made by dirty hands
I wait for you to jump in
But I bet you never can

Forget what you are leavin´
Here you´ll get aments
What´s firm and what´s deceiving
Here they all will blend

Quiet air is grating
Soft wind drowns your words
What´s twisted is still turning
And familiar never returns
