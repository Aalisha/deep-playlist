She threw her purse upon the bed
She looked around and shook her head
There's really nothing left she said
There's nothing I ain't done
She wore her favorite dress tonight
She hoped her hair would catch the light
And you just sat there getting tight
On double shots of rum

You don't care what people say
They're gonna do it anyway
You don't hear what you don't use
It's always been the same old news
