(Carly Simon)

It's all of our birthdays this summer
One number older, another year younger
I'll go to your party, you'll come to mine
We've given up cigarettes, we've given up wine
We've given up caffeine and sworn off desserts
I don't try to seduce you, we don't even flirt
We're too good to be happy, too straight to be sad
