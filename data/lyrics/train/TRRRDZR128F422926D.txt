So looking back I can see what you mean
The look on his face said it all (and) in regret, 
He looks at himself then in silence he screams.
Then packed his bags, 
With a locked stare he heads for the door.
I know she'll get what she deserves! 

Another clenched fist that's raised to the face
We'll keep this one to ourselves.
