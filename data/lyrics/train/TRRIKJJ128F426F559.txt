Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh
Whoa yeah

I never knew real love, real love
Till you were mine
And I
And I never knew each touch
Between us would feel like the first time
The very first time, well
See I remember the days of hurt and pain
Just wouldn't let go, oh oh oh oh oh oh
And now every night shines so brightly
And I know, I know I'm not alone
Not alone no more, no

I can't let go
I can't let go
I can't let go, let go (I can't, let go, let go)
All I know
All I know, all I know
I know, I know
Is I can't
I can't let go
