She never thought that she would
Get her second chance
Running so far from all she's ever known
And then she lost all meaning
Where did her dreams go
But still she knew that there was something more

Don't be scared
There's someone there
To say these words
You need to hear

Don't let anybody tell you who you are
(who you are)
It's okay to let go, you're that shooting star
(shooting star)
Remember all you wish for
Believe it will be true
You will never find yourself anywhere else
You'll find yourself in you
...
