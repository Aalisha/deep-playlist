[Andi Deris / Alfred Koffler]

You're a dream light years ago
Of a world dreams are like I did not know
I did not know
You're a queen scared of your might
Like a shades dying away without light
You fear the night

I know how temperatures rise
I'll heat you out of ice
I know we'll party tonight
So come on baby, do it right
I lift up your disguise
I've known you lightyears ago
Welcome to the nightlife show
