And if I told you there's somebody who loves you
Would you say, "Hey, show me that face?"
And if I told you that true freedom was actual
Would you say, "Hey, take me to that place?"
And if I said there is a family
A body that moves as one
Do you feel the love that invites us, liberty excites us?
The disco has just begun, has just begun
Give me love, give me liberty, disco
The place everybody in the family's found
On that day, we will all be happy people
