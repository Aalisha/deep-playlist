Got no time for the corner boys
Down in the street makin all that noise.
Don't want no hos on 8th avenue.
Cuz tonight I'm gonna be with you.
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride
Cross the river to the Jersey side.
Take my baby to the carnival.
Well I'll take you on all the rides.
Down the shore, everythings alright
You're with your baby on saturday night.
Don't you know all my dreams come true,
When I'm waling down the street with you.
Sing shalalalalalala
