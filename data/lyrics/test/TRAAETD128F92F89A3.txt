Surrender to your senses'Indulge in your desires
The need to have it all is the flame that feeds your fire
Determined to obtain'Programmed to receive
Your heart has hardened'Your soul has been deceived
Searching for the things that will make your life complete
You never learned from the past
It is you they will defeat
...
