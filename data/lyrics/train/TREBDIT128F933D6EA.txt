Since you've been gone
All I wanted was for you to come
Back to me and say sorry
Baby I was wrong
But I waited my faith is strong
This hurt could be undone
Time goes by and hope subsides
I fell for way too long

I don't know when it changed
Cause I was always imagining
We'd be together
Cause I loved you
But Now your standing here
I realized 
I'm really healed
Cuz I feel better
Than I thought I could do

I cried so many nights
Wishing you were by my side
My hearts so tired of breaking
Suddenly here you are
You're saying all the words
I was waiting for
