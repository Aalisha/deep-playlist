There comes a time in every man's life
You're gonna do wrong
I made a mistake girl
Just let me, just let me explain

I can't believe it, although I did it
I've never been that kinda man
I must admit it, I wasn't with it
But you were the best I've ever had

Right now I'm going through some changes
I've always thought I was a faithful kind of man
I never thought I would be tempted
Baby, you licked my lips and I said, "Right now, right now"

In the heat of the moment
Baby I lost my head, lost my mind, didn't know what to do
In the heat of the moment
Baby, I fell in lust with you
I lost my head, lost my mind
