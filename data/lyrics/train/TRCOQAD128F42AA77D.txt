This is a sound
The here and the now
You've got to talk to talk to talk to talk
to get it all out
I listen, I listen, I listen
But you're out of tune
You're so out of tune!

This is the last song (This is the last song)
(This is the last song) That I will dedicate to you

Somethin' I found
Yeah, while I'm still around
You got to walk to walk to walk to walk
