Captain's telling me that I am welcome

He's saying that soon this bird will fly

He says the forecast's looking fine.
'cross the runway I can see you
Looking lost and trying not to cry.
I see you getting smaller

I wish that I could stail her
Leave this p\ane but
L.A. Goodbye
oh
oh
oh

L.A. Goodbye -
L.A. Goodbye
