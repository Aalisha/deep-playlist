Step up to the stage, kids - and don't retreat
from this Carnival of Volume
I know that you're red-eyed and bloodshot-beat
ya just can't lick that all day frown
And now you're rollercoaster sick and drinkin' lemonade
Well, listen up!

On Sunday the tears were fallin'
and trickling down your cheeks,
But yesterday's cares are no big deal
...
