If I were your hero
I'd know what was best
Together we could make history
We're walking a tight rope
That's what you said
In search of some peace and harmony
If we are the answer
Prove to me your willingness

I don't want to save the world
Think I'll quit while I'm ahead
In this movie that I live
I'm much better off instead
I don't want to save the world
But it seems that

We're an awful long ways
From Kansas
I don't know if I'd catch you
If you fell
There is no direction
To get homeward
Oh no no no

Who'd be the keeper
