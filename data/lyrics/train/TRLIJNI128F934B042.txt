Dusk, I rule the night
And rest by the light of the day
Blood, I thirst the blood of the corpses
That befall me
I, I have a lustful need to kill
Deep in my heart
You, you are the victim I've chosen
To prey upon

And every night
You'll feel my bite
You won't be scarred
So be prepared
To feel the pain
Your life I drain
And then we'll be
Baptized in blood

I am the prince of darkness
Bow before me
Fall, succumb to my trance
...
