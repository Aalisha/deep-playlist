From the dark days of my life
I have walked a lonesome road
Just can't reach the light that others have
How is it that I can't see
How to live my life and learn
I've reached the point of no return

I've got to grasp the opportunities
When they're close at hand
And I've got to realize
My memories must burn

Set me free and let me see
All the beauty in this world
Give me hope, make me believe
...
