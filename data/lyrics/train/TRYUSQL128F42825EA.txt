I can't take it
I'm so lonely
Gee I need you so

I can't take it
Oh I wonder
Why you had to go

But Baby, Every night I wake up crying
Tears on my pillow
An pain in my heart
You on my mind

I remember all the good times
That we had before
Oh I remember an now my heart
My very soul cry's out for more
...
