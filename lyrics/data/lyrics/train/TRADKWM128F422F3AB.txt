Dont let go, 
Must be the head and I can't see us turning this ship around 
Phoning friends who lived this dream we started, started breaking down 
This is something that we'd never thought we'd see 
we are finally where we want to be, with all this rapid progress 
I can't forget our promise 
I was ready to give up on all of this 
(x2)
