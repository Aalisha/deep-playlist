You tell me you love me, you say you'll be true.
Then you fly around with somebody new.
But I'm crazy about you, you butterfly.
(Ooo-oo-oo, ooo-oo.)

You're treatin' me mean, you're makin' me cry.
I've made up my mind to tell you goodbye.
But I'm no good without you, you butterfly.
(Ooo-oo-oo.)

I knew from the first time I kissed you,
That you were the troublin' kind.
'cause the honey drips from your sweet lips,
One taste and I'm outta my mind.
