[Jamie]
Got nothing but my t-shirt and boxers on
Waiting for you to get home
Its been sunny outside all day baby
I can't wait for it to storm
Wanna feel your raindrops fallin' down all the way
That thunder from down under surrounding me
Coming down hard pounding me

[Chorus]
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soak and wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soak and wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
