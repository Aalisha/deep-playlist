Change, Change, Change,
Change, Change, Change,

Chorus:
Oh i wish i had the power, the power to change the world
But im just one man trying to do it on my own
Oh i wish i had the power, the power to change the world
But im just one man trying to do it on my own
Can someone help me? (change the world)
Can somebody help me? (change the world)

Everyday i saw you there chillen on the corner
puffin on crack and marijauna
Because i know how your life is
nobody just be guidin, no

Hope to see black people living longer
also less kids without fathers
We should all come together
Please stop fighting and killing eachother

Its what happens when your living in the street life
its so dark and you dont get sunlight
People seeing why you dont get treated right
...
