I'm so angry
I'm so angry
Something that you said burnin' in my head
I'm so angry
I'm so angry
Everything you do makes me furious with you

It's like a poison to me
It's like you put me in shock
You stick a needle in me
Every time that you talk

I'm so angry
I'm so stupid
Everything you say, I believe it anyway
I'm so stupid
I'm so angry
Running after you, that's what I gotta do

It's like a poison to me
