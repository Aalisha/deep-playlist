You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am

You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
