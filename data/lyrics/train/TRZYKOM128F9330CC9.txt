I just wanna lock the door
Leave it all outside
Turn off the lamps
I just wanna hide
Don’t bother look for me
Not even sure that you were
So I don’t have to tell
I am not feeling well these days

Just give me directions I go anywhere
I need to find something I cannot find here
Give me a chance and I'll prove that you are wrong
I manage to find I can be strong
