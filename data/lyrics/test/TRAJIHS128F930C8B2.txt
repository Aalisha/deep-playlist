What if you could unlock your dreams?
Could you perceive what they mean?
The nights are clear, the days so dark
But there´s a way out there...

Whatever comes into your mind
May be the answers trapped inside
You feel a cold cut through your veins
But there´s a way out there...

Alone you go into the darkness

You feel the fear of someone else
A broken picture from the past
The feeling traces in your hands
...
