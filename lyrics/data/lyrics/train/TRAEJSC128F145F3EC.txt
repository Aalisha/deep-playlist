I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes tonight
Well, I'm a-leavin' here
'Cause you don't treat me right
All ya do is make me cry
So now I'm a-gonna say goodbye
I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes tonight

Ya, I'll be wearin' my old travelin' hat
Now, baby, what do you think of that
'Cause all ya do is treat me wrong
So, honey, I'll be good and gone
I'll be wearin' my old travelin' hat
...
