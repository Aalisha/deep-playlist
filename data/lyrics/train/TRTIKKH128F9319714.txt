if i could say whats on my mind
(if i could say whats on my mind)
you would know how much i love you
if i could say whats on my mind
(if i could say whats on my mind)
you would know what im thinking of... you
(all of those sweet things, love)
(i feel but cant say, hey)
(i could say them. everyday)
if i could say whats on my mind
(if i could say whats on my mind)
you would know i love you all... the time
if i could say whats on my mind
(if i could say whats on my mind)
you would know that i need you
