I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way
see the dreams, i hope they last, never fade away
gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight
gotta set it all afire, set it all alight
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar
i am gonna set you all alight
gotta make it man
i ain't got a choice
gotta fill this hall tonight
Helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
