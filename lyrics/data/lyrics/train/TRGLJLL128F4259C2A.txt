Shaking like a dog shitting razorblades
Waking up next to nothing
After dreaming of you and me
I'm waking up all alone, waking up so relieved
While you're taking your time with apologies
I'm making my plans for revenge
Red eyes on orange horizons
If Columbus was wrong I'd drive straight off the edge

I'd drive straight off the edge
Taking your own life with boredom
I'm taking my own life with wine
It helps you to rule out the sorrow
It helps me to empty my mind
Making the most of a bad time
I'm smoking the brains from my head
