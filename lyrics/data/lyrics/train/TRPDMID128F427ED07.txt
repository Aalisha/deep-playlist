Ohh, ohh, ohh
Why would you pay to see me in a cage?
And why would you pay to see me in a cage?
Some men call the stage

Listen now I have gone you will know
I was the only one that would have gladly died
What was wrong in the eyes of the unwell and unwise

They killed a man for his giro today
Wasn't very game, I didn't mind
I wasn't a money man anyway
They killed a man for his giro today
