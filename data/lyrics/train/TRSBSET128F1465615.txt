Stop, slow down, take a deep breath (ooh yeah)
 Stop, slow down, take a deep breath (na na na na na)
 Ooh, oh
 
 I look at you and I know you're trouble
 I should run just fast as I can
 One smile, game over
 Here in front of you I stand
 I know you're only gonna burst my bubble
 Trouble is my heart don't care
 It's ignoring all the danger signs
 Stop, Slow down, take a deep breath, beware
 
 I'm not willing to be so fearless, careless, just yet
 Once bitten, twice shy, is what you get
 
 My hearts got a mind of it's own
 Won't listen to a word I say
 Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
 When it acts that way
 Cos When it breaks I break 
 I don't know how much more of this I can take
 Doesn't it know that I get hurt too
 When it acts that way
 
 Too many times I've witnessed
 My heart make a fool of itself
 So sure it's gonna turn out one way
 Always turns out being somethin' else
