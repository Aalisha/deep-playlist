I'm working hard from mornin’ ‘til night
My shoulder bendin’ to the wheel
I get home, you start to run me down
How do you think it makes me feel?

Your lashin’ tongue, it hurts my soul
I start to thinkin’ and I lose control
I'm not movin’ like I know I should
Or feelin’ like I'd like to feel

And I spend my days just foolin’ around
I can't function, honey, when you run me down
Oh darlin’, don't you run me down

I gotta make a little fortune
So I can bring it on home to you
You're only hurtin’ yourself my friend
