I would walk across burning desert
Bearing water to quench your thirst
Just call my name
In the time it takes to think of me
I will be there by your side
I'll be there
Call my name

Give me your hand
And I'll take you somewhere so beautiful
Give me your dreams
Together we'll make them come true
...
