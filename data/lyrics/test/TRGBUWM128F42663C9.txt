I lie here awake.
My lifeless body that's cold feeling the pain.
That's a cry far away.
Why is this prolonged, I've already lived, what's to fear.

Alone in our decision to unlock the door,
And escape from within.
For only death is my life.
Escape from within.

From terminal living, cutting me, low in my prime.
