(matraca berg/randy scruggs)
Evening, porch swing, we love to watch it rain
to some folks, it ain't much, but we think we've got it made
some people dream about streets paved with gold
only to find a yellow brick road
we know the way that story goes
Here under the rainbow
people pass us by
we laugh at the way they laugh at you and i
the world is spinning around and around
everybody's lookin' for higher ground
but here under the rainbow
dreams fall from the sky
