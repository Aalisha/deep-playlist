It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done,
To be so in love with you and so alone.

Follow me where I go, what I do, who I know
Make it part of you to be a part of me.
Follow me up and down,
all the way and all around,
take my hand and say you'll follow me.

It's long been on my mind,
you know it's been a long, long time,
I've tried to find the way that I can make you understand
