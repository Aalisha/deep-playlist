Downwards we operate
And I go all to pieces. 
For just once you imitate someone who is loving,
and I am scared of you. 
Always you come around 
saying that you're sorry. 
Take away this awful sound 
that I cannot belong to. 
So now I'm through with you.

And we owe this to ourselves 
To say what we really mean.
