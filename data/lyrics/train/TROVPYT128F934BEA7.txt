You bastards

Redeem me now that I have lost
Now, what have I gained from this?
This is a curse for me
Still I long to be set free

The self is set on fire
Out comes the exit
Like a serpent sun
The flames break loose

Release me now that doom is here
I will never settle for anything less
Than the truth in this great divide

The self is set on fire
Out comes the exit
...
