Ooh whoa-ooh!
Whoa, whoa... yeahh!
Whoa-oh!
Ey, ey!
Yeah, you got to get going
No time for sitting down
Some people not knowing life is a cycle
You got to know how to get around
Woo!... hahh

Yes, you got to be strong
And be all the best you can
The world is out there, conquer your fears
And don't you wait too long
Yes, you got to be strong
And be all the best you can
The world is out there, conquer your fear

And don't you wait too long

Ahhy! how you doing? long time I haven't seen you
Hope you behaving yourself now like a good-behaving citizen
Nothing come easy--you got to work hard, I'm telling you
Hope and pray for the best 'cause I believe in you
Not like the stereotype, cleanliness intriguing you
Give thanks and praise for my life, and for us being here
...
