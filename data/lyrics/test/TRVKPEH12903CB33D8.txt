How many times have i felt down inside
the need to be loved by you
i wanted to show you how good it could be
if you would only show a little interest in me
bat you run, you just won`t show love
that`s the thing you`re frightened of
He`s a runner
You came into my life and tuned my head around
and just as quickly you put me down
now you don`t won`t to know what i`m going through
`cause just like i said, it means nothing to you
