Chop shop
Moody/Median
A tree died for me to scribe on this loose leaf
Shallow niggas like, "Median is too deep"
Cats stay frontin' like they runnin' who's streets?
World Trade terror?
Now that's true beef
The innocent fear for they life now
Runnin' out the White House
Shut down airlines, they cuttin' lights out
The temperature is risin'
Meltin' ice down
At the polars of the Earth and we gettin' high now
Scriptures, Revelations, bout to reach their height now
And we watchin' it on TV, like movies of the week
Thin line between fiction, reality
Who teach the violence, but where all the wildin' be
To enterprise, just take God and y'all eat
I should have saw it comin'
