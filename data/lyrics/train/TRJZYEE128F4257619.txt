Come in out of the rain thou sayest -
but thou ne'er stept'st aside
And I am trapp'd - A Distance There Is...
None, save me and the bodkin - pitter-patter on the roof
Behold! - 'tis not the rain; thence me it has to be -
I will not drink thy vintage wine, my dear
Thou hast heed'd that I am of innocecne
Yet thou let'st thy lass into peril -
Thou let'st me be parched
My heart, my heart, my heart...

My heart, my heart, my heart...
My heart is of frailty, my pale skin is hued damask.
When thou thy tears hast hidden
"Come back!" thou sayest - There I soon am to be -
...
