I dreamed a garden full of light
just you and a man in white
And he tears the apples from your eye
just to allegate your eyes

Wait for the moment
when night becomes sky
There's a shadow creeping through you
will it reach your heart and mine
standin' in the corner
to tired to fade
and you wanna take this with you
and you'll yearn to be set free
and you wanna take this with you
we'll be so free

And I've wasted words of love and faith
the meaning came too late
and now there's just whispers in the dark
just scars upon your heart
just scars

...
