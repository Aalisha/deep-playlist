============
Walk the dog, do the dishes
My lips are brown from kissing ass
Sorry guys, I can't make it
Maybe next time. I think I'll pass
Don't make her mad, don't make her sad
A fate for you that's worse than death
You're a slave and you don't know it
It always happens to the best.

 Pussywhipped, pussywhipped
 Don't you know you're pussywhipped
 Pussywhipped, pussywhipped
 Don't you know you're pussywhipped
