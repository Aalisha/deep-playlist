Puffs of white cotton passing the window
Everyone talking, oh, so very loud
And captain sits and seems to be in a daze
One minute high, the next minute low
Nobody knows where we are
Nobody knows where we are

Cigarettes burning faster and faster
Everyone talking about the everafter
And captain sits and seems to be in a daze
...
