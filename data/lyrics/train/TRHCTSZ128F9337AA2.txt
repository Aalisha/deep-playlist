You know, everyone we know
They all have their own drug
Mine just happens to be punk music
And drinkin' at the Pub

'cause I, I, I,
I'm addicted to Oi Oi Oi!

I'm addicted to it
Oi Oi Oi
I'm addicted to Oi Oi Oi!

I'm addicted to it
Oi Oi Oi
I'm addicted to Oi Oi Oi!
I'm addicted to it
Oi Oi Oi
I'm addicted to Oi Oi Oi!
I'm addicted to Oi

With it I leave my troubles behind
My problems are all gone
I just scream & shout with my mates
And Pogo all night long
...
