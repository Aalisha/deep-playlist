Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it? s all on you

Don? t you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And don? t you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day your way, oh your way
