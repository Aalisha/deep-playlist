Tic-tac says the clock on the wall
It tells me everything is wrong, maybe
I lost my dreams along the way
Feels like we're about to fall
Into the shadow I run but lately gravity
Is pulling me back on my feet again

Why don't we say goodbye
Cos' now I know how it feels to live a lie
It's hurting so deep inside
Tell me why, oh its breaking me, its killing me
So why.draw the line
