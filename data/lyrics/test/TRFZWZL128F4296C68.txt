Woo, say what
Uh, from? 79 to? 95, old to the new style
Track fat so we're going back
Way back so nod your head, boy and Gayle
Take it on, Michelle

I think about ya in the pouring rain, yeah
Splashing down on my window pane
I think about ya in the bright sunshine, yeah
I think about you all the time
And I never want to let your love go, it's true
Oh baby, yeah
If you ask me I will never tell you no
No matter what you say or do, mmm

Happy just to be with you (happy, happy)
Happy just to know you're mine
And every day I say a prayer (say a prayer)
That you'll stay with me all of the time, hey
(Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-ooh) doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo
(I'm happy) I'm happy (so happy), so happy
(Doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo-ooh) doo-doo doo doo doo-doo doo
