It feels like we're blind... It feels like we're dead
We'll never find our way... we'll never feel the light of day

Don't try to think... Don't try to live your own life
We have you for keeps... Our ways are sewn deep in your hearts and minds

The colours have faded... everything's black
Darkness around me... Darkness inside me

Your blood line stops here... We are your family now Prepare for the end... a
new life awaits us beyond
...
