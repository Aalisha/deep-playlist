A star up in the sky goes slowly passing by
The lights below... they spell out your name.
You're comfort on my mind and you're with me all the time.
And lots of feelings that I can't explain.

I won't spend another night alone.
I won't spend another night alone.

Out of every girl I meet, no other can compete
I'd ditch 'em all for a night with you.
