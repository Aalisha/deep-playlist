Underneath this skin is a heart that's bleeding
Underneath that heart I'm waiting and praying
Can You really feel what I'm feeling?
'Cause this world don't ask it takes, it steal

And can You feel this heart it's beating like a drum
It's beating, it's calling out to You
Will You come and rain on this desert heart like only You can do?

Can you hear this soul is crying?
My soul is crying, calling out to You
Will You come and wash over me like only You can do?

Will You be my freedom?
Will You be my freedom?
