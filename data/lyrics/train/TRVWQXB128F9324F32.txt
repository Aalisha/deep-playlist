Turn the lights on!

Every night I rest in my bed
With hopes that maybe
I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes

I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands
And be my guide?

Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

You can be a sweet dream
Or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me
Your love is too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)

My guilty pleasure
I ain't going nowhere
Baby, long as you're here
I'll be floating on air
...
