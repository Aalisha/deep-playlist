We'll live out our lives on this dirty old street
Only because we just can't compete
But in the concrete of our younger days
We left our names, our names

Just like the people before
When they reached the distant shore
With their drink and their dance
And their dreams and sincere aims

All ghosts long gone, through old buildings they stare
With their offspring staring at me for they are still there
Dreams that are dead and lives not realized

Well, why did we write our names
In these streets to show we're alive?
Alive, alive, alive, alive

Well, Chicago is my home and I'll never went to Roam
To live on any sun swept distant shore
Well, it is that I was reared by forbearer's so revered
And I sing the songs that they all sang before

Well, any woman that's neared me
Has been repelled most thoroughly
Still I'm a lover, God, I am foremost of all

A musician that's my call
Of high degree professional
But I'm afraid that they do not know my trade at all

Well, if it's every twenty years
