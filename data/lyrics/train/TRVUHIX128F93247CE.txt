You played hooky from school
And you can't go out to play, yeah
Mama said, "For the rest of the week
In your room you gotta stay, yeah"

Now you feel like the whole world's picking on you
But deep down inside you know it ain't true

You're in punishment 'cause your mother
Wants to raise you the right way, yeah
But you don't care 'cause you already made up your mind
You wanna run away, yeah

You're on your way
Runaway child, running wild
Runaway child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong

Roaming through the city going nowhere fast
You're on your own at last
