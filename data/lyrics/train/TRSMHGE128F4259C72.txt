Brucie dreams life's a highway
Too many roads bypass my way
Or they never begin
Innocence coming to grief
At the hands of life - stinkin car thief
That's my concept of sin
Does heaven wait all heavenly
Over the next horizon?

But look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt more much more than cars and girls
Just look at us now, start counting
Ehat adds up the way it did when we were young?
Look at us now, quit driving
Some things hurt much more than cars and girls

Life's a drive through a dust bowl
What's it do, do to a young soul
...
