(Pat Bunch/Doug Johnson)

He came to town on an old freight train
He jumped off in the pouring rain
Everybody says he's insane
Just a low down no account hobo

He made his bed beneath the county bridge
The city folks said hey, that's not his
They signed a petition they're gonna get rid
Of that low down no account white trash

What if Jesus comes back like that
On an old freight train in a hobo hat
Will we let him in or turn our back
What if Jesus comes back like that
Oh what if Jesus comes back like that
