Yo yo, School, cuzin', what's up man? What's up with the record business?
Man, I think I'ma have to beat somebody up, man, they always be bitin' my shit man, y'know, man, just bitin', man
Man, I told you how them niggas are man, they ain't nothin' but squares
Oh, that's what they is

Yo Schoolly, what time is it?

Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme,
I heard you was out there writin' my lines,
And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine
You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man
How the fuck didja get so cool, man,
Never ever seen you play no fool"
Cuz I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and (x2)

MC Schoolly D, and I'm
I've never had a party that I cannot rock
And every baby girl thinks she's gettin' the world,
I've never made a tune that wasn't too cool
Never been stopped next to T O P
For him to try to fuck with MC Schoolly D

2 Dolla bitches on my kitches
Suckah MC's taken out with the dishes
Rhymes so delicious, raps so vicious
Buy me a wife to do my dishes
I keep ya in stitches
