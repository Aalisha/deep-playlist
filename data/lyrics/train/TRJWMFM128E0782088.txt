You watch the phone like it was the tv.
If you're all alone, well whose fault can that be?
Your keys, your bag, the car - they're where they always are.
And the light goes down and all the lights come on
and they call to me, oh come on, come on
and you don't make, you don't make no difference to me.

You look at me, say "what you talking about?"
well me, I'm going out, with or without.
