You never understood any given day could be your final one
No room for regret, don't ever forget your being followed by

The swinging Pendulum, watch as it grows so close
Fall to the Swinging Pendulum, watch as it grows so close until you are gone

We're chased all through time not knowing one day from the next
Numbers coming up, when will you cut the golden thread
Maybe it's not my time, maye it's not your time
But we should live our lives in case there's no tommorrow
...
