Calling all stars, calling all stars
This is an emergency
There is a crucial jam at the corner of R and B
Proceed with caution
Suspects are musically armed and dangerous

Call the police, police, police, po-lice
I'm about to make a hit
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit

Call the police, police, police, po-lice
I'm about to make a hit
Call the police, police, police, po-lice
Heart is about to quit

Jump off ma stool outta ma corner
May I have the floor to say
I play the fool to catch the wiser
Now I've gotta motto that guilty must pay
