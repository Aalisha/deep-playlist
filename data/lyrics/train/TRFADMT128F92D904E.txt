I don't wanna talk about love
'Cause I've heard it before it talks too loud
You can hear it in a disco midnight, shouting

And I don't wanna think about it, think about it
It comes dressed in its summer clothes
When you're traveling through the heart of the winter's cold

And I don't wanna talk about changes
Changes come of their own free will
And if you wanna talk about leavin'
Well, you've always walked and, you always will

Every time you talk about love
