Say the talk and I won't mind
There's cause you know I'll never try
And I love you like the one I used to know
And if you never had the time
That's an ordinary problem
And I say I'd like to have a place to go

And you held and you tried
I could never find another
If you walk me to the car park
I won't go
To my left I saw time
Flash and fall it seemed to swallow you
I could love you like the sister
I never had

Drawing circles in your concrete
...
