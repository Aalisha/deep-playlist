Hear the call I beckon
Harlot come to me
Lay your trust in satan
Fall unto your knees
Ride with me through fire
The eternal pits of hell
Grant to me your body
I will take your soul

Tormented soul eternity
Satanic slave you will bear my son
The evil force from the frosty skies
I possess your mind
Bound by chain
The immortal slave
Mystic chants round the holy grave
Lust for blood a sacrifice
Deadly sin contract in blood
Contract in blood!

Renounce me all religion
Smite the wrath of god
