Oh, eat your animal crackers
'Cause my mother told me so long ago,
"If you eat your animal crakers,
The children in Europe won't starve anymore".
Hahaha hahahaha hahaha.

Oh I love eating icecream,
Chocolate, vanilla and butter pecan,
But I best love animal crackers
'Cause I love helping my fellow man.
Yeah, I eat more crackers than anyone can
Hahaha haha.

(I forgot the words... ONCE! Thank you!)
