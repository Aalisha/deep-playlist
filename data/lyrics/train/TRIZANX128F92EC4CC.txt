I cannot believe, I'm this dirty
And I'm ashamed to even ask to be clean
I can't think of anyone less worthy
I have nothing to offer or to bring

So I throw myself on Your mercy
And I throw myself at Your feet
And I throw my filth on the grace of One
Who's beauty is beyond me
And I wait and I wait

I don't even know how I got here
I wondered to this darkness from Your light
I still remember walking in the garden with You
Now I'm just stumbling through this night
