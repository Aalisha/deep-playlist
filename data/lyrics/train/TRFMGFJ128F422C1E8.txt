Just a girl in a photograph
Wearing the dress that I wear now
A pretty face in fields of grey
It's sad to see that nothing seems to change

She's running from the boy in the schoolyard
She's running through the field to the open barn
They're laughing as the sun dances round her
A little life within her takes it place inside her starts to grow

She cuts the seams of a favourite frock
She sits and listens to the old church clock
Oh daddy daddy don't send me away
