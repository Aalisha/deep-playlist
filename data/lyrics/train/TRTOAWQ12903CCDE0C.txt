Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow
Out of the line

Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder
And the wind shouts back

Grinder
Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene
That's why I won't get caught
...
