(Written by Terri Clark)

You were standin' at my front door
When I came home tonight
And I could tell by the look you gave me
You were needin' my advice
You say you want more out of life than he can give you
As a tear rolls down your face
But girl, I've seen the way he looks at you
And I know someone who'd gladly take your place.

Chorus:
If I were you
I'd run back home tonight
Tell him everything's all right
Yeah, I know what I'd do
If I were you
I'd never let him go
