Charlie to Jonathon
O.K. boy now here's your deal
Will you gamble your life?
Sign right here on the dotted line
It's the one you've waited for all of your life

Jonathon to Charlie
Ah - will it feed my hunger
If I swallow lies right down my throat?
Or will it choke me till I'm raw?
And tomorrow when I'm gone
Will they whore my image on?
I'll will my throne away, to a virgin heir and Charlie's slave

Jonathon
Murders, murders in the new morgue
Murders, murders in the new morgue
See old Charlie and the platinum armys
Making me their boy
Murders, murders in the new morgue
...
