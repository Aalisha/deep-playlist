Well my life is filled with songs
But I just could not get along without my friends
And I'm happy now, but when this good life ends
I know a better life begins.

And love to you sir Stonehill,
Armed with your axe full gallop on your amp.
Ah, you're so crazy but you know it,
And I love you as we both crawl toward the Lamp.

With Clapton on guitar, and Charlie on the drums.
McCartney on the Hoffner bass with blisters on his thumbs.
