I really don't know much better
There's nothing I can tell you
But that's something for me to know
And something for you to do

Put yourself in my position
Think about it everyday
Give me solid facts
I want to hear the words
I want to hear what you have to say

You know my situation
The reality is true
But it's leisure time for the pleasure boys
And the pleasure boys are you

Leisure and conversation
All the boys are on the phone
