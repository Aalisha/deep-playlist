Our sun is set, our day is done
I'm left here wondering
Is this the end, my final words to you
Day turned to night
Now you're gone I'm left here pondering
Can this be true, are we really through

You were the wind beneath my wings
Taught me how to fly
With you I lived among the kings
How could this ever die
So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I always will be
