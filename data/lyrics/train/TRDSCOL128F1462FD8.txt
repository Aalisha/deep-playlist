I don't want to be standing here
With this ticket for this outbound plane
'Cause I've been here before
And somehow it doesn't feel the same
Talk is cheap, so we could talk all night long
We may never figure out just where our love went wrong.

AndI don't wanna be standin' here
And I don't wanna be talkin' here
And I don't really care who's to blame
'Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane.

The old folks say loves not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away
From love alone, to pace the floor
...
