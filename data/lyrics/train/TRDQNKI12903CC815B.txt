Hothouse flowers grow lush and bright
In tiny little towns across this big night
Hothouse flowers all kissing for fun
Slipping into stores then out in a run, singing
Laments and rowdy songs, hymns about sin
High lives and reels, a tarantell' violin
Other people's apartments and couches and clothes
Young again, lost again
Here we are, here we go
Hothouse flowers growing up so strange
...
