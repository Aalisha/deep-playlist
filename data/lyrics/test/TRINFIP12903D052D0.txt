Another saturday
Another careless move
Tells the world
That you're thinking of what to do
A window opens up
And some one calls your name
But I can tell
You don't know how to play this game

I know this isn't it (Oooh)
You'll hit your target someday (Oooh)

So now your on your own
Won't you come back home
To see you're not that kind
And find the strength
To find the strength
To find another way
