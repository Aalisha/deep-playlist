Strange vision dreams my mind
When I am walking through the night
Each time I see the visage of the moon
Dead cities amongst the sands
Under the black abyss of seas
Does madness seize my soul?
The elder race
From beyond the stars
Etarnal watchers
Of sphere no return
Seven seals
Of seven mighty gates
Abominations
...
