Take away my prime from the mouth of the lion
Savage jaws are the price we pay
Take away their lies
let me see with my own eyes
Walk along the narrow way.

Oh what a waste (Oh! What a waste...)
Your sword is no use when your standing face to face
(Standing... there face to face)
Oh what a waste (Oh! What a waste...)
A mystic human race (human race)
Your sword no use to you when standing face to face
(Standing... there face to face)

Hey fool watch out (watch out!)
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
(I don't think so)
Hey fool watch out (watch out!)
You'll get mauled by the lion's mouth
Oooh!
