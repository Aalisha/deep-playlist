Life is a journey before I went the rap route,
I serve niggaz on off the bench like stack house,
Going in with no intention to back down,
My quote can't flow solidified I spit crack now,
You get confinement from my mental stash house,
I'm back, droughts over fiends mouth foaming,
There's residue on the street my mics smoking,
Time to show these niggaz it's doe or die my eyes ain't closing,
Ever since I started rhyming the crime rates lower,
And I froze my watch cause time waits for no-one,
Can fuck with NY when you think it's over,
You stay coming back like the Yanks with Hovers,
I ain't livin on the strength of no-one, controls my fate, I hold my weight and know my place,
When I show my face it's all love if not I say fuck it I don't mind hate.
