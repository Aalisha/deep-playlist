We're all alone in this world, so save yourself
No one can hear your voice, don't waste your breath
You fall behind and no one will stay to help you
Your lady luck ain't got no patience left
She said you've been programmed to fail the test
Around your age, that was the way I felt, too

But there comes a time when a man earns his stripes
But no badge of honor is worth his life
Don't take no shit

Don't take no shit
...
