We started out so good
There was nothing like the two of us
Yeah we understood
That loving each other is 
Starting with foundations 
That we're building to last
But you were not ready
Yeah, you were unsteady 
And it's all come to head

Now I feel 
All lost I got no home
I feel all alone
In the house that we built
No bricks
It's got no stones
You took all the love out 
Of the house that we built
No guts
It's got no bones
I feel so alone
In the house that we built
No heart
It's got no soul 
It's falling down and down

We started off so strong
