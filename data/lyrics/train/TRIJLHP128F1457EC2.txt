Born in darkness
But I fought my way up to the sun
Had a lot of battles
Some I lost and some I've won

But let me tell you, girl
You ain't seen nothing yet
There's nothing in this world
That I can't get
As long as I have you (long as I have you)
Long as I have (long as I have you) you

Give me mountains to crumble
And I'll turn them to sand
Let me put this world
In the palm of your hand
