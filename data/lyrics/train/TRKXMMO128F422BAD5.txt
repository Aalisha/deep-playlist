My doobie eyed Madonna
A triple fire alarm
All the other rougues and darlings
Get sent to the farm

I dont need to deceive you
Cause I feel no pain
Maybe I should let you
Come on and eat my brain

Theres an art to perception
So see it as you will
Can you adjust my reception
Just give me the lastest pill
