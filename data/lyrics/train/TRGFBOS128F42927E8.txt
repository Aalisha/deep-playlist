If you wanna dance, this is our chance
If you wanna dance, let's take our chance

Jiggy jump to the beat
Keep bouncin', 30 seconds and counting
Hot one, this choice is critical situation is difficult
My caliber won't allow me to rhyme
On a level where you people can hear me
See me, guess I know you wanna be me
In the meantime bounce to the beat sing
Music is my life 'cos my life is music
The beat of the drum in your heart

Let's dance
(Like you mean it, can't you feel it? Don't you know)
Let's dance
('Cos you need it, better believe it, here we go)

Let's dance
(Give your all when we're coming together on the floor)
Let's dance
(You know that you've got what I like)

Check it down
Droppin' verbal bombs on the beat
Hopin' that you people think this sound is unique
'Cos I like to party, you like to party
Come on everybody, gotta get it started
I got something to get you jumpin'
When I kick the freaky rhyme
I'll get the dance floor thumpin'
Just step back and take time to check
When I rock up on the mic
You people never forget check it out

Music is my life 'cos my life is music
The beat of the drum in your heart
