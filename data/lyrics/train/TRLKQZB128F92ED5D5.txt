I'd always dreamed I'd build a cradle we'd lay you in when we brought you home, when we brought you home,
But there you lay, fast asleep in a feed through; it was all that I could find.

I'd always hoped you'd have my eyes, maybe a little bit of the skill of my hands,
But, as I look into your eyes, I see your hands created mine.

This is all I have to give,
You can share my home and bear my name, but this is not how you should live,
The son of God has become the son of man - this is all I have to give.
