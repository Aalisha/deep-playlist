OK, you're on your own, it's late
Your girlfriend is on another date with the hero in your dream
Turn around, ask yourself. So, you think you're gonna win this time Manchild?

Is it the pain of the drinking
Or the Sunday sinking feeling
The car never seems to work
When it's late your girlfriend's on a date
And the hero with her in your dream
In your sleep it seemed to like you
Turn around and ask yourself
Turn around ask yourself

Manchild, will you ever win
Manchild, look at the state you're in

Could you go undercover
And sell your brand new lover (could you)
Be someone else for a night
Maybe someone else will love you
You sell your soul for a tacky song
