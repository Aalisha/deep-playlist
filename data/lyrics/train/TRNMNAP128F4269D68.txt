They must mean business
To say there's nothing worse
Then to let your precious love child
Leave the planet first

'Cause, oh whoa whoa
They've gotta just let her go

All the things that you swear you're gonna do
Reservations on the next train to the moon
Pack your things 'cause there ain't no time to lose
And all the things you never

So I think we're gonna have to record her
...
