Since you've been gone
I shut my eyes
And I fantasize
That you're here with me

Will you ever return?
I won't be you satisfied
Till you're by my side
Don't wait any longer...

Why don't you come back?
Please hurry, why don't you come back?
Please hurry...
Come back and stay for good this time
Come back and stay for good this time

You said goodbye
I was trying to hide
What I felt inside
...
