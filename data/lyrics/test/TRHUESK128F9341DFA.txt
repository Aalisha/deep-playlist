A little wrangler was born
I seen him squirming in the saddle all wet and warm
He's such a changeable form in his very first year

He rides on to wrangler school
With a slingshot and a saddlebag of hand-me-down tools
Doesn't want to look like a fool
Pass the jail without tears

Time machines, remembered scenes
That a wrangler rides through a passing stream
...
