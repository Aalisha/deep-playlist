It's been seven hours long
And you're shadow still hangs on
You've been two weeks gone
So tonight I'll follow you home
There are so many different ways
Of collecting all the strays
The ones that get away

Oh, fascinations, we play
New sensations
Oh, fascination, it's been in my
Frustration
It's been in my frustrations
And I haven't got the patience
