Somethin'
Somethin's takin' over me
Shakin'
Bottled up inside of me
Crawlin'
Crawlin' in the shadows so
No one finds me

Hidin'
Paranoid I suffer
No sleepin'
I'm annoyed I think you should
Shut it
Give me no attention or
You'll be sorry

I've got nothin' left to lose
You always get your way
Got everythin' to prove
I saw you turn away

Got nothin' left to lose
You always get your way
Got everythin' to prove
...
