(Mark Gray/James P. Pennington)

The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all.
I'm fallin' faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall.

The things that you say to me
The look on your face
Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love

The closer you get, (oh baby) the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all.
