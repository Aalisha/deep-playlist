I just got your letter dearest sweetheart and darling I miss you oh so much
Your letter has cheered me but I'm lonesome lonesome just to feel your loving touch
Letters have no arms dear to hold me kisses on paper are so cold
These sweet things you write in your letter I wanna be with you dear when told
