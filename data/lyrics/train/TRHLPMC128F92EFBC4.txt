I fall asleep there's a tense atmosphere
It's you I see like a weird prophecy
Camels burning in the snow impressions of the night
The shadow of a stranger your expression of delight

All I want is to love you
Neither secrets nor compromise
All I want is to love you
My jealousy that's the other side
Oh, you!
