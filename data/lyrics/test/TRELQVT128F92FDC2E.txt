Here she comes, that little town flirt
You're falling for her and your gonna get hurt
Yeah, I know it's so hard to resist
The temptation of her tender red lips
But you can get hurt, hur-hur-hurt
Yeah, you can get hur-hur-hur-hur-hurt
Foolin' around with that little town flirt

Here she comes with that look in her eye
She plays around with every guy that goes by
Yeah, I know she's gonna treat you wrong
