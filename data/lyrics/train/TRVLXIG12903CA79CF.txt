All good things must come to an end
If I could be there again
For just a little while

I hear voices in the air
I wish that I could be there
Maybe someday- I don't know

Maybe someday, maybe someway
I don't know

Wait just long enough
See what tomorrow brings
Wait just long enough
See what tomorrow brings
