Well, the grasses are swaying, sun's going down
Music is playing, you? re weaving through town
Pull into the drive way, toss it in park

You stare out of the windshield, out into the world
It was all for the love of a wayward girl
Who left you with a second place smile and a broken heart

And the streetlights are starting to flicker to life
They glow for a minute then they get bright
...
