So we maybe gorgeous
So we maybe famous
Come back when we're getting old

Cover us in chocolate
Sell us to the neighbours
Frame us in a video

Clone us in a test tube
Sell us to the multitude
Guess that's the price of fame

She likes the black one
He likes the the posh one
Cute ones are usually gay

Here we come, this is our destiny calling
We're freaks
This is our destiny calling
Unique
This is our destiny calling now
