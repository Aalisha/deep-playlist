I rode all night on a big old bus
You came a long way to be with us
You pay good money to see a show
Yeah, let's get ready 'cause here we go

Get on your feet 'cause I'm plugged in
So come on, let's do this

I'll turn it on, I'll crank it up
I'll show you all what I'm made of
I'll get loud, I'll wear it out
I'll bring the roof in this house down

I know just what you came here for
And I want to hear you scream and more
Get on your feet, you know you can't resist
Let's do this, let's do this
