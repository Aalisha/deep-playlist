Well I really didn't wanna go out, to the movies
With some guy I didn't know named Joe, a friend of my friend Susie's
Waitin by the window, not expectin to see
Anyone who was any interest to me

You drove up in a powder blue corvette, it was a stingray
With Tony Bennett on the stereo and a rose stickin out of the ashtray
You jacked up your shades and you smiled at me
You said "Hello" I said "Oh no, here we go again"

With lips like yours you could talk me into anything
And with arms like yours you could hold me all night long
I guess I'll dance the dance, take my chance, a leap of faith
Fly further than I've ever flown before
