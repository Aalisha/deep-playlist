From the wreckage I pick up the pieces of my life
It's all around me ripped to shreds, I'm wounded and that's why
This time I'm taking mine, I will not wait in line
I'll bite the hand that feeds me, I will do what I must to survive
This time I'm taking mine, I will not wait in line
I'll bite the hand that feeds me, I will do what I must to survive
