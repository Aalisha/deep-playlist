Every day is a new day
A chance of a lifetime
A break in the sunshine
We're only giving you what you want
You don't know where it's funny

Every day a new way,
Total understanding,
Every beat of your heart,
We're only giving you what you want,
Giving you what you want
Giving you what you want
Giving you what you want
Giving you what you want
Giving you what you want
