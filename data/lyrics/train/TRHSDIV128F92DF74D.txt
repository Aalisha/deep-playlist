I wish I'd known, maybe I could've helped you
But you were already gone to the trouble that held you
Come knee high you were treated like the meantime
Well they might've been young but excuses just become lies

They were wrong
They were wrong
They were wrong
They were wrong
The day is never too long
When it's gone it's gone
They were wrong
My god they're still wrong

We were drinking warm beer at Ninth and Michigan
You were making me nervous but I was still listening
Well he might've been a talker but he never said too much
He was just a souvenir from a cold done dead love
