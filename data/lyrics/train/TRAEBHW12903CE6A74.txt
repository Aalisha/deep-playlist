I'm standing in the center of the room
I watch the boys follow girls perfume
All is as it should be I assume
Except for the distance between me and you

You're standing as a flower on the wall
The room is still but we're about to fall
And all the names that brought us here
Simply fade away

Who you are is falling over me
(Who you are is falling over me)
Who you are is everything I need
(Who you are is everything I need)

I'm hoping
I'm waiting
I'm praying you are the one
...
