Don't blame me
I'm crazy
PMT and I'm young
Don't hate me
That's lazy
Plenty more work to be done

I'm cravin'
I'm ravin'
Mad about the thing that you do
Oh baby
Just save me
I'm giving it up for you

You can't stop me
I can't help it

Flirting with my new philosophy
Livin' it up with my intuition
Getting on down is my new therapy
Working you out is my new religion

Ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba, ba-ba-ah
Is my new religion
Ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba, ba-ba-ah
