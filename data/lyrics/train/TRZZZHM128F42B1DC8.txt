brother and sister, mama and pa
livin' in a trailer in arkansas
when ya comin' home son, well i don't know
still got a couple wild oats to sow

'cause i'm just doin' what i do best
livin' out the legend of the golden west
flyin' like an eagle, walkin' like a man
chasin' my angel through the promised land

friday evenin' when the sun go down
it's a five-star party in a one-bar town
dawn come early but that's all right
we can get a head start on saturday night
