Living in a daze, beyond belief
Withdrawn from all that I know
Disturbed by darkened thoughts
Of haunting agony, restrain the memorie
Fearing for my life
The government denies their sole existence
But it's much too late for them
Can't wait to see their faces
When they arrive again
Mental impairment, sanity lost, it's vanished away
...
