Storming the borders of chaos
For the cause of a battle once strong

Faster than the wind we rode
To where our blackened hordes dawned

Armed in the fires of combat
The end will come fast on this day

Stronger than the gods we fought
Triumphant for the dark prophecies

Besiege the thrones of reverence

Gods of all fiery fate

Besiege the thrones of reverence

Warriors crowned on this day
