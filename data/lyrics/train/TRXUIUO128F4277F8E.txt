Holler at your boy, Saigon, set this shit off!

(Chorus: Saigon)
Me when I'm rhymin', remarkable timin'
Shorty's with brown eyes that sparkle like diamonds
Us in the park when we played on the swings
These are a few of my favorite things
Hagglin' couches, necklaces and watches
Brethren that got no respect for the coppers
My cousin Face who was placed in the bing
These are a few of my favortite things

(Saigon)
Your favorite color... black
