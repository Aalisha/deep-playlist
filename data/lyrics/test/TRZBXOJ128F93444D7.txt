My land lady treats me like I don t pay my rent
Took my car to my mechanic, I ain t seen it since
My phone is always ringin when I want to be alone
They try and sell me everything from Heaven to cologne
Everybody s got an offer I can t refuse
It s a circus out here momma
Your baby s got them Sideshow Blues

It s all a big commercial, it s a video of a man
It s a plot to put an end to my attention span
They make up all these issues, I never understood
If I thought I could change things I d run out to Hollywood
But it s hard to kick the door down wearing seven dollar shoes
It s a circus out here momma
Your baby s got them Sideshow Blues
