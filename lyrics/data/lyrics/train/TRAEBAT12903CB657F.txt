Hold me tight, laying next to you
Every kiss says something new
Every breath, deeper than before
Making me want you more

All I know is, baby, it feels so fine
So special, will you really be mine?
Hold on tight to this love tonight
Don't let go

You've got to give me your love exclusively
Don't share it with nobody else
