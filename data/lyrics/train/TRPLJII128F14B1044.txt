We sit and watch umbrellas fly
I'm trying to keep my newspaper dry
I hear myself say
"My boat's leaving now"
So we shake hands and cry
Now I must wave goodbye, wave goodbye
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye
Wave goodbye, wave goodbye

You know
I don't want to cry again
I don't want to cry again
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to cry again
I don't want to run away
I don't want to race this pain
I'll never see your face again
