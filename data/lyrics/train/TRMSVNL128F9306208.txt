My Roommate 
I swear to you people, it must be my fate.
The cards were against me, now there's no escape.
I have this here problem, who keeps me up late.
My roommate, my roommate.

He thinks he's the greatest, dancer of all time.
He never stops dancin', he's out of his mind.
In the bathroom singing, a pitch out of time.
My roommate, my roommate.

Chorus:
I can't sleep the day, noon or night.
