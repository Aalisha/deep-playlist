Yo foxy, shorty yo
Don't let that pretty shit fool you yo
I ain't pay that bitch phone bill

This is for all my ballin' ass bitches
All over worldwide
Shake them thighs for them pies
For all my niggas on every street corner
That's right, love you all niggas

This is for the baller bitch
The waller bitch
My niggas never call a bitch
You all be rich
So Short, what you mean?
I bet I be a poor girl's dream
More money than she ever seen

This is for the baller cats
All the cats
That want a bitch to lay on their back
To hell with that
So Fox what you mean?
Bet I be a poor nigga's dream
More money than he ever seen

Kiss the projects goodbye
I'm a change you bitch
I'm a have niggas thinkin' you a famous bitch
Here's the keys to the Benz but don't start the car
If you good I'm a let you park the car
From a straight broke ass to a baller bitch
They got no other choice but to call you rich
I got hella fly ladies, never cry ladies

Those cheat on they man type, tell a lie ladies
Diamond rings, platinum chains
Tell them 'Baller Bitch' when they ask your name
I say strut that strut
Walk that walk, pop that shit, talk that talk
Hold your head high, be proud of this life
Pray to God that you never fall out of this life
