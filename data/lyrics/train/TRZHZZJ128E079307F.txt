The tar in the street starts to melt from the heat
And the sweats runnin' down from my hair
I walked 20 miles and I'm draggin' my feet
And I'll walk 20 more and I don't care
I'll wander this world, wander this world
Wander this world, wander this world all alone
Alone I'm like a ghost some people can't see
Others drive by and stare
