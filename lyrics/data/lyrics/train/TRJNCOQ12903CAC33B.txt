Back and forth, I have come to this,
So listen if you are interested in this
I hope you're not too busy to miss
This epiphany I just had...

And I know it's not too sexy 
That I'm singing about the blessings we get
When we give up ourselves for something good,
It would be bigger than a promotion, motion, motion...

Because nothing matters,
Just tell yourself again and again and again.
Nothing matters
All of our wealth 
Again and again and again.
Nothing matters,
...
