I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
Now it seems, this is how the story ends
He's going to turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
Not for long, I can see the way this ends
He's going to turn me down and say
"Can't we be friends?"

Never again
Through with love through with men
They play their game
Without shame, and who's to blame?
