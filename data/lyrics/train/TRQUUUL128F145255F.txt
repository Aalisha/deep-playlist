Why do I keep finding myself so surprised?
The qualities, you open me, as advertised
A bigger man might not feel quite so compromised
But I've never been insane and I won't start tonight

I won't let your lousy reputation throw me off
I've heard it enough
I won't let your lousy reputation throw me

I've heard some things I guess it's better not to know
