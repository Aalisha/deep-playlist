Country boy, ain't got no shoes
Country boy, ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day while you're waitin' to play In the sun and the sand, with a face that's tan
But at the end of the day, when your work is done
You ain't got nothin' but fun

Country boy, you got a shaggy dog
Country boy, up a hollow log
Well, he comes in a run, when you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two, and your dog and you
When you get your rabbit, you'll skin his hide
