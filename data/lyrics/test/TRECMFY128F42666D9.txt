Yo what's up? This is G-love coming at you live out here from California even though I'm Philly born and bred. And I got my man Jack Johnson in the studio today. We just got out the surf. My man Jack, tell 'em what time it is.

sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah,
turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
nobody's romancing because it's too early for dancing
but here comes the music.

bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of soul
many people, so many problems, so many reasons
to buy another round, drink it down
just another night on the town
with the big man, money man, better than the other man
he got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
when nobody understands he'll become a smaller man
the bright lights keep flashing, the women keep on dancing
...
