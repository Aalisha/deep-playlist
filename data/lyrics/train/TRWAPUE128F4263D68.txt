Our love's in motion
Give me a notion 'cause
You know we'll
never part
Our love goodbye

I love in season
Give me a reason 'cause
You know we'll
never part
Our love goodbye

And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
No place too far for us
We don't need it...

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly Away
Gonna stay
Love today...

I love a notion
Give me a motion 'cause
You know we'll never see
The thing you see
