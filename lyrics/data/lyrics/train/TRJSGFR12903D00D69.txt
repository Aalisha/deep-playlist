I used to see in color
But now it's only black and white
Black and white

I used to hear your voice
But now I can't make out the sound
Not a sound

And in the solitude I've crafted for myself
I cry a single tear for beauty left unfelt

I used to smell your presence
Like fragrant roses on the wind

The sweetest fruit is tasteless
I reach to touch, but nothing's there
I'm grasping only air

And in the emptiness felt deep inside
I search for memories of what real life was like

When hope is gone and love has died
There's only emptiness inside
...
