I read your letter, made me feel better
How did you know that I was singing the blues?
I felt your sunshine, made me feel so fine
How did you know that I was thinking of you?

In blue California, lights are bright
They'll make you learn to fight for fame and fortune
Promises are made and promises are broken
Dreams are falling through, I should have stayed by you

I've had some hard times, your words are so kind
It's good to hear somebody telling the truth
