I've Got A Right

Tell me what's on your mind
We’re running out of time
I can tell from the look in your eyes
You’re making decsions with me in mind
If I asked you this before
But it’s hard to pin you down
With a chance to have everything mean nothing
You’re really puttin’ me in a bind

I've got a right to know the truth
Will you be loving me tomorrow?
