Children cryin; from the heat
Don't they know they belong?
People fightin; can't compete
Don't they know that they're wrong?

Time is standin still on the ground
Yea time takes us on a trip
Round 'n round our minds
Oh pictures of a dream
All it does is cloud all the lies

Let's all join our hands
Raise them together
Fight for the lives that are real
Lets all join our hands
Raise them together
Fight for the light that we feel

Whoa yea
