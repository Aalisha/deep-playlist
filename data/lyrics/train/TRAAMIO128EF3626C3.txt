Ooh, ooh, closer, closer, yeah...
Ooh, ooh, closer, closer.

Long ago, seems so far away,
I fell in love with you, and that feeling remained.
Looking back I recall how you never could see,
All the feelings I kept deep inside that I didn't set free.

But still I, I wanna be close to you, I wanna be close to you.
Still I, I wanna get close to you, I wanna get close to you.
