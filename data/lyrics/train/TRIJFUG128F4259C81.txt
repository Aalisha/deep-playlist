I'm told my idea of seduction
Is a bit passe'
I hear you like to try it
So I'll try it anyway
I would try anything
I swear I'd try it here and now
I might impress you
With a Rudolf Valentino bow
I tell you to get your attention
I'd do anything
I would work night and day
For all the joy that she could bring
I'd like to be the hunter
Who get's captured by the game
Oh won't you run your fingers through my mane!

* I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!
I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!
