When I don't call and you wait
I guess it seems I'm abominable
Then I'm late and I sleep in
I feel like a criminal
Late at night, we're in bed
I can be like a dog
The heating's off, and you're warm
I don't feel like catching a cold
In any case, you don't care
You don't feel like rubbing it in
When I'm outside in the pouring rain
...
