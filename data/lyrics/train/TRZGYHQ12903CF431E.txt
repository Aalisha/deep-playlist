The things that we go through
Are what it is that makes you.
The hardships that we live
Are the lessons that life gives.

Well, he comes home from school in fear.
His mother screams and his father wreaks of beer.
Dad's nothingness makes for clenched fists.
But, don't be scared 'cause I've been there.
The broken home has helped to keep me strong.

Don't give up; don't give in
When you're the only one in this world,
And it feels like life's turned its back on you.
I am here now and when
