If we could see ourselves, the mirror would reflect insanity
Instead we camouflage the flaws that lie within
Condone the suffering we witness as we mingle casually
We need to right ourselves, or else we will derail

Aiming too high
You are bound to fail
Patience is a vital virtue that you'll never have

Don't force me to believe
We're caught up in the greed
'cause I just care for me
To break it, we'll need everyone
Think it through: united is the only way

A raging tragedy ignored will have its justice, finally
Distress and poverty is everyone's disease
...
