Silver linings are for someone else's cloud
yours have lately been all grey
I know your dreams and they've seen their better days
some of us who live have higher tolls to pay

Why have you brought me this angel here

Are you alive, ah come on look at me
I know you're in there, just open your eyes
I know you're alive
oh but you just might not want to be
I can hear you breathe just open your eyes
hope is a stain on someone else's soul
