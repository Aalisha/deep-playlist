Here I go again
I promised myself I wouldn't think of you today
It's been seven months and counting
You've moved on, I still feel exactly the same
It's just that everywhere I go, all the buildings know your name
Like photographs and memories of love
Steel and granite reminders
The city calls your name and I can't move on

Ever since you've been gone
The lights go out the same
The only difference is
You call another name
To your love
To your lover now
To your love
Lover after me

Am I all alone in the universe?
There's no love on these streets
I have given mine away to a world
That didn't want it anyway
