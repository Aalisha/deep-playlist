I live on a diet, of half-price pub lunch
And Tesco's trifles, I think it might be all too much
I sleep all day and I dance all night
But when you come down, everything's gonna be all right

Too many Hannahs
Too many Hannahs
Closing time, closing time
About the things you do
The way I feel about, I just can't tell it to you
