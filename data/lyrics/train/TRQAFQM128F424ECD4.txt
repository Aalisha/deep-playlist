Our love fell out of winter
Along with the leaves
And bloomed into spring
Taking all of our chances
And all of our dreams
And turned 'em into possibilities

I wanna know
What you're thinking
When you're lying in your bed late at night
Trying to keep so still
My heart is pounding
And it's trying just to keep up with the time

I am not yours
You are not mine

Trees sway, seasons change
And so did my heart
We bend 'til we break
And then we fall apart
You made your point
And I rest my case
My dear, you're just a little bit too late

I wanna know
What you're thinking
When you're lying in your bed late at night
