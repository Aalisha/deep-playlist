I know, I saw
What ya did behind the back door, oh no
Why d'ya have to go and start the freak show
Now I'll never look at you the same way again

'Cause I heard, that you always do it
Every time we're trying to get on through it
I wish I'd never seen you
Doing what ya did, yeah, when you did it that way

Ain't got time for your dirty little games, no
Don't wanna be a part of your whole grubby freak show
Stay away, stay away
(Go, go)
'Cause you're too nasty
(Oh, oh)

Ain't got time for your dirty little games, no
Don't wanna be a part of your whole grubby freak show
Stay away, stay away
(Go, go)
'Cause you're too nasty
(Oh, oh)

Season's will change
But I'll never forget that awful day
How could you do it
