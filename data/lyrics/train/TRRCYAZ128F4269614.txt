Wonder how we've got that far
It nearly freaks me out
I can't believe it's all in vain
I suffer from this pain
I want to be alone today
(I'll) let it fade away

This is my manifesto
Written with my tears
This is my manifesto
Hidden in my heart

Now you're gone and it's so cold
So cold as if you're dead
Have I really been that wrong
(Or) was it just a dream
You made a perfect fool of me
