Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

Hold me in your arms
Tell me that this love
Will always be

Whisper in my ear
Things that only you and I
Should hear

Through the storms of life
We toss and turn
Tryin' hard to break us down

But I could face the hurt of anything
Just as long as you're around

'cos being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my mind

Being with you
Even the rainy days seem fine
You are an angel in my eyes

All I ask of life
Is to let me near you
Con-stant-ly
