Stale as a 2 day half full beer
Cigarette boats float around in here
A field in my gut lacking sunshine

Put down like a teenager's first drink
I cough up compliments, I think
You're better off walking away while you still can

She was passing through to climb a hill
As you slipped and slid on my gut spill
My better half was praying for you to fall
