You can all call me crazy
For the things that I might say
You can laugh all you want to
I know there will come a day
When we all will come together
And learn to set aside our hate
And we can learn to love our neighbor
Just like we would love ourselves

We've got to come together
'Cause in the end we can make it -- alright
We've got to brave the weather
Through all of the storms
We've got to come together
'Cause in the end we can make it -- alright
We've got to learn to love
We've got to learn to love

You can call me a dreamer
