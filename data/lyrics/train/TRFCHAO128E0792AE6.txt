I used to wake in the afternoon,
When the sunshine finally cut through the haze,
I really don't remember that much I just know I wasted a thousand days.
We need protection from this infection, something to ease this cruel

A ray of hope in a new direction,
I called to you and you rescued me.

Because when you're around, I feel like I'm born again,
I'm through going down,
In you I've a better friend.

Yes I know I'm the lucky one,
