Sometimes you choose to make any excuse
Any reason to believe you belong in this room
You can't live life from the sheets on your bed

Sometimes you choose to make any excuse
Any reason to believe you belong in this room
You can't live life from the sheets on your bed

And it's a long way down, before you reach the ground
It's okay... because I've felt that way before
And it will happen again I'm sure
I'm sure, wrong or right
I'm on your side

In time you'll find
That so close to living is just waiting to die
...
