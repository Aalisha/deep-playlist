The priest is raped, the churches burn
Reality of lost existance
Catastrophy was long foreseen
Nothing's done, it had to be
Rape the world for inbreed ghosts
The lunatics to reign this world
Dehydrate the holy wells
Castrate the redeemer

You've deceived me, you've betrayed me
You ran away with the devil's gold
Cut the flesh, slay the soul
You've deceived me, you've betrayed me
You ran away with the devil's gold
I will teach you obedience
Loyal to the crown of God Dethroned

Spirits of a higher kind don't show their flesh
