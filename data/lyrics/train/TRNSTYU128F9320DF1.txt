Grinspoon ' Hard act to follow

(intro)
You're a hard act to follow
Such a fine lookin' fellow
I hear your belly is yellow
You're a hard act to swallow

(verse)
Kinda makes me sick
The way you turn those tricks
C'mon light it up
I wanna feel the rush

(pre chorus)
I'll be shootin' for thrills when I walk out that door
You say it's hard to care anymore
