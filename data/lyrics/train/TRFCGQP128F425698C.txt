You went to my head
All the things that you said
Straight to my head
Like a cannonball
I fled
The more that I heard
The more that I knew I'd been had
Should have got out the lead
I ran full speed ahead
Full of dread
Went to my head
You went to my head
Message was danger
Color was red
I dreamt I was dead
Sat straight up in my bed
My bed
Oh where did I bury my body
...
