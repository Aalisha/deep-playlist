There was a world outside my door
I wasn't in touch with anymore
There was a way I used to feel
I knew what was and wasn't real

You built a bridge, I tore it down
I felt safe on shaky ground
And I was a master of despair
Making believe, I didn't care

I shouldn't be standin' here today
After all the crazy things I've done
I'm ready to fall and that's okay
I ran as far as I could run and you won
