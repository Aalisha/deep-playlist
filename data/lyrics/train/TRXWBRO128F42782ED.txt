I can't say that I
Was always there for you
I won't try to lie
and say I did all I could do

Let me tell you this
'for you close the door
I could've loved you better
But I could not have loved you more

You're all I ever needed
And all I ever did was let you down
And for what I never gave you
I don't blame you if you can't forgive me now
