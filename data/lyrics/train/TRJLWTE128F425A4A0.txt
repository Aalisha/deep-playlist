I toss and turn
I'm turning around
But I cannot sleep
I'm hypnotized
I'm paralyzed
By a different beat
I hear your voice
Getting louder now
Yet so out of reach
But I'm mistaking
It's only the echo of you

And I'm not sleeping
Now that you're gone
I can't help feeling
I did you wrong
And now this feeling
It's been so long
...
