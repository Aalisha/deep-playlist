Well your mama didn't like me
So we just ran away
Got a little apartment in a hotel
Down in Brownsville way
I used to sit in the kitchen and play guitar
When night turned to day
We always thought we had something
No one could ever take away
But the time run out
And the payment's due
There'll never be enough time to forget about you
Well there'll never be enough time to forget about you
