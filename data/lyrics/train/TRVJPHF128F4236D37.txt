Look at those dancers gliding around
Seems if their feet
Don't hardly touch the ground

Look at them smiling
Like they knew one another
And they never would come down

Turn around and hold me
I'd like to see your face alone
I'm hoping there's someone home

I'd like to meet you
Who do you see?
Introduce yourself to whichever of me is nearby

Close behind your eyes you're laughing at me
And I'm stuck here with no instructions that I can see
To steer by

Stick around it's tricky ground
I'd like to see your face alone
I'm hoping there's someone home

Two or three people fading in and out
...
