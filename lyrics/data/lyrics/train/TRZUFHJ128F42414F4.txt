September When
Mother Ive Been Kissed
Waste Of Time
She sat almost there in the corner of my eye
A long time ago
Weaving up stories about what I should know
And I liked it so
More of a meaning that couldn't be true
I didn't understand
It's always a good night for sleeping with you
and go back in time

OK?
