Ok baby come here, look this what we gonna do.
We gonna play this cops and robbers thing,
but you got to keep this to yourself. I mean...
...you kiling me alright. Listen

Put your hand where I can see em'
License and registration
Your doing 60 in a 35
Do I detect intoxacation
Get up on this ride
Put your hands behind your back
and close your eyes
I'm bout to run you downtown
Lock you up and throw away the key
Tonight I'm going to be your police

You got the right to remain silent
You got the right to keep this on the low
Anything you say or do can be use against
you but as far as I'm concerned cased is closed

If you wanna testify
