You never have to lie
Don't build a wall and hide behind it
Let's see what we can find
Let me show you what I like

Don't waste another night
Let's build a dream and live inside it
Don't be afraid to fly
Baby, show me what you like

All I want baby is to have enough
All I need angel is someone to trust
All I fear sugar is to care too much
All I need baby is to know I'm loved

I want us to be right
