She said: 'How did we get ourselves so lost?'
And I said: 'I don't know, but we will not be leaving tonight, tonight
When you hold me I, I feel better'

I only want one night, together in our arms
This is the longest night, we're meeting arms to arms

Nothing is wasted and life is worth living
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing
Everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
Nothing is wasted and life is worth living (I only want one night)
Heaven is nowhere, just look to the stars
There is a day that is yours for embracing (This is the longest night)
Everything's nothing, and nothing is ours
