Gaining strength by tearing you down
Weakened by physical torment
Broken down by psychological exhaustion
Stretch the limits of psychic tolerance
Paint out their pain in black and white
The pleasure of someone else's pain
The suffering of thousands created by my sinister hand
Thoughts made real

Trapped in mental prison for all eternity
Infinite pain far beyond the pleasure of suffering
No more fragrance, vision or sound
Just the conception of fear
...
