Well, I been sleeping for forty days and I know
I'm sleeping 'cause this dream's too amazing
She got gold doorknobs where her eyes used to be, yeah
One turn and I learned what it really means to see

Ah Ah, it's the magical mystery kind, ah ah, must be a lie
Bye bye to the too good to be true kind of love
Oh oh, I could die
Oh, now I could die
