(Aww)
(Yeah)

Here is the money that I owe you
Yeah so you can pay the bills
I will give you more
When I get paid again

I hate those people who love to tell you
Money is the root of all that kills
They have never been poor
They have never had the joy of
a welfare Christmas

(Yeah)
Oh, I know we will never look back
(Yeah)

You say you wake up crying
Yes and you don't know why
You get up and you go lay down inside
My baby's room

Yeah I guess I'm doing okay
I moved in with the strangest guy
Can you believe he actually
Thinks that I am really alive?
