I: Ours
(leadvocals by Julie King & Andy Tillison)

After our wars we feel a moment's inspiration as we rebuild our cities
With visions anew and the architects and artists sound our glory
In a monument to freedom
Scraping the sky with steel and stone and a deep pride in our new-built homes
People are the focus once again, in the wide, wide streets of a town for today's men

And after a time we become immune to all the images
That war brings to our front rooms, so far away
Decisions to be made do not seem relevant to anything that's happening now
But six feet under lies the charred earth, the buried memories of the last time
It's there in the eyes of the survivors, and our peace walks
On an all too finite line

II: Theirs
including "Ours Reprise"
(leadvocals by Andy Tillison)

The world is awash with dictators and moguls, between them we don't stand a chance
Caught between egos and cold economics we all know the steps to the dance
We can watch it all on TV while we're sitting eating tea
We can watch the bombs start falling to "set the people free"
And it's raining down on me, through the atmosphere, from the satellites
The battlefields the way the media sees them

The press always get there in time for the flag-burns in every demonstration report
