G-L-A-D
good loving and devotion
good loving and devotion
There are the guys that like to settle down
tell you things you want to know take you where you like to go
then there are boys who like to fool around
use you up and wear you out try to tell you what love's about

And then there are girls who try the best to please
and there are girls who do the best to tease
here are the things I think you all should know
check out these words G-L-A-D

G-L-A-D.
is what I want for me
G-L-A-D good loving and devotion
G-L-A-D sing along with me
good loving and devotion
good loving and devotion
