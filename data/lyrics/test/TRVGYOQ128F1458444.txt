Everybody sing!
Oh yeah baby
1, 2, 3, oh yeah!
Oh, oh yeah

I'm a total experience
This is how I play
I'm not one of those people
With nothing much to say

I'm here to get busy
I'm here to throw down
I'm here to tell you that
The boy is back in town

I want to tell you something that you don't know
Don't know about me
They are much too blind to ever know the truth
Why can't they see

Everybody sing!

I don't care what people say
I don't care what people do
I can do what I want to do
Whether they like it or not

I don't care what people say
I don't care what people know
I can do what I want to do
