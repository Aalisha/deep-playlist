We were three little girls from school
One was pretty, one was smart
And one was a borderline fool
Well she's still good lookin' that woman hadn't slipped a bit
The smart one used her head, she made her fortune
And me, I cross the border every chance I get

We were the girls of the 50's
Stoned rock and rollers in the 60's
And more than our names got changed
As the 70's slipped on by
Now we're 80's ladies
There ain't been much these ladies ain't tried

We've been educated
We got liberated
And has complicating matters with men
Oh, we've said, "I do"
