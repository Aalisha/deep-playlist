(rowe / stannard / watkins) (additional lyrics / somerville)

You and me to compromise
Need to give and take
Look and me don't you realise
I can tolerate
Whoever else may want you
Whatever turns on you
Nothing changes I can trust you
Just as long as

I can feel heartbeat in my hand
And I can see tomorrow in your eyes
If we believe that love makes no demands
...
