These games that we play so hard,
They got me feelin' like I lost my special one and only
And there's nothin' left to say (There's nothin' left there's nothin')
You swore that you would always be there for me
But a year has come and gone and still I sit here lonely
It never mattered anyway

First time you played me for a fool
Next time I pay the price
This'll be the last you take a banner
Till you gimme away, gimme away, gimme away

[Chorus:]
There's only so much more that
...
