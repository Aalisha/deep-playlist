Hey, Man I cant be out here too late, How long we gonna be out here?
Till When? Where the hell is this you taken me too?
Man ya'll crazy, the Funroom? No, the what? Man oh lord. Come on

First number one done run the ball
Ninety some of yall in the first quater
Whats messin these country boyz, nuttin at all
Me and my partner dawg, Timbaland ought to be

Best thing to hapen since they made carz
Brightest thing shinen since the north star
Best communication since sailor I tell ya boy,

Man we aint lookin for him we just bump into em
