Trap door in every step
Truth is I can't connect
Move along I work in stages
Where you at
It looks like cages
See a little, see a lot
Come around see what you're not
Up and down, but never out
Last one here is left to shout

You're just a stereo
Stereo
Stereo
You're just a stereotype
(You're just a stereotype)

You're just a stereo
Stereo
Stereo
You're just a stereotype
(You're just a stereotype)

Sometimes the worst is best
Pick it up and beat the rest
Dig deep to find every scrap
Tragedy can make you laugh
Sign up and sell your soul
What's that
It's rock and roll
Don't get it, you never learn
Where it's cold, it's where you burn
