I'm in a room full of people
Hanging on one person's breath
We would all vote him most
likely to be loved to death
I hope he still want it
But it might remind him of when,
he aimed for the bulls eye and
hit it 9 times out of 10.
That one time his hand slipped
and I saw the dart sail away.
I don't know where it landed but
I'm guessing between green and gray.
Well I thought nothing of it, but it
still haunts him like a ghost
With all eyes upon him, except
two that matter the most.

CHORUS
