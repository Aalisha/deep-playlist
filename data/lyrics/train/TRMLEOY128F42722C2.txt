Yeah, yeah, yeah

You've won my affection, You've captured my heart
You have my devotion, my worship is Yours
You've won my affection, You've captured my heart
Now I am Yours, completely Yours forever

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I see the sacrifice You gave
I know the awesome price You paid
You went the distance, You finished strong
