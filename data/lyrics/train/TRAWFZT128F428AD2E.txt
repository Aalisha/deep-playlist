Too many lies,
We've broken hearts over time
They wanna get with the flow,
And treat 'em just like a pro
I wanna say hey yo baby
Girl you driving me crazy
And I can't take a no
I can't let you go

I said you know you're my babe,
Why don't we just kiss
I'm gonna keep you all the way through life
So remember this
So won't you come on lets go
And we'll take it slow
Just like my superstar
You are the star of the show
...
