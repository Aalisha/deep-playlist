It was a dream; we had to wake from it eventually.
We went around the world, riding the ships,
As if they were horses.

I wish I had collected tea towels
At least then I've had something useful to
Remind me of all the places I might never get to
Go back to.

You know that I don't need the world
To be anymore complicated than it already is.
After the things that we have been through,
I'm just amazed that we still exist.
