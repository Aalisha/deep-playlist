Cheers to the day I'm on my way
I'm living inside with the words you say
Its killing me
How youre always bringing me down
So put to rest this breath that I cant forget
These marks just left on the side of his neck
Its killing me now
Youre always bringing me down

You never learn to expect the worst
It always takes just the slightest little turn
To open up your eyes
And though it seems like we're all you changed
Youll never learn cos youll always be the same
Predictable inside

The way you are
Its not your fault you knew that
The way we were
