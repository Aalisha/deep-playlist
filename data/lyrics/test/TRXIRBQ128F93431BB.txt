We run like it kills us to stay
If judge, I'd be nothing 'till the day that I stopped you
He's tried as these things might seem to anyone else
I wrote them down to document

My wealth is you
My wealth is you

Excessive city we can't afford to stay
But home to the same somehow safe now we can afford to leave
Transformation and tragedy needs conclusion
Our world marches to drums of death

You're my rest
Stories will sleep
