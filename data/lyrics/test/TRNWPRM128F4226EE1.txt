Drive boy dive boy
...
Dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy
She was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy
And tears boy
And all in your inner space boy
You had
hand girls boy
and steel boy
You had chemicals boy
I've grown so close to you
Boy and you just groan boy
She said come over come over

She smiled at you boy
...
Drive boy dive boy
...
Dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy
She was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy
And tears boy
And all in your inner space boy
You had
hand girls boy
and steel boy
You had chemicals boy

I've grown so close to you
