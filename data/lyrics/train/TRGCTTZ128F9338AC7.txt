Your best friend your best girl just made a big messy world
Cause arm in arm they left you feelin' blue
She set a trap you got caught you should've took her with a grain of salt
So have a little faith and love will come to you
So she's leavin' for somebody new
She's even got you believin' there's nothin' you can do
