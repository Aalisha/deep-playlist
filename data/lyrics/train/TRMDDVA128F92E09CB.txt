Say my name and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames

Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites, now

I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us
Can find happiness in misery

I said I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness in misery

Oh take a chance let your body get a tolerance
...
