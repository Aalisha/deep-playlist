"Stay"

Stay (x3)

Stay baby
Stay, come on darling now
Stay, you know I want you back
Stay with me tonight
Come on won't you stay
Stay, oh
Stay
Stay with me

It seems I have the strangest dream
I'm dreaming that you are gonna leave me
I wake up and I find it's true
What will I do without you?
I don't know, I don't know
Just what it takes to get to you
I don't know, I don't know
Baby I'll be true if only you

Stay
Baby though I made you cry
Stay
Baby don't you say goodbye
Stay
Baby look me in my eye
