There was that girl I used to know
She'd tease me about my name
Fan the embers long enough
I sometimes catch her flame
The soothing voice of distance tells me
"That was just a fling"
Other music fills my ears
But I still hear her sing:
She sings:
Paddy Joe, say Paddy Joe
Don't you remember me?
How long ago one gorgeous night
We let the stars go
Paddy Joe, say Paddy Joe
