All right!
Come on, now!
Ooh, yeah!

Got it in me, I've got it in me,
Ain't gonna quit until it all comes out.
Gonna do it, ain't nothin' to it
Just shake my hips, throw my head back and shout...
Been a long education
But my homework is done.

I'm gonna rock the nation
Just-a wanna have fun, yeah!

Gonna shake it and I ain't gonna break it
I'm gonna show you what it's all about.
Got it in me, got it in me now,
...
