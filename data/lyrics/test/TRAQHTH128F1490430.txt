Beside me now, are strangers to my eyes
It might be getting crazy, might be wise
Stranded either way
Such a lonely place
I'm looking out for you
Among the flies that wait in line
The days on end
The nights are cold
But always so intense

I try to reach the top most every day
And hope I turn my face up to the sky
And the cover hangs so low
I see no sign of light
...
