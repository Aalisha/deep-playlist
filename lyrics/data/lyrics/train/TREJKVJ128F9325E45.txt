If they could see me now, Booming and Zooming
If they could see me now, Booming and Zooming

F104, come in F104...
C'mon get down F104.
Ho, get back up F104!
Aw, now, one more time for me
On the ground F1--104 get down.

'Cause you know and I know it's a private thing
At twice the speed of
sound blue goes to black.

You're spinning flat like a skipping stone F104
But don't green apple,
ok. We want no defenstrations today, okay?

F104 where are you at? Play it Kenneth!
Uh! You think you're staying cool while its getting hot, eh?

F104 here, uh, stop flapping your gums.
I wear my own clothes now
and I don't need you to roll up my sleeves, ok?

Uh ground here, uh, that's a couple of million, F104.

F104 here, uh, look this is a private thing
and I don't want you talking about it
down there with your nice friends.
