I jumped straight off that trail today
Ain't nobody better get in my way no
Trail dust, sore butt, gotta get out of this 10 day rut

Whoa, gitty up and go
I'm a redneck punk
Mean, red, better off dead
I'm a redneck punk, yeah

Staring down the barrel of an old shotgun
Don't you step on my toes
And you want find yourself with a bloody nose
