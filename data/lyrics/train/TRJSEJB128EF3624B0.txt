As I walk through the valley of one eighty-seven land
No matter what state, what city, what town
I can see there's no place to run, no place to hide
I could be in the crosshairs of somebody, somewhere
I wanna ask why...
But I ain't got time for that
I gotta keep movin on
Or be the next one to die
I walk through the valley of no-man's land
Sayin peace, slappin fives and holdin up those two fingers
To the many nine millimeter automatic pistol toting young men
that roam everywhere
...
