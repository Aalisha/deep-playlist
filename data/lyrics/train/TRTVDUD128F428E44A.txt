Open your eyes and stretch your hands,
This house is clean but it is not my home,
Did i make this bed, do two hands touch on two?

Sometimes I think of someplace colder,
The sound of traffic and the way it's warm,
When you feel yourself grow up inside of you

And you love me just like a stranger,
...
