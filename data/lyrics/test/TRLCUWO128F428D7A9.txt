Something's wrong, doctor please
Got a strange heart disease
And I desperately need to get over
This temptation

There she stands day by day
And my life turns away
It was love at the first sight
And I know this won't come easy

Couldn't move, I was petrified
Couldn't talk, when she passed me by
Now she's constantly part
In my thoughts, in my heart
Can't hold another day
