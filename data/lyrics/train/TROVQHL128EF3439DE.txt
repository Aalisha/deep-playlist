We're [Incomprehensible]

We are smashed men, still moving
We tried everything in the book
No stranger to failure
Death with a steady heartbeat

Scratching into any surface it wants
Joy and beauty rejected so many times
A world of hurt, a heart of false hope

And while we thought
That we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends
