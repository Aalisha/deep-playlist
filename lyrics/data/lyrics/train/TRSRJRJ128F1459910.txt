I could feel from miles away
the time you spent and the games you played
in his eyes and his name upon your tongue
but I kept walking
Through the pain and the desert sand
through the night as you took his hand
I found a way to remind you how it was
to remind you how it was

So long ago
so long ago
yeah

Let's walk away from the valley
there's no life in here anymore
let's pack our hopes and our dreams away
and just walk through that door

Now we're marching miles until the sky will rest
until we're free, and we're safe unless
you turn around to see it all fall
no we can't look back

She said "I know"
I know
she said I know
I know
she said I know
she said I know
she said I know
that we can't look back
...
