Well, I know it
It's a shame
A shame I can't show it

And I see it
I can see it now
But I'm so far below it

Don't wanna
Don't wanna talk about it
I say why not?
Don't wanna think about it
I say there's got to be
Some good reason
For your little black backpack
Up smack, turn around
He's on his back

And I don't wanna tango with you
I'd rather tangle with him
I think I'm gonna bash his head in
This shouldn't concern you except
That just don't expect to get
Your bloody black backpack back

And I can feel you
Yes, I can
