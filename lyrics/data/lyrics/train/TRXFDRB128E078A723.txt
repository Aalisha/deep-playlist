I know you
So better than the city in the rear view
I drive to
Eliminate the ball that I'm chained to

Take me, break me
Every mile further, there's a part of me that slips away
One day you’ll see
Even if you got down on your knees, you couldn’t make me stay

Drive all night
Never gonna get me
Night by night
To get away from it all

Fight, fight, fight
All you wanna do is hurt me
You wrecked my life
So I’m gonna have to drive all night

I'll stay strong
I’m pushing on the pedal 'til I break dawn
So I’m gone
...
