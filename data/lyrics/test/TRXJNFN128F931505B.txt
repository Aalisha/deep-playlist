Turn me off and turn me on with your haggard conditions
In your copy/paste world of compelling renditions
Salt in this wound
Season this scar for tomorrow

So I close my eyes in this lucid time
Send my prayer for life
Imperfections

So turn me off and turn me on with your haggard conditions
In your copy/paste world of compelling renditions
Salt in this wound
Season this scar for tomorrow (2x)
