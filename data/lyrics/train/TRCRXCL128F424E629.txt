Drink up and pay and it's time to move on
This place is dying and they've turned the lights on
Nobody wants to hear the ravings of a bad drunk
They're afraid he'll speak their minds and say

That you'll find yourself alone
No matter who lives in your home
You better find yourself alone

My life's a car wreck on the side of the road
Say nothing but you can't turn away
Not a pleasant subject, so I don't blame you for turning away
...
