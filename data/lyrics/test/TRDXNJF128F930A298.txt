Lady, please tell me
How you really feel
Deep inside your heart?
I hope that it's for real
I feel lonely
Do you wish that I was there?
There right by your side
Showing you I care

College Girl
Won't you come over tonight
I want to make love to you
College Girl
I can make it feel alright

Lately I've been thinkin'
'Bout how we use to be
Something about your love
That makes my life complete
...
