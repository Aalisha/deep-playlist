I've never seen the inside of a barroom
Or listened to a jukebox all night long
But I see these are the things that bring you pleasure
So I'm gonna make some changes in our home

I've heard it said, "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em"
So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy
...
