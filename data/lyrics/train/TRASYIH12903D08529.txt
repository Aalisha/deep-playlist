she's seductive, but she does it well
she'll charge you by the hour
for a straight trip down to hell
she'll correct you, when you think you know
she's gonna let me go, she's gonna let me go

I'm not a lover, but I'm still concerned
That when you touch the fire
That your heart could still be burned
I should warn you that I know
she's gonna let me go, she's gonna let me go

see all those familiar faces
crowded in my mind
I know that now is not the time
