home town Hamilton quiet place want to leave good friends good times my old car singing beach campsite river woods swilly night caught police, can't leave, can't change, can't stop, another week, 
gotta stay I gotta stay right here and now gotta stay stuck right in my town gotta stay this place was great back then for me gotta stay it's not exactly where I wanna be, 

when your life's built like a cell you can't find a way out 
when your life's built like a cell stuck inside my whole life 
when your life's built like a cell you can't find a way out 
when your life's built like a cell stuck inside my whole life 

we can't be caught, we can't be caught we can't be caught, no 
we can't be caught in a four wall way of life
