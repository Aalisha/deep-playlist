Tearing out all these open pages,
Women and kids of all ages,
Millions of men with blank faces,
Italicised lies, headlines, bold type

Living lost just like deer in headlights,
Terrified, blind, and wait to die,
I wonder when they'll come get me,
I wonder when they'll come get me:

We want to, have to, need to:
And we'll tell you when their hungry again,
And we'll tell you when their hungry again,
