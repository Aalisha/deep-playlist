Bones grinding, churning, ripping flesh
Unleashing horrid fantasies
Frail sickening victims fresh

Awaiting the executioner
Defaced, skull smashed with a mallet
Larynx torn out with a hook

Body suspension, blood red angel
Dye the pavement crimson
Limbs ripped apart with precision

Carving symbols in the skin
Boiled and crushed through clockwork
Intestines removed from within
Brainwashed in acid

Aim for the torso and then I shoot
Ribs made into wings
...
