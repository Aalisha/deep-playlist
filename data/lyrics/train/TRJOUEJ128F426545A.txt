Taste the fruit of life
Don't stop yourself to wonder why
(Oooohhh) Fruit of life
Taste the fruit of life
Don't stop yourself to wonder why
(Oooohhh) Fruit of life
Something in your eyes
Makes the water (?)
And the leafs fall from the trees
It happens everytime
Love so warm & gentle
Sailing smooth across the sea
Hold fast to this feeling
Never take the chance & let love go
(No no babe)
Here for you & willing
I wanna know your way
Let's take it nice & slow
Taste the fruit of life
Don't stop yourself to wonder why
I'll be here to help you choose your flavor of love
(Fruit of life)
Taste the fruit of life
Don't stop yourself to wonder why
Makin' it your everything you always dreamed of
(Fruit of life)
Keeper of my dreams
Like the moonlight dancin'
Silver rays across the skies
Such a special thing
