There is the need for speed
Everything that exceeds
The point of no return
And this one's gonna hurt
All set before your eyes
A human sacrifice
It's time to clear the ramp
Who wants to take a chance

So let's roll
All night long

I like the smell of fuel
I got myself a bruise
The only time it's real
It's when I shift the gears
A few in every town
The death defying clowns
Gather with all their rigs
