clockwork is usually the way good things work
but if your someone like me then clockwork is worst
so someone please tell me im doing no wrong
and someone please tell me we didn't write this song

[Chorus]
now i can't even tell
i can't even tell
the difference between
you her friend and her

so take me home tonight (take me home tonight)
take me home tonight (take me home tonight)
take me as far away from her (yeah!)

and i do use the memories of us
but i use them more, more like a drug
...
