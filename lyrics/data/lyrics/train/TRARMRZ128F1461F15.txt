She's got wings that shine so bright
They keep her up most every night
Burning the candle at both ends
Livin' a lie up with all her friends

Only heaven only knows what's up her sleeve
She flies too fast and she dips too deep

She's an angel, too high to come down
She's an angel on the wrong side of town
The lights go dim on her long golden hair
She's an angel, an angel without a prayer

She wears a smile just like a clown
She never seems to touch the ground
The stars in her eyes keep her amused
She keeps getting further from the truth
