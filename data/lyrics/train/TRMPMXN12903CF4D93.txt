[E.S.G.]
One-two, they coming for you
Three-fo', better lock your do'
Five-six, they wanna take your bricks
Seven-eight, cause they know you got weight
Nine-ten, new Benz blue lens
Elev'-twelve, got FED's on the trail
13's-14's, that's was SS crawl
15's-16's, juvenile hoggs
17-18, ounzes is a half
Unless them boys, done water whipping on your ass
19's-20's, cut your whole click up
21-22's, on the Escalade pick-up

[Hook - 2x]
One, life is all that I got
Two, glocks to pop when shit's hot
Three, initials in my name
