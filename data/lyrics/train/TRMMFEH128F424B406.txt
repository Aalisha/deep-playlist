The Exies
Miscellaneous
1970

And all the people are afraid
Cause Ali's got a punch they say
That'll knock you down, knock you down
Sly's got a family stone *
And all the cats groove along
To the melody, to the funky beat
And while they don't remember
Well it's always clear
In their 1970 box of dreams
They're crashing cars and calling out the crazies
To set them free
