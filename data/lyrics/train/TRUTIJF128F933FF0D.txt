Burning bush, burning rubber, burning thighs,
Ooh, I’ve got a crush on you.

Skull and bones, rock and roll, magpie,
Ooh, I’ve got a crush on you.

Fritz Lang, laser eyes, freedom fries,
Ooh, I’ve got a crush on you.

Joan of Ark, redwood bark, Cutty Sark,
Ooh, I’ve got a crush on you.

Isis, bite your tongue, whirlpool,
Ooh, I’ve got a crush on you.

Vampire, snake eyes, snake face,
Ooh, I’ve got a crush on you.
