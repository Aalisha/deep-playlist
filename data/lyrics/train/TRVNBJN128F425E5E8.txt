You know the fellas good
you know the fellas good for the moolah
you know the fellas good for the moolah
you know the fellas good
If everybody looked the same
we'd get tired looking at each other
You know the fellas good for the moolah
you know
you know the fellas good
If everybody looked the same
we'd get tired looking at each other
You know the fellas good for the moolah
you know
you know the fellas good

you know the fellas go for the moolah
you know the fellas go
Everybody look
everybody look
everybody look
everybody look
everybody look
