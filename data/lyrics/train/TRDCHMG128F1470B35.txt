Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burnin'

To my surprise, yes
One hundred stories high
People gettin' loose y'all
Gettin' down on the roof, do you hear?
The folks was flaming

Out of control
It was so entertainin'
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno

Burn baby burn, burn that mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn that mother down
Burnin'
