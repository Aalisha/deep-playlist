Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said your mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been called cold before

As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then a flip in your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you have left and it was going to waste

Your past-times, consisted of the strange

And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
Crying lightning

And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons
...
