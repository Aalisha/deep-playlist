(Ice Cube)

Check it hoe shut your mouth and get naked
I'm connected plus I'm makin' hit records
So, if you wanna win hop in and take a spin
That's W.C. and Mack 10
What's your name girlfriend
You can have some fun wit us lay in the sun wit us
Pack a gun wit us and make a run wit us
To these illegal amigos who wanna buy bald eagles
out my regals we shoppin' at Spiegels
So what you wanna do
Decision, decisions
And what you think about dick and pussy collisions
You're a irrisistable bitch and all that
Me I'm rich as fuck plus I smell like yack so come on

Chorus, Repeat 2X:

Irristable bitch let's go
Where we goin'
Westward ho

(Mack 10:)

A nigga gots to get chose it's a house full of hoes
I suppose at least one of those want
Mister flossy with the kilos
You know it's quick fast shit it's all about the cash
Pauveted Rolex' and Benz' in the S class
Don't get it twisted nigga you know the word
Cube got the herb and I don't fuck with nothin' less than a bird
I make yo whole crew scatter what ya say don't matter
cause nigga you's a punk so tell yo bitch I need to holler at her
I take fo shows hop in my Benzo
I stomp my Chuck to the flo as I head Westward with yo ho
It's Mack 1-0 so fuck what she say
I put it down the G way
I'm gettin' head on the freeway.
