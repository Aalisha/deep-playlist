Catch you

You create misery
Have your cake and eat it

Take your place in history
And pray we don't repeat it

Call it fate, call it back[break]Call it off, don't call me later[break]
Lay your head in your bed
It's just how you made it

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
