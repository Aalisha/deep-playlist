Grown from a seed of hope
I've never known
Been raised by the surroundings
Of a home so cold, so cold
If I only knew what I know

I'll shake my fist up to the sky
Just keeping my dreams alive
I'm one part saint and two part sinner
And the last part is still on the line

We pray even when we know nobody cares, ah ya
And make everything we know turn into fear
...
