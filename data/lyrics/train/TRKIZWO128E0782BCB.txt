I'm shaking like a leaf on a tree
Do you understand? Will you come with me?
Don't make a sound, don't even breathe
They'll understand, why don't we leave?

We can steal a ride on a bus
Drive down a road, all covered in dust
Head north by north west, till we reach the coast
We'll find an address that don't get the post

When she's gone
Even though she won't be long
It just tears my world apart
Puts a hole right through my heart

She let me see her new tattoo
It was my name, written in blue
