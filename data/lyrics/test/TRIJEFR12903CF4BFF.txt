Seven days, seven days
(Seven days, seven days)
And there's not a word from you
(And there's no word from you)

Seven days without love
(Seven days without love)
Tell me what am I to do
(Tell me what I'm to do)

Seven days I have cried
(Seven days I have cried)
How I long to feel your touch
(How I yearn for your touch)

Why'd you go, why'd you stray
...
