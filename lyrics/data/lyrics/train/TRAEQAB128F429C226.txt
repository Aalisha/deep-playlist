Oh, oh. op-bo, bo, bo-bo-bo!
Oh, oh. op-bo, bo, bo-bo-bo!
Yes, me friend, me friend,
Them set me free again
Yes, me friend, me friend,
Me deh 'pon street again

The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me now
They try to keep me down,
But God put me around

Yes, I've been accused,
Wrongly abused, now
But through the powers of the Most-'Igh,
They've got to turn me loose... Mm!

(Brrr) Don't try (brrr)
To cold me up (brrr)
...
