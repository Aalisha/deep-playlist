Yeah, here comes Amos

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun
He lived by himself in the swamp
He hunted alligators for a livin
He just knock em in the head with a stump
The Louisiana law gonna get ya Amos
It ain't legal hunting alligators down in the swamp, boy

Now everybody blamed his old man
For makin' him mean as a snake
When Amos Moses was a boy
His daddy would use him for alligator bait
Tie a rope around his waist, and throw him in the swamp
...
