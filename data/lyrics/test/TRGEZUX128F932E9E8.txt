There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be
Lived with you
Lived with you

There's a way
Everybody said
To do each and every little thing
But what good does it bring
If I ain't got you
Ain't got you

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
