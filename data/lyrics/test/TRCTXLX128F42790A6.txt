The wall has fallen down tonight
I can't believe this dream
Tears of joy - everywhere
We celebrate this day
I hope we'll always be free
I pray on my knees

Paper ships sailing
Just as a sign
To show the world now
There's no borderline

Ships are sailing 'cross the water
All the white lights shining bright
...
