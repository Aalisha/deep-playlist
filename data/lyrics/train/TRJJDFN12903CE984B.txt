Well well well well
let's get together and go for a walk in the park
and while we're walking we can steal a little kiss in the dark
i wanna walk with you (i wanna walk with you)
i wanna talk with you (i wanna talk with you)
but it's up you to say "come on baby"
if you don't hurry up i'll go crazy
'cause a walk in the park all alone is just no fun
Chorus:
