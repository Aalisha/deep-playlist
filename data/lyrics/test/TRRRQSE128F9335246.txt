I don't give a hell what you spit
 (This is)
Who you are, where you from
 (This is projects)
I don't give a hell what you spit
 (Urban wolves)
Who you are, where you from
And who the hell you be gettin'
 (Dream team baby)

I don't give a hell what you spit
 (The sosa of the game has returned)
Who you are, where you from
(Brooklyn)
I don't give a hell what you spit
 (Black sopranos)
Who you are, where you from
(Let's play)
And who the hell you be gettin'

Nice and smooth, white knights, icy jewels
So cool, but the slightest shit ignite my fuels
Love it low, stay in mine, attach semi
'Cuz its hard to enter rap just passin' by
XK8, it's all good, the next they hate
Was never the type of nigga that flexed his weight
See, frontin' just ain't my forte, I'm all foreplay
Hoppin' out the Porsche, drop products on graves

My slow grind story niggas cosign for me
Y'all slouch rappin' fake trash niggas' rhymes bore me
Adore me, respect niggas way before me
Since a shorty, in love with big guns and orgies
Engaged to it, guzzlin' that beige fluid
Spazzin' like its the music that made me do it
Move through it if you that thorough, I'm certified
Through the grapevine, I know that niggas heard I'm live
