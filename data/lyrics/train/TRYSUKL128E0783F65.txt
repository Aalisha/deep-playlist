Here I go again
Through the backstreets of my mind
It seems my love was standing still
Oh, I'm sorry now, it's funny how I didn't know it

Here we go again
Finding things we never will
It seems our love was standing still
I'm sorry now it's funny how
I don't feel the love
I just hear the words

Julia says
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't seem to care at all
Open your eyes and see
Love hurts
