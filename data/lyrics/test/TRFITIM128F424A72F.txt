Taking life for itself
You call yourself a man
Declare it as a sin
Who are you to judge
Can't stand alone behind your own words

We made you as a coward
We blame you, you loser
We name you as a coward
So you deserve to fly away

We have seen so many fail
Trying to change people for better
Evolved to minus side
And the number is growing
