You fought with bravery
You won some of the battles you commanded
But still you won't concede
You tried to knock us down but we're still standing
The war you waged with me
Our oldest enemy

When it all plays out
And you know you know you love me
And you won't lay down
Then it's better just to let it be
There's nowhere you could hide I wouldn't find you
There's nowhere left to go
But you and I
Oh
