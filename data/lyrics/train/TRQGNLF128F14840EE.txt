Now the sun was in my eyes
So forgive me if I was blind
But I can suddenly see the light
Now the blinds are raised,
Now he's finally spoken
Winter's finally broken
Realise I'm heading for colder days

He can feel it just around the corner
He can feel it on every breath
And something tells him its good goodbye summer
And something tells him, its the kiss of death

Losing at the tracks, loosens all his taps, I smell winter on his breath
(I smell winter)
Theres a chill down my spine, but the weather's fine, I smell winter on his breath
(I smell winter)
