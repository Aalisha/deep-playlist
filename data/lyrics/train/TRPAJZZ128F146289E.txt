I'm gonna do it right girl
I'm gonna hold you tight girl
Till then, I gonna wait, anticipate that day
I'm waiting for the right time, when you'll be mine
You say that you love me, I'm still gonna say

Girl you are the reason I wait
And when comes the season I know
I'm gonna give you the best girl
You tug on the strings of my heart
Sometimes I could break them apart
But if you wait till later, it'll be better

I'm gonna honour your body anyway I can now baby
'Cause we belong to somebody and that someone is G.O.D
