Well I never was one to believe
I thought love was a fantasy
But Honey you made a believer in me
Now I know it's true
Now they say that this will last forever
Just as long as we stay together
So now we can see just what love means to me and to you

Well I tried to find the answer in the 'Book of Love'
But that didn't give me a clue
What I found a definition it wasn't anyone
It was you
Yeah

Well I never knew the meaning of love
Now I just can't get enough
And I never knew the meaning of love
'Till I met you
I never knew the meaning of love
