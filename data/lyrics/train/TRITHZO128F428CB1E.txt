See and observe, written in these words, sick and absurd
Don't waste your breath on me
Jealous and fake, spineless and wormlike, I wish you death
Rot should the flesh that's weak
Why are you making me hate? Constantly feel hate, you are the seed
Waste is the fruit you bring
Your life should be taken in vain, endlessly feel pain
Bleed all you bleed, hide from the eyes of hate

Spending time judging others, what are you?
Sick hearted, ill-minded
Self content, you insult me in your words

Backstabbing, ass kisser
Leech-like, lap dog, puppet, parasitic
Boastful, selfish, cocky, egotistic
...
