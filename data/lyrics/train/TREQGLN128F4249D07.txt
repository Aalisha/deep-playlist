Chorus:
Turn on the action, (Come on and give me your love)
I'm runnin' hot, baby, give me the
Love inside. (Gotta keep it hot, give it all you got)

Feed me your passion, (Come on and make it alright)
Don't waste no time,
Baby show me a dream tonight (Cotta keep me satisfied)
Don't hold it back,
Let your love flow through me
I need to feel you in my soul
Like it used to be
Won't you do it to me
Give me the moments that make me lose control
Got to put back the feeling we knew once before,
...
