I've waited this moment
To look in your eyes
Put my hands on your sweet neck
And squeeze out the life
Living without you
I paid quite a price
But to live without the torment
Of your cheating and lies

Living life without your love
Is a life without your pain
Livin life in the numbness
Of a prison yard chain.

If she wore a scarlett letter
I could let her live on
But not in this house
