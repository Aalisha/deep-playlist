I remember it well, the first time that I saw
Your head 'round the door 'cause mine stopped working
I remember it well, there was wet in your hair
I was stood in the stair and time stopped moving

I want you here, tonight I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
I want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down

I remember it well, taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform and my ships were sailing
I remember it well, I was stood in your line
And your mouth, your mouth, your mind
