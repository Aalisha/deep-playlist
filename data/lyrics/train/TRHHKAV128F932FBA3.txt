I was about to give up and that's no lie
Cardinal landed outside my window, threw his head back
Sang a song so beautiful, it made me cry
Took me back to a childhood tree, full of birds and dreams

From this one place I can't see very far
In this one moment I'm square in the dark
These are the things I will trust in my heart
You can see something else, something else

I don't know what's making me so afraid
