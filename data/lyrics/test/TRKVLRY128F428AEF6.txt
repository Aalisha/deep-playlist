The sign says Do Not Touch. You're out of bounds.
You're forbidden fruit, don't come around.
It says Don't Make Plans, 'cause on your hand
is a promise made to another man.
'Cause when you're around, my defences go down.
Feelin's get stronger, looks get longer.
The closer you come, the weaker I get.
If it ain't happened now, it just ain't happened yet, so

(Chorus)
Please, please, please go.
I'm not strong enough to say no.
