Tonight I'm lying here without you
It feels like hell baby without your love, your love
And I'm no good 'less I'm around you
Like you can't tell baby, you're all I want, I want

I get up and I pick up the phone and
Then I dial your number praying that you ain't gone
Every day I seem to lose a little bit of my mind
I wanna let you go boy but I

Ain't got no remedies baby, it's all 'bout you and me baby
I feel up, I feel down I feel all together emotional
Ain't got no remedies baby, I got it bad you see baby
I go in, I go out, I get all together emotional

My heart can barely beat without you
What is this spell baby, you've got me on, me on, me on
Can't make no sense of things without you
