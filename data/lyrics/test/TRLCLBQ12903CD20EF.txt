Hello, hello, yes may I speak to Juanne
Oh no this is not Yolanda darling
You may not know who I am
But the name is Shirley 
Miss Brown to you
You see I am the originator of the message
You're trying to bring
And I wanna tell you and Yolanda 
A thing or two about my man
You see ain't no need for you girls
Sweating each other about somebody that don't belong
To either one of you
You see he's still mine
Always has been, always will be
Until the end of time
Yeah I heard you bragging about that beat up Volkswagon
I saw you riding in
Girl please, I'm pushing a Mercedes Benz
And I heard you talking about the little stuff you know what he likes
And the food he eats
I don't think so darling 
You see because I give my man
A full course meal every night
Something to fill him up and satisfy his appetite
And I can see why you and Yolanda ain't got no man
Y'all too busy playing star 6 9 games
And it really don't make much difference
How you takin this
I just want you to remember one thing
Woman to woman 
You ain't woman enough to take my man
Now you check this out
