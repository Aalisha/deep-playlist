Pimp In Me

Yo, what's up baby?
I can't even believe I'm bout to tell you this.
But it's like every since I've been with you things you
know, just been changing.
Parts of me have been dying.
I just wanna tell you about it.

Lately I feel like I've been slippin.
And it's you that got me trippin.
I can't control myself when I'm around you, oh.
With any other I would've been done.
Love to left the next one.
But I just can't shake you off.

Cuz you got it all girl.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The body of a call girl.
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
With a mind of a teacher.
(Yeah, yeah)
That's why I need ya.
(Yeah, yeah)
I gotta let you know.

[Chorus]
Girl, the pimp in me just died.
(Died)
Died.
(Died)
Died.
When I look into your eyes.
(Eyes)
Your eyes.
(Eyes)
Your eyes.
(You don't know how hard I tried)
Mature you.
