You take my self, you take my
You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control

I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow,
so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes

I, I live among the creatures of the night
...
