I am words, I am speaking
I never heard my conclusion
Lost the way in my confusion, in illusion
Lost inside the picture frame

I'm not to blame, I didn't see the black flame
I'm not ashamed, its poetry, the black flame
I'm rearranged, it's changing me, the black flame
Burns my blackened brain


I am strong, I am leaving
I never knew I'd feel the need so
