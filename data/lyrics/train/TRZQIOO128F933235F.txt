Sign me up I volunteer.
Votes are in for lifeguard of the year.
Her feline past lives are plain.
Their singularities are shown in this life again.

Like mamma said,
"Don't you let it go to your head
when you know you're being fed."
I'm so proud to know you.

Lizzy I'll write, I'll sing,
telegraph, telegram, telephone, tellin' you
I'll be home soon. Dienu.
