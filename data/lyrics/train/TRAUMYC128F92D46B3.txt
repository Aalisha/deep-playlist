I thought I'd win them all with words
I'd say a smooth little line to win the room every time
And they'd be moved by what they heard
My tongue as empty as my heart
It's not enough to play the part
O Jesus give me more than words

We pass out paper facts all week but they won't come around
We can debate theology but they won't come around
Apologetic reasoning, but they won't come around, come around
There's only one way they'll come and it's love

I am a one man marching band
