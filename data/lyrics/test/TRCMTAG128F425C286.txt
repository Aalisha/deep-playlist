I walk like you guide me, my eyes
Are shut like I'm blind
Turn to you and listening and tryin'
To be in your mind
There's a feeling that I get
When I look to the west
'Bout having all the answers
Still failing the test

Wolf packs and convoys and
Captains and men
Surprised in translation
World without end
Welcome back to real life
The picture is gone
Put a contract out on things that go on and on
How do you stay where
You most want to be?
