Let me breathe

I can't even think right now
Something's got me feeling guilty
Hurt you slowly but so surely
I don't know why
Love you so much
I can't feel because I'm lost
Not too much matters no more
Is it you
Is it me
Is it us or is it trust
Or is it trust

Push you into what I want
Because I am so goddamn selfish
Left you hanging
Stopped relating
I don't know why
Love you so much
