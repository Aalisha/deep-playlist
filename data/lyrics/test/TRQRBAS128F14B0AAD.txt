she's diving down
gonna make her home now
the ocean
she's done with living her life
on the ground
she's sinking down
hands above her
held her
nineteen years
and now they're letting go
tomorrow will be 'round
and everyone will see
no tragedy
it's like it's over
but it's just begun

she's going off
the deep end
breaking from the crowd
...
