Everybody in love,
go on put your hands up,
Everybody in love,
go on put your hands up,
Everybody in love,
go on put your hands up,
If you're in love,
put your hands up,

You know you need someone,
When the needs so strong,
When theyre gone you dont know how to go on,
So the whole world is stuck in a moment,
Standing still until they come back,
You accept that they've,
got things to do,
But sometimes in the end t
theres nothing left for you,
If hurt is missing your baby,
Ive done too much of it lately,

Every minutes like an hour,
Every hours like a day,
Every day lasts forever,
But what else am i gonna do,
Id wait forever and a day for you,
I wait up, wait up,
I cant eat, I cant sleep,
what else could it be?
