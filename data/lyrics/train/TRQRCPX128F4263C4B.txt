Sister, sister you don't have to cry
Everything will be alright
My sister you don't have to weep
'Cuz things are getting better

Sister you don't have to cry
Everything will be alright
My sister you don't have to weep
'Cuz things are getting better

A mother worries about the son she raised alone
'Cuz he is flirting with danger and it's getting close
But he won't listen she prays to God
And asks him would you please protect him but she is not alone

A young girl's lying about the weight she's gaining
Because she is hiding a baby that her boyfriend says
He didn't father he said he was in love
But now he can't be bothered
But keep your head up high little sister

Sister you don't have to cry
Everything will be alright
My sister you don't have to weep
'Cuz things are getting better
