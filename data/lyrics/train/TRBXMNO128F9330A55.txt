Under your spell 
Haunted by your face 
Tattooed an image 
Of barbed-wire and lace 
and the deception 
Give me abrasion 
I want the real you 
I want the real you 
You had it commin', you had it commin' (oh) 
You had it commin' should be written on your headstone 
You had it commin', you had it commin' (oh) 
You had it commin' should be written on your headstone 
Your silhouette 
Up on the mantle
