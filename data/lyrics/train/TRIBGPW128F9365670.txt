You need someone to point your finger at
Well yeah, I'm your man, I'm everything you lack
Someone to kick around when I'm down
Maybe steal my credit where success is found

Yeah, one once might've had a hit
But that's yesterday's news, now no one gives a shit
In the void of my depression time
I fought my way back to a better life

But I'm so jaded, dreams faded
It's harder than you think
Loved, hated, frustrated
I'm the missing link
