Cast aside
Like shadows with no light
Oppressions won by thrust
Gone to past

An image of stone to never be undone
For there's an evil thorn stuck so far deep inside
Sacrificed
Crucified
Almost disappearing in the light

All the wicked kept in silence
Forever to remain unknown as hatred grows
Rising from the depths of saints
Alone in the darkness, with half a soul they're not forlorn
Serving the sane
...
