Lately I can't breathe
Waiting they're chasing me
No one listens but i'm ok with it

Only I wonder why
If only my hands weren't tied
The world's a blister
But I'm ok with it

(Don't touch me)
What if I was there
What if I was scared
I'm waiting for...
They're at my door
But I'll be back again

Lonely I'm wandering
...
