I'm sleeping my way out of this one
With anyone who will lie down
...
I'll be stuck fixated on one star

When the world is crashing down
...
I keep telling myself
I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds
I keep telling myself

I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
Sitting out dances on the wall
I'm trying to forget everything that isn't you,
I'm not going home alone
Cause I don't do too well
Sitting out dances on the wall
I'm trying to forget everything that isn't you,
...
