Merchant of death is on the loose and haunts you
He has stuck in his own hell and can't break through

And when the man standing still
His hands are swept but that was the deal

Truce concluded and the war farewelled
Most poisonous weapon is coming in
Travels in the bags, carried by the cross
Aid is the name of the game

All the people on this earth feel comfort
Yeah, we read like the devil reads the bible
