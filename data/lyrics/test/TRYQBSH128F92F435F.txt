My God, you fly thousands of miles to get some sun
And it's rainin' cats and dogs!
Typical tropical, I go on vacation and Mother Nature gives up on me
Yeah, what a lady

Thanks for at least sendin' it down pre-heated!
Doesn't seem to bother the natives, though
Back home it gets no one laughin', and here they even sing to it
Must be some voodoo rain chant or somethin', humph!
And it sure sounds familiar, oh well

I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again
I'm laughin' at clouds, so dark up above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love

Let the stormy clouds chase, everyone from the place
...
