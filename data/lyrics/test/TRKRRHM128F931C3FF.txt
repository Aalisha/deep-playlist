You don't have to be pretty
Just to be beautiful people
You don't have to be a star
Just as you are

Baby, you're beautiful people
Just be yourself and no one else
I love you for who you are

You may not get second looks
But in my book, my darling, you're a star
Oh, and I will always love you
And want you by my side, my love for you
