Yesterday
the sky looked sweet
when we dropped
a big bomb at our feet
and sometime soon
we all might zoom
to space and continue
with another zoo


Work and pace
for paper face
spend it wisely
and keep it safe
because the human race
is a non-stop race
with too many trials
but no real case


Something about this second
something about this hour
take away the money
...
