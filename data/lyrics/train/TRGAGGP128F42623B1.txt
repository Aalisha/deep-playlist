[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
We are gathered here today
To join
I see it, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I like this right here
Yeah, yeah
One-Two, One-Two, in the place to be
As you can see
I am the crush groovin'
There's a whole lot of stars be groovin' in here tonight
The record breaking and the record making
Yeah, yeah, turn this up

From the states to over seas
Every city in between I hit the scene
Catch fire like kerosene
Geting paid for more then a decade
We been blazing, y'all wasn't ready for the PD invasion
Caught you off guard, got bitches, got cars
Healin' war scars, puff smoke out of the jar
Catch flights to and fro, nigga who you know?
No one important, just another nigga flossing
Gotta seal, what I'm touching is real
You just a clone wit' a production deal
I sailed the seven seas and kept my head above the water
Sorry I left you, but now I am back for ya
But it's like we never bounced, platinum from word of mouth
