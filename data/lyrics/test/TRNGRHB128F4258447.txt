Hundred lashes
The battles are fought outside
Count your blessings
The war is in your head
Hundred lashes
Try to suffer less than learn
Count your blessings
I try to be fair with both

Hundred lashes
Walk proud to the pole
Count your blessings
The seconds are really short
Hundred lashes
Don't forget how to breathe
Count your blessings
