Every night now
He speaks to me
Vog Sothoth in my mind
Must not be unleashed
With every restless dawn
I'm getting weak
Open up and let me out
He whispers to me

Haunted at night in my dreams
Waking up to hear my screams
Clear my head must be strong
Still I feel him gain control

Insomnia wrack my brain
...
