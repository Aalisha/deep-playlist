You're breakin' my heart, I'm fallin' apart
You make me crazy, crazy
You're breakin' my heart, I don't wanna start
A new day, new day
I'm wreckin' my brain, I'm feelin' insane
You make me crazy, crazy
I'm changin' my ways, I'm leavin' today
But things look hazy, hazy
I can't express the words to tell you 'bout the feelings I got
Locked up inside
If only you would give me a reason why you're so uptight
What's on your mind?
Maybe we could make it one more time
Maybe we should try it again
