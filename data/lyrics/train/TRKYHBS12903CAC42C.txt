You were a dreamer
They always got you by
Don't forget them
Or one by one they'll die
You have to know the dark to know the light when she comes
Too sad to see that she had never go

[Chorus:]
Oh I know the fire is hot hot hot
Ruby stay on the line
Oh just give it all you got got got
Ruby stay on the line
Cause I warned my heart of your thirst for love
I know you're gonna be fine
