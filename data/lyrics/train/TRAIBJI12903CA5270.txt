(New Order)

Treat me like you do
Treat me like you do
Treat me like you do
Treat me like you do

How does it feel
To treat me like you do
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are

I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now how do I feel
