Set
set
set me free!
Flash backs hits me right between the eyes

The man just came and said to me: I want you by my side.
Something so excited but not without a doubt

He's locked the door and thrown the key
someone get me out.

I know he means no harm to me

but building walls confining me

Can only make me wanna leave - set me free!

Set me free
set me free
set me free
set me free

Set me free
