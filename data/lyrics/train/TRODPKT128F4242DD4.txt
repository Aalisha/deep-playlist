Turn left at the old hotel
I know this boulevard much too well
It hasn't changed since I've been gone
Oh this used to be my way home
They paved the road through the neighborhood
I guess the county finally fixed it good
It was gettin' rough
Someone finally complained enough
Fight the tears back with a smile
Stop and look for a little while
Oh it's plain to see the only thing missin' is me

CHORUS:
That's my house and that's my car
That's my dog in my backyard
