Mississippi Delta shining like a National guitar
Paul Simon wrote that song about Graceland
While driving in his car
Mark Cohn wrote that other one
It was a big hit, it made Mark Cohn real

I'm walking in Memphis, do I really feel the way I feel?
Well, look at me, Lord, I am at Graceland
On a Saturday afternoon
I threw up last night at a rest stop
From eating cheese grits at the Waffle House
I felt like hell then, I feel alright now
