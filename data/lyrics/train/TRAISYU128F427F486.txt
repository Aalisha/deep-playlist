Damn... I miss you
MMM... ooh

I toss and turn... it's so hard for me to sleep
I guess I'm no used to being alone... yeah
And I know it's because of me
And I'm trying to face this reality
Past relations they've made me into this man that I am
Knowing now that it's wrong
It's too late cuz she's gone

Gone... gone... gone
Don't think she's ever coming back
It's killing me
That I let her heart down completely
I should've gave her all of me
She's gone
Gone... gone... gone
She ain't even thinkin' 'bout me honestly
Being strong to carry on ain't easy
Gotta face it she's gone... gone
