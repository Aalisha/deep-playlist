Sometimes I feel like my heart is made of stone
And I'm really better off alone
I've played a lot of silly games
The kind that always end in pain
Sometimes I feel like I've been cursed
To be the one to say it first
Goodbye

It's hard to give my heart because I'm so afraid
That someday you'll see through my mascarade
Do i have a fate of love
Or is this some unwritten love
