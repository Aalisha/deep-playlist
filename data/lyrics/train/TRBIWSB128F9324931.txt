My mind pushes past conscious thought
Thinking, feeling, knowing past
Tell me, tell what am I?
This gate is closing way too fast

They say routine is how you live
I'm convinced it's how you die
Trapped in this hollow pensive
Gaining you the more you try

This cannot last
It will not last
This cannot last
It will not last
This cannot last
It will not last
...
