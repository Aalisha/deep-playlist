[chorus] You might be thinkin', thinkin'
Maybe, maybe I'm just like that girl
Oooh
And just because I'm with you doesn't mean that
I should be that girl
Ohhh
Ohh oh oh oh oh oh yeah [repeat]

I don't think you really know
What it is you want from me
Baby all you ever do is try and control something make-believe
So you buy me things you think I like
But nothing ever fits me right
Do you confuse me with somebody 'cuz
I'm just not that type

[pre-chorus]
She must've hurt you so bad
Can't seem to let her go
'Cuz even though you could be holding me
I know you would rather be with her
That girl must be amazing

No matter how many times I try and try to tell you
