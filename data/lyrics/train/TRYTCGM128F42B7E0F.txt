Nananana... nananana (4x)

Boil my head and crush my pretty bones
Nothing matters in the end
As good as dead
It's good to feel this dead

I don't wanna see you on the fence
Or sitting in the garden
Drinking from the watering can

I've had enough to last a life time
I'm never happy in the sunshine
I'll keep my hands upon the wheel, yeah yeah
Now things could get mad
