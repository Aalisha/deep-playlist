I am a lesson you've learned
I am a hope that is free
give yourself to me
I am all that you love
but just like the daughters of eve
you like bitter fruit from forbidden trees
and don't be scared I'm only trying
to help you
It's easy to get cut down to size when
your see-through
uninspired
I'm safely out of range
of all the games that you play
and I'm so sad
of everything you say
...
