I can’t hold back I gotta let it go
Held on for too long I gotta let it go
If I don’t find my way then I’ll never know
Who I am truly let the beat move me

Then I’ll go where it takes me
Releasing all the shit I’ve been holding in lately
At this rate see fam it’s bound to break me
Mess around and give new meaning to crazy
And lately I’ve been dwelling on this fact
Discovering new ways to keep my sanity in tact
I can’t get back to carefree living
Rent’s thirteen plus a month where we’re living
So kids right now is a scary vision
With my income support I’ll barely give them
Afraid at times but strength’s rarely missing
I crave to shine although every prison’s
A bit over-crowed they’ll make an exception
For a brother my size about my complexion
Hell no Cuz that’s out of the question
Though I’m often stressed and I fight with depression
I realized life is a lesson I don’t always
Like where I’m heading so I write with aggression
Hard to be polite when you’re stressing
