Across the town on the other hill,
your lights glow from a different world.
You always found a place to hide - nails and cross to lay beside;

and the wheel turns, and people change - scattered ashes to the wind.
And there's no pain, there's no pain, there's no pain
A dry river in the blazing sun . . .
