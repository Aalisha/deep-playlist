Around and round it goes
My head spins again
Attentions difficult
I'm out of my seat and then I'm climbing around the room
All thoughts invested in causing people doom
These are my symptoms...

My medication gives bad reactions
Off in my very own dimension
If I forget another thing you said
Your ass will soon be calling up a coroner
You'll become the first dead
From the Attention Deficit Destroyer!

What's that pill bottle that's in your hand?
