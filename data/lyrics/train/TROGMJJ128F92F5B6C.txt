I caught a ride on the
Dreamland express last night
I was sailing on an ocean of blue
And right there by my side
Much to my surprise, was you
I said come over here baby
Let me look in your eyes
Let me see the very heart of you

And I couldn't believe it
Or conceive
That my dream would come true
Cause you said, hey there
Sweet daddy
Everything is alright
You know for miles there's
Not a telephone line
There's not a soul to disturb us
...
