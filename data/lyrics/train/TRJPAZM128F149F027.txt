Last call at the hospital
You slept through it all
And these four walls warn you
That your surgery, it might not be the key
To fix the memory of you and me

Doctor I don't know what I've done
There's more to this than my
Ex-love and my ex-limbs could ever in my life begin to explain
Everytime I think of her and what went on that night
I don't see it, instead i hear it
A song so awful and so perfect

Last call at the hospital
You slept through it all
And these four walls warn you
That your surgery, it might not be the key
To fix the memory of you and me

Doctor I don't know what I'm gonna do
I need this song to be shouted out
And to be heard by everyone
Its like each word and every chord refuses to be ignored
