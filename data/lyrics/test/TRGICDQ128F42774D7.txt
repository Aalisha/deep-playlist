In cold blood
The pressure expands as my mind explodes
Thoughts control my actions, forced to bleed
Infected with life, I seek my cure from death
Gripping tighter on your neck
I realize you're drowning in your own blood
Drowning in your blood, I let go of your neck
Death came faster than I would expect
My emotions are expressed by your torture
