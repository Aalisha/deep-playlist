oooooooooh hey hey this goes out to...
you really do think that you can do anything that you wanna do
your protecting us from crime but 
whos protecting us from you yea

24hr patrol around the block 
never stops the drugs from comin in comin in 
yea it kind makes me wonder sometimes just whos really deliverin
always harassin me and askin me for my id but i aint done nothin so you aint seein nothin no 
packed me a bag of buddah but i aint the high school shootah
im sure you got bigger fish to fry

chorus
krooked kop leave me alone
go find someone else to
run your game on oh yea (thats my car)
