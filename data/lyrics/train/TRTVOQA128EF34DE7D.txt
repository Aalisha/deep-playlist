I know I made you cry with some of those crazy things I did
And lots of times you thought that I was acting like a kid
But I want you to know my love, that everything I did
I didn't do for myself, I did it all, I did it all for you
I may have said a lot of things you didn't understand
But all I ever tried to do was lend a helping hand
All I ever wanted darling, was to be your man
I thought you knew, I did it all, I did it all for you
