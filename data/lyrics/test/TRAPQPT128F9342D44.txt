She was wearing her favorite dress
She was waving a blue handkerchief
She was laughing aloud in the corner of the room
But she was dancing alone

Chorus

So I walked up to her, grabbed her arms to show the world
Tonight we'll dance like we're in love

She was standing beneath the chandelier
I offered her chocolate and some beer
She said no, I said why, she said no, I said why
And stayed dancing alone

Chorus

So I walked up to her, grabbed her arms to show the world
Tonight we'll dance like we're in love

I look down on her
She looks up at me
All I want is all her love
All I want is all her love

Chorus

Tonight we'll dance
Tonight we'll dance
Tonight we'll dance
All night long like we were in love STATIC ON CHANNEL 4
Moon and stars above us shine
Everybody knows you're mine
Static on the channel 4
Television radio, hold me close when you are cold
Now I've got to get us home, everybody knows you're stoned

Chorus

And when you hear me calling
You will turn away and see me standing there
Waving my old colors, lifting up my arms
And you will understand

Kiss me on the lips again
Millions are just tuning in
satellites begin to spin
Listen close and let me in

Chorus

And when you hear me calling
You will turn around and see me standing there
Waving my old colors, lifting up my arms
And you will understand

You will understand SUNLIGHT MAKES ME FEEL PARANOID
