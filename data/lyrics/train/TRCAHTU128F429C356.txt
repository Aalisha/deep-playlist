I'm steppin' out into the walk of life
Hold tight the vibe is right
Feel the heat that's in the air
People watchin' everywhere

Rush hour slow it down
Stop and listen to the summer sound
Playing in the park and street talkin'
London Town is walkin', walkin'

London Town is walkin'
I said it's really talkin' yeah
Steppin' in the walk of life
I said makin' out the walk of life
London Town I'm stalkin'
I said I'm really walkin' yeah

The sun goes down, and the lights come up
So we move on to a club
Surround yourself with the feel-good groove
