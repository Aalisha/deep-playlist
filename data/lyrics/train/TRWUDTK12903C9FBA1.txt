Things went wrong today
Bad news came my way
I woke up to find
A wire had blew my mind

Western Union man
Bad news in his hand
Knocking at my door
Selling me the score

Fifteen cents a word to read
A telegram I didn't need
Says she doesn't care no more
Think I'll throw it on the floor

Got your cable just to day
Killed my groove, I've got to say - ay

Western Union

duh-dit-duh-dit-duh, duh-dit-duh-dit-duh
duh-dit-duh-dit-duh, duh-dit-duh-dit-duh
duh-dit-duh-dit-duh, duh-dit-duh-dit-duh
duh-dit-duh-dit-duh, duh-dit-duh-dit-duh
