You can fool the landlord so you don't pay the rent
You can fool the world and become the President
You can fool all the people some of the time
You can make a million dollars
And cry "I don't have a lousy dime"
But you can't fool the blues
You can't fool the blues
When you re makin' all the rules it's so hard to lose
You can't fool the blues, oh no
