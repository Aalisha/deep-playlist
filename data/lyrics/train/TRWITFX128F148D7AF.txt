I can't believe what you're saying about me
I can't believe it's true
You know you never should doubt me
And take this attitude

You say there's something between us
Something just ain't right
But every time I ask you to tell me why
You say it's not the moment
You say it's not the moment

You say you're tired of walking on eggshells
And falling in between
That I'm two-timing you but you know quite well
That's just not my scene
