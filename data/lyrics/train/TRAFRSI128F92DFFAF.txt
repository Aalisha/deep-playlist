Take cover as the alarms starts to roar
Crawl beneath napalm threatening sphere
See the fear in their eyes
Hellbombers attack from the sky
Bombs exploding bursting flames
Armageddon reigns

Warheads - napalms to the core
God's children wish they've never been born

Like wolf among the sheeps
He guards you while you sleep
...
