We are not the images we see

I refuse to follow the fashion to its end, hypocrisy is killing me
On the rights of your wealth, I disagree
This puppet's culture scars our tongues with what's unsung
But we're not finished, we're not done

Illusions of their fucking progress are always fed to us
But innocence can rise again, redemption, a healing trust
From the depths of their false dreams, rebuilding, rebuilding
Nothing for their war, nothing anymore

Are we all guilty, are we all guilty?
The greed inside me waiting for our share
Are we all guilty, are we all guilty?
The greed inside me waiting for our share

Stand up now
Rebuilding
Nothing for their war
