I will find a way
To get to you someday
'Cause I, I'm so afraid, I'd fall
Now can't you hear me call

Shake some action's what I need
To make me bust out at full speed
And I am sure that's all you'll need
To make it alright

It's taking me so long
To get where I belong
Lord don't make me
Send it back that way
