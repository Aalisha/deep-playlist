Aw yeah, coming to you live and direct from the LBC
We have the one and only, Snoop D-O double G
Yeah, yeah, drop it

It's the one and only D-O double G
Big Snoop Dogg, it's the one and only
The one and only, D-O double-double-double G

Big Snoop Dogg
You in the presence of a motherfucking rap star
I push up laid back in a black car
Though I bossed up, it ain't hard to tell that

I came up hard as Hell, check it out
I stayed sharp and played my part
All I had was a mic, a dream and some heart
Me and my moms wasn't getting along at this time

And since pops was gone, I'm out grinding
Catch a nigga praying, swearing I ain't going back to jail
Judge about tired of a playa, I don't know about this bidness shit
But I'm good with this rapping, can I get a witness, what's happening

That's about the time, I put down the rocks
And got to working in the studio around the clock
For a small profit, but a whole lot of game
Man I'm famous, now it ain't the same

It's the one and only D-O double G
Do you want some of this
Top Dogg bite 'em all, yeah, I'm burning it up
Aw naw, Big Snoop Dogg
You tuned in to the number one
