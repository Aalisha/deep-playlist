Writing in the book of life, a chapter of insanity
And I keep runnin' away from yesterday
And with a hold of my heart, I recharge my mind
And see what I can find
What lies
Behind the sky
And if there is not only emptiness and pain
A future lies out there
I'm gonna grab it here, even
Sometimes the truth (sometimes the truth)
Cuts like a knife, but I've got 9 lives

Like a ship on the stormy sea, I've been drifting all the way from me
From my own fears and from serenity
...
