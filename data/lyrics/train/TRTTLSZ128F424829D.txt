Any day now, I will hear you say,
Good bye, my love.
And you'll be on your way.
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown.
Any day now, I'll be all alone.

Any day now, when your restless eyes meets someone new,
Oh, to my sad surprise,
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down.
