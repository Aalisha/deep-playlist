Marry me, John
Marry me, John I'll be so good to you
You won't realize I'm gone

Marry me, John
Marry me, John I'll be so sweet to you
You won't realize I'm gone
You won't realize I'm gone

Many people wanna make money, make love
Make friends, make peace with death
But most mainly want to win the game they came to win
They want to come out ahead
But you you're a rock with a heart like a socket I can plug into at will
