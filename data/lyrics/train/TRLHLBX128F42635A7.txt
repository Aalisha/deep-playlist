Verse 1
How can I explain this game?
Got me on the road everyday, to fill my name,
Me and my dreams of gettin the world crunk,
The hits bring bling, and do the ATL stomp, this thang real,
I got the gun chill, cranberry's and x pills,
Smokin on the best of the best,
When you see me you know i'm fresh,
In the black lambo, I aint ridin there hoe,
Probably roll my other up, tell them what, I don't give a fu**,
Prince's cut, round my neck, round my wrist, in my ear,
In my son ear, in his mama ear, crystal clear,
Listen hear, this fo all yall ni**az bitin' my flow,
Wanna come up in the game, I can't stand a mane actin like I don't know,
