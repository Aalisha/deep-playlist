They kept on coming down to this place
Cause I could see it in their eyes
They made the world a fucking disgrace
And everything burn cold

They kept on coming down to this place
Cause I could see it in their eyes
We took the world to heal the disgrace
Now everything burns fine

I'm talking about the ever changing
Winds of fame
I guess it just got cold in here
It comes full circle
No one ever changed our ways our
Little pill killed summer days
I guess it just got cold in here
It comes full circle

They kept on coming down to this place
Like they were running out of time
To make the world a fucking disgrace
And everything burn cold
...
