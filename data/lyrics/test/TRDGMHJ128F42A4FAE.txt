Somebody's filled with hate
His faith is all about a certain
Too busy thinkin' bout the pain
To bother checkin' why it's hurtin'

So come on make it right tonight
Gotta get in the light
Doesn't matter who you are
When you movin' up with Alcazar

This is the world we live in
(Ohh)
And these are the hands we're given
(Ohh)
Use them and let's start tryin'
(Ohh)
To make it a place worth livin' in
(Ohh)

This is the world we live in
(Ohh)
And these are the hands we're given
(Ohh)
Use them and let's start tryin'
(Ohh)
To make it a place worth livin' in
(Ohh)

When you're movin' up with Alcazar
