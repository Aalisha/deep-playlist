Maybe we're the lucky ones
'Cause we can choose to turn it off
Maybe we're the lonely ones
'Cause we decide to shield what's soft

I'm sure you'll learn to dance and drink and dream
but you might still feel lost 

And I see myself in you my friend
but I would break where you would bend
I'm calling on what you defend and tonight I won't hold back
...
