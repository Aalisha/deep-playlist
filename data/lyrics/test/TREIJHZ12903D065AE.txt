I'm making ugly faces while I'm sleeping in my tomb
Light myself on fire and I fly around the room
I just sing of drunken nonsense while your ears are to the wall
Saying something sparkle just to get you in the hall

Light myself on fire and I fly around the room
Light myself on fire and I fly around the room
Light myself on fire and I fly around the room
Light myself on fire and I fly around the room

But you can't blame me
'Cause I've been listening
