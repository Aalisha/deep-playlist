Everyone is crying out for peace, yes,
none is crying out for justice.

I don't want no peace,
I need equal rights and justice.
I need equal rights and justice.
I need equal rights and justice.
Got to get it! Equal rights and justice.

Everybody want to go to heaven
but nobody want to die.
Everybody want to go up to heaven
but none o' them, none o' them, want to die.

I don't want no peace,
I man need equal rights and justice.
I've got to get it! Equal rights and justice.
I really need it! Equal rights and justice.
