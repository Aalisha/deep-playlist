MacCormack-Manzanera

Well, they say that home is where the heart is
But you left, way back, and started roaming
For these streets that were so bright with promise
Mother's love is what you turned away from
Now you're trapped

Down in the City of Light
You'll go crazy
City of Light
City of Light

Blinds are drawn cross windows facing nowhere
In the day the darkness is complete
Close your eyes and try to cry away your nightmares
You just know the downtown city street
Where darkness reigns
