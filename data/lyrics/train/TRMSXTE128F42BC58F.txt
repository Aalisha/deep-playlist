Your hearts been broken, you don't wanna
open up to me
But can't you see
All that you're needing is someone to believe in you
And when you are no longer afraid
Darlin' I'll be just one word away

Say when, I'll be there by your side
For a day, for a year, for the rest of my life
I know you're not ready
But someday your heart's gonna mend
...
