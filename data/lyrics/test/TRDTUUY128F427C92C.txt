(Gerry Goffin, Carol King)

More than enough to last the whole night through
and it's all for you

In the midst of all my darkness baby
you know you came along to guide me
you took pity on a lonely man
when you said you'd stand beside me
I'll never forget you
for that you've done little girl
I'll never turn my back on you for anyone
'cause I've got

So much lovin'
I'm a natural man
So much lovin'
More than enough to last
a whole life through
...
