i'm living out of a bag
life comes and goes
but i did not know
no use thinking 'bout
what i never had
don't suck for me
because it's letting me free

i'm heading out across the sea
i want the land and you alone with me
so step behind the wheel we'll drive though the gloom
come sit down next to me and we'll try
breath in the fumes that we leave
if i open up the sky you push through the trees
i'm kicking up a storm because i do what i please
to be myself so please yourself
...
