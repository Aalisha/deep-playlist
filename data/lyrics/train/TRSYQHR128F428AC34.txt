It’s way past my curfew in an emcee circle
rhyme dispersal, the ones without rehearsal
and if Pops found me, I’d get smacked hard
by that tree branch from my own backyard
cause it was all about textbooks and grades with A’s
something hard to juggle as a hiphop slave
skating on pave, or lounging after school with my crew
writing tags on the bus, or finding ways to rock a shoe
paying dues no return no concern back then
like fat kids in lunch lines at shows packed in
for rhyme battles with ill punch lines at crunch time
by unknown emcees thinking why aren’t they signed?
then I’d pick up a pen and express
rhymes were nonsense but nonetheless were off my chest
while some thought I should stop wasting my breath
dent on confidence I put my pen to rest
so what’s left but getting high every day
rolling blunts with vegas, smoking profit away
Cypress Hill on play singing stoned is the way…
singing stoned is the way…

And its like that I’m telling ya
That’s the way it went down, down down
And it’s like that I’m telling ya yo the truth is out my story is found
And its like that I’m telling ya
That’s the way it went down, down down
And its like that I’m telling ya, yo the truth is out
