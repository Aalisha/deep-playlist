Oh yea
Oh yea
Oh no, no
Your mother told me that you
Don't live at home no more
Your mother told me that she don't like
The way I call you on the telephone
The old lady cursed the day that I was born
You never answer when I come by your door
Yet, leave me messages I cannot ignore
For a light dance, we took some heave steps my dear
You wear my trench coat in the rain and disappear
Does the forecast say?
Don't take me to the racetrack
Cause I don't want to place or show-ow
