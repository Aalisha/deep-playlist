Spirits! Spirits! Spirits!
Oh my African spirits
Looking over I
You guide and protect I
Oh my African Spirits
Beg you guide and protect I
I beg you protect I, InI

Out of the bones
Of InI forefathers
Ini Arise, I arise
Out of the chains
And fetters that bound I
Well, InI Arise InI Arise, I Arise
You're the same
That has been before
And you're the same
That shall be again
That shall be again
Again and Again

Oh my African Spirits
