Oh, black mama, what's the matter with you?
Said, if it ain't satisfactory, don't care what I do
Hey, mama, what's the matter with you?
Said, if it ain't satisfactory, baby, don't care what I do
You take a brownskin woman'll make a rabbit move to town
Say, but a jet-black woman'll make a mule kick his stable down
Oh, a brownskin woman will make a rabbit move to town
Oh, but a real black woman'll make a mule kick his stable down
Say, t'ain't no heaven, say, there ain't no burnin' hell
Say, where I'm going when I die, can't nobody tell
Oh, there ain't no heaven, now, there ain't no burnin' hell
Oh, where I'm going when I die, can't nobody tell
Well, my black mama's face shine like the sun
Oh, lipstick and powder sure won't help her none
My black mama's face shine like the sun
Oh, lipstick and powder, well, they sure won't help her none
Well, you see my milk cow, tell her to hurry home
I ain't had no milk cow since that cow been gone
If you see my milk cow, tell her to hurry home
