Oh baby, you know you feeling so sweet
And people say you got be be gentle but sweet
But I can't, I know what I want
I want you
And if you want to get by
Sometimes they say you got to gentle
And sometimes you know you got to be sly
But I want you
I don't want anything else
I don't want nothing else

Stick it up inside
[You got to be gentle]
And push it up
[You gotta to be sweet]
Baby
I'll stick it inside
[You got to be gentle]
Yeah, you know

Give been a thousand planets baby
And I left them all behind
Searched across the sky
'til I found you here
This world is ours
And you will help me, conquer all

Evololution is too slow
Evololution is too slow
Evololution is too old fashioned
