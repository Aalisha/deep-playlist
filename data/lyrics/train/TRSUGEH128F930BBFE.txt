Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never, never will I feel discouraged
'Cause our love's no mystery

Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly, yeah
I like the way ya make me feel about you, baby
Want the whole wide world to see

Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love
Whoa, whoa, you've got the best of my love

Goin' in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
...
