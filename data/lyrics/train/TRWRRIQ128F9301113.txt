Baby, Baby, Oh
Do you want to see me
Never really want to fight the feeling
And I like the colour of your eyes
Baby baby
Many times the words are spoken
No doubt somebody will decide

Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on
Play me
And strum me like a guitar
Play me
You make me wanna ooh ah
Play me
Oh baby baby keep me moving
On and on and on

Maybe you don't wanna be here
Cos time after time gets riddled
And I know the price you've paid turn away
Someday everything you want
And desire
To find another way move higher
And I know the price you've paid turn away

Play me
And strum me like a guitar
