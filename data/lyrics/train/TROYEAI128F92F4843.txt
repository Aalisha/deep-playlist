[Static - police starts talking]
[Chorus]
I wanna run, I've been runnin for some time now
My time has come, I think I'll turn myself in now
I wanna run, ohh, I've been runnin for some time now
My time has come, I think I'll turn myself in now
[Attitude]
Wake up and kiss my baby, grab my weed and my gun
Load and cock it & blaze one up, that's how it be on the run
More money more problems, no money yo problems aint gone die
Put 5 in the tank, I'm high & I'm bad news, don't ask me for no ride
When I look at my daughter & son & I see me in their eyes
It hurt so bad I hope the mistakes I made will keep them alive
I keep pushin looking for a lick to hit shit I need some cheese
Gotta go no sleepin for me momma I gotta leave
And if god is on my side then one day soon I'll get where I gotta be
I'm free aint nothin gone stop me from seein what I gotta see
Not even me
The day I cop a? gone be the day that I can't even breathe
All the shit that I go through, if I could show you, you wouldn't believe
All I got is my Bible & me and this rifle my last name aint Mavoe
I'm just a survivor
Been gone from home so long some folks thank that I died
It's cool and If I don't get rich I'm thankful that I alive besides
