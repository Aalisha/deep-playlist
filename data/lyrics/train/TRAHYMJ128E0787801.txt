Does it go from east to west
Body free and a body less
Come again just to start a fresh
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime

Dropping in coming through the mesh
Checking in just to get it blessed
Hard to leave when it's picturesque
Find a form that's free to roam
Where you come from
Where you going

Where you come from
Where you going
Do it all then it all again
Make it up and you make a friend
Paddle on just around the bend

Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend
Hard as hell just to comprehend
...
