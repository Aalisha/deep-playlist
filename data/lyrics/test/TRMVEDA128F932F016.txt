Oh but I pray thee give me one thing
Give me love from your heart
Where does the fire of love kindle first
In the heart, in the hearts of every man
Taking your chances, not knowing fire burns
To give love to receive no love in return
That emptiness it brings tears in your eyes
Tell me why you're doing this now at this time
When love fire should be burning

Love is the force I said let there be light
In the heart, in the hearts of every man
He who drowns in his tears will
Cling on to the memory
Hopelessly clutching onto yesterday's properties
And murders love, it's just tears in your eyes
...
