Not the same person as before
With a different face to move along
And make it through each day
Until the black night sky

Dont let me hear your voices
They keep me going on
So dont you run this is a taste of its reward
You got to give it a hundred and ten percent

Day after day I replay
Switch it to the role of a new day
...
