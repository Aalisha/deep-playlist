I'm like a shadow coming through your door
I'm like a bullet at the speed of light
I go around taking peoples lives
While you sit around saying lies

When I'm around you'll feel the pain
And when I'm done you will be no more
Your life is through now mine begins
My days of agony are now gone

I'm a shockwave and I don't need anyone
