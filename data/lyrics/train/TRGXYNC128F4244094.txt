A cruel sleep 'cross our land
All withered and dying
As the fall, the victims
They're dying a sad death
In our land, we lay down
And suffer again

A dark girl'cross our land
Is pacing. Is preying
And with her, a fever
A marching black fever
No eyes see. No features
Just black form, suffering

You have her sympathy
You have her tears
...
