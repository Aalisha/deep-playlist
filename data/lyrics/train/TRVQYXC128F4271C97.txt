Buddy I'm sick of shootin at clay
(PULL)
Dreaming of opening day
How bout you

Yeah me too

The only thing I want to do
Is hunt with you
Kill a bird or two
Go get your gun

Let's shoot dove
All day long
Until all our shells are gone
Shoot five times
Then reload
Run like heck if the game warden shows
Yeah when the sun comes up
...
