Hey Cledus, Whad'ya get in the mail?

He-he-he, got a letter from Ed.

What's it say?

I don't know. D'you get one?

Well, open it up!

He-hahahahahahaha!

...Open it.

I quit my job about a year ago, I'm on a permanent vacation
All I gotta do now is sit back and wait'll my notification
You see, old Ed, he's a friend of mine, and he writes me once a week
Sends me my very own winnin' numbers
I'm practically on easy street
Well, I don't know, I reckon Ed just likes me a little better'n everybody else
I'm sure he's been tryin' to reach me, 
But uh, I've been out on tour with Garth Brooks. He-hehehehe
