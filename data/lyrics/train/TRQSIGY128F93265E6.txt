Would you stay on standby
Because I need another alibi
In the wrong place at the wrong time
Could you talk a fine line
I need to know that I'll be fine
Bulletproof
It's like I've never been born
We conceive in the alleyways
It's like I've never been born
We believe in other ways
That you do and you did
And there's proof that we did wrong tonight
