Well, I wake up in the morning
With my hair down in my eyes
And she says hi
And I hurry to the breakfast table
While the kids are going off to school, goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says "how you feelin' Hon?"
And I look across at smiling lips that warms my heart
And I see my morning sun
And if that's not loving me
Then all I've got to say

God didn't make little green apples
