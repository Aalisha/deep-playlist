Carve the pain and start again,
Keep up the reputation.
Hide the marks and be the spark
In any situation.

Set the sight, a perfect night,
The mental degradation.
Trouble caused to wild applause,
The trials and tribulations.

Freed from strife, a troubled life
In the hands of our living gods.
A simple glance, dreams of romance,
They hold the cards.

Stomach churns, the nicotine burns,
hand-to-mouth existence.
We're legally caged, slave to the wage,
Bow to the Man's insistence.
