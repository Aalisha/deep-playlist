[Intro:]
Oh oooh oh oooh oh, oh my darlin
Oh oooh girl...

[Verse 1:]
She ready fi live up, give thanks she atrt
Nuh matta mama, papa, nor it, aunti rot
Cho! She haffi ride di big donkey cart
Love di heart of di nyah, from di heart
She's unevil and Irie, and she smart
I seh she's more than beautiful, and she laugh
Caan give har nuh money fi tek har clothes off
Nuh trick har wid nuh fancy talk, I Wayne

[Chorus:]
Touch her softly, she erupted shortly
She seh now, mi mek my day
She need life seeds within har ovaries
Yeah, touch her softly, she erupted shortly
She seh oh rastafariiiiiiii!
