Cha Ching... uh strip
Ah Ah Ah.Ark!
Ah Ah Ah.Ark!

Checkin my one shortie
Checkin my view
Half past two tell me what we gonna do
You stalin me now i wanna blaze it out
I wanna see what its like let me take it down
I wanna dive in your tight thighs, got the right size
Wanna do things till you frame hit the light
Slow flow, no clothes, anything goes
Head to your toes, you know i gotta go

Gotta let me know,
Tell is it fo'
Finish up and more
and we can hit the floor
Take it to the back
Watch the car we at
No matter where we at we can make it happen
Its a quickie two minute
On the spot, its hot let me hit it
In the back of the club in my SUV
Anywhere you want aint nobody gonna see
