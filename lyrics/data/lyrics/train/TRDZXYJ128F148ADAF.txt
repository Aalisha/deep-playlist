I miss the look of surrender in your eyes
The way your soft brown hair would fall
I miss the power of your kiss when we made love
Oh, but baby most of all
I miss my friend

The one my heart and soul confided in
The one I felt the safest with
The one who knew just what to say
to make me laugh again
let the light back in
I miss my friend

I miss the colors that you brought into my life
Your golden smile with those blue-green eyes
...
