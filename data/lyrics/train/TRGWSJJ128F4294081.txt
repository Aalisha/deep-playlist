Half a mile from the county fair
And the rain came pouring down
Me and Billy standing there
With a silver half a crown
Hands are full of the fishing rod and the tackle on our backs
We just stood there getting wet
With our backs against the fence

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day

And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like Jelly Roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like going home
And it stoned me

And the rain let up, and the sun came up
While we were getting dry
