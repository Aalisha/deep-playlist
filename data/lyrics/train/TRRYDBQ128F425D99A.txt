I know you said when I left I'd regret every word, every breath
Every step, every minute without you but go do what you have to
I know I said you were wrong I'd move on, it was only a matter of time
'Til I'd make it without you but this wasn't about you

I said I needed space, a change of place
To go out and live my life

But I don't wanna live without you anymore
And what I wouldn't give to get us back to the way it was before
