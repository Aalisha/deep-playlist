And I can still feel the wind in my hair
I can feel
The road that you're travelling
Takes you so far away
Sometimes it won't hurt you
And there'll be times when you cry
As long as you're with me
I will be strong
The bridge I have to cross
I've burned so many times before
But with you by my side
It feels like i'm walking, walking, walking
