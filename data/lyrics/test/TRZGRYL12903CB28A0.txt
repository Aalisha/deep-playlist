The question is this
By will alone
Does my heart carry the strength
To see you burn?
When I do not wish to part
To see them farewell
Does my heart carry the strength
to leave you behind?

The eternal search for purity
A fragile hope for the just and fair
Order feeds from the corpses
All beauty must die

Where is the essence
