Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be thinking of you
It's the wrong time
For somebody new

It's a small crime
And I got no excuse
And is that alright? Yeah
Give my gun away when it's loaded
That alright? Yeah

If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it?

That alright? Yeah

Give my gun away when it's loaded

That alright? Yeah, with you?
