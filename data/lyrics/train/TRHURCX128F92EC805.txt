Sing a song sweet music man 'cause I won't be there
To hold your hand like I used to, I'm through with you
You're a heck of a singer and powerful man but you surround yourself
With people who demand so little of you

You touched my soul with your beautiful song
You even had me singin' along right with you, you said
"I need you", then you changed the words and added harmony
Then you sang the song you had written for me to someone new
