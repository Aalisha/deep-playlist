Judy wrote the saddest song
showed it to a boy in school today
Judy where did you go wrong?
you used to make me smile when I was down
Judy was a teenage rebel
she did it with a boy when she was young
she gave herself to books and learning
she gave herself to being number one
Judy I don't know you if you're going to show me everything
Judy I don't know you if you're going to show me everything
Judy got a book at school
she went under the covers with her torch
fell asleep till it was morning
