Yeah, we're having a Temazepam party

Good evening!
And welcome to the Temazepam party
Just slide inside and help yourself
We have a wide selection of downers
For your love and enjoyment
So sit down and gouch out
At your own leisure

Welcome to tramazi parti
Just sit down and slide inside
We'll get some go-go girls for the (?)
If you call around you'll have me
Just like you were Dirty Harry
We'll fill up your carrier bags like a leg of lamb

I've got my boots on my head
It's full of jellies in the double bed
And no-one knows what no-one said

Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah
Welcome to your nightmare
You can have it if you treat it right, yeah

Tramazi!
Yer spazzy!
