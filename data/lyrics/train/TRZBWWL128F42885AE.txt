Girl it always seems about September
That's the time, again I remember the lights
And all the fun of those summer nights
Young and innocent and livin' fast
Didn't know enough to know
That a summer love can't last
Can't last

Then the snow, it fell without a warning
Left me standin' out in the cold
My heart shattered, thinking only of yesterday
Does me no good to reminisce
I can really only tell you this
If I had my way, I'd take yesterday

Do you remember those
Summer nights all night
Dancin' in the light of love
(Dancin' in the light of love)
Summer nights so right
Couldn't last beyond September
Summer nights all night
Livin' for your love
Dreamin' only of
You and summer nights
...
