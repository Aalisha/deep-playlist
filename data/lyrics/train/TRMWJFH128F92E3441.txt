She's the queen of the red hot mamas/hottest thing around
And she shows up at a honky tonk cause she can right just lay it down
Ya know she get on down/on down to the ground
She's the cats meow and a dogs bow wow/hottest thang in town

Friend of a friend of a friend of mine said he knew her well
Said she hung around heaven til she learned too much
Then she headed straight for hell/she went straight to hell
Everything for sale
