I can just imagine you and me
Running out of steam, going through the motions
And I have no idea how you know
When I dip my toes in other people's oceans

'Cause you have local knowledge of the local area
And that impressed me quite, so I tried that night
To do all the things I thought you'd like but that just made it worse
And I impressed you not, well, not a lot

So we started from the start

When the heat dies down, I'll be back in town
And until that time I'll be round at mine
And when the heat dies down Ill be back in town
And until that time I'll be round at mine
