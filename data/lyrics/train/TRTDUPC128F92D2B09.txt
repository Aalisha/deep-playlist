a bunch of smoke with building wad
in dissent under your "god"
and we biked to drink the day
because downtown just fell away

and the towers falling down
gave the U.S.A. a frown
and all the bumpkins wept at zero ground
but all these fucking lies
tears up our weary eyes
'cuz 9/11 was an inside thing
and G-Dub played the king
to wipe the crime scene clean
smart folks know what I mean
...
