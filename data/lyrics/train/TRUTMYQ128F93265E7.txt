Lamps in the windows burnin' bright, over in Santa Fe tonight
Full moon shining down along the border
But the ground is hard and the night is black
Over here by the railroad track
And I wish to the Lord that I was back in Georgia

Blue water in the evening sun,
Calling me when the day is done
Mama mama pray for your son

All of my life I've been told
That the LA streets was paved with gold
...
