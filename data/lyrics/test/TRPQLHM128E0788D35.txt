You dont know, what u do to me,
let me tell ya how u make me feel
I need your loving its so good to me
I can't even sleep
boy u got me weak
My heart is on fire since you put that thing on me

You put that thing on me, that thing baby
You put that thing on me, that thing baby

You got me mesmerized
I don't know what to do
Baby got me hypnotized
I think I'm in love with you
You got me so caught up
Baby I'm spellbound
I'm floating on cloud 9
I don't think I'm coming down

Don't you know what you do to me
Baby baby it's like ecstacy
