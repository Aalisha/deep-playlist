The sun contains a ray,
They label vitamin D.
If you like vitamin D,
It's quite alright with me.
But I am here to say,
That I like vitamin love.
But I can't get vitamin love,
with that doggone sun above.

I don't care if the sun don't shine,
I'll get my lovin' in the evenin' time.
When I'm with my baby.
It's no fun with the sun around,
but I get going when the sun goes down,
