All I know if you keep on taking water from the well... it will all dry up and you have up having nothing for yourself.	All I know if you keep on taking water from the well... it will all dry up and you have up having nothing for yourself. 

Your making a fool of yourself... thinking money can buy you health... it's only a greedy heart... loves to finish but never start. You use and abuse everyone around you... taking them for granted... feeling like the world is against you... so you take advantage.
