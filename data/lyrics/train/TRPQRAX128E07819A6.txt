God save the queen
The fascist regime
They made you a moron
A potential H bomb
God save the queen
She ain't no human being
And there's no future
In England's dreaming
Don't be told what you want, you want
And don't be told what you need
There's no future, no future
No future for you
God save the queen

We mean it man
We love our queen
God saves
God save the queen
