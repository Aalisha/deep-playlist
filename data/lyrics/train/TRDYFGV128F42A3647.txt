He's running wild through the streets at night
But he's hiding in the shadows by the break of day
He's got a clip-on Spyderco knife
But it's just for keeping the wolves at bay
It's 2am, fucked up again
He's living in the bottle cause he's living with the pain
Insane, poking his veins, he's standing in the rain
With nothing to lose but everything to gain
Unwanted and unforgiving
He's tired of fighting and he's tired of living here
Swigging beer with nothin' to fear
...
