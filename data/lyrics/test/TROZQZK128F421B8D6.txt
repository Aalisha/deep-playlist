Long ago, the world was one
We walked through the ice floes
To an unenduring land
Our future, our hope
There was something in the air,
The Age of the Unknown
Far beyond the sea of trees
The vision laid close

There's a place where the sun shines brighter
There's a mountain that climbs to the stars...

Day and night we built a reign
With heavenly desire
Sweat and dreams made up the bricks
That raised up our walls

Paying tribute to the gods
And blood kept on flowing
And the lust for knowledge
Was the sense of it all

Fly, fly to the stars,
...
