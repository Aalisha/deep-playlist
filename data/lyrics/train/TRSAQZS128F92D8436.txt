You've got a beautiful temper
But it gets
The best of you, best of you
But you know your mouth
Is on the edge of a secret
And you make adjustments for cover
But you want to
See it through, see it through
And though you're standing
All alone now, it's your fault

Your heart is beating faster
And this isn't what you want

Wake me up
You know I can't stand this
I guess I'll try to find a way
To try to forget it
Get over this
Before you

You say thanks for the notion
And even know that
...
