I gotta keep moving
Nothin's gonna slow me down
I'm countin on these restless wheels
To get me back to my hometown
I gotta keep moving
I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm doing everything I can
I'm getting back from where I've been

I, I can't wait to see you
Workin on that pickup truck
All covered in oil and dust
I, I can't wait to be with you
Finally just the two of us
In our old jeans and our hair messed up
...
