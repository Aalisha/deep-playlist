I know I'm far from perfect,
Too set in my ways for my own good.
And there's other things about me
You think you'd like to change, If you just could.
I could let you shape me,
Mold me like a potters piece of clay.
But you really wouldn't want me that way.

It's a crazy world we live in,
And it keeps on gettin' tougher all the time.
You say you wish I wouldn't let life's troubles,
Weigh so heavy on my mind.
When things are wrong I guess that I could smile,
