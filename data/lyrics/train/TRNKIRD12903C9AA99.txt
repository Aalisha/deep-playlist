Land Spit By Rivers,
Storm Rises Fast
Rain Whipped By Winds
Thunder It Blasts
Rocks, Like Giants Of Doom
Dangerous Figures
Blazed By The Moon

Apocalyptic Scenery Forms
To Weaken My Courage
And Scare Me By Dawn
See My Objective Ahead
There Lies The Cavern

Sent Here
By The Gods In My Visions

(Goddess Of The Fire)
You Shall Be The One.
You Will Carry On
