I am covered in much shame
As I watch my neighbors die
I am but to blame
Now I pay the price

Dear Lord hear me call
May you forgive all my sins
How I need your redemption
To bring this curse to its end

Here I stand before his evil lair
Anticipating the night to fade
It shall be done I cannot turn back now
My people his victims in, hell, they'll not stay
