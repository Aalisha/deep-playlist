(man talking)
I call this song Lemon Meringue.
Hah, that was a bad joke, eh?
But this, this will be a good song.

Hold on, you gotta wait just a minute
See the cookie jar with my hand caught in it
Just let me try to explain
You know I've been a good girl but I've hit a limit
I know there's not a lot of logic in it
But my life's feeling to me

(like lemon)
Sometimes it tastes so bitter (lemon)
I gotta make it sweeter
Stop right there before I get bitter (bitter)
