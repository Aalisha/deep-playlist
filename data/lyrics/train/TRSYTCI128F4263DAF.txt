The first time I laid eyes on you
Me and my heart didn't have a clue
What it was we were gettin' into
But oh, we soon found out

You said, "Hi," my heart strings popped
My lips lost track of my train of thought
I started falling, couldn't stop, look at me now

I'm tore up from the floor up
You're dynamite, you're a real humdinger
I'm unwound from the top down
Wrapped around your little finger

Been sideways all day
Just thinkin' about last night
...
