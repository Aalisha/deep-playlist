Ch- When your around I can see so clearly through the
Rain;
There's something bout' the way that you hold me, keeps
Me into you that is why I know gotta be the one for me.

1-This must be divine intervention.
Heaven must know that I need you, see first I tried so
Hard to ian from it somehow, love made it's way,
Straight to my heart.
