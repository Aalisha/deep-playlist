Black Man! / You better stand strong / hurry before our chances for survival are gone / it's the youth man / they get we at a young age / try to live a better life but them want RAGE!! / You may ask me where this is coming from / so Imma let the numbers run / in the year 2000 / 46 % high school graduate Black man / without a job or in the can / 2004 / the number had increased by 4% more / where does this leave us? / presently void / shaking in a jail cell paranoid / I see lots of young Black men pun TV / Nuff jewelry /yet them not free / how can it be that we can't see / we're still shackled on that boat in the great blue sea / Flee! / You don't like hearing the truth? / The message that you're spreading is deading the youth / A people with no foundation stand naked / Look in the mirror and sever the hatred
