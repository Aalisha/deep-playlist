Get on Top Get on Top

Hit me come get me I bite but she bit me

Go-rilla Cunt-illa
Sammy D and Salmonella
Come with me 'cause I'm an ass killer
You're ill but I'm iller

I'll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I'll knock and
Set you up to get on top

Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on

Get up and come sit up I light up but she lit it
...
