Softly touched by lascivious breath
The strange feeling like in a dream
The face gleaming in full glory
Touches of provoking beauty

Step back
Deprive yourself of the spell
Seduction is death
Is death
Step back
Deprive yourself of the spell
Hallucinations mean death
Mean death

Unleash yourself,
Destroy the evil spell
The face desintegrates to dust
...
