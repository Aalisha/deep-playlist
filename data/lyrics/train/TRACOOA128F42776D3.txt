Unchain your obscenity
Desirable enemy
Await my enlightening
Allow what your fate can bring

Now you're caught inside my cage
You are the object of my rage
Sin, I wash you clean again
I'm your redeemer

'Cause I, I live for your pain
I live for your pain
I'm dying

My victim you are meant to be
No, you cannot hide nor flee
...
