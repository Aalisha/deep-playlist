And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
Pass your door
But you don't live there anymore

It's years since you've been there
And now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place
