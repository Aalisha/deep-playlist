If believe in miracles
Where're you from, you sexy thing, you sexy thang you
I believe in miracles since you came along, you sexy thing

Where did you come from, baby
How did you know, I needed you
How did you know I needed you so badly
How did you know I'd give my heart gladly
Yesterday I was one of the lonely people
Now your lying close to me, making love to me

I believe in miracles
Where're you from, you sexy thing, sexy thing you
I believe in miracles
Since you came along, you sexy thing
