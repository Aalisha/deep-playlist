I never thought that I could
Crash upon your sandy shores
And like the feeling of your warm security
It's not like me

Now I come with strange excitement
At your very touch I'm frightened
Don't I ask too much you tell me
'Long as I can keep on yelling

Don't don't tell me no
I want you to take my hand
Never ever let it go
Even if I make you mad
Darlin' every bit of love give
You will get more back
If you believe it

Who cares if it's forever
There's no time when we're together
...
