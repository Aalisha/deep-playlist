Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by looking for angels

Walk this world alone try to stay on my feet
Sometimes crawl, fall
But I stand up 'cause I'm afraid to sleep
Open my eyes to a new day
With all new problems and all new pain
All the faces are filled with so much anger
Losing our dignity and hope from fear of danger
After all the wars, after settling the scores
At the break of dawn we will be deaf to the answers
There's so much bigotry, misunderstanding and fear
With eyes squinted and fists clenched
We reach out for what is dear
We want it, we want... We want a reason to live
We're on a pilgrimage, a crusade for hope
'Cause in our hearts and minds and souls we know
We need it, we need... We need more than this

Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
