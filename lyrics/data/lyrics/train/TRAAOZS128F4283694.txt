Halcyon Days

Bright light streaming in, through my window pane
Think I'll star at the shapes it makes
on the floor and then stare again
You've got your curtains drawn,
anything I can do?
Maybe a rose or a pillow or a picture or a funny joke just for you
To carry you away
Let me bring you, some tokens of esteem
Close the door on the world, make it our own beautiful scene
There's a darkness visible, maybe only to me
Maybe just a dream, a time-slowing-down dream,
a hole you're sinking down deep
Comes loose at the seams, make the dream leave

Some rise by wrong
And some by virtue fall
...
