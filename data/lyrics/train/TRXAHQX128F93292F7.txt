Most of my life I've spent up in the air
Waiting for time to come down
And now my virtue is well past its curfew
I've got to get out of this town

Madness, a train that's left the station
All destinations unknown
I needed to find myself a new situation
One that I can call my own

And I'm alright now
And I'm alright now
...
