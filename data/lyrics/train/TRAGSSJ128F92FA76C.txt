I dreamed last night No more cops
It felt alright No more cops
No need to fight No more cops

'Cause no one needs to steal
Everyone gets a meal
If it was only real
We'd need no more cops

I dreamed last night no police
An army-less world doomed to peace
And now as all my dreaming stops
I see it clear, we need no more cops

No need to fear
