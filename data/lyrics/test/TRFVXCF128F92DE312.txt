It feels the same every day
Come home from work, late again
Work so hard and never play
I can't wait to take you far away

Don't you know
(Don't you know)
Gotta go
(Gotta go)
Pressure builds from everyone, every day
Get away
(Get away)
Come my way
(Come my way)
When the day begins to enter your mind

Come go with me
Make you feel like
This night will last, everlasting through the time
Come go with me
Have no fears

Bring back the memories
I can take away the misery
Take my hand, fly away
To our world, that we can find today

Can you feel
(Can you feel)
...
