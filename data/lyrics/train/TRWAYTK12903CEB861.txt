I'm missing you my old friend, and the small town days
that would never end we rolled like the future kings,
and we sang to each other. You will never walk alone again...

On the highway west where the rain won't fall,
and I wonder if you'll remember me at all 20 years ago
friends forever we had said, and we would hold the course,
and ride until we're dead.
