Ah you can talk about the pit, barbecue
The band was jumpin,' the people too
Ah mess around, they doin' the Mess Around
They doin' the mess around
Everybody doin' the mess around

Ah, everybody was juiced, you can, bet your soul
They did the boogie-woogie, with a sturdy roll
They mess around, they doin' the mess around
They doin' the mess around
Everybody doin' the mess around
