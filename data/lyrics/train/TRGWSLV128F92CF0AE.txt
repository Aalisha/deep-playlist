I'm running out of patience cos I can't believe what the hell I'm hearing
And speaking of hell, it don't compare to this heat that I'm feeling
I love you too much, it shows
All my emotions go out of control
Good for you, bad for me
When I can hardly see
From the tears that flow

Can't forget to breathe slow
Count from one to ten with my eyes closed
'cos ladies take it in and get composure
Before I lose it, get composure
I'm gonna breathe slow
Count from one to ten with my eyes closed
'cos ladies take it in and get composure
Ladies never lose composure
