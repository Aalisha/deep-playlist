Ow!

I'm gettin' weary
I'm goin' blind
'Cuz you mistreat me, baby
So unkind
One thing I know, honey
Love is blind
'Cuz you find your heart
And then you lose your mind

I keep cryin' the same ol' way
I keep on tryin' the same ol' way
Feels like I'm dyin', baby
The same ol' way

Yeah

Your kind of lovin'
Can't be found
You pick me up just to tear me down
But here I am, baby
On my knees
Still tryin' to give you love 'n everything
