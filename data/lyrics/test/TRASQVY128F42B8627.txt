(It's rollin'. One, two... One, two. Sorry, one, two, three, four.)


Oh no
Love just leaves you bruised
If you want to know
Then find something to lose

The world won't turn until something breaks
Who will make the first last mistake?
You say good things come to those who wait

Into the spiral
Your world or my world
It's never final
Love just leaves you bruised

I went because you said you'd be there
A box of candy, smoke in your hair
When I didn't know, I didn't care
But now I know
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Ba ba ba ba baaaaaa
Love just leaves you bruised
