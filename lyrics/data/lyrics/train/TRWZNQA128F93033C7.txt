Lately I've been feeling low
A remedy is what I'm seeking
Take a taste of what's melow
Come away to something better
What I want is what I've not got
But what I need is all around me
Reaching searching never stop
And I'll say...

If you could keep me floating just for a while
'Til I get to the end of this tunnel... mummy
If you could keep me floating just for a while
I'll get back to you
...
