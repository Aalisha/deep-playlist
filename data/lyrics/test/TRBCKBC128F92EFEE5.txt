Charlie's got a gold watch
Don't seem like a whole lot
After thirty years of drivin'
Up and down the interstate
But Charlie's had a good life
And Charlie's got a good wife
And after tonight she'll no longer
Be countin' the days

Eighteen wheels and a dozen roses
Ten more miles on his four day run
A few more songs from the all night radio
...
