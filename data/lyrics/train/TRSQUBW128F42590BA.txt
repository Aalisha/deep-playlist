Picked up the paper this morning
Could not believe what I saw
A friend of mine was killed
Runnin' from the law

I could still see the face of my old friend
In the picture that stared back at me
And through the tears I went back through the years to remember
The times that we were

Playin' pirates in the school yard, singin'
Soldiers in the fields
We were dreamin'
Brothers in blood 'til the very end

We were best of friends
Best of friends
