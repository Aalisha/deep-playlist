[Verse]
Now once again, a deep thought of Aaliyah
Crosses my mind, I rethought that I seen her, all in my mind
Memories of Big, all in the lime light, all of the time, all on his grind, right
I'm blacking out about 'Pac, blacking out on them cops
Middle finger, after blacking out from them shots
And I go visit Shyne, in my distant mind
I tell him stay up, cause in there it's a different grind
I see Eazy and Jam Master laughin'
Big L still rappin, like it never happened
I got a sick sense with me, God picked then sent me
To this earth place, to win in the first place
Visions of mommy, on an Island somewhere, yeah, I designed just for my mommy
My whole life is a blessing, that's why I'm so nice, so right
