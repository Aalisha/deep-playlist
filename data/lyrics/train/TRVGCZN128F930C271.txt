It's Charlie Puth bitch
uh
Let me tell ya about 6 youngs fellas
That really know how to get down
Coast to coast, NY to L.A.
Yeah, they run this f*cking town

I'm talking about
Jc Caylen, Connor, Sam, Ricky, Kian, Trevor Moran

Check yourself before you wreck yourself
Â´Cause now you're rocking with the whole damn fam
Oh, yeah

That's O2l, but you already know
And if your really don't
Your out the window
And they're never going to keep you feeling lonely
Your only biggest problem is the bitch Chloe
Ricky got sass
Sam got love
Trevor got them notes from above
Connor got the giggles
