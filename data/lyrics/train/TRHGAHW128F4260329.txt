Although my lover lives in a place that I can't live
I kind of find I like a life this lonely
It rips and pierces me in places I can't see
I love the rip of nerves, the rip that wakes me
So I'm dissatisfied; I love dissatisfied
I love to feel there's always more that I need

So come on home
So come on home
So come on home
Home
