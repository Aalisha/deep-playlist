You think you are on top
Against all odds you've made it
But life ain't that easy baby
Death is giving you a fright

In the mist of the night
A lot of commotion is spread
Someone is diggin' the graves
Someone's preparing murder

One of these days, mark my words
A demon in neon will flash your eyes
Public enemy no. 1 will fuck with your head
Forever and ever, nothing is never

Young and wasted
Too blind to see this mess
Stabbed and stabbed again
...
