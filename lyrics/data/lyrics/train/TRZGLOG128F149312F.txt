(Gary Moore) 
I can still remember, 
like it was yesterday, 
the pain inside my heart 
as you turned to walk away. 

I don't know and I don't care 
what the people say. 
I don't know and I don't care, 
I love you anyway. 

For I have found my love in you. 
And I have found a love so true. 

I can still remember, 
like it was just the other day.
