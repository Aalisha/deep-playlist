Flame flicker fast how you love that's left
All your moments sift down to this
Now you love like your passion is here in its box yeah
Like your heart meant so much more than the things you've strived for

One chance one chance at this
Yeah one life baby one life to give

Drift to see head to pay dirt
Wish like you could to see all your worth
