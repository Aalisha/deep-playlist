Pecked by the seagulls, hanging from the gallows
Twisting in the breeze, dripping something on the streets
I can see him from my window, they can see him from the water
Just a victim of the press gang

I knew him when he was breathing
He was a good man, he was a young man
He was like you, he was like me
It could've been me
It could've been me

Twisting in the breeze
(Cut him down, cut him down)
Left for the children on the street
(Cut him down, cut him down)
On the street

He should've kept his mouth shut
He never shoulda left that ship
