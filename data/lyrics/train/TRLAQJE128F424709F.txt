A neverending dream, a dream of you
I believe I receive a sign of you

I am waiting for the night,
Drifting away
On the waves of my dreams
To another day
I am standing on a hill,
And beyond the clouds
The wind is blowing still
And catching my doubts

A neverending dream, a dream of you
I believe I receive a sign of you
Tonight I wanna hide my feelings too
As you do and I wanna be with you

I'm hunting on the night,
The slave to my dream
An illustrated scene
