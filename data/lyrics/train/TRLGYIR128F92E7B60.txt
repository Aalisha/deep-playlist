Blue skies, once upon a dream
All eyes never in between

Then into the garden came the spider
"I'm here for you," said the spider to the fly
And when I'm through, you can open up your eyes to see

Your world on fire, and the liar won't let go
Atom and Evil

One more promise 
We can tame the sun 
And then we'll shine forever 
Someday you can cry for everyone 
We'll burn when you were clever 
...
