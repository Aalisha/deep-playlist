I made some mistakes in my life that I m not proud of see
And I hope that doesn t mean now I m trying it will be harder for me
I been hurt and its not an excuse but it s a reason
It s like some things happen in life for a lifetime or a season
And I m just now learning how this world really works
There s a law that says you get back what you put forth
All this running around doing nothing aint good for me man
Its stupidity so this mirrors up and it s looking at me
I m sorry mum for all the times that I made you cry
And its been said before in songs but you are my life
So if you really wanna move away and not work so hard
How can I tell you know this is my blessings mum
And you don t have to worry about me I m doing music now
It s the truth it s from my heart I hope it makes you proud
