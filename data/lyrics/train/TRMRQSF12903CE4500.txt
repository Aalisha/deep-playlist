Hey I found a whistle that hangs like a charm,
and when my noose is tied I could blow it
and fall down into your arms
15 centuries of dissolution and grief,
to return a yellow trickster and a thief

Hey I found a whistle that works every time
that's when the trail escapes to nowhere,
and the flood erases the crime
such conviction,
to paint all the wall with the blood
of the young and the faithful and the good

Yeah I found a whistle as thin as a sheet
...
