I been around the world once, had your fianc√© twice
I ain't nothin' nice, but every lifestyle got a price
Kiss my momma on the cheek cause her love was deep
Like Keith Sweat, but the deeper the streets get
The deeper the beef get
Enough fatal attraction to? your vet
Cause everybody wanna have it? and sh
Now,? is my? over night, insight
I write like six hundred thousand kilobytes
Yes I'm on one, European cars, Cuban cigars, rap stars,
Glass ceilings to the inevitable cap dealing for sexual healing
I lack feeling, voted for black women like Terry Macmillan
Save a prayer for me, I was told no guts no glory
I she'd a tear once in a while, too
But a soldier gots to do what he gots to do
I once? in? for Rupert Murdoch, I thought you knew
It is what it is
Hook:
[Jazze Pha] Nowadays, that's the way it is
[Ras Kass] Why do we do what we do when we do what we must, that's
How it is, and how it is is kinda fucked up
[Jazze Pha] It's sad to say, but things just ain't the same no more
[Ras Kass] Why do we do what we do when we do what we lust, it is
What it is, and how it is is kinda fucked up
[Ras Kass]
