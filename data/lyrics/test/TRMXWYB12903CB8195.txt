The Dow Jones took a dive today
Another bank closes it's doors
A man downtown tried to fly away
From it all on the eighteenth floor
And everything he worshipped
Ain't worth nothing now

He had a jaguar in the driveway
A house with eighteen rooms
Every night he dined alone
Fed from a silver spoon
Guess he never figured out
You ain't what you own
