Sittin' over here, starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes, sure don't give a damn
And ya don't know that I've been dreamin'

Think what you want, let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to

How many nights I've laid in bed
Excited over you
I've closed my eyes and thought of us
A hundred different ways

I've gotten there so many times
I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day
All I've got to say is

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl
