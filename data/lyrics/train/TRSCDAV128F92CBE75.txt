(Opening)
Thy kingdom come
let your will be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven

(Verse 1)
They say we're all in the pursuit of happiness
(a life so fabulous)
So we fight for what's ours like an activist
The struggles here we can find across the atlas
And it all started when Adam gave up his own palace
Now the earth waits for its rightful owner
2000 years ago the second Adam told us
The kingdom is at hand
Died for the sins of man
Just so He can bring us back to its original plan
Well we rule over the land (yea)
And meet every demand (yea)
And nature awaits for us keys to take a stand
but we need to understand (yea)
that we can change the circumstances (yea)
The kingdom is in us so we choose when to advance

(Chorus)
You got the keys inside this kingdom
Lift up your head it's only begun
Keep holding on and you'll see the Son
Everybody's singin' now
(everybody's singin' now)
You got the keys inside this kingdom
Lift up your head its only begun
Keep holding on and you'll see the son
Everybody's singing now
(everybody's singin' now)
ohhhhhh
whooaaaaa

(Verse 2)
I heard this thing that You would die for me
Gladly gave Your life for me
