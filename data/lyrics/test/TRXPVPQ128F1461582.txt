Shake Your Bootie Cutie
Hello Daddy Baby
Hello Sexy Mama's
(Hello is anybody there? Come on! Bring your bad-ass self down here
Get out of your head and into your body!)
Shake Your Bootie Cutie
(I wanna see you do your thing, remember to cut me in)

You walk the walk, you talk the talk
We met by chance, shut up and dance
Conversation's fine, but I haven't got the time
Coffee and small talk is the last thing on my mind

We're doin' it baby
We're out here on the floor tonight, yeah
No worries baby
Forget about the problems in your life

Shake your bootie cutie
You are dancing king
(Uh huh, uh huh)
Sexy daddy baby
You really make my thing sing

(Sexy mama, come on! shut your mouth, ow!)

I'm a girl who likes to be kissed
I'm a sentimental freak who just loves to get frisked
I'm not in the mood to analyze
It's the way that you shake it, not the shape or the size
