(Dolly Parton)

We can't always both be right 
We sometimes disagree 
But you've got the right to speak your mind 
An' it's the same with me 
When the anger's at an end 
And you want inside my arms again 
All you have to do to make it right is just 

Touch your woman 
Touch your woman 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Touch your woman
