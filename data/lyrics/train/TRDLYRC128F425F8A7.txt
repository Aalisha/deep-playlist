I can't seem to make you mine, Ohhhhh! 
Kissin' around all over town, Ohhhhh! 
You fly around like a bee, Ohhhhh! 
Hurtin' everything you see, Oh! 

I try everything I know, Oh! 
To make you wanna love me so, Oh! 
The only thing you do, Ohhhh! 
Is try to put the hurt on me

Can't you see what you're doin' to me?
You fill my heart with misery
With every breath every step I take
I'm more in love with you
