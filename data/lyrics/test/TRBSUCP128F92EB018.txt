I'm walking in an open field looking for some space to fill
I believe there's something left to hold
So even when the sun goes down and there's no one around
I'm standing in the freedom of my soul

And the truth of the matter is still the same
It's that you and I, we will not be here forever
The truth of the matter is still the same

I'm ready to stand
Ready to stand
Ready to stand
Ready to stand
Stand, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know, I know, know I
