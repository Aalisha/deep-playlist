I saw your light last night
And I hoped that you were home
And I saw some shadows move
And I wished that I had phoned
Well it seems like I was running scared
I guess now so were you
And Mersey
I'll just save my love for you

You were the best girl that I ever knew
Mersey I'll just save my love for you
...
