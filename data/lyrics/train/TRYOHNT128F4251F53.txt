If you ever see me walking down the side of the road
Do you ever stop and wonder why
Would you think it's lost that I paid the cost
Stop and give a poor boy a ride
And forget my past

'Cause if I ever get home, I'm never gonna worry 'bout the things that I could've done
'Cause I've done a lot of things I could've done better
But now it don't matter none

'Cause I've raised my glass

I fell in love and then lost touch
I dropped it and broke her heart
I drove off a cliff
And I barely missed
Walkin' days through the park

With a selfish boy
...
