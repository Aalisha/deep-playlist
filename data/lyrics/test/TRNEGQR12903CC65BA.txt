He felt invulnerable
Absolute control
His soul worked like a mine
He would
Exploit the present
Flood dead-ends
If they sparkled, stakes would sometimes be too high
He was offered
A buffet of seduction

Easy target
King of diamonds
His fate was sealed
This spell he could not shake

Good-bye, my love,
Good-bye
Losing ground is what it takes
If you really want to fly
