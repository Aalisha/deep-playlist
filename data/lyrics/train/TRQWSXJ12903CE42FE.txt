There's no good way of seeing it
It's all joke and lies and smiling under the sun
It wouldn't be a dream if I could ever really land it
Like it so much, there's no reason why

I can't talk and I can't do anything
God save us the man aims to please
Just do it, it won't mean anything
Got a wild track working nine degrees

Psychic not tonight
Sucked in
Miami Skyline
