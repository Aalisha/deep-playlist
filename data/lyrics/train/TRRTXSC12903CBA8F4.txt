A long time forgotten the dreams that just fell by the way
The good life he promised ain't what she's livin' today
But she never complains of the bad times
Or the bad things he's done, lord
She just talks about the good times they've had
And all the good times to come

(She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man)
She loves him in spite of his ways she don't understand
...
