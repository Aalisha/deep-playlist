A fresh face and a smile you can't ignore
A crooked tongue tangled up by needing more
A warm spot waiting here on either side

I should have known it from the start
You can't kill a cancer without heart
I wait here mapping my brand new life
And I was hoping you could tell me why

You broke me down while swinging off my mind
And all I have to say, you made a fortune off of me
Singing everyone around me looks the same
