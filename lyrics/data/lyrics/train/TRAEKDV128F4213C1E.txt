Last night in Chicago, last week in New York,
last Christmas between near and far?
If I search for one thing that I really can't find,
the answer must be in my heart,
I count every second since you went away,
lost one million faces at all,
but the world turns around while the time's passin`by,
let everything live and let die.

Refrain:
I want you to come back and carry me home,
