There are times in which you can't see the meaning
There are lives in which you won't find the love
There are nights in which you don't ever dream to see light again
...it's hard to believe again

We can't say we always believe, but still we hold on
And after thousand tears we know again
You can't say we always believe in love
But still we hold on, still we try again

Bring on, come on and bring on
After all the tears you cried you still can always
Bring on, come on and bring on
Everywhere there is a smile you still can bring it on
