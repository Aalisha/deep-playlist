I was born on a railroad track
With the weight of the world strapped to my back
Born to be a soldier boy, born to be a soldier boy

Looking for a life in a graveyard town
If you never get lost, you never get found
Born to be a soldier boy, born to be a soldier boy
Born to be a soldier boy, born to be a soldier boy

I fell in love with an impossible girl
She was my breath in this strangled world
Born to be a soldier boy, born to be soldier boy

She broke my heart with my best friend's name
Now my mind still works, but it's not the same
