No one's ever here but the lights are always on
And if you want to know what it feels like when they're gone
You can run away, you can run real far from this
But when you turn 'round you'll have to face it like it is
Like it is

What if I still saw lights flash, you can move back (?)
Love was here, I'd die first from what she'd understand

No one can tell her that nothing's in control
...
