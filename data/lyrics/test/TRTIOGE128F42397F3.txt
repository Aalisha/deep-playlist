(now the evening has come to a close
and I've had my last dance with you
so on to the empty streets with me
and it might be my last chance with you
so I might as well get it over with
the things I have to say
won't wait until another day)

Shut up
Whoooooo
Whoooooo
Whoooooo
Check this out

The Fabulous structure that's coaxed out of rubbles puddles splash
Mechanisms burn with beeping sounds that own their humans sold as
ruthless rounds of radio dust, Cranial mush, men get flattened out
radials spun on dusted combatant joust
...
