You better put that down
You better put that down
All I need is a bottle, and I don't need no friends, no

Wallow in my pain, I swallow as I pretend
To act like I'm happy

When I drink till no end, no

I'm losing all my friends, I'm losing in the end

And she says ...

Behave little boy
You better sit back down until you hold your ground
...
