Sorry, now that I let you go
You were the better part of me I know
If only I could show that
Baby, I love you

When the light illuminates the scene
I try to shake this heart of mine
From off my dirty sleeve
Call me a fool or maybe just naive
As all I have to share this place
Is my own company

Yeah
Give me the strength I can trust
Give me the will to ignite
I know what it's like

Sorry, now that I let you go
You were the better part of me I know
If only I could show that
Baby, I love you

You linger on like a melody
You gave me so much more
Than you received
