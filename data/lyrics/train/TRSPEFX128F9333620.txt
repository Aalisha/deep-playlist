We saw the western coast, I saw the hospital
Nurse the shoreline like a wound
Reports of lovers tryst were neither clear nor discript
We kept it safe and slow, the quiet things that no one ever knows

So keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired, today's the day we dropped out
Give up my body in bed, all for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals

So keep the blood in your head and keep your feet on the ground
Today's the day it gets tired, today's the day we dropped out
Give up my body in bed, all for an empty hotel
Wasting words on lowercases and capitals
