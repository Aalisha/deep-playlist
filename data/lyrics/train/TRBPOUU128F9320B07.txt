Hey kid, you're just not looking so good
You pissed on your people then you turned tail and ran when they attacked
I got a little lesson for you
The more that you push it, the more that it's gonna bite you back

You're lost like a rat trapped in a maze
Bear down and put your nose to the grind, your boundaries defined
Your safety just went up in a blaze

Impassive and restrained
