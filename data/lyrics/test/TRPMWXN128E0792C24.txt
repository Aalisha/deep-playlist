If anything should mash up my head Sah
Play the music me can't dead
Jah in music prolongs gives me life to
Praise Jah
In motion with music getting what we want
Getting what we need
In motion with music getting what we want
Getting what we need

Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
Dancing, stepping in a ridim fashion
Dancing, go deh, go deh
Dancing, let the music rock me
Dancing away
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
