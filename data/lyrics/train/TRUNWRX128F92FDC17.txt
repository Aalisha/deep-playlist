My love has got no money
He's got strong beliefs
My love has got no power
He's got strong beliefs
My love has got no fame
He's got strong beliefs
My love has got no money
He's got strong beliefs

Want more and more
People just want more and more
Freedom and love, what he's looking for
Want more and more
People just want more and more
Freedom and love, what he's looking for
