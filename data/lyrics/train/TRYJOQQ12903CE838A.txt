Tell you baby
I've been waiting
For so long
I want it over
It's pleasant waiting
It's pleasant hating
Placenta fed
Get out of my head
Life's a laugh
When you complain about
The way that I give
All I have to give
You say you want more:
You can't sustain without
You wanna live
But you don't know how

Overthinking,
Smoking and drinking
You're in my head
It's time for bed
...
