Ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh
I'm in a battle I'm rattled
Under a spell I'm your muse
I feel the pressure is building
And I can't find an excuse
You're like a sediment elegant
On my mind all the time
And I am telling you telling you
Girl I'll make you mine
I said ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh
Time's about to change
I said yeah yeah
I'm taking control
You rock my world empire
Give my word to you
Make me fly so much higher
Show me I'm the only one
You rock my world empire
Give my heart to you
Make me fly so much higher
Show me I'm your number one
Lose control
