I wish that I cold be an Indian
On a painted pony so fast
No one could ever catch me
I get caught up in my past

I’d ride across many rivers
Too many moons to tell the times
Then I’d tell all the young warriors
Many moons ago this was mine, all mine

Same ol’ river, same ol’ sea
Same ol’ water rushing over me
Same ol’ moon, same ol’ sun
Same ol’ race that we’ve always run
Same ol’ race that we’ve always run

I wish that I could be a Pirate
I’d sail the ocean blue
Way before the big liners
Started sailing them too

I’d bury most of my treasures
