Let go of all
Your preconceived notions about me
And let me set the record straight
I'm not the person that they said I was
I'll show you that we're more

You won't be alone
If you fall I fall too
Cause we've got nothing to lose
What else can we do?

Listen to these words I say
With meaning and structure
And let me set the record straight
I'm not planning on leaving you so helpless
...
