Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promise I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
As we walked to the room
There were faces starring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scarring me

We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls
(Sitting in my room)
She walked up to my face
Said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
