In 1580 we sailed our little ship
Around the coast of Africa, down the Gaza strip
We took some salty bacon and a hammock for a bed

Then we mixed it with the Spaniards in the middle of the Med

There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago
We hired some more and then we started runnin'

All down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Mexico...
Well, Francis Drake said if you really want a fight
