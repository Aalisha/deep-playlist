With a filthy mind of brilliance
filthy mind in doubt
pinching skin hard between the eyes
suck the poison out

running for our lives like a child's dream
mouth make the word, electricity
nothing to hide but your old milk teeth
can't see death i'm just a baby
climbing up from the single bed
off the same pages we both read
with papercuts and our money tins
...
