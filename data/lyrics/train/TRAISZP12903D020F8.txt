At my ring fittin, feelin like my ring different
My hands grew from the last time they was ring dishin
They made mine but they stunted on the ring givin
So now I'm taxin the jeweler like "where the ring sittin?"
If all's movin and tell 'em that I'm beyond movin
I'm all through it, I told 'em that I don't part two it
It's one shot like take it or leave it
The advantage is off top, it's like breakin a ceiling
I handle it off top, both hands on rightfully
They say I achieve too much for them to hype for me
Did it on my own, so yeah I got the right to be
Half of my inbox starts with "can you write for me?"
Huh, so as far as your speakish fam
We not neighbors but I can give your speech a hand
I told 'em, I obsoleted the ones you believed in
And did it on Posturepedics but you thought I was sleepin
Still dozin

Streets keep callin me now, tryin to make me act out
I'm tryin to stay on my nine to five, so one day I can get out
Get out, of everything that keeps tryin to bring me down, yeee-eah

I ain't your favorite but the one you like, been a fan
