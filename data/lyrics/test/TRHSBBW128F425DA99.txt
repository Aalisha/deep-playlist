So that was the first big weekend of the summer...
Starts thursday as usual with the canteen quiz and again no-one wins the big cash prize.
Later I do my sound bloke routine by approaching gina's new boyfriend to say that he shouldn't feel that there's any animosity between us and then I even go and make peace with her shouldn't hav
Hered.

Then on friday night we went through to the arches...

There was only one car going so some of us had to get the train. we got through quite late. then we went to a pub to take the gear.
There was no problems getting in - we saw some others waiting down the front of the queue so we skipped in.
It was a good night - everyone was nutted and I ended up dancing with some blonde girl.
I thought she had been quite pretty until last night when matthew informed me that she had, in fact, been a pig.

When the club finished we wandered the streets for a while until we got to this 24-hour cafe.
I didn't like the look of it so we left and got a taxi back to morag's flat.
I couldn't sleep so I sat about drinking someone else's strawberry tonic wine and tried to keep everyone else up.
