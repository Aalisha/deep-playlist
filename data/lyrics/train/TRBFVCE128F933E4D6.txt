She looks so pretty
She's ruler of the world
Number one movie, model, she's the all-American girl

He's got a hit record
Selling out his shows
He's got the car and the cash and the shoes
And the girl that you want

So turn up all the lights I'm ready
Taking over, I'm not waitin'
That's right I'm here now, I gotta go
Now's the time, I know it's mine
Watch out
I'm movin' in
I'm movin' in

I'm with the in crowd now
