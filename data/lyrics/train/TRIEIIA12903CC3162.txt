Happy talk, keep talkin happy talk
talk about thing you like to do
you got to have a dream...
if you dont have a dream.
How you gonna have a dream come true?

talk about the moon.
floating in the sky
lookin like a lilly on a lake

talk about a bird
learning how to fly
makin all the music he can make

Happy talk, keep talkin happy talk
talk about thing you like to do
you got to have a dream...
if you dont have a dream.
