Questions drip from my umbrella
Shadows hang over me

Stand here, waiting
I know the sky will break
And bleed it's light
And kiss my face with mercy

I'll endure the rain
I will wait an hour more
Not sure if I'll see anything
Can I wait here anymore?

I'll endure the rain
I will wait an hour more
Not sure if I'll see anything
Can I wait here any longer?

Teardrops vanish in a moment
