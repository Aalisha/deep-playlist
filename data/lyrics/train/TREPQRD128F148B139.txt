You said that we would always be friends
You said our love would never end
All you gave to me were scars on my heart
All you did to me was tear my world apart
You left these scars on my heart

You took my love and made it bend
And you knew my money was for you to spend
You stabbed my heart and tore my world apart
and all you left me with were scars on my heart

Scars on my heart
These scars on my heart
Scars on my heart
Scars on my heart
