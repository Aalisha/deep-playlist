It felt like just a moment
The way they never last
Where were you goin'
That you had to leave so fast

We were supposed to wake up
One day when we were older
Holdin' on forever
But we flew past each other

Like windows on a train
The flashing of a frame
I can't hold on but I can't let go
A snapshot in my mind
Of a love that's stuck in time
...
