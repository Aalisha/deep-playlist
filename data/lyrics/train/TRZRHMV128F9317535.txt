INTRO:

On your own, far away from home
There doesn't seem to be a friend when you're alone
People stare, you wonder if they care
So, you turn your back on someone with love to spare
Try to see, it's gotta be
Lovin' one another is the only possibility
So, when you're down and losin' ground
Don't get to thinkin' love can't be found

CHORUS: Hey, stop, stop! And look around
Somebody wants to love you
Stop, stop! And turn around
