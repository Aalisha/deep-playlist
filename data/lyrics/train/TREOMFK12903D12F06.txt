When the curtains open finally revealing horror
Hiding scenary smells like death
Everyone who's not breathing anymore wake up
Fingers of despots turn on the lights
From the dark clouds sounds trumpets
Everyone knows the last cycle is over

Blood and tears rain like an inexorable sentence
Skies are crossed by spider webs
Neon Canahan is take off to it's profane owners
General dispair has the metropolis
The great Babylon falls one more time
The great Babylon falls one more time
