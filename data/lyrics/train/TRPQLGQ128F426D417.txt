Here we go, we're at scene one
The camera rolls,
At the bottom of this building
We pull open, the door and dive right in
Each door we open,
Brings an argument
The stairs shine, shine light
We spiral, spiral up them

We lose con-control

This feeling inside,
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
This feeling inside,
Building for a long time
It's unbearable, are we capable
