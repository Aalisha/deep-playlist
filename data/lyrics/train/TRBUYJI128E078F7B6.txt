Buenos noches senorita,
I'm mighty pleased to meet ya
Maybe you and I could sit a spell and talk
I'm new to Santa Fe,
I just rode into town today
Thought I'd spend some time
In these adobe walls
It's dark in this cantina,
It's a wonder that I seen ya
Sittin' without any company at all
I was wondering if we might
Dance away this lonely night
Like two shadows on these old adobe walls

I hear Celito Lindo softly playing
...
