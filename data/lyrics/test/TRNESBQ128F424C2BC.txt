Don't know why
I can't function
In this dead ends
Impossible

I don't know why
It's not that I
That I don't try
It's not easy

Don't know why
I can't function
In this dead ends
Impossible

I don't know why
It's not that I
That I don't try
It's not easy

Bury your head, bear your heart
But I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
...
