I was standing in the station
being pounded by the rain
so I chose the last compartment
of a stationary train
felt someone get in behind me
but I never caught their eye
but I thought I heard a woman's voice
whispering goodbye

So I lay down in the darkness
with the beer and coffee stains
and I stared out at the thunder
through the broken window panes
And although the storm was booming
like an engine in the sky
I'm sure I heard a woman's voice cry

Don't wanna be under your thumb forever
Don't wanna be under your thumb forever
...
