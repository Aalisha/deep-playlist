Once a beautiful Miss America,
married Mr. Right.
Had a little baby girl,
born on a stormy night.

But that was once upon a time,
now it's a brand new world.
Gimmee the future, gimmee the future,
gimmee the future with a modern girl.
Gimmee the future, gimmee the future,
gimmee the future with a modern girl.

Somewhere just between the past
and somethin' dawnin' new.
There's a break in the chain,
a skip in the clock,
girl that's where I'm gonna find you.

Between the boy I was before
and what I'm gonna be.
There's a clash on the border,
a flame in the sky,
girl that's where you gonna find me.

Can't ya hear the planet groanin',
like a broken down machine.
Rusted with the guilty tears
...
