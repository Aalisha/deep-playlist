The road ahead
Is going nowhere fast
The light is red
Looks like I'm gonna crash

I've lost all direction
Right is left and up is down
So here's my soul confession
Right now, check it out

I wanna lose control
I'm ready to let go
Call me crazy

And I've made up my mind
Kiss the past goodbye
Come and change me

What took so long
For me to let You in
