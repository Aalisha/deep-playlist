Getting over you, ohh
Getting over you, ohh

Hopeless
A single word that you would not expect from me, from me
I take it like it's coming from an enemy
The scene was meant to be
I see it coming after all the worst of me would fall
Make this now or never

See it on my face I'm getting over you, ohh
I'm getting over you, ohh
The place it takes me now
Well is it far enough
I'm getting over you, ohh
(Make this now or never)
