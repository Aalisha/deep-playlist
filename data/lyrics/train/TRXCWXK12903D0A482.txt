Hold me closer
If you'd kill for me, I'd die for you
Ask me now I'd say I do
If you'd kill for me, I'd die for you

I've never seen these things so clear, 
Stared in the face of the things I fear, 
Petrified, I lost my breath.
I'm scared, I'm scared.
Stuck on the though of having nothing left.
I'm scared, I'm scared.

I've never seen these things so clear, 
These words I speak, I'm being so sincere
Electrified, straight from the heart
I'm scared, I'm scared.
Caught on the brink of being torn apart.
I'm scared, I'm scared.
