Ohh, ohh

My foolish heart, it made me fall in love with him, I know
It goes with how I was feelin', ohh
My foolish heart was broken when he left us in the cold
Now I'm left to fix the pieces, ohh

I told you once, I told you twice
The next time I wont be so nice
You so quick to give it up
Boy, you don't think about us
You don't think about us
I wont let you keep, keep hurtin' me
If you gone keep causin' me pain
I wont let you keep, keep hurtin' me
I'm bout to take you out the game

My foolish heart will jump into the deepest of the seas
Even if it cannot swim, ohh
...
