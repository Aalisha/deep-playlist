When you look out your window and see her runnin' away
You start addin' things up, how you let her down
Now she's makin' you pay, by runnin' away

It's just like some movie, one you've already seen
You're playin' the part of the guy
All alone up there on the screen, you know what that means

Your sight's twenty-twenty and you're lookin' behind
You only wish you had thought of something you could do
To ease her mind, instead what you find is she's runnin' away
...
