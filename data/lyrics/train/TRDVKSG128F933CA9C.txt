I remember way back, way back when
I said I never wanna see your face again
'Cause you were loving, yes you're loving somebody else
And I knew, oh yes, I knew I couldn't control myself

And now they bring you back into my life again
And so I put on a face just like your friends
But I think you know, oh yes, you know what's going on
'Cause the feelings in me, oh yes, in me are burning strong

But I will never be your stepping stone
Take it all or leave me alone
I will never be your stepping stone
