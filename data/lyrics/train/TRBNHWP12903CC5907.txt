Your eyes, tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heart beat
I know you like what you see

Hold me, I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited, I can feel you
Getting hotter, oh baby

I'll take you down, I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more
If you want more, more, more

Then, jump for my love
Jump in and feel my touch
Jump, if you want to taste
My kisses in the night then
Jump, jump for my love

I know my heart
(I know my heart can make you happy)
(Can make you happy)

Jump in, you know these arms
(You know these arms can feel you up)
(Can feel you up)
