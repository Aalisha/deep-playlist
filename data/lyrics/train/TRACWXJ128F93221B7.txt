On the planet Earth spinning 'round and 'round
And as I cast my gaze about,

After I'd shown them to the holy road, the holy road
After I'd shown them to the holy road, the holy road

Well, I laid a bounty in their hands
And only gave them ten commands
But they never learned their lessons very well
And they drove My garden straight to hell
That's when they fell off of the holy road, the holy road
