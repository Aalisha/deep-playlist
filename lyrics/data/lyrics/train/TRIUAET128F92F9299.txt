Last night I thought to back when we was in the 'Lac
Listening to tracks on my back, have you seen her?
Then I told you I wanna get between ya

Baby I know you remember that Marvin Gaye
And some of that Jodeci
So baby come here and let me sing to you
While we're freakin' in between the sheets

Shorty can I sing to you? Baby bring it near
Let me whisper something in your ear
Shorty can I sing to you 'cause I know what you like?
Let me bring romance into your life

Sing it with me girl
La da da, la da da
La da da, la da da
La da da da da

Shorty can I ask you one more question?
