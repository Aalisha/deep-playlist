Hottest, finest

Everybody wanna be wearing jewelery
Escapin' reality, running the city
So you wanna be number 1?
Don't forget where you came from

It's not about me and you
It's about the things we do
Most guys don't have a clue, material issues
How can I make you see
The real things in life are free?

Hottest, finest

We don't someone
That can show you what true love means
Need someone
That'll never let you down
Need someone
To tell you that they love ya and always be around

You could be the hottest
You could be the finest
It don't matter to me

You could be the baddest
Be the most stylish
You could be rolling in money

It don't matter what you got
If your heart is out of love

You could be the hottest
You could be the finest
It don't matter to me
