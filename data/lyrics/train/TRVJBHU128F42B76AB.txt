* send corrections to the typist
Shout out to my motherf**king self
Ya heardz?
I'm talking bout these bitches
These hoes
These play ass niggaz
?
(Mannie)
I ain't the one
That get your tune up and you all done, bitch
I'm looking nothing like your momma, son
You get me messed up
Guess what? I ain't him
Get up and pick your shit up
And go with him
Nothing, nada, Nathanial
I can't stand you
Can you leave
Please can you
F**ked up weed
Leave my shit
Stanky ass bitch
F**k your ass ho
A nigga still rich
My lawyer stay down
Lay down
And play the playground
You joke ass, broke ass
Ran out of smoke ass
Gay ass, oh
Bitch touch the wall
Old sissy ass wannabe
Missy ass y'all
Some of these niggaz are bitches too
Look at yourself
It could be you
But that's the way they do it bro
I always knew that though
Nigga had gays in his ways
Cos he walk with a
Switch, twitch
Funny looking bitch
Nobody likes you
Fake ass snitch
You need more people
We don't believe you
F**k you in your ass
You can never be my equal
(Woman/Mannie)
(Baby)
I ain't the one
To get played like a pool party
Trick money
Get nothing bitch
