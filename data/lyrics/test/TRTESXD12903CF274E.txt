I'm thinking it through
I'm thinking of you
Try to remind myself to move
The nightmare unfolds
Should have never let her go
Alone in this empty room
Let it burn

I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking it through
I try to remind myself to move
I wait by the phone
You're never coming home

Let it burn, let it bleed
Let it go that Sunday morning
I don't understand
