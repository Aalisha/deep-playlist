Today I'm just a lonely man
But tomorrow I'll be a king
Blessing all my subjects
Cast a far and insecurities

The whole wide world will watch me
As I walk up to my throne
Nights in shining armor
Stand around to heed my call

But wait a minute, I'm still lonely
I guess anyone can dream
But when you lose someone it seems
So unimportant
