We saw the summer night
We drank down the sober sky
Left our mark into the concrete
Burned up all our tires sleeping

Words flow as we are fading
Watch the canvas become our painting
Not all roads lead to Rome
'Cause this one leads to the hell back home and

Oh oh, this is what we do
Oh oh, this is what we do

You can say, it's wasted ignorance
But we're okay, just living in the wreckage
...
