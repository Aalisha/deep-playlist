C'mon pack your bags, clear the floor
Let's step out through the open door
Leave a note that says goodbye

Build a new house down by the sea
Get to the place we were meant to be
You'll know it when you smile

Up at the window, searchin' the sky
Looking for the rainbow and don't ask my
I wanna see the rainbow come
Hey

We'll be leaving on all sides, hmmm
