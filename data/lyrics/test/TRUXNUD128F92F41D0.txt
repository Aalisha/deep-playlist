While you skip the night, I stay up till 5
We may meet again when semester ends
So with all my might, I sit down to write
Here lies precious pen failure to the end

And while you were gone I let my sores out bleeding open
I was cold, I was sold, I met a road sign leading nowhere
Doublecrossed and erased I let a monster run me over
I was lost don't know where there was a road-sign leading nowhere
