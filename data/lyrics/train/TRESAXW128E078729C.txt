He sleeps with a chainsaw
Got eyes like an outlaw
He takes a two smoke walk
And he don't like to talk

And he don't like change
And he don't like change
You may think, he's deranged
But he'd rather be home
Home, home on the strange

He's a Canadian icon
He's sleeps with his clothes on
He likes to work with his hands
He's an apolitical man
