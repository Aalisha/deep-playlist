I feel some funk comin' on
I feel some funk comin' on strong
Feel some funk comin on
Everybody
(Stand up)
I wanna see
Let me see you
(Stand up)
And raise your hand
I said
(Stand up)
I wanna see, yeah
(Stand up)
And raise your hand
Hand, hand, hand, hand, hand, hand
Oww
(Turn it loose)
What you waiting for?
(Turn it loose)
It's time to get it on, come on
(Turn it loose)
(Turn it loose)
I want you to turn up your radio
Here comes that record you been waitin' for
I said, turn up your radio
'Cause we don't know, easy to get it on
Now tell me what you waitin' for?
Why don't you get out on the floor?
Now tell me what you waitin' for?
Ready, somebody, get out on the floor
Let me hear my horn
Don't know, don't know who's Michael
I said don't, don't know, don't know who's Michael
You gotta keep your feet on movin
So let's keep the music groovin'
Oww, what you waitin' for?
Why don't you get out on the floor?
Now tell me what you waitin' for?
Ready, somebody, get out on the floor
People, you wanna be rockin' to the music
I tell ya, you wanna be sure of gettin' down, down, down
You wanna be dancin' to the music
(You wanna be dancin' to the music)
