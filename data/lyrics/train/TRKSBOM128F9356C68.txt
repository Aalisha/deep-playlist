I'm so glad that you decided to come

Go ahead make yourself comfortable darlin'
I've got a proposition for you
There's a room available inside of my heart
And I hope it will be taken by you

You can bring whatever you wanna bring baby
Each and everyone of your friends
And if you want a dog or a big bullfrog
Hell I've even got room for them

I'm so glad you decided to come

Another day and I could've gone mad
Another day and it might've gotten bad
Another day and I might have betrayed
Every scruple I have

You cause in me an impossible craving
