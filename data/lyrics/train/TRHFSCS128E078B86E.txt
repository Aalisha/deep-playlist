(Jian, speaking/whispering)
Take... We can take a trip up to the corner...
corner... corner... It's not too far...

Ok, I'm ready, anytime.

(Jian)
I have a college pal who
Says we can pay one price for two
Uhh, Just ask for 'Roger', at

(All)
Video Bargainville

(Spoken by Jian)
We can take a trip up to the corner, it's not too far, especially in the car
There's a friendly store with nice decore, and lots of posters on the door
Once past the counter and the news stand, with a free bag of popcorn in your hand
You're ready for the world - No, not the band... But a fine selection in video land

Don't be too confused by the little reviews
On the back of the box, just pick up the boxes, all the boxes you can use
The hipedi-hoppest videos in the land
Maybe something foreign, maybe something panned, maybe something formerly banned
Perhaps it's something you can watch with friends, or something that inevitably lends
Itself to shapely curves and bends of exploited women and their friends
