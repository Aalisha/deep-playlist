The night was all that I'd once known
When I was small and all alone
Where dreams and visions never played
Towns put on their cheap parade
With cheap trombones and plastic horns
And choirs faking opera songs
I nursed my coffee til the dawn
And waited for another day

The lady on the second floor
She squints her eyes at bills galore
Opens up a cabinet door
Sippin' on bourbon through the day
...
