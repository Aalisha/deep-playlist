Ooh, hoo, hoo
Hot night she's running right and magic's in the air
So what do I care
The one in red straight ahead sets my soul on fire
We're taking it higher

The message from the coast is loud and clear
Cool running
The second I get off I'm out of here
Cool running, yeah
Ooh, hoo

Aim south, we're chilling out
The boss is on the phone, tell him I'm gone
