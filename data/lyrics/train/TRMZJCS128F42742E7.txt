they tore up our kisses and ran
on tomorrow's pages
and the lions have eaten the lamb
on tomorrow's pages
there's a day of your life in your hands
full of people you don't understand
in my highwire days
i can see all the way
i see through the games you play
in my highwire days
they pushed all the buttons and things
