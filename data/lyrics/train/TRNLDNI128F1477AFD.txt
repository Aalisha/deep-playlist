Rain fallin in a paper cup
Got her head turned down and her collar turned up
There's a sorrow in her eye and a sadness in her sigh
But she ain't gonna talk unless you come again, come again
Sitting on a curb in the afternoon
Watching colors dance around her feet to a tune
You know she knows she knows she knows
There goes it goes it goes
You better come again

Chorus:
I got a lot to learn baby...(2x)
I got a lot to learn
So please won't you teach me
I got a lot to learn baby...(2x)
And everybody wants a shot at you darling

Oh she said
