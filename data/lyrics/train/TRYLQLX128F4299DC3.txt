You can try to make this better
You can lie and make this better
You rely on every reason under the sun
Just try for fun

You could live to where there's weather
You could love me, if you'd rather
Still I'd like to have tricked you
If stowaways make use of days

Still, you fall in and out of love like this
When you know everyone's afraid of that
If I know you better than you let on
You'll drown the sun

You can read my heart and travel
Isn't that how love unravels
...
