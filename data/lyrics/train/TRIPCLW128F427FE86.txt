You're never alone
Still you're on your own
You cannot see the light
Although you face the sun

The things you see
Are filtered through belief so strong
Passed on through DNA and society
I could never believe that the veil
I saw just came from my mind
The illusion is gone

A swarming pattern of frequencies
Is what this would be?
Without the decoders called the eyes
Bent into shape as thoughts define what you see
...
