Ooooooooh
I'm caught up in the middle
But I'll take it to the end
It's coming back together
And it's breaking down again
If I could find a reason
I'd say you were my friend
If I could find a reason
I'd say it once again
When I'm with you
The days are bittersweet
I still can't remember
What it feels to be complete
Yeaaaah
I've tried pretending
But it drops off my feet
I don't know what it's coming to
But I'm looking through the glass darkly
