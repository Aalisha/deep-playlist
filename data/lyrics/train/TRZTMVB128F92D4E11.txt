Hey where have you been?
Where did you go? Looking for innocence?
Shame is holding you down, selling you out, won't you come back again?

'Cause you've found a way to go on for days, pretending to live
But you are not ok, with all of that weight, you need to give up

Come now just let it go, let it fall down, let it all flow like
The water that's rushing in over your soul 'til there's nothing left
Won't you come to me and rest?
