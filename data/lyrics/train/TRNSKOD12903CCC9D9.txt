Now he's got those stars in his eyes
Pulled down from the midnight sky
And it aint gunna be like you thought it was
But it, could be like you make it now,
Shoulda please
Take a step back for me
What the hell did you come all the way down to be?
I know you don't see it
But I do
So keep on moving and I'll walk with you
And we can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cuz I feel like giving up
We can zipcord across the sky
You and I
Now how hard do I have to try
To find somebody like me
Little more like me
Cuz I feel like giving up

(Chorus)
I wanna turn us all around
Now
Take a step down
How can we all get along
When we're so violent and young?

Hold me back
I think I'm bout to blow
Hit me here, then you know
...
