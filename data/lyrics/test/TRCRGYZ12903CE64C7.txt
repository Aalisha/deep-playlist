He's followed her up and he followed her down
And into the room where she lay
She hadn't the strength for to flee from his arms
Nor the tongue for to answer him nay

"Rise up, rise up, my pretty Polly
Rise up and go with me
And I will take you to North Scotland
And there you'll married be

Go fetch you a bag of your father's gold
And some of your mother's fee
And two fine horses out of the stable
Where there stands thirty and three"

So she's lit upon her nimble-going brown
He's mounted the dapple-gray
And when they came to North Scotland
'Twas just three hours 'til day

"Light you down, light you down, my pretty Polly
Light you down, I say to thee
For six kings' daughters have I drowned here
