Birds on the wing at the end of the day
The trees of green and brown you see
Have suddenly turned grey

Don't be too sad when you're waiting for death
The message on the garden wall says
Mickey Mouse is bad

Ooh, Need, I need, I need, I need her
The broken arrows in the door, there's lots of Indians
Ooh, Need, I need, I need, I need her
The grass that grows above her hair
The pretty patterned teddy bear
Aah, aah aah yeah yeah
