*Verse 1*
is it me.
who'll never comprimise,
wanna see things thru my eyes.
which means it's my way

or is it you.
who's always shutting down,
never wanting to talk about,
the problems we got.

or is it we
to blame for all that's going down.
(we say that i love you but we can't work it out)
it's making us not want to stay around
we need to sit down and ask ourselves.

*Chorus*
Why can't we (Why can't we)
Why can't we get along.
when we know we can't be away from eachother for long
Why can't we
Why can't we get along.
when at the end of the day we know we gotta come home
