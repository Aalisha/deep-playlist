Again and again and again and again
Do it again, do it again
Again and again

It's a shame, it's a shame
It's a perfect shame
Creep under my door and we do it again, oh oh

It's so easy and easy
And easy and easy
And creepy and creepy
And creepy and creepy
Oh oh, again, again, again

Again and again and again and again
Do it again, do it again
Again and again and again and again
