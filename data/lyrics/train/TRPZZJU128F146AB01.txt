He's always there to brighten up your day
Always there in every way
When it’s cold and dreary
And your faith is growing weary
You don’t have to be afraid

He’s always there, just ask for what you need
He’ll be there if you believe
Open up your heart, invite Him to come in
He’ll turn your life around
