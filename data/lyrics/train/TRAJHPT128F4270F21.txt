The girl I love, she got long black wavy hair
I do declare, the girl I love, yeah
She got long black wavy hair
Yeah, her mother and her father, lordy
They sure don't, sure don't allow me there

Well I, I'm goin' back to my baby, Lord I
I swear, I wouldn't lie, yeah
I never saw that sweet woman yeah
