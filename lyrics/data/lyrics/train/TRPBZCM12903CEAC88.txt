Four walls surround my bleeding heart by my own hand
You are an angel and I know you understand
But that don't keep the blood from rushing to my face
Or keep the darkest days away
The feeling's numb and hollow and it calls my name
It moves my feet, it's in my blood, every last vein
My words will never...

You said it, you said it
Our time's a waste but you can't bleed this out, forget it
Drained dry and overrated
Regret it, yeah, I regret it
Letting those words escape but they're dying out now

(Come bleed this out with me)
Come bleed this all out with me
(Come bleed this out)
We'll have an endless dying dream
...
