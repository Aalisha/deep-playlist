You've been hurt and you've been down
You've been set out of your course, boy
And pushed around
Flying high, but oh, you felt so low
When she walked out of that door
And left you on your own
Don't reach out for me with an apology
I'll never suffer your desire
Don't reach out for me with an apology
But I'll share it
Why don't you take my hand
Come away, come out of your blues
Boy, everything you give
So I give something to you
I'll take you down, deep down where the love lives
Where love lives, where love lives
Follow me down, deep down where the love lives
...
