Girl I got a question needing your attention
Something that you can't avoid
Gotta to get a chance to
Trying to get an answer
Somewhere in between the noise
Think you got a reason
Everytime you're screaming
Shouting till you got no voice
Don't know where your head is
I don't want to feel this baby
But I got no choice

Tell you what you want from me
Is there somewhere
That you'd rather be?
'Cause everytime that we're alone...

I'm watching it all fade out
I'm feeling my heart grow colder
Bridges are burning down
And I just want to get away
I'm hearing a different sound
I'm hoping the worst is over
Waiting to hit the ground...
