extra sensory perception
Between mythology and truth
Cold emotion goes deep inside of you
Talking bout the gena rain storm
Slow motion rising from the pool
Mysterious voices are guiding you
Every single bone inside your body
A combination of souls and their futicles
Pay attention to the feeling
I'll go back if your not
Of the strong sensation
Girl its a new sensation
