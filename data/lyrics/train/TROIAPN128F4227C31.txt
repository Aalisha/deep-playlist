Cathedrals have tried in vain
To show the image of Your face.
But we are, by Your design,
The signature of Divine.

We'll always sing Your name.
Forever and today.

Yahweh, Yahweh...
Great is Your glory when You go before me
Oh, we sing...
Holy, Holy!
Your ways are lovely. So high above me.
Yahweh

The fortunes of kings and queens
Are wasted chasing what we've seen.
