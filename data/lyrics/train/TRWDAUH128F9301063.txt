And the man keeps sayin' 'Do you take this woman
to be your awful wedded wife?' Heh, heh

And then I started thinkin' about no more winkin'
At the pretty little gals a-boppin' by.
No more dancin' and new romancin'
Lord, it made me want to sit down and cry.
Aw, no pool shootin' and a rootin' and a-tootin'
With the boys if I take you for my wife.
I can't go no place, I gotta look at your face
For the rest of my dog gone life.
This is it!

Ah, honey, what am I doin' here in the first place?
You knooooooow I don't go for this marraige bit!
I was only kiddin'! Hahahahahahaha
And there's your daddy sittin' over there with a shotgun
