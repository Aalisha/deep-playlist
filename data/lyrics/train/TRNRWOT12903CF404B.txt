We both knew the answers
To our misery and pain that stained our being
Lost in clouds of comfort
So afraid to take the fall into desolation

What could make you fade away?
I can't pretend that there's nothing left
What could make you fade away?
If there's something then I need it to fade away
Make you fade away,
Why can't I make you fade away?

Searching for completion
And so we venture separate ways to find fulfillment
