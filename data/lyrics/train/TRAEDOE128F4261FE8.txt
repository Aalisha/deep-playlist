I'd like to kill nobody

Hold me to the light
All this for me
Arms wrapped around me

Breathe
Out
Gold
Cold

Hold me to the light
Hold me to the light
Hold me to the light
Hold me to the light

Hold me to the light
All this for me
Arms wrapped around me

Breathe
Out
Gold
Cold

All I could want
All I could need
...
