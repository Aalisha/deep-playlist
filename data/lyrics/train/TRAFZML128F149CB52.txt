She's out of luck
And out of hope
And out of cigarettes
Misunderstood, with naked pictures on the internet
Her social deviance is teasing me
I know what I want

And I'm really gonna, really let her know (woah)
That I like her, but I just don't care enough
To fool around with love

Yeah, my baby's pretty as a car crash
Sexy as the stinger of a hornet in your arm
Just another modern swinger
Screaming catch me if you can
With a cigarette in hand
And its love
It's heavy and it hurts and it's love

Strung out on blow
She doesn't know why she's not feeling good
Dropped out of school
...
