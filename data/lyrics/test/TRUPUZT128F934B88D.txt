When I tread the verge of Jordan
Lost within the hope of freedom
Not for control
But in light of our cause

Bid my anxious fears
Will subside
With another death, in another

Rise up
This age of silence
A god with a quick fix of

Pulling on
These two words: Apathy, Sacrifice

Awakened soul
Look fourth and see
Ungodliness rip open me
For all I have contempt for greed
Death of deaths
No fears I see
