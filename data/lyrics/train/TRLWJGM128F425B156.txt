We'd feel much better if we sunk this treasure
And laid our armor down
These precious metals and these captain's letters
They are no use to us now

In the day we struggle with fatigue much greater
Than any offer was
We bow down and worship these bandits and cowboys
Unable to hold their own guns

I know that soldiers are not paid to think
But something is making us sick
Onward and steady
Able and young
In the valley of the low low sun

In the shade we wander along a highway's shoulder
Into the back of beyond
...
