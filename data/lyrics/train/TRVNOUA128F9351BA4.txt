In your eyes
I am magnified
I peep your sides
I do fantasize
I make your mind
And pretend that you've lied

And I take it all the way
I take it all the way
'Cause you taste just like the river

Babe, you've played my heart
But the way that you've played, it was art

In your eyes
I've been televised
Great big lies
As evil as you flies
