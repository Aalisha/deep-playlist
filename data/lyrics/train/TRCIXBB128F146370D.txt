You've gone away, left us today
For another place and time
With so much more to give, so much life to live
So much love you've left behind

That's what makes it hard for me
That what makes it so unfair
I only know that someday, somewhere

We will meet again
We will meet again
Though I must let you go
I know it's not the end

It may take a lifetime
But wait for me my friend
I promise you
We will meet again

Don't you cry, at least please try
...
