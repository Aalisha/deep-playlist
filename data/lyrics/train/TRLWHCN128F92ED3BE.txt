With my winter time
My idols and stage fright
In another night
Where the lights are loud and bright

One dream from wakin' up saved
Too shy to hold in the rage

I know no luxury
Of knowing what your eyes read
I know one million ways
To always pick the wrong thing to say
Oh yes I do

A love that you never gave
Always one time zone away
Oh it's not out of spite
Oh I just know what's right
So that's why
