Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, I met myself a cowgirl
What she want? Put me on

Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, I met myself a cowgirl
What she want? Put me on

Okay, this is how it went down
Sunday afternoon with the fellas at the play ground
Chillin', my father honked his horn at me
Said, I have a show in Texas and I gotta leave

Texas, wow! I've never been
Maybe I can find a new hang out friend
Anyway, packin' up my bags on my way
Signing autographs as I run to catch the plane

I seen her, chubby cheeks with long braids
Cute face, same age, she played hard to get
As I offered out my name, she just walked away
With a smile, oh, my little cowgirl

Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, I met myself a cowgirl
What she want? Put me on

Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, lil' mama
Yippee ki yo, yippee yay, I met myself a cowgirl
