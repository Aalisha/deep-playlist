How did I find myself in a world,
I can’t see through,
And I’m standing right beside you,
I’m hoping that you don’t move,

Blocking our views so they don’t get older,
But you keep on moving over,
You become part of the view,
And part of the world that I see through,

And you have been gone too long,
Gone too long,
Gone too long,

And you have been gone too long,
...
