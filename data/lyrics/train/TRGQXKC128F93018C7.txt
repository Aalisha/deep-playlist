We all drink to forget
Some of us more than most
When reality gets too real
And the fires of hell too close
But I'm here to let you know that
You can make it through
If you believe that someone's watchin' over you

Call it an angel
Call it a muse
And call it karma that yo've got comin' to you
What's the difference
What's it in a name
What matters most is never ever losin' faith
'Cause it's gonna be alright
You're not alone tonight
...
