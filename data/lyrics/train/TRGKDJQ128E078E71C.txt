I, I know I'm a dreamer
It's easy to see I want to be a believer
And fly right through the air
Now I'm wide awake
I want you to take me there
The things that you told me

And dreams aren't enough
Life is so lonely
I need someone to believe in
Are you in love?
Can't you see that's everything to me
That's enough

Magdalene, let me hear it said so I am sure
