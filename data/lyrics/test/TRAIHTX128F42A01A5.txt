Why you turned out the way you did
That thunderstorm is still crashing in your cranium
Find that all these funny faces look the same
I know who's to blame, but I swore I wouldn't say

It's time that I got moving on
As you're still burning the dress you wore to senior prom
Trying forget how you've been touched
I loved you so I told you, but it didn't matter much

And I'm trying to figure out
What you're all about
...
