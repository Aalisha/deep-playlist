I'm having a notion
It's a strange, the strangest emotion
I'm all wrapped up with my head in the clouds
The sweet child thinks he doesn't deserve me yeah
But I'm not that proud
I'd walk for miles to see that handsome face
To be with you baby I'd go anyplace
So you say that you ain't got money
Well I don't care
Cause I'm so in love with you honey
What I got I'll share


Take me by the hand
Help me move my mountains aside yeah
Help me understand
Because love is stronger than
It'll serve you longer than pride
