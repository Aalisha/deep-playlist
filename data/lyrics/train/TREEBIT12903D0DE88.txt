There's a way to make it out in time
Keep the cash under the mattress
They're down in the streets
Run for cover

And if your money's ain't no good
That's fine
While everyone's ducking it out
And taking names
Well, I'll just take a number
'Cause I

No, I don't care at all
No, I don't care at all
No, no, no
...
