Jah-Jah!
The children crying in the wilderness, that's right.
Jah-Jah!
The children crying in the wilderness.
Send us a prophet, to warn the nation.
All the children in this creation,
All the people that you see
Will be the children of the Most High.

Jah-Jah!
All the people that you see
Will be the children of the Most High.
