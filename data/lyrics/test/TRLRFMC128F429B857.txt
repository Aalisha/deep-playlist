See through how everyone sees you
They think that you're an idiot
But they must know an idiot
Cause you were born on idiot's time
If you stop or continue
You'll still be an idiot
With all the other idiots

And everyday there's a new way back
To the very place that it all began
But your heart was telepathic
When you died on the Atlantic, 1975
And your hands meticulously crafted
