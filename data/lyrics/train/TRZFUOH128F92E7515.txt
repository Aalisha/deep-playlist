I tried to tell you but I couldn´t find a word
Maybe, I did and you misunder stood

I guess, I thought it better for never we should be
I waited too long now, I´m bound for Tennes see

There´s no use wonderin`
Things are never what they seem
No sense in turning round
Looking back won't change a thing

That ship is sailing
It´s gone out on the sea
I waited too long
...
