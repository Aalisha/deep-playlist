I'll trade you my heart for your heart baby
Give you all my kisses to do
I'll trade you my heart for your heart baby
Give you all my kisses to do
If you feel you'd like to make a deal
Carve your pistol and rooty-too-too
Bang-bang-bang, bang-bang-bang
Bang-bang-bangedy-bang-bang
Bang-bang-bang
Bangedy-bang I'll trade you my lips for your lips baby
Give you all my huggin' to do
