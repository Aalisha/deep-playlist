Phoenix seems so far)

(6 o'clock) by the time I get to Phoenix
She'll be risin'
She'll find the note I left hanging
On her door

She'll laugh when she (ha ha ha ha) reads the part
That says (I'm leaving) I'm leavin'
'Cause I've left that girl, so many times
Before

(10 o'clock) by the time I make Albuquerque
She'll be workin'
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me
A call
