I know this girl
And know you well
You want her now
She needs you now
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
SheÂ'll be for you
I know she will
I know she will

Take my advice
Treat her good, treat her right
Smile for her
SheÂ'll be your world
No matter where you go
No matter what you do
SheÂ'll be for you
I know she will
I know she will

She told me how she longed for you
