Doo da doo doo doo a doo da doo doo doo

Who is the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
Rolling down the highway in my Jimmy hauling freight
From Chicago to St Louis Lord I see her every day
A double clutching weasel like me can hardly ever get a girl to look at him that way
Like the girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway

Well what a girl wearing nothing but a smile
And a towel in the picture on the billboard in the field near the big old highway
I bet it wouldn't take her very long to get gone
