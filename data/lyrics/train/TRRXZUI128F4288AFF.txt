Well if she rocks like a spitter, and she flows like a spitter
Then you know she's a spitter, and she probably is
And if she walks like a spitter, and she talks like a spitter
Don't floss please forgive her, she probably is
And if she writes like a spitter, hold the mic like a spitter
Pause boys, ain't no gutter, you know that she is
And if she rhymes like a spitter, know she rhymes like a spitter
Who rhymes like a spitter, you know who it is

A burnt sky scorched the earth's flesh
At the same time the murderous text arose
Like a phoenix with the glow of death
A poet two steps ahead like Noah just left
Mo' and sex holding techs
No, I'm not what you'd expect

Golden pen, exposing men false
Like a fallen disciple, All in the bible
The cause is the calling haiku
The love of words language liquor phrased
Slang in Mecca raised skyscraper
Look a future brighter then your jewels of praise

This life must be what divorce caught be like
I fall apart right just to stay right
...
