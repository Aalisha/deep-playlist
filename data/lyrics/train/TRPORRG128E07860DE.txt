[Intro]
Aww, yes how you do today
My name is N.O.R.E, that's pronounced Nore
Here on behalf of thugged out militainment
I'm here to see the president of the record label
I believe his name is Mr.Isenhawk
I been out here quite some time
So, aww can you let him know I been waiting
And aww can he please hurry his ass up before I bounce you undadig!

[Chorus]
So whats the matter Mr. CEOOOO
You can't look in my face and feel my pain yooo
Shit give a hood nigga a chance
Anigga won't rob you, plus a nigga ain't gone dance
So whats the matter Mr. CEOOOO
You can't look in my face and feel my pain yooo
shit give a hood nigga a chance
A nigga won't rob you, plus a nigga ain't gone dance

[Verse 1]
Ayo nigga through in the key and let the engine spark
Yo I love the rap game, hate the buiness part
An give a hood nigga a chance, that's what they won't do
Cause I stay up in the office, with the toast too!
An shit fuck a check, I rather cash
And you know I shoot niggaz, don't bring up the past
But I just came home, and ain't leaving alone
Give a nigga one chance, im a have the shit sown
I'm a hard worker, I don't need no handout
I opportunity and im a expand out
It's militainment, military entertainment
Brand new hot shit nobody with
So invest your cheese, and pay this thug
