Got a visit from the dead dog
He slept at the end of my bed last night
He could tell I was fading
And somehow fighting against the light

And everyday when I open my eyes
I see unwanted funerals
Maybe I'll be buried alive
But I've never seen you so beautiful

Oh, I'm staying in today
And watch the others play
Oh, wash my sins away
Like all good children, I mean what I say
