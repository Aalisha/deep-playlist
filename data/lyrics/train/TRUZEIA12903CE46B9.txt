She passed, she's class
Candy for the eye and a twinkle in her smile
She looks like butter wouldn't melt, oh oh oh
He's bewitched, her daddy's rich
You can see she comes from money but she's still a little honey
And it looks like butter wouldn't melt, oh no

He stuttered oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I never thought I'd say this
But I think you're so aw-aw-aw-aw-awfully nice
It's alright, she said fine

He was a little bit scared, a little apprehensive
He was just a boy from a local comprehensive
But he'd heard that
Posh girls have good manners but they go like the clappers because they never got to hang around with boys at school
Posh girls have good manners but they go like the clappers because they never got to hang around with boys at school

She seems pristine
