Ay let me get that ski-mask D-Tay
Priest, load up the strap mayne
Let me go get some money mayne

[Young Buck]
Life ain't 'posed to be like this, robbery and poverty
24 hour shifts to keep this cocaine off of me
Y'all ain't livin how I'm livin, one mo' week I'm seein prison
Cause to get what I'm after, a nigga might be missin
I ain't listenin to shit, hit the Sweet and load the clip
Cause if crime didn't pay, then I'd be still on the strip
You niggaz still runnin yo' lips, I be runnin them zips
Up and down the interstate, makin ten G's a trip
A hardheaded nigga, do whatever it takes
to go and get that bread nigga, heard what I said nigga?
Been misled for a long time, waited in a long line
Finally I'm here, now this rap game is mine
Keep the herb burnin, ain't nuttin changed cause I'm worth somethin
Y'all know the Young Buck, I'ma leave this earth bluntin
But still carry, the chrome Dirty Harry
Cause your boy got to have that, by any means necessary

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
