This mornings's drier than ever you put your shoes on part your hair to the right to the left your party made you all part alike yesterday times changed you see the party has lied the sky has never turnedred but it's not what you thought what it used to really be either need a little boost in a little glass no toast no fuzz just the two mates from the estate waiting outside below zero and fever
Who's gone?
Who stole the sun?
Who sold the soul in the search of the masterplan?
If only heaven's made of peroxide i wouldn't then need any other lies
