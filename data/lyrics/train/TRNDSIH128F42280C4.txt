Talk to me baby, whisper in my ear,
Talk to me baby, whisper in my ear,
A come a little closer, don't you have no fear!

Don't you know? I love you so!
Don't you know? I love you so!
When I holler hey! ko-ko-mo!

Heard what you told me, heard what you said!
Heard what you told me, heard what you said!
Don't you worry my purdy, I don't lose my head!
