We're conquered all but still we're searching for blood
To thirst the quench a thousand years old
I want to hear the screams of nation's colliding
Soaked in sorrow the fate of tomorrow

You better run... run far away
From everything you ever wanted to be
Your destiny is mine...
To defy this is suicide... it's suicide!

To Reign Again
