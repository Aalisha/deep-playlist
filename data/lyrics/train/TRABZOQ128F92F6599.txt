Time heals it all is what they say
Leave it at that and you'll be okay
Expressing yourselves with no word
I'm left out to long for what I've heard
Courageous to talk in the silence
Leaving the doubt and the violence
As I'm waiting for the time to heal my pain

I'll hold on just one minute
I'll hold on a little more
I'll hold on and make sure that you know
...
