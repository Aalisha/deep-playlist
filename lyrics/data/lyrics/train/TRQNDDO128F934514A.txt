My father was a farmer
But his head was in the sky
He worked everyday but Sunday
'Til the day he died
He prayed for rain and thunder
And listened for the sound
In the dry years he went under
He never got off the ground

We all dream when we're younger
That we will do great things
Me, I used to have a hunger
To wear a pilot's wings
