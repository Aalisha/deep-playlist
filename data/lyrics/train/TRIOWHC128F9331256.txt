(eleanor mcevoy)

In case of loving unreturned
Unrequited fingers burn
Don't you blame yourself at all
There is no blame, there is no crime
This madness happens all the time
No one there to break your fall

I understand how hard it's been
I've been there too and I have seen
What running after love can do
That feeling deep down in your soul
That searing, empty, gaping hole
Has dug a hole in my life too

My darling, my darling
So crazy, so charming
It's just that it happened too soon
