I got pockets full of rocks, and twisted sleepy sheets
When I don't know what to say, I make death defying leaps
Towards you everyday, until we're orbiting
I can almost hear your thoughts, and see your missing angles

Don't go that way, you might fall in like a stone
Collect your doubts and you set them on, the wet black bough
First kisses, near misses, teacher hisses "Tell me what you've learned"
Everything I thought I wanted in this world, has got me turned, upside down
