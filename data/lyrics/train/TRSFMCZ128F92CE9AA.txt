Goodbye my friend
Goodbye my love
You're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be united by and by
United by and by
Goodbye!
No handshake to endure
No, there's nothing

It was written in blood!
It was written in blood!
It was written in blood!
Oh god, written in blood!
It was written in blood!
It was written in blood!
Oh my god, it was written in blood!

Let's have no sadness
Furrowed brow
There's nothing new
In dying now

Let's have no sadness
Furrowed brow
There's nothing new
In dying now
Though living is no newer
Though living is no newer
And it was written in blood!

It was written in blood!
It was written in blood!
It was written in blood!
