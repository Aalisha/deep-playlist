I heard you were back in town
I heard you were comin' round
Tryin' to get off the ground
From every road you went down
I walked down the old street
Stiff through the old heat
If you're burnin' on empty
I'll be holding a golden ring

Cause hey, hey, they don't know you like I do
I wait for the whole world to show you
Baby, we're not, not that gone
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever call my name?
Ask me now, I'll give you the reasons
My love will not fade
...
