God, I love her

God, I love her
Don't need no lightning, no thunder
Just always knew You'd let me know
When it was right

I know she cares for me
I'd have to be blind not to see
The love that strikes me blind
Is love that gives me sight

But there's another Man in her life
Another's love stronger than mine
There's another love in her life
...
