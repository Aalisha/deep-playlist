Mr. Bass lies waiting in his kelpy room
Waiting, til comes doom
He comes and them he goes
He sees Orca and then he knows
And I can see Mr. Bass, he's on my wall
I can feel Mr. Bass, he's on my wall
I can taste Mr. Bass, he's on my wall
I can smell Mr. Bass tomorrow
We finished the island with a broken motor
