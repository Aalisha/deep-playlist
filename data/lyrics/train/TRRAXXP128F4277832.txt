I remember the day I called mama on the telephone
I told her mama I'm getting married, I could hear her voice
On the other side of the telephone, she was smiling
And she asked me a question that I proudly answered

She said, "Son did you take time to know her?"
I said mama she's the best but today it hurts me so
To go back to mama and say mama I'm getting divorced
Oh I'm getting divorced

This choice I made didn't work out
The way I thought it would
This choice I made didn't work out
The way I thought it would
It hurts me so mama, mama said to me

It's not easy to understand it son
