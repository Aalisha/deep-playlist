I'll wait by the windows
I'll wait by the door
To make sure you don't come home after dark

Now, I'll wait by the phone
I'll make sure I'm at home
I'll be there when your needin' you know what
Now I can tell you by the things you do
You don't know that I've been watching you
Now I don't understand your games or crazy plans
I'm here for you baby stop playing with my mind

Well, I know what
I feel inside
I trust enough in what my heart tells me
Haven't I been good?
The way I should
Just act like a man and stay here and stand by my side

Chorus:
I'll wait just a little more time
Just a little more time
...
