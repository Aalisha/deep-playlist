Come on and thrill me, thrill me baby
Come on and love me all the time
Come on and thrill me, thrill me baby
Come on and let me know your mind

Don't be scared, things will change
Cuz your friends say things won't stay the same
And if you stay, things will never change
It would feel like, it's gettin' better all the time
So come on baby, come on smile
Come on and thrill me all the time

Come on and thrill me, thrill me baby
When I look into your eyes
