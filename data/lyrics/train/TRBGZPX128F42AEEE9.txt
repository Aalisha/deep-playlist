Before you're pointing at me
There is a possibility
You better turn that thing around
Nothing's come easily
So don't you tread on me
'Cause I will knock you down

Some days it seems it's not worth it
The fight in me is all gone
And I'm not trying to be perfect
But just get one damn thing done
Before I lose control
I pick myself off the floor

Before you're pointing at me
There is a possibility
You better turn that thing around
Nothing's come easily
So don't you tread on me
