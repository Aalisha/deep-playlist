That isolating fan is moving left to right
Like it's mocking me for coming here again last night
I slide from under your arm, you're still out stone cold
As I fumble through the twisted sheets looking for my clothes

I step over that spot on your hardwood floor
The one that always squeaks when I'm sneaking out your door

Some use water, others use beer
Some don't need anything but I end up here
Searching for comfort for this burnout, can't soothe
Chasin' my whiskey with you
...
