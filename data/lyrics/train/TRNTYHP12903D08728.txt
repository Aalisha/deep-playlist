Static tone on the phone, are we breaking again?
Must be something better, babe
All the names that you called out in bed seem to fade
To sometime never but

I won't cry for all the hunger in my heart, no
I won't cry because I've made it through this far

Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now for me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh
Just 'cause you're raising the bet and call the shots now on me, ooh
It really doesn't faze me how you spend your time, ooh
