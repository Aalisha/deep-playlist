L.A. face with the Oakland booty

I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
When a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, wanna pull up tough
You notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

Ooh babe, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your pretty picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes me so horny

Ooh, Rumplesmoothskin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen them dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet,
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette

I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back

So, fellas (yeah) fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (yeah)
Tell her to shake it, shake it
Shake that healthy butt

(L.A. face with the Oakland booty)
Baby got back
(Little in the middle)
Baby got back
(L.A. face with the Oakland booty)
Baby got back
(Little in the middle)
Baby got back

I like 'em round and big
