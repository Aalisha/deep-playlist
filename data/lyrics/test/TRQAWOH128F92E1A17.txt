Whos gonna smoke some weed tonight?
Put your lighters in the air
If you smoke weed like you don't care
I'm addicted to the herb
It's a dangerous love affair
A natural plant that's from the ground
Some smoke ganja by the pound
I'm gonna ask this question now...
Who's gonna smoke some weed tonight? We on top of ganjas, some call it reefer
Others call it blunt, which is actually a cigar
If you put crack to your head,
You're a retard
Don't get twisted, marijuana's not a real drug
Because it's so traditional, in
Places it's not exceptional
Except in Cali where doctors prescribe it, it's medicinal
The rate is so alarmin; people use it for farmin'
All around the word they call ganja Bob Marley
Gnarly! Bikers smokin' weed on their Harley
It's a recession an I'm still gonna party
An, after the club I got the munchies
I'm starving
Way your officer to the Marvin
Marvin...
Put your lighters in the air
If you smoke weed like you don't care
...
