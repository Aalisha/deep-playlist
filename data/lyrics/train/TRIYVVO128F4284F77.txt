hey,
hoh,
he-e-e-ey,
Lay down for love,
lay down,
yeah,

I was alone,
with you on my mind,
look at me now,
you've left me behind,
you're all that matters,
you are my life,
you are the one that should be here by my side,

(you are my lover)
yes you are,
you should be my friend,
don't you think we've got some talkin' to do?
Only love depends on you,

Don't tell me it's over,
'cos it's not over yet, no,
don't tell me you love me when you're tryin' 'a throw this love away,
don't throw this love away,
...
