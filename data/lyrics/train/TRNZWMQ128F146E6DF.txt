Swore that I was living free
Boy, you couldn't talk to me
And the pride that kept me
Didn't know no company

Early morning subway train
Feeling lost and runnin' late
Well he held the car
He gave his seat to me

And I can't find nothin'
Feels so fine as lovin' a good hearted man
Oh he can sooth me, free me
Oh I'm going to marry that good hearted man
