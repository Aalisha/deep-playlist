Time kept me in line
Kepe me defined
It kept me safe
When I was afraid
Kept me in line
Kept me defined
It kept me safe
When I was afraid

Counting the days
Pacing the sky
Holding every breath
I have left inside

Gravity I can't forget
You saved my heart
A thousand ways
Gravity I can't forgive
You let me go
I felt the weight
When I was afraid

Falling away
