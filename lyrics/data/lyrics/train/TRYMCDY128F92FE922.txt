Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go, down to New Orleans
You know I love you so, baby please don't go
Alright!
When ya might done gone
When ya might done gone
When ya might done gone at the county farm
You got your shackles on, baby please don't go

Hey, hey!
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
