The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me

They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly
They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
Its the same old cry
