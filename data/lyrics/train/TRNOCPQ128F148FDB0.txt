Lyin' here, arm around my girl
I turn on the radio.
A shame we had to bail
You know we put on quite a show.
What'm I gonna do?
I left on my answer phone
Tell them what I told you -
Right now, I just don't know.

And I said
Hey! Kid!
Don't think you gotta try and be somebody, yeah!
It happens on its own.
I said it's all right.
Hey! (Hey!) Kid! (Kid!)

You don't get along trying to be nobody else
It's god-damned right, you know!
Every day will break
But another comes along.
Won't have long to wait
