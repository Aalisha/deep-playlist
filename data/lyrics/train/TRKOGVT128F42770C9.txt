It's time to jump my favorite song
It's time to jump everybody now! (bis)
Made in Barna!
Go! Fast! Go! Fast!
Made in Barna!
Go! Fast! Go! Fast! (bis)
I beg you please to stop and listen to my song
Come from the city straight from deep my "corazón"
Don´t want you to be lonely!
Just feel it only!
Just free your mind and let my music do the rolling.
