Now that I know what I know, I know I'll always love you
Now that I see what I see I see it will always be
Now that I got what I got I know I had it all along

Midweek morning time I wake up next to you
With your head on my pillow and your arms around me,
Oh baby it's so warm
And I've looked all around
Seeing nothin but big mouths with something to prove
Never come close to havin anything on your
No baby not even close
Still I lay here thinking about the way I thought it would be
But all my planning aside
...
