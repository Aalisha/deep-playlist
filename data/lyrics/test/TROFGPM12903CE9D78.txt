Postcards from amsterdam,
phone calls from birmingham,
to tell me only how you miss me
received your telegramm
now you say, here i am
oh, the way you hold, and kiss me.
Oh, darling, darling, darling,
leave a little love for later on
darling, darling, darling,
so that you can come back when you've gone
i idolize, your magic eyes, and i imagine
all the good things we can do, we can do
...
