Your invasion was a crime
Your (see through) righteous explanations lies
kicking in our doors, raids at night
won't win our heart, you've lost your minds
You're killing of my family
did not make a fan out of me
If this is what your freedom reaps
keep it for your united states
I'd tell you all these things but I can't speak because...

I'm dead, I'm dead
my life is life no more
...
