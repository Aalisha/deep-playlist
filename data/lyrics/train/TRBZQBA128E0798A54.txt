You fall hard, you fall deep
Even when you're awake, you look half asleep
Do you even know what you did last summer?
Wandering around deaf, dumb and blind
With the girls all hanging around you

Is that no or yes? We'll have to guess
Mysterious eyes let you see what you want
Half the time you didn't know any better
But half the time you did
Hanging around like tomorrow doesn't apply to you

Lazy dreamer, you never want to rise
Stubborn in-betweener you're almost paralyzed
Makes no difference to you the sun shining in your eyes
Or the buzzer that's whining
...
