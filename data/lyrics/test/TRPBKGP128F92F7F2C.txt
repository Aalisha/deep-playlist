Day by day I won't get younger
I'm afraid I'm getting older
Life is always getting faster
Can't take me any higher
Escape from fun
Plan to see it all
What I was looking for
On one of those days
When everybody was seriously dramatic
Dissatisfied with something they can't change

Maybe they're still there all praying
For break in the weather
For break in the weather
(weather weather weather...)
