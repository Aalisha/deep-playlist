If looks could kill you'd put a man way down in his grave
I need a resurrection to get my condition straight
Yeah, yeah, show me what you're hidin' in the back
Hold me, like a brand new Cadillac
Want it full time, I don't want to rent
I need a love that's 100 per cent

I want the real stuff
I want the real stuff

Don't want no hand-me-downs, Lord, I won't take second rate.
Don't want to be the hound that takes the scraps right off of your plate.
