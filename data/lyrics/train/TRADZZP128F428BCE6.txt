Lachrymal Of Eventide

A lonely girl in the dead of the night
Differs from us all by her blood
Strong as long she licks moonlight

She was born more than a life time ago
But now she's met something so much more
She can feel love in her heart

Knowledge of their future is but fear
That makes her weaker
She decided to make him her own

Forever so far her bleeding scars
And downcast eyes suck motions apart
Inside fragile is her heart

Time will run much faster than her love
And demons fill the sky
But now nothing is the same

Once upon a time there was a girl
Ruins of her soul remain in this world
When the moon goes down she goes to sleep
And when the night arrives she'll dream of him
