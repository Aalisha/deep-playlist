Let's sing a song about smoke and flames
That burnt down our lazy yesterdays
Let's pretend this poverty is fine
And sit on our front porches like we do it all the time
Go!

Out on these mean streets it's all the same
I watch my shoes while they take me on my way
And I step to the beat everywhere I go
All the televisions screaming out these windows

And we're just waiting for the end

When the bell tolls I'll be fine
They say that living is a lot like dying
...
