She didn't have to try, she really caught my eye
With the glint of metal coming from her face
She is my punk rock queen, angry but never mean
It takes a lot to make her draw her mace
We are so underground, we are both really down
No one would think to question our street cred
I love that she can't wait, she wants to smash the state
The kind of cop she likes is one that's dead
