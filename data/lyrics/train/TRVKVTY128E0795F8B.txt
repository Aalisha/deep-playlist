Who do you think you are?
Stardust is what you are
Since ages invading
Poisoning and leaving
From planet to planet
From planet to planet

Look into a mirror
And focus your eyes
You'll hear a voice in your head
Telling you to love instead of hate
'cause that's your fate
And not a mind like lead

The answer sleeps in you
Revive it with a kiss
Can you see the death circle?
Can you feel the emptiness inside?

Can you feel the rage and hate?
Can you forgive yourself or anyone else?
