Oh glorious father I call upon
Your blinding winds
Engulf this world with your nuclear fire
Come forth and end this charade
This travesty known as humanity shan't prevail
This empty void is what I desire

Missiles shall fly
Upon the black wings of destiny
Brought forth by artillery
Into the womb of mankind

[Chorus]
