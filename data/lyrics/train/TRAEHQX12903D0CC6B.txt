Step back relax and chill as I thrill
The K is back I'm not here to ill
Laying knowledge through the mic
Hype with a beat like this for your delight
Cooling in the crib writing rhymes
A pen on the paper spending times
Then up on the stage the crowd's in a rage
Taking rap to a brand new age

Psychological poems fun funky fresh
Rob'n'Raz on the cut to bring big success
Ain't down with horse ain't down with smack
I'm a flygirl packed with rap
When I grab the microphone
You better move your butt
Homeboys in the house show me what you've got
I'm Leila K on the M.I.C.
Come on come with me to the place to be

Got to get and get again and again
And I'll get you got so you remain the same
Got to get and get again and again
I am what I am and I'm playing my game

Got to get and get again and again
And I'll get you got so you remain the same
Got to get and get again and again
I am what I am and I'm playing my game
