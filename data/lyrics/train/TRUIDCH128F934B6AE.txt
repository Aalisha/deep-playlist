Transfused in these rites of my veins
Design of drowning the first born son of man

Hands of cold and empty condemning in bastard choice
These teeth of heresy speak of promised ruin

Bow before my vengeance
I am masked for death in rage of this worship of disease
In red skies my words are weapons of hell
Conjuration through this death of falling skies

Hatred swarms this lethal rage
...
