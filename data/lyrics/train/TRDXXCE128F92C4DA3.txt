1989 the number another summer, get down
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hittin? your heart, 'cause I know you got soul
Brothers and sisters

Listen if you? re missin? y? all
Swingin? while I? m singin?
Givin? whatcha gettin?
Knowin? what I know and

While the black bands sweatin?
And the rhythm rhymes rollin?
Got to give us what we want
Gotta give us what we need

Our freedom of speech is freedom or death
We've got to fight the powers that be

Lemme hear you say
Fight the power
Lemme hear you say
Fight the power

Lemme hear you say
Fight the power
Lemme hear you say
Fight the power

Lemme hear you say
Fight the power
Lemme hear you say
Fight the power
We've got to fight the powers that be

As the rhythm designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhymes designed to fill your mind
Now that you? ve realized the prides arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough
