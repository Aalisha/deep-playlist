You'll never find the truth cause you don't wonna know
Reality is not a dream, it's an effect mode
And if I told you what I thought about the system
I'd be banned from being played by using vulgarism
I don't wanna be somebody like you
Wanna be somebody new, not like you a statue
You make me sick with your hypocrite mind
And I know you can see but I still think you're going blind

Welcome people, recharge, repay
Backward, braindead, blinded, blockhead
Sterile, futile, hostile, lifestyle
Why can't you be someone worthwhile
