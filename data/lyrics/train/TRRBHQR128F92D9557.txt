Put 'em down, put 'em down
Put 'em down, good Lordy
Put 'em down, good Lordy
Put 'em down, shake 'em down

Good Lordy, shake 'em down
Good Lordy, shake 'em down
Good Lordy, shake 'em down
Good Lordy, shake 'em down

If you, come to my house
You's gon' find
Me around, good Lordy
Stop right there, baby go in
Shake 'em on down
Lordy, must I Lo-ord

Shake 'em down, to my house
Good Lordy
To my house, good Lordy
Shake 'em down, good Lordy
To my house, good Lordy

Shake 'em down, to my house
Shake 'em down, to my house
Shake 'em down, to my house

Shake 'em down, to my house
Shake 'em down, to my house
Shake 'em down, to my house
Shake 'em down, to my house
