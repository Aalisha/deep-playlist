-Dappy-
Haa, Haa, Haaa, Haaa, Ha Ha Ha

-Tulisa-
Dappy Turn My Mike Up

-Dappy-
Haa, Ha Ha Ha

-Tulisa-
Today Is The Day That I'm Gonna Tell
Just A Little Bout Myself (myself)
All Of These Haters They Don't Understand Me
They Can't Touch The Pain I Felt
I Wish I Could Show Them All Of My Secrets And They Might See Through Me
But If I Tell My Secrets Or Expose My Weakness Then I Can Let Em Tear Through Me

Mummy Had Problems, Daddy Couldn't Solve Them
Won't Stop Just To My Pain
Daddy It's Ok I Still Love You Because You Show Me Love In Every Way
Mummy I'm Sorry For Not Always Caring
I Got So Lost When You Weren't Around
Since I Was A Young Girl I Kept Us Related
I Don't Trust So I Won't Get Let Down

CHORUS
-Tulisa-
So Who (who) Could Be (be) Behind My Smile
I'm Crying Out And I'm Left Without A Hand
-Dappy-
