I can't believe it's true I finally got you here
I been waiting for this moment for some years
I've been torn down enough to know
Everyone goes through this door
Just before their lives explode
Come in here with a heavy load

Walking down the road watching the day begin
Radio song is playing off in a distant wind
But you can feel it its a gentle love
Coming out soft from the windows above
Just when you have had enough
Here comes the world you've been dreaming of

Oh my my the Mystic River
