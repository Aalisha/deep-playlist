There you go
You're in the shadows now
Nothing to see but your eyes
As they're following me

Hungry heart
Screaming out loud for more
You're taking a chance cuz you're livin'
Your life desperately

Hypnotize, paralyze
Only now I realize
That you're lost and you will spin out of control
With your rebel soul
...
