Wine bottle why are you weary
And why are my eyes so grey
Semi circle people are pointing
And staring up to the sky
And the dogs are all gone and my muesli is mouldy
And the saints they are sinners in their songs
And the crickets they call to their rusted rainbow
I swear if you listen
You might just hear our song
