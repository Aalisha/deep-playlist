I'm not giving up on you
I'm giving up on us
'Cause I'm so damn lonely again
And you're so out of touch

Is it not obvious
Not clear enough
That this won't do
This waiting on you

I know you want to be, but you ain't
I know you'd like to be, but you can't
I know you would do, but you don't
So tell me where it leaves me
It leaves me without you

You say you don't understand
