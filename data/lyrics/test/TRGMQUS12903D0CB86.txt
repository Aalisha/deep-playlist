Ooh, I’m on fire
Life has just begun
My only, desire
Have myself some fun
I’ve got money but nobody
No one to call my own
Feel so lonely, I’m tired
Tired of being alone

So I’m heading for the city lights
Dancing where the grooves are right (all night)
Go to a place I know
Where do all the people go
It’s just one of them nights
one of them nights you feel like getting down
It’s just one of them nights
It’s just one of them nights you feel like getting down

Life is for living
I’m gonna have it all
Gonna check out, what’s happening
