.And I woke up in a blur and was tied up, hurt, adrenaline scorching inside, as it raced through my veins.
I was coughing up blood, I must've looked like shit... and the worst part was that I had no recollection whatsoever of what, or who brought me here?
and why?
but before I could make any senses of this situation, I heard it all loudly and clearly;
'I resent your vile existence!
I truly despise what I've designed and you're a major factor in that little kid.

That's when it all came back to me;
The Bar, the magnum, the shots of J.D...
Perdition's rhetorical theory:
I'm sorry nobody loves you, but just think about how miserable I have become and that's all your fault.
