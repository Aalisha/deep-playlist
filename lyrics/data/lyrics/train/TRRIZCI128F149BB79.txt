She gets grumpy when she doesn't come
She says, "Hey boy you got all the fun"
Then she comes over
With the flowers in her hand

She gets clumsy when she's all alone
I say "baby, there's some things you just don't know"
Then she comes over
And puts her hand upon her heart and says

Oohh you could she her dance the seven veils
...
