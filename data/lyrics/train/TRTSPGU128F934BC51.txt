Devastate leave them weeping in your wake
a family's broken dreams with gloved hand I separate

the powers of a knife at hand if it breathes it fucking bleeds

mankind end time disgusted with this race
I pluck them from the universe pawns in my favorite game

cut them all down completely randomized
