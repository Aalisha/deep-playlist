One used to be the shotgun
Two used to be the bad boogaloo
Three used to be the swing shingaling
Four used to be the funky four fingers

Down on funky street
Digging the funky beat
Down on funky street
That's where the grooviest people meet

From Atlanta, Georgia
Going on down to the border
Every boy is dancing
With somebody's daughter

Grooving in the city
Got to get down with it
