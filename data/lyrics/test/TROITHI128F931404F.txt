She's the kinda girl boys read about
In magazines, glossy magazines
She is the only one I think about
Leading lady in my dreams
Hey I have waited so long, to gather up my courage
She has got me love drunk fumbling my words
Times running out, gotta do it now
She's the one I cannot live without

Yeah she's the one I cannot live without
Yeah yeaaah yeeeah yeah

You only get one shot so make it count
You might never get this moment again
The clock is ticking down, it's the final round
So tell me what it is thats stopping you now
You never know unless you try
You'll only regret sitting wondering night
You only get one shot so watch this moment go by ay
when love's on the line

I never thought that i would get the chance
