Run little rabbit you cant break the habit for none
Shapes like a rocket and shoots like a pocket gun
Every mothers son
Has spent a lifetime on the run

One by one and two by two
Our hearts beat a rhythm true
Wave goodbye now baby blue
You're exploding like a star into the gloom

I thought I could shut you in
You said baby let me out
I thought that I could pick you up and roll you like a dice yeah

There's hitchhikers thumbing on the verge of the lovers highway
But we just roll on by with the top down the sun's out
I'm so glad when you came along you happened to be going my way
