1.
once i promised, i'd do anything to please you
and looking back you must admit i've tried
now you stand there, and tell me i must leave you
but i can't go i guess i must have lied
(chorus)
for these lips don't know how to say goodbye
and my heart doesn't even wanna try
now these feet can do the walking
