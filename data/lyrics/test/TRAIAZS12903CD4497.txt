Check out that noise in the background! I'm mad green right now. It's a biodiesel generator!
I'm using it to run the computer studio for the recording of this album!
I got it with this gift certificate I won at the Save the Sea Turtles Marathon Run dude!
Check it out! I wrote all of the lyrics on my arm because trees are too important to be

I got a letter from Al Gore the other day
I opened and read it, it said we're in trouble
It said "Go Green!" What's that mean?
Bought a hybrid hummer to save gasoline
Went to Live Earth in my private jet
Just like Sting and Kanye West
Let's save the earth with area rock
(Pyrotechnics are very sustainable)

(I'm going green) Can't you see? I keep the AC above 63
(I'm going green) Hardcore like Slayer, here's 27 fliers on the ozone layer
(I'm going green) Because I care, use organic aerosols in my hair
(I'm going green) So my grandkids will remember,
when you couldn't buy ocean property in Denver

It's not easy being green (it's not easy)
Having to change that old routine (it's not easy)
The climate change could be extreme
It's not easy... it's not easy

Went to Sea World with a giant net
