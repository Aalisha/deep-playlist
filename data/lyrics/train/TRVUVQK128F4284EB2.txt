Da von Mill
Next

Hey love, you got it goin' on
I watched you for years
Watch your bra size bloss
Shalont stay in your ears

Make me wanna sex you raw
The thought alone make my dick draw
Spit a ball in your pregnature
Quite your night job, sounds good

But the age thing got me shook
Tell you what, let's hit the mall
We'll blow them condoms
In your pocketbook

Alleviate the game, girl
Your world don't stop
Come this time next week
I'd have that cat on lock rock on

When you're walkin' down the street
With your casual wear
Rings on every single finger
With your braided up hair

Got your tattoo with your kid's name
And your anklet on too
What's the next man gotta do
To get next to you, rock on?
