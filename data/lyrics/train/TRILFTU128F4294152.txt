Verse 1
Smile, wave
Convince the sanctuary, our charade
Though you're the object of my deepest rage
Just counterfeit this holiness for me
And everything will be okay

My sweet one, you tell no lies
The greatest reason to be despised
(But) we must pretend
Your broken wrist
Just happened when you fell off your bike
Your bike, your bike

Chorus
This is the reason
The sanctuary hums
'God save us, God save us
From your chosen ones'
