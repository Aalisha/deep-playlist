The seed of the apothecary, an heir to aided ends.
She loves the sound they make as they expel breath;
the soul from the chest.
She laughs a little, but never makes a sound

She swears she's offering you something savory.
What lies she tells.
So take a drink, her product's number one.
Right down the hatch.
And now, it seems, a smooth intoxication, well,
Just one drop is more than enough.
