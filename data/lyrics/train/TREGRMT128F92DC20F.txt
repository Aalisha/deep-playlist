The world was empty
before the day
and it didn't seem to get better any way
the way I lived would have broken me
I drank too much. Had no one who was watching me
But God sent an angel
with broken wings
to save and protect me
and guide me through this life
was you I met on that day
it was you who saved me from my tragedy
