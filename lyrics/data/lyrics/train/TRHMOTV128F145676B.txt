It's been too long since the last rain
still the stars sizzle hot in the sky,
and there undressed in the shadows
stands my sweet Cherie hiding from July.

And all night you kept me up
up all night hoping that I could
make you mine

You're getting me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me.
Isn't my love, strong enough
I'm ready to rock you long and rough.
You're getting me hot, Cherie
I want what you've got all over me.
I'm going crazy (yeah).
