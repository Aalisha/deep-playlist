I will crawl through your grief
I will cry 'til i drown
Cut a path through your dark
'Til I'm lost and you're found
Turn your black into gray
I won't hurt when I bleed
I'll give up my desire
'Til you get what you need

*chorus*
Ask me I'll be there, whenever you fall
To do anything, everything, nothing at all
I'll move any mountain that keeps you from me
I'll change, rearrange, disappear in your dreams
Please don't ask me to let go or make me give up
Cause I love you that much and I will
