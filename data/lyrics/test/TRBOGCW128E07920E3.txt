I been stuffed in your pocket
For the last hundred days
When I don't get my bath
I take it out on the slaves
So grease up your baby
For the ball on the hill
I'm polish them rockets now
And swallow those pills
And say oh...

Space Lord Mothermother

There's a car in the field
Now in a column of flame
With two doors to choose
But only one bears your name
You been drinkin' my blood
Well I been lickin' your wounds
Well I'll shave off the pitch now
And the scope of your tune
You'll sing oh...
