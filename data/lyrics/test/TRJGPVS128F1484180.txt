(shit)
don't be a fool girl
he's taking me all the way
we've come to burn you up
you've come going to burn me up
got to, it's real alive
you make me feel stupid
(sugar come here, hey sugar)
wish it was five minutes before yesterday
do you remember the time when we were gonna, do that
(sweetheart, come here)
bring me all your food that I don't care to eat
darling, darling
do you wanna fuck me?
no, bring me all your food
don't be a fool girl
(shit)
you ought to have made our american dream come true
don't go in the water
darling, darling
