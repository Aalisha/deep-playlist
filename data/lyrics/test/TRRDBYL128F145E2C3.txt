Please please stop

If you see her
Please give her this message
Oh won't you tell her
How much I miss her
Even better
Tell her I must meet her
Or tell her that I lover her
And nothings changed

You see together
We were stonger
Alas no longer
Are we together

And God forbid
If I should never ever see her
