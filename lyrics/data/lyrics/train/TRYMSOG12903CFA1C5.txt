He's goint to he concert
He's full of thrashing rage
He's going to rip his face off and throw it at the stage!

Headbanger Face Rip

She's putting on her makeup
She's teasing out her hair
She's going to rip her face off and throw it down the stairs

It doesn't really matter who you came to see to play
All we want to see you do is rip your face away
Thumbs into your eyeballs, stick your fingers in
Rake your hand across your face and pull apart your skin

Blood and hair swirl everywhere
Your face is gone but you don't care
