Didn't they say that I would make a mistake
Didn't they say you were gonna be trouble
People told me you were too much to take
I could see it, I didn't wanna know

I let you in and you let me down
You messed me up and you turned my life around
Left me feeling I had no where to go

I was alone, how was I too know that
You will be there

When I needed somebody
You will be there
The only one could help me
I had a picture of you in my mind

Never knew it could be so wrong
