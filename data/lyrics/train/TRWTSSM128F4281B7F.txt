I got a song in my mind
I've been singing it all day
I'm gonna to teach it to you tonight
Come on and answer when I say
Hey! (Hey!)

When you hear me start screaming
Listen, I ain't gonna quit
Gonna show you different sizes
That I guarantee to fit
When you hear a warm vibration
Look out baby this is it
Heeeeeeyyyyyyy!
