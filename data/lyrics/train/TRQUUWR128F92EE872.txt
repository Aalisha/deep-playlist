I heard a battle ragin
On the other side of the wall
I buried my head in a pillow and tried to ignore it all
Every night when I hear you
I dream of breakin down your door
An avengin knight in shinin armor to rescue you from it all

From this family business
Family business
How long does it stay
Family business
Oh, it's nobody's business
This family business
But tell me how long it should stay
Family business

When I see you in the supermarket
Sunglasses in the shade
Avertin your eyes from those starin questions
How were those bruises made
The children clutch tight to your legs
They've got so much they want to say
But daddy's sittin home drunk again
