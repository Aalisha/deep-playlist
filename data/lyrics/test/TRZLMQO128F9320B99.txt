You never told me
What was wrong or what was right
You never told me
Why you couldn't sleep at night
I know you've heard this before
But I'll say it once more
You've done all you can
And you can't do any more
But thats alright
'Cause I'll just wait and see
That you realize
You never told me

You never told me
You never you never
You never told me

And I know that things have changed
As I know they always do
And I know, I know we're not the same
To think we were I was a fool
But I never, I never thought I'd see
Even in my darkest dream
