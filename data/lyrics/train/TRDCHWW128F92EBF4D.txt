Dut, dut, dum, dum, dum, doom 
(Get upstairs tiff) 
Dut, dut, dum, dum, dum, doom 
(and change your clothes quick) 
Dut, dut, dum, dum, dum, doom 
(zip your coat up) 
Dut, dut, dum, dum, dum, doom 
(you chillin wit da clutch) 

[verse 1 tiffany]
your da privite school girl 
wit your skirt rolled up 
showing off what you aint even got yet (got yet) 
you need to button up your blouse 
put back on your vest 
cuz your out here lookin a mess 
you must be tryna catch a cold (catch a cold) 
where your mom and pops at? 
how dey feel about that? 
girl you need to stop that you know (you know) 
tryna fit in the outfit 
tell you what you gone get 
whatcha you dont want 

[bridge]
you showin skin 
you showin legs 
you gone get hurt what i said 
you bumped your head 
cuz you mama 34 and she still be up in da club
