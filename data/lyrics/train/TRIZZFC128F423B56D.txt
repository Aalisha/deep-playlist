(Verse)
This is a warning I advise you all to stay alert
Yo Reals grab the nine cause it's time to go to work
Ask Dee, rest the rhythm, I hit 'me, then I just split 'em
Besta believe that's the way you should've did him
Backing niggaz down with the heat, feel the flame
Ripping through your flesh, can you handle the pain
I don't give a fuck, I never did, I never will
A little Crooklyn knight nigga with the skill to kill
Which to the point I will extend the trey pound
Nobody makes a move, nobody makes a sound
Catch mad wreck, raise hell with my crew
Chilling in the east as I sip on a brew
Drugs no frills cause the dutch is the master
An individual who blows up because I have to
Bust mad shots, it's time for me to misbehave
Whoever doesn't like it we can take it to the grave

(Chorus 4x)
SON GET WREC
SON GET WREC
