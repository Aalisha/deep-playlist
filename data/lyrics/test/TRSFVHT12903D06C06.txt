I was in a functional way
And I have my brown sound jacket
Queen of call collect on my arm
She was my calm-me-down
She was my good-luck charm
She was my good luck

Here it come running
Here it come running again
Trouble come running
Here it come running again

Well alright
I got taken away
By a heavenly host
To a heavenly place
