Is it your alluring way
Could you always drown the fire?
Keep a check on all you feel
Keep a hold on all your desire
But I feel there's something new
And it's lying in your eyes
There's a shudder running through you
Now I realize

Inside turning to outside
The feeling you can't hide
Is touching a highlight in your eyes
Inside turning to outside
It's gonna be alright
It's running a high for you and I
