Bones begin to break, smash your fuckin' face
Beaten, you plead to live
Born to mutilate, live to desecrate, die, I will kill again
Adrenaline rush, pumping through my veins, boiling in my blood
Methodically, this hunt has just begun!

Death, by the power of my hands, the strength of my grasp
My skull crushing blows
Arms, tight around your neck, trying to get loose
Hard for you to breathe
