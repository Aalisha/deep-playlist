yes indeed i'm,
alone again
and here comes emptyness,
crashing in
its either love or hate
i cant find inbetween
because i've been with witches
and i have been with the queen

it wouldnt have worked out anyway
so now its just another lonely day hey hey
further along we just may
but for now its just another lonely day hey hey
