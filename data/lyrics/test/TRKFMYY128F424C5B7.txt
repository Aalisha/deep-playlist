Let's rip it up
Well, Saturday night
And I just got paid
Fool about my money
Don't try to save
My heart says
Go, go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night
And, baby, I feel fine
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna break it up
I'm gonna lock it up
At the ball tonight
Well, I got me a baby
And I won't be late
Pick her up in my 88
A shag going down
By the social hall
When the joint starts jumping
Gonna have me a ball
I'm gonna rock it up
