Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you...
Do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you oh...
Kiss... me... like you just did
Oh baby do that to me once again
Pass that by me one more time
Once just isn't enough for my heart to hear
W-h-o-a
Tell it to me one more time
I can never hear enough while I got ya near
W-h-o-a
Say those words again like you just did
...
