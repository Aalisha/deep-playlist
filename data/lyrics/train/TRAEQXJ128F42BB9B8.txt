A long ass fuckin' time ago
In a town called Kickapoo
There lived a humble family
Religious through and through

But yay there was a black sheep
And he knew just what to do
His name was young J.B.
And he refused to step in line

A vision he did see-eth
Fuckin' rocking all the time
He wrote a tasty jam
And all the planets did align

Oh the dragon's balls were blazin'
As I stepped into its cave
Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles,
With a long and shiny blade!

'Twas I who fucked the dragon
Fuckalize sing fuckaloo!
And if you try to fuck with me
Then I shall fuck you too

Gotta get it on in the party zone
I gots to shoot a load in the party zone
Gotta lick a toad in the party zone
Gotta suck a chode in the party zone
Aahhhhhh!

You've disobeyed my orders son
...
