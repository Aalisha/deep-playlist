Hey!
I'm driving down a dusty road
Hey!
I've got nowhere to go
Hey!
No place that I can call my own
On and on this road is burning
Break away!
I'm leaving all this crap behind
Break away!
The past is gone the future's blind
Break away!
Don't care how long it takes this time
On and on I'll take the long way home
The long way home
The long way home
...
