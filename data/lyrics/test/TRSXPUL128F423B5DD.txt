Halloween is the night
The legend says the ghost will rise
On Halloween they can't redeem
A restless soul from an ancient scene
At the sound of the demon bell
Everything will burn to Hell
Rise... rise... rise... It's Halloween
Rise... rise... The ghost will rise

Reconciled with the powers of darkness
...
