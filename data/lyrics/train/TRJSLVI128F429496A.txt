Hi, my name is Stereo Mike

Yeah, we got 3 tickets to the Bran Van concert this Monday night
at the Pacific Pallisades. You can all dial in if you want to answer
a couple of questions, namely,
what is Todd's favorite cheese.
Jackie just called up and said it was a form of Roquefort.
We'll see about that...

give us a ring-ding-ding! It's a beautiful day.

Yeah Todd, this is Liquid ring-a-ding-a-dinging
I want those 3 Bran Van tickets man
waddya think?
Todd, you there?

*voices in background*

I woke up again this morning with the sun in my eyes
when Mike came over with a script surprise
a mafioso story with a twist
a "Too Wong Foo, Julie Newmar" hitch
get your ass out of bed, he said:
I'll explain it on the way

but we did nothing
absolutely nothing that day
and I'll say
what the hell am I doing drinking in LA
at twenty six?
I got the fever for the flavor
the payback will be later
still I need a fix
