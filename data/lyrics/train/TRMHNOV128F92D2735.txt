Another hotel
With ruined plans
Romantic gesture
With ruined plans
And so you make it your own
But this is where your arm can't go
you make it your own

Another phone call
With ruined plans
Romantic gesture
With ruined plans

And so you make it your own
But this is where your arm can't go
You make it your own
But this is where your arm can't go

And your red sky at night won't follow me
...
