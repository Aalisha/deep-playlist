Head away from the years
You're on the price list
Head away from the years
You're on the price list
Head away from the years
You're on the price list

Everything will stop your new changing
The grid will be filled
Go to Scotland, no obligation
We'll send you an invitation

We'll send you an inside shower
We'll send you an inside shower
