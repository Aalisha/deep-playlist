And I saw the ambulance screaming down main street
I didn't give it a thought
Well it was my uncle Eugene
He died on October the second 1981

And my uncle Wilber
They all called him skinner
They said for his younger ways
He'd get drunk in the morning
And show me the rolls of fiftys and hundreds
He kept in the glovebox of his old gray impala
And we're all gonna be here forever
So mama don't you make such a stir
