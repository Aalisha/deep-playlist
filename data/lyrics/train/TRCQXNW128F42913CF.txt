If it feels it's starting again
Over heavy and you wanna be thin
If you think it's over, begin
Recovery

Even when you wanna get high
Misdirected when you wanna fly
Take the splinters out of your eyes
Recovery

When I get a rhythm within
I feel happy when I'm living in it
When I wanna turn it round on its head
Aah recovery

Stepping on a carpet of glass
You're just happy you don't drop on your ass
