Don't call me baby
When she is waiting in the car
It took so long to get this far
Don't call me baby

You said forever
And then you went and changed your plans
You said some day I'd understand
But I still wonder


I wonder why we are not walking and fighting and asking for favours
Meeting at midnight while avoiding all the neighbours
Time is a distance that you can't retract by miles
If I saw again I'd smile

But I'd say don't call me baby
When she is waiting in the car
It took so long to get this far
...
