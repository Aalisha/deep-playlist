How? How can it be
That a love, carved out of caring
Fashioned by fate, could suffer so hard
From the game played much too often

But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years, it's not so wrong
To be human after all

Drawn into the stream of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams, they can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you, baby
...
