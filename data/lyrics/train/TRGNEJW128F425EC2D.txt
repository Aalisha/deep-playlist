Excuse me girl, can I talk to you
Maybe get you name and your number too

I don't mean to be blunt, but baby
I know that I've got the thing you need
Say what you want and I can make sure
You get it on the count of three

We can move slow or we can move fast
To get to it right away
You must've known with a body like that
I'd go insane

You got me so, so hooked on
Every little thing you do
Has got me so, so turned on
Let me take a look at you

Without a doubt, I'm higher now
Girl, I'm higher now
Every little thing about you
Has got me so

Girl, you got me so, got me hooked on you
