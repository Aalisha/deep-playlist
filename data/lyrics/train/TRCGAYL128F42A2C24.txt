This time
Make no mistake, resolute and crystal clear
This time
I'm ready for you, complete and without fear

Sweet believer, you must be found
A soul survivor, who'll stick around
Never let me down

Trouble in mind
It's a question of pride
The standard is high
I couldn't live another lie
I could walk miles
If the feeling is right
I'm takin' my time
I couldn't live another lie
