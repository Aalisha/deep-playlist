I'll ask you once as I'm leaving
Is there anything that I can do to make you change your mind
I'll ask you once now that I'm leaving
Will you leave all of our memories behind

Chorus:
I told you that my mind was all askew
And I hope that you know anything at all
If we could hold onto all of our memories
And I'll face all the trouble I have caused
I need you near me, oh
