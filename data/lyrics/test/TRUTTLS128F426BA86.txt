Carmen.Carmen... Carmen...

Tonight I am aching, my body is shaking
Tonight Carmen's coming back home
Tonight there'll be no room for tears in my bedroom
Tonight Carmen's coming back home.

Tonight as I stand here I notice my hand here
Is trembling as never before
My feelings I can't hide, resistance has all died
My pride will rush outside
The moment she walks through the door.
