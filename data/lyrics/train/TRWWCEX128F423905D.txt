Ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay
Oh let us lift our eyes to the hills
From whence cometh our help yes I
And give us health and strength rastafari
In these challenging times I say
Never let I foot be moved
Show I to improve
Let the words of my mouth
And meditation be true
Cause Africa awaits it's creator
Those at home and abroad
Cause Africa awaits it's creator
Those at home and abroad
So let peace be within thy walls
And prosperity in the palace
...
