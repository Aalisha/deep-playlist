Do you hear those distant voices
and sounds through the flames
the deafening drone
of these clanking machines
in the lights
it's the same
we're trying to free
the sculpture from the stone
we'll take the rhythm from the throne
if the radio is dying
listen to me won't you listen to me

I don't want to lie in a bed of ashes
I don't want to burn in a midnight sun
I don't want to know if the system crashes
I don't want to go if it's just begun
I don't want to lie in a bed of ashes
I don't want to burn in the midnight
sun
in the midnight sun

I scream like a madman in the morning
no one heard a thing
I had hoped for a more effective warning
...
