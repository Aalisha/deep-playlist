Who? Mike Jones!
Who? Mike Jones!
Who? Mike Jones!

Shyeah, keep ya eyes open
For them jackers, baby
It's going down

Even though the law's patrollin'
Them jackers get rolling, so they can't out hold it
'Cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the law's patrollin'
Them jackers get rolling, so they can't out hold it
'Cause I ain't about to go down

Shyeah, they see me doin' my shit, that's why they in my mix
Jackers plotting along, watching like I'm moving bricks
But I ain't move nothin', I'm on my grind hustling
Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion

I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowing for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect

Myself, because they ain't gonna get me
I'm in the club sober as fuck and you won't catch me tipsy
Nigga yeah, I'm Mike Jones
