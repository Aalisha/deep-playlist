The vapour in my mind makes it hard to find
The things in life that I lost back in time
And the trail of my heart has turned all roads so dark
So hard to find, so hard to overcome

And all the things that I believed were true
Were never roots to anything but lies
To demons in disguise
And all the roads that I've been strolling down
Now I've found they all seem to be marooned
So profoundly doomed

And the vapour in my heart makes it hard to love
The things in life that I used to love
...
