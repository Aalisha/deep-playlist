Irridescent eyes of the seahorse rise
Treasure she loves
Others dispise
A shooting star shan't fall very far
Dim fireflies held in glass jars
April showers brings May flowers
Dazzling dust tossed in wind gusts
The trap door is open
The window half closed
The tapestry curtain vivaciously closed
London bridge did fall down
