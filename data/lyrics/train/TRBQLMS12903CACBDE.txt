Safe in the shadows
Deep in the night
I know you're near
But you're nowhere in sight
Safe from the darkness
Down in the streets
I hear your footsteps
I hear your heartbeat
Oh, I can hear your heartbeat

On the street corner
Away from the light
I know you're near
But you're nowhere in sight
Over my shoulder
I feel you're near
I feel you moving
But you never appear

Chasing shadows
Chasing something I can't see
...
