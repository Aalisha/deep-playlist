I'm feeling so afraid,
'Cause everything that I do lately makes you angry.
I've never been so ashamed,
It really felt like you and me were getting better.

I hope that you still want me,
I hope it's not too late.

Don't walk away,
And leave without a reason when there's
Too much to say,
That hasn't been said.
I know I was wrong,
And I'm sorry for making the same mistake.
Don't walk away.

Can you really throw away,
...
