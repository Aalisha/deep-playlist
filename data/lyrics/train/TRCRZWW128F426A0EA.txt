At night I heard the owls say:
"Find the truth beneath the stars
You'll have to travel back to heaths of green...

...The entrance to the oak woods will be revealed to you
A king will tell you to ride until..."

... the leaves on the trees from black colour turn to green
There to find the oak woods I seek, where the old oaks
still speak

At night I heard the old king say:
"To find your journey through the dark
You'll have to travel on a field of green"

Through time dark landscapes leave their place to
grasslands of joy
Bestowed to ancient oak woods here I ...

... stand astonished by green, light of power covers me
To understand the nature of man I have now to speak with
the trees.
