When it feels like the world is on your shoulders
And all of the madness has got you going crazy.
It's time to get out, step out into the street
Where all of the action is right there at your feet
well, I know a place where we can dance the whole night away
Underneath electric stars
Just come with me and we can shake your blues right away
You'll be doing fine when the music starts, oh

To the beat of the rhythm of the night, dance until the morning light.
Forget about the worries on your mind, you can leave them all behind.
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh, the rhythm of the night, oh yeah

Look out on the street now, the party's just beginning
The music's playing, a celebration's starting
Under the street lights the scene is being set
A night for romance, a night you won't forget
...
