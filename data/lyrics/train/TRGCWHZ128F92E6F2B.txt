Soulja Girl
Soulja Girl
Soulja boy Tell em
Right now it's going down
Lookin for that Soulja Girl

You gotta step like this to be a Soulja Girl
You gotta step like that to be a Soulja Girl
Tell me Ohhh Youuuuu
Tell me Ohhh Youuuuu
You gotta walk it out to be a Soulja Girl
Know what I'm talking bout Soulja Girl
Tell me Ohhh Youuuuu
Tell me Ohhh Youuuuu

You gotta walk it out to be my Soulja Girl

I get sick when I picture you out, I done told you girl
Hit the mall with me
Come ball with me
From Monday to Sunday
I know we won't
But everybody fall in love someday
Soulja Boy Tell 'em got the girls goin' wild
From the corner of my eye I saw her smile
I want me a girl that can wipe me down
Dress so fresh it makes the girls go wow
