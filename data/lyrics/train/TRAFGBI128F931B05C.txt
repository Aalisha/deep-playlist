I was born in the city,
Oh, but I was born in the country
My mother said I didn't have a name
But she would have to love me just the same

I was looking for something
I was looking for something
Well, I was looking for a place to go
Someplace that maybe i could call my own

Just let it go, just let it go 'cause it's gone
You're pointing fingers, you're pointing fingers
Just let it go, just let it go, let it die
