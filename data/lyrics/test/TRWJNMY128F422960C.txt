He's getting much closer to forty every day
And he can't tell his mother what he's done
He thinks he's the only one that feels this way
And he's like why has it begun

He says Tracy please don't leave me
Don't you really need me
I swear it didn't mean a thing
Tries to make it better
Cries till he gets wetter
And promises a diamond ring
But now she's gone
