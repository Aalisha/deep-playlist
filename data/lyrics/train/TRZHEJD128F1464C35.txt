My old friend buried his Mama today
Told me about how he cried bloody tears and prayed
As the preacher shouted loud to believers
The sermon pounded home to redeemers
That's heavy brother
Heavy as 10 rocks

When I heard the icy water waves crashing on the shore
(oh the water, can't stand the water)
When my little baby said she just can't take it no more
(oh the water, can't stand the water)
When the earth split open and we buried the man (oooooooh)
The man that died a demon with a two-fisted hand
That's heavy brother
Heavy as 10 rocks
