When you walk along the street how oftentimes you meet
Some poor old man who's gotten old and gray?
With age his back is bent, in his pockets not a cent
And for shelter he has no place to stay

His relations by the score, they'll turn him from the door
They'll see him on the street and pass him by
If you ask them why they do, they'll turn and say to you
He is old, he's gray, he's only in the way
