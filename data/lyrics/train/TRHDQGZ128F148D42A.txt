Got to give the people
Ladies and Gentlemen
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

[Incomprehensible]
Got to give the people
Ladies and Gentlemen
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

When I came out with my first rap jam
I had no idea that the record would slam
It did real good without radio play
Maybe at night but no airplay in the day

I couldn't understand why to be exact
Our music was good and I was far from whack
Then came the answer, commercial was the key
To get airplay and a spot on TV

Like Ed Lover and Doctor Dre from Yo, MTV Raps
A show, mainly for the black
And still we can't ill, 'cause to them that's wrong
Cause like P.E. said, we're too black and too strong

But hey, what can I say?
Brothers and sisters, that's a price a rapper must pay

Got to give the people
Ladies and Gentlemen
Give the people what they want
Ladies and Gentlemen

[Incomprehensible]
Got to give the people
Ladies and Gentlemen
