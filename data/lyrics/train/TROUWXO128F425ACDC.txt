All I want to do is love you
I just want to take you there

Baby, I don't want to argue
Don't even want to fight
I just want to love you
And hold you all the night
The message from the party
Nothing to do with how...
Try to keep it happy
Then depress yourself to cry
All I want to do is love you
You've got to move on up

All I want to do is love you
...
