Hey, you
I would like to meet you when the day is gone
My heart's trembling and I'm turning
Round and round

Looking at your photograph
Can't forget the way you laugh
You have changed the way I feel
I feel inside

My heart is feeling something new
Changing every black to blue
Every day you're on my mind
I've lost control

REFRAIN:
Danger, danger
Can't you hear me crying, crying
Oh-oh danger, danger
I can't get away
How could I live without you

Danger, danger
Is it love I'm feeling, feeling
...
