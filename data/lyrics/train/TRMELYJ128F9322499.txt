I had a bad day so I said to myself
I wanna have fun, gunna raise some hell
Gunna show this world my time has come
Gunna go and blow up everyone
So I went to the store and bought me some gas
Poured it into my old man's flask
Called all my friends to join along
And now...
I wanna throw a bomb
Gunna throw a bomb tonight
