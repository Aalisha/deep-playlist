Tip toeing along the line
Just in case you're not fine
I'll give in to your needs
'Cause this just might be what you need

Even though it's unknown
Where the two of us would go
And the darkness
Will have to see through

'Cause I'm bound by love
And I'm thinking of what could be
Where there's a will there's a way
So will you come out and play?
With me, with me

For every troubles caused by me
