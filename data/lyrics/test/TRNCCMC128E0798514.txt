:
Grab my knee and look at me

And try to tell me I'll be home soon
Asleep in my bed and un--stoned
I'm tired of me this way
I don't know what I've gotten into
But I'm glad it? s now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
With a wish I had for win--ter
It? s not as gentle as it sounds
As though it sounded yes-ter--day
When I heard a leaf of my life hit the ground
And as a bottle cap flew from my finger
I don't know what I've gotten in to
But I'm glad it? s now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
With a wish I had for win--ter
