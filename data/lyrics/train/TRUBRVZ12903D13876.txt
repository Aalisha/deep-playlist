(Music By Jim Rushing)

The moon is full and my heart is why
I love to dance oh me, oh my
Gonna have more fun than a tree in a coon
Tonight's the dance of the cajun noon.

Chorus:
Cajun moon nugget of gold
River of light on the bayou
You're just like rain
To a love in bloom so
Shine on me oh, cajun moon.

Pick ups and wagons 'round the river road shack
Bonfires draw in a crowd out back
...
