You can't escape life just because you stopped living
but you're dead the same second you decide to just give in
and given the choice between your own life and death
I suggest that you cherish the time you have left
'cause time waits for no one and we're all growing older
I've found myself looking more over my shoulder
I like to say fuck it I could be dead tomorrow
and deal with the pain and the stress and the sorrow

life will kill you, in the end we're all gonna die
life will kill you, it doesn't matter how hard you try
...
