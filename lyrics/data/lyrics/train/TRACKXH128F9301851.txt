From the ashes to hell and bakk.
Barbwire around his nekk.
Easy to identify.
He brings you down
and gets you high.
Your GOD is not his god
Your HELL is not his hell
He got the world on his bakk
Who the fukk is he?
THE PHOENIX IN BLAKK!

CHORUS:
Enjoy, I follow you!
He will forgive but he won't forget
and you gotta deal with that
