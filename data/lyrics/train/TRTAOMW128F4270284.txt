Well who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes Or the bitter direction of pending goodbyes?
I'm fallin', I'm folded, I'm wilted in place
At the sight of you standin' with streaks down your face

You got your heart broke, you go runnin' from the reason
Got your heart broke, don't give up on believin' in me
Heartbroke, who kept me from leavin' with my heart broke

Well cryin' when you're rich is a bore if you're lonely
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to yield
...
