A broken woman
Oh my
Sits at the bar
Sipping gin and tonic
She thinks she's the star
The star of the dance floor
The goddess of love
She chics to the music
Till the last song is gone
She wants to change
At least that's what she says
But she just can't relate
She just can't find herself
But the foolish...
But the follish...
Broken Woman
Her face is aging
...
