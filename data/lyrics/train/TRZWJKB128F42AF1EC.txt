Little Red Rodeo

Well a note said: "You've had time to think about it.
Looks like to me you're feelin' kinda crowded.
You're not looking for anything permanent here,
so my Rodeo is packed and it's in 'goodbye gear.' "

So I shot down to the Longhorn Diner,
her sister works there and she'd know where to find her.
She said, "You didn't hear this from me,
all I'll say is momma's got that place out in Monterrey."

Oh, how fast can I go, I gotta catch that little, red Rodeo.
She drove off with my heart, I gotta let her know.
Need the girl in that little, red Rodeo.
Texas plates, candy-apple red Rodeo.
