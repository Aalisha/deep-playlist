Time marches on never ending,
time keeps its own time,
Here we stand at beginning,
and then goes passing us by,
And I, I, I can dream for us all,
I hope I'm in a better state,
When here and now crumbles and falls
and you, you, you who make worlds collide
I knew you'd come knocking one day,
unannounced like a thief in the night.
