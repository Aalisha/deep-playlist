There's a time when we try
To begin what is ending.
If at first you don't succeed
Then we just end up pretending.
If the dream isn't real,
Is the life worth defending?
Close your eyes,
Cover your ears,
Shut your mouth.

You can act Na√Øve,
But I know you're not stupid.

You'll wake up, when I walk out.
Isn't that the way it plays?
The leaver leaves, the stayer stays.
You wouldn't make a move, so I made mine.
Isn't it a pity?
I wish you were really in it for life.
I wish that you were in it for life.
