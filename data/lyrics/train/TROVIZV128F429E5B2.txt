For those that said I couldn't do it
I'm here to show improvement!
(x2)

I'm Gandhi with a bulletproof vest (what?)
Malcolm X kickin' a freestyle, whatchu expect?
You ain't expect Martin Luther King with a gat
Leavin a church yelling "Go back!"
? You know how it go fams
Large wingspan like the son of Rodan
Stuck between Godzilla and Bunzilla (huh?)
Fingerhut and Fingerpaint (what?)
Jabba the Hutt going corrupt
You ain't ready for the twin double cypher uppercuts
Plus, I'm off the bean curd rap
You ain't ready for the hypodermic ginseng mat

(Chorus)
In the club is over the bub
In the car is over the dub
In the street it's beef over the slugs
Watch out for the cheeba, it's under the rug
And it still bug
And I'm still wired
...
