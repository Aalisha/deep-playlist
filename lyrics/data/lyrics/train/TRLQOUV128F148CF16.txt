Born with no soul
Lack of control
Cut from the mold of the anti-social
Plug em in and then turn it on
Process the data, make yourself da bomb
What is your target?
What is your reason?
Do you have emotions?

Is your heart freezing?

Seizin, this opportunity to speak
Ya didn't say nuttin but turn your fuckin cheek
Dead cell!
Dead cell!
Sick in the head
Livin but dead
Hear what I said
Learn a lesson from the almighty dread
Jah, nutty warrior
Nuthin's scarier

Kids are gettin sick like malaria

Situation gets hairier
I'm throwing up all types of barriers
