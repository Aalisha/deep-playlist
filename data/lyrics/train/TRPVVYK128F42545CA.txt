I came through frost and fire bring up by jotun's secrets
And i'm the last of skjioldung's stock my father died in battlefield
I seek revenge i crave my crown i've got the right to be a king
A valorous king... but now i'm alone...

Who is my foster-father? a jotun strong and brave
I know the secrets of the forest i have learned some magic spell
I follow the will of the gods i'm protected by odin
The hammer of thor... will be my guide!
