Seems like after all we've been through
We would have learned by now
Never to fight for who gets the last word
It doesn't matter anyhow

But round and round we go in circles
Trying to work things through
And sometimes it feels like miles between us
But I keep coming back to you

And it's rough, and it's tough
...
