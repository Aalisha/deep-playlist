When she comes
With the ghost of a smile
And she runs
Through his eyes for a while
Days turn
There's empty ground somewhere
Bring the gods
Line them up one by one
Turn the coin
Sound the fife and the drum
Rake it down
Till kingdom comes back here

There's a rise, there's a fall
Where the light hits the wall
Spins a Shadow
There's a rise, there's a fall
...
