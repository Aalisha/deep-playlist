Misunderstood by all but a few
You hope to overcome the demons chasing you
Tempted to give in and weary from the chase
The conflict in your soul shows in lines on your face
Telling of a tale that only you believe
To others who in pity watch
But soon will turn their backs and leave

Too many there's no hope
Except survive against the cruel world
Disown the cause of all the problems
They're your children soon forgotten
