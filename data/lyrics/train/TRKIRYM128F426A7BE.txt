I'm not trying to hide
the hunger i feel inside
It's under my skin a fire within
I can't deny oh yeah
I'm outta control
you better get out of my way
My body and soul as one in the role
I stalk my pray

These are my streets of fire
And i fight to be free
There's a fire and it's burning in me
These are my streets of fire
And i live to be strong
...
