Well here I am, back in town
Just as the night is comin' down
Warm wind blowin' through the trees
I watch them swing, I watch them sway
Lie here waiting for the day.

Sleep won't come, I need a drink
Stop my head, don't wanna think
Wishing I could be with you
But I know you're so far away
And I'm here waiting for the day.

Water of life pour your light down on me
Take me out of this darkness, sweet star of the sea
Water so sweet you can open my eyes
...
