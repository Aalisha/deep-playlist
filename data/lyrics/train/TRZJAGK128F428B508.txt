Don't be greedy
Don't be greedy
Don't be greedy
Don't be greedy

Every time I want a kiss
You put a cigarette between your lips
Oh my, I know why

Every time I mention sex
You turn away and say you're out of breath
Oh my, I know why

I know why you're coming home so late
I think it's time I put on the brakes
It's me or the other one baby
You can't have both
