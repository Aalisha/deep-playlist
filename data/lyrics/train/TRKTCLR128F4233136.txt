Yea gotta stay conscious - huh - aaah
Gotta get ma bread gotta keep ma head up

These are the days
When the gal dem in dem teens have the aids
Nuff yute nuh have degrees but dem hav the grades
Picture dis an' try fi si it wid yuh ears

These are the times
When yuh sneakers ain't yuh only nines
Some weh call pon Jesus a dem commit the crimes
Nuff illiterate an' still a read between the lines
Those are the dudes,
Claim dem a yuh fren an' want yuh food
Then some a dem a rob while some a dem rape
While some a dem kill while some a dem shoot
Is like we need a rated R pon the news

These are the days
When yuh caan trust police wid dem dutty ways
Juvenile a run the streets wid the Ks
Yo yuh caan even rest in peace in yuh grave
