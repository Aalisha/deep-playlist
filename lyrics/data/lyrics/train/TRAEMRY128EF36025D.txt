I can do anything
That's what she says
I could be anyone
That's what she says
Put on your masquerade and play and fade
She says, she says

I need to learn to dance
That's what she says
Take that stick out of my ass
That's what she says
I need to pirouette and sweat
And sway she says

And she says that time won't wait
...
