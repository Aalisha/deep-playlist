You'll always be my sunshine

Sunshine
You'll always be my sunshine
No one compares to you
Don't you go, don't you go nowhere (No)
You make all my dreams come true 
(They're comin true, comin true for me, yeah)
And thats why you'll always be my sunshine
My sunshine

When I see you
I got to stop to catch my breath, oh
Because it's somethin that you do to me
That I just can't express
And it may seem kind of crazy but it's true
Everything is all about you, yeah

Sunshine
