I've been with you for a while now
And you're still so nice
Not like all the others I've been around
Who love to fuss and fight

You've changed in no way
You're always at your best
I love your style, your personality
You're better than the rest

You're so considerate when it comes to me
I'm so glad to have you
So splendid you are to me
I love your everything

'Cause you're a lady
Lady you are
You're a lady
And I'm so proud of you

You're so sweet and innocent
...
