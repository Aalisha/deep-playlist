(together) Hiero y'all...

It's not a wrong thing
to be addicted to the microphone like a heroin fiend
I'll tell you one thing:
You'll never catch me fronting
As I proceed to give the people what they wanting
You're making some green...
But not for drama or fashion
I'm stacking cash until I can get Moms a mansion
All from rapping?
Nah man there's many plans
Like investing in land
It started all from impressing the fans
With brand new flows
And you know
All the way from gangsta clones to weirdos
Fools used those
But we ain't tripping
Give respect when you see this
You need us,
or your raps underdevelop like a fetus

Those that know not doze
And it shows
When we broke out the knock
Hos hopped out they clothes
That's positive feedback
Yep, The Prose
I'm poised, we never pose, you'll never know
...
