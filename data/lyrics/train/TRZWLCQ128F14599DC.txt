I ain't got to love nobody else
I ain't got to love nobody else
'Cause I got you

Now if the whole world will turn its back on me
I wouldn't lose a thing, no, no, no, because I got my baby
And to me she's every everything
That's why I can say

I ain't got to love nobody else
I ain't got to love nobody else
'Cause I got you, I got you
...
