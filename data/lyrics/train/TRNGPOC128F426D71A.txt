Your voice that sounded soft and sweet
Your manners knocked me off my feet
Infatuation made me blind
Today I know you are someone else
Than the one I keep in my mind

So now you think I'm yours
And you don't have to try
Seems nothing I do is right

How dare you talk to me like that
If you're not careful I'll get mad
How dare you talk to me like that
