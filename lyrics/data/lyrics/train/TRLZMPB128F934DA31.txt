Everyone keeps telling me I'm something I'm not
They fill me with questions that tear me apart
But through it all it was you who pulled me out
So please don't leave me now

Just give me one more night to hold you
One more night
Give me one more night to have you near

There's a man at the train stop with tears in his eyes
