Oh, live without you
Oh, I can live without you
Oh, live without you
Oh, I can live without you

I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time

I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time
I got love on my mind
Ain't no use in me wasting time

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

When the heartache is over
I know, I won't be missing you
Won't look over my shoulder
