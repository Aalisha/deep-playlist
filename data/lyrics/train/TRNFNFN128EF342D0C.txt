There's times when fake goodbyes made you cry
But this time you don't
And I was only joking
I was broken when you told me to go

Don't make up the wrong mind
Don't forget the good times

Let me stay a little longer
Cause if I'm gone I can't make it right
In just one night
We could go back in time maybe
Go back and find where we both went wrong
It won't take long, I know
Don't let me go
Oh don't let me go
