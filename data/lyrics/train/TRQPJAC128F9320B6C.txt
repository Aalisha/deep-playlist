I'm so fed up with everyone around me
No one seems to care
I'm just so far gone and nothing's gonna change
I'll never be the same
It's always do this, do that
Everything they want to
I don't wanna live that way (No!)
Every chance they get they're always

Pushing me away
It's never enough, no it's never enough
No matter what I say
It's never enough, no it's never enough
I'll never be what you want me to be
It's all so messed up and noone ever listens

Everyone's deranged
