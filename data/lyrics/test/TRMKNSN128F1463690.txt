We need a love revival, 
Somewhere for us to begin
To take apart the wounded hearts 
And love them back together again. 

Solemn promises are 
Too quickly spoken. 
That tie that binds the hearts 
Is easily broken. 
It hurts to leave and 
Yet it hurts to live a lie. 
It's easier to say goodbye. 

The family chain has oddly
Gained a missing link
Cheating pairs don't seem to care
What the children think
...
