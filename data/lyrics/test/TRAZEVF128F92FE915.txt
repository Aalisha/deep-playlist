You're at the top of my long list of heartaches
Right out there with the worst of the worst I've ever known
A real master of disaster, you're my number one mistake
And you're holding down your spark
At the top of my long list of heartaches
When we first met I knew you were a cut above the rest
With mere determination you've proved to be the best
They'll be singing your praises a hundred years from now
Congratulations, well, here's to you, stand up, take a bow
