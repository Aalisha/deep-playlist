One child that's born in peace,
One babe that knows no war
That's what we live to see
That's what were praying for.
A healthy and a happy one, born with no misery
A child that's so full of fun
And just as free as it wants to be
(And) we'll give 'em peace, with all we can give.
(And) We'll give 'em hope, with each day we live.
And our dream will be, this world will see
One Child of love, yeah
One Child of Love
