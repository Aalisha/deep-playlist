sometimes being inside just gives me the creeps
so i jump in my boots & get right oot on the streets
with the weirdos & the bars & the noise of the city
kickin' oot the jams with the licks of the skinny
getting up & oot to where they don't make cents
where they ceilidh & the fling
with their kilts on & everything
...
