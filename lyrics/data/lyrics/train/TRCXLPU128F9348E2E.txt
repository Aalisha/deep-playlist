Had a friend he would spend all his time going mad 
You never heard more absurd, his new versions of 'crazy horses' 
Finger to the head, everybody said he was cracked 
And he was out there, but somehow he always came back 
Back to zero 
Then he got put away up to the hospital 
Back to zero 
They let him out -- Now he's got nothing to say

The lesson learnt was to never return to that place 
Creating fear with control of your character on prescription 
Now he smiles like his files are being held to his face 
If he did resist a bit it wouldn't fit and there he goes again 
...
