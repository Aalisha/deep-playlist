I take some comfort in losing my memory
(Oh wait, oh, don't you let me down)
Then I get it back and I said,
"So this is what they mean?"
(Oh wait, oh, don't you get around)
They don't say that don't make it hard

Everybody's making faces in the dark
Don't stop struggling, that's what sets you apart.
It's the ghost of inhibition that's what's breaking your heart
Everybody, everybody's making faces in the dark.

I understood inhibition I was listening to
(They don't give up, they don't give in)
It's the middle of the summer and I got nothing to do
(Somebody get out, somebody get in)
I only miss my own city park

(Everybody)
