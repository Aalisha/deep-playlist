Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do, some can't be done
Things you can do
Yo, Deltron thunder force, ain't no other source of sunlight
Two ton mic, leave you tongue-tied
Runnin' amuck with technology with no apology
Shoutin' out to my colony with third eye physiology
Millennium past apocalypse is all I spit
Make you swallow it, your weak style, I'll abolish it
With nuclear rockets, they glued to your optics with sci-fi
Unsettlin' man and metal blends
Underground chillin' with the Mole Man and his whole fam
Inhibit bacterial growth, material wrote
Impenetrable, incontestable, indigestible intelligence
Never let a computer tell me shit
It's rapid innovation, penetratin'
Artificial life forms who bite songs
I'ma buy a vest, lies next, then I'll flip the biotechs
Right into the wireless, your third eye is hit with psoriasis
The mightiest Deltron Zero
Traverse and purge the travesties that tempt your ear holes
The area of distribution, lifts the clueless
My flow is like, liquid oxygen
Rip it often with specific impulse, increasin' thrust
...
