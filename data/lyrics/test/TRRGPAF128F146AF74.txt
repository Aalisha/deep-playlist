There's a portrait of Uncle Alvarez
Hanging in the hall
Nobody wants to look at it
But Uncle Alvarez sees us all

Ho, ho, ho, imaginary accomplishments
Hey, hey, hey, you visionary guy
You might even shake the hands of presidents
Better send a postcard and keep the family quiet

He's not really part Cherokee Indian
He didn't fight in the Civil War
He's just Eugene Isaac Alvarez
We feel sorry for the wall
