Hey stop, do you hear an echo?
I do but does anyone know?
The same old thing we hear an hour ago,
Different band, the same radio.
We broke down on the side of the road,
East coast we had to cancel the shows.
I'm trying as hard as I can.
But I'd rather write a song than a business plan.
Because this is me saying words I actually mean.
I won't compromise this thing just to make it.

I want to that's a given but,
I can't it imagine the same way as you.
Oh you know I'll never do the things they do just to make it.
Oh, oh whoa.
