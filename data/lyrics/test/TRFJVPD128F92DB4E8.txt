Change; I can't deal with this change.
All these people, they say that it's cause for inspiration.
But I've got this pain so real I see what I've gained
But I feel like I've gotten here by losing so much more.

Life won't wait for me to get back on both my feet again.
It just likes to sucker me into the new
And then flip the switch on everything I do
â€˜Cause when opportunity knocks you have to let her in

Change; I could just stay the same but what would that prove to you?
I've got this pain so real I see what I've gained
...
