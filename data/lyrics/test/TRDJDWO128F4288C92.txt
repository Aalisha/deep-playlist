How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changin'?
How can I be sure
Where I stand with you?

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
I wanna die 'cause you know I wanna stay with you

How do I know?
Maybe you're trying to use me
Flying too high can confuse me
Touch me but don't take me down

Whenever I, whenever I am away from you
My alibi is tellin' people I don't care for you
