I never thought that love would cut so deep
I guess I need a little understanding
And I wonder if the ends will meet
Can't stop this heartache
From coming my way

I've had enough I'm leaving
She said and walked away
Left me broken-hearted weeping
Tears will fall like rain today

Don't like these games you're playing
Well, easy come and easy go
I don't like these words you're saying
...
