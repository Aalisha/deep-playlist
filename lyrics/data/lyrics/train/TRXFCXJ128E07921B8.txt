ah, when I moan, when you're gone, I come
I wanna jump, when you wanna jump?
I wanna touch, where it makes you mine
I wanna push till I get it right

'Cos I'm free, free to do the dirty things you like
I'm free, free not to do what's on my mind
When you go down and freak on me
That's when I'm free, well, that's when I'm free

I wanna fall, so you can pick me up
I wanna scream until it hurts
...
