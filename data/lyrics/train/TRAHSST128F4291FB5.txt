The night's a spill, a permanent stain
The city soaks in silence, salt and dirty snow
A blue glow from the TV again
The curtains never open, faces never show

And every time a light is turned on
There's a light that's turned off somewhere
For every other moment that's lost
There's a perfect cost, there's a debt you can't share

Clock stopped at the corner of Albert will show
Your last bus left an hour ago

So stumble down the stairs again
Pretend you're not too proud
...
