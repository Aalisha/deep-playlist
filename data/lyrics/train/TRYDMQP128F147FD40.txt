Governments elected, nobody votes.
Politically correct, isn't that a joke?
We censor music then give children guns.
On CNN, still fighting to death over Jerusalem.
A four letter disease still makes us run,
Can't comprehend that you can die from Love.

Can a simple tune flow through you?
When the music feels like this,
When you lose control you gotta go with it.
Ten feet high, flying above the sky.
Your problems don't exist, when music feels like this.

No money left in Africa
Starvin' to death In Bosnia
we close our eyes and hide a nation's cries
And In the West TV Possessed and weight obsessed
The media dissects, infects
