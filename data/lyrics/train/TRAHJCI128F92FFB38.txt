I ain't goin'
I'm gone
Up up up and away
And I'm on
A higher plane
With a brain
With a flame
Feel the fire
Desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom
And understanding
Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level
Read the Holy Koran
Or the Bible
Because it's liable
To be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Who wants some
come get it
A battle is a test of wits
And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music
Alright hit it
Now that it feels good
I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
...
