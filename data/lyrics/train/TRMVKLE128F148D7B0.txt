Hey, how's your conscience lately?
You tried so hard to please me
And now you seem so uneasy
You say that you've had enough and you're out of love

And fall down on the ground again
I thought that it would be okay
But you had other cards to play
Just like a shot from a gun
I got hurt, I got stunned
That's how it hit me

Well, I just want to know why
Do you do this to me?
And where, is your sense of reason?
So how, could you fool me so long?
