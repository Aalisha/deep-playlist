stop, your not made like that
stop ask yourself where you made like that
and when you stop and ask whos the kings of the cats
stop and ask yourself am i made like that

to every king theres a few pawns
every rose theres a sharp thorn
grabbing attention like a loud horn
we're coming for it all you've been warned
i understand it all now better than before
ive had a little peice and now i want it all
and no aint a word that you'll here in this vocabulary
cos i have to be with my sanity
its the men that be
