Careful In Career
Take care
I take care
It's a shame
To go away
It's a shame to go away
It's a shame
To die already
Looking at you
Looking in through at me
Pouring X years of life
Pouring in ecstasy
Performance or ecstasy
I'm looking at you
Looking in through at me
I've come so far already
I've come so far already
So far
