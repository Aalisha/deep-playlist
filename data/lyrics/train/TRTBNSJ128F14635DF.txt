Does your appetite for novelty still burn?
And do you pick a fight just to feel the heat of his concern?
Do you still misbehave, then beg for his reprieve?
And do you love to feel his needy hands pulling at your sleeve?

Don't you always fall in love again
Just before you leave?
Don't you always fall in love again
Just before you leave?
