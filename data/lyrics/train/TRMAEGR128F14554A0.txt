Are you blind?
Blind to me trying to be kind
Volunteering for your firing line
Waiting for one precious sign

The flicker of a smile
You should try it just once in a while
Baby, it's not quite your style
It's simply too easy to do
And you might not see it through
See it through

Oh, so find yourself another place to fall
Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel
Well, I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall

Are you proud?
