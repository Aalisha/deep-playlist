I been down this street once or twice
i played the bars and the blues
never took noone's advice
to me its all yesterday's news
and we would drink an old flannery
we were drinkin' and drinkin' some more
the clock struck a quarter to three
the cops busted right in the door
(Refrain)
Goodbye Clevland
turn down the rock and roll
...
