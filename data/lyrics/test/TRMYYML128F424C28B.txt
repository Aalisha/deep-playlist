I've got some time to kill
So I'll sit here and wait until
Until the right thing comes along
I got some friends to meet
And I said I'd see them at the corner of the street
But I'm just on another losing streak

When you're wearing that frown
You're bringing me down
Slow down
But it's all fine
Cause I'm just killing time

God, now it feels so slow
