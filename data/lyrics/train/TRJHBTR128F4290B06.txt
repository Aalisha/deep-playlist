Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Leave me alone, never leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Leave me alone, never leave me alone
Never leave me alone

They tell me that temptation
Ooh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me
I tried to hide my feelings
D-O-G's ain't supposed to feel like this

You can call it what you want to
But I don't even know what to see
You've got me singin' in the morning
You bring me breakfast in my bed
And when it hurts you rub my head

I'll ask you one time only
Baby, won't you be there when it's hectic?
When I don't have a hit record

Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Leave me alone, never leave me alone
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Leave me alone, never leave me alone
Never leave me alone

I've traveled so many places
I've seen so many faces
And there were times
I didn't think I'd make it through

I went through so many phases
That got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gone
Then what you gonna do?
