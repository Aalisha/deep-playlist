Inside I maty be falling down
But outside I'm as tall as trees
But it's only when the quiet of the night falls that you find me
Wishing that you were wishing for me
'cause in every smile
on every face in every crowd I see you
never slate what a stranger says
But it's only when the night descends upon me i realise
that no-one can take your place
no no no no
'Cause somedays can be so fine
And somedays can be so right
Ooh it's amazing, yeah yeah
