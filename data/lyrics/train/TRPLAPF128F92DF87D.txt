Thought that I would forget you?
Heaven knows that's not my style.
And that I would let you...
Walk away without at least goodbye.
You shouldn't let those feelings fool you.
You shouldn't let those feelings get you down.

We're happy together now.
Feeling you close to me baby.
Happy till the end of time.
We're happy together now.
Feeling you close to me baby.
Happy till the end of time.
