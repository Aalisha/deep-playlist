I sent you roses, I warned you I would
Do all that I could to show you the way that I feel
Please, don't say, I'm wasting my time
I've got nothin' but time so I'll do all that I can to catch
That ghost of a chance

The sunlight, the moonlight are beyond my control
And there are stars in the Heavens that I'll never hold
But if dreams give you power then I'm strong enough to offer my heart
...
