Hover above my head and call me out, I'm beneath it all
Just a thief caught in the red, hands dirty from the crawl
Back to an unsuspecting victim, waiting on a different view
But it's too late now to change it
Wrapped inside, holding tight to the memory of your light

And that's enough for me
I'm better off just to know you, just stay right here with me
And that's enough for me

They're running from my eyes like there's a fire out of control
Saltwater testimony to a feeling in my soul
Given to me by your tireless power, undermining all I've learned
And it's too late now to change it
Wrapped inside, holding tight to the memory of your light
...
