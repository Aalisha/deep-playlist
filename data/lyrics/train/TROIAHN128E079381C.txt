Kid Rock
Devil Without A Cause
Where You At Rock
Bitch

Where you at Rock, where you at

Answering Machine: Beep
You fucking ass fucking hole
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Where the fuck are you
You fucking love me?
Yeah mother fucking right
Where the fuck are you? What are you doing?
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Fucking some groupie bitch
Goodbye
Fuck Off
You know what I hope your fucking dick fucking falls off
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
And when it does, maybe you'll have some mother fucking time for me
You fucking asshole
Don't call me no more
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Don't call
Don't beg
Don't call
Nothing at all, bye

(Where you at Rock, where you at)

Answering Machine: Beep
Yo Rock it's Carp
Ahh where you at man?
It's about 3 o'clock here in New York
I guess it's about 8 o'clock in London
Ahh your supposed to be at Abby Road finishing lyrics
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
I just got a call from one of these guys and he mentioned that you would
Ahh that you were thinking about going to Amsterdam
Which I just wanted to let you know that if you were pondering that
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
That it is not a good idea
We have matchering in three days
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Ahh just remind you
I'm at the office, see ya

(Where you at Rock, where you at)

Answering Machine: Beep
Where you at rock, where you at
Bobby where are you?
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
It's Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock
You know I did ask you to be at 3
You promised me you'd be here
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
Were having a special party for the whole family
It's Father's Day and I'm really upset
(Where you at Rock, where you at)
You know, we planned this whole thing around you
