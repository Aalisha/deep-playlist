I'm sleeping
right in the middle of a good dream
when all at once I wake up
from somethign that keeps knocking at my brain
before I go insane
I hold my pillow to my head
and spring up in my bed
screaming out the words I dread
I think I love you!
this morning i woke up with this feeling
I didn't know how to deal with
and so I just decided to myself
I'd hide it to myself
and never talk about it
and did not go and shout
when you walked into the room
I think I love you
I think I love you
...
