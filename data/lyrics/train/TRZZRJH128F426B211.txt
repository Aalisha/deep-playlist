I'm home again, I won the war
and now I am behind your door.
I tried so hard to obey the law
see the meaning of it all.
Remember me? Before the war
I'm the man who lived next door.
Long ago...

As you can see, when you look at me
I'm pieces of what I used to be.
It's easier if you don't see
Me standing on my own two feet.
I'm taller when I sit here still
you ask are all my dreams fulfilled.
They made me a heart of steel
the kind the bullets cannot see.

Nothing's what it seems to be
I'm a replica, I'm a replica
Empty shell inside of me
I'm not myself, I'm a replica of me...

The light is green, my slate is clean
New life to fill the hole in me.
