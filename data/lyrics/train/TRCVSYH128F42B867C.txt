You've cut it down
Down to the bone
You begin to spite yourself and all that still surrounds
You've been deceived now
By what you've sold
Truth gave way to consequence and left you all alone

(Chorus)
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
When i was holding you I think I died
Your touch
Your kiss
Its killing me so slowly i think
I lost the feeling in my heart tonight
