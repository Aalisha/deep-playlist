Well i don't know what'll come of this
And yeah i don't know if it'll change
But i do know that i care for you
And i'm the one to blame

Sitting here on my bed alone
Wishing you were here
Maybe someday this would be the case
I'd wait a thousand years

[bridge]
Don't walk away
I want you to stay
Just stay for a while
I love it when you

[chorus]
Smile!
Cuz i have fallen for you everytime, be mine
And when i see your face i freeze
Cuz you're the other half of me, my girl
I love it when you smile
