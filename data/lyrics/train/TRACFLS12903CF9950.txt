Can't fight this urge
I'm overwhelmed with anxiety
It's taking over me
Can't calm my nerves
I just can't seem to stop this calamity
Will it be the death of me?

I'm finding out
There is no doubt I need some help
How can I learn to protect me from myself?

This craving is too strong
Restraint is on the shelf
I just can't be alone with myself too long
Can't stop my trembling hands
I've got the shakes again
Convinced myself the needle's
My best friend
