Hey (X4)
No, I can't seem to get it,
And in my mind I'm bettin'
My time's made up, I gotta' go...
And it's alright if you want,
To see through your tomorrow,
But right, now I gotta' go...

If you want to stay then you can be here with me,
But I can't let go of all this love, oh no, so easily...

I said, if you want to stay then you can be here with me,
But I can't let go of all this love, oh no, so easily...
