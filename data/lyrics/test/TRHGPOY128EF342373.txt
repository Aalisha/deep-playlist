Things are gonna change
and not for better
don't know what it means to me
but it's hopeless, hopeless...
Got to get you home
could be with anyone
think of what i've done, uh
you know it all
Everything is everything
everything is everything
the more i talk about it
the less i do control
everything means everything
can't understand a word
half of the stuff i'm sayin'
The things i do possess
...
