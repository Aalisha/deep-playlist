When I feel like I'm loving kissing and hugging
I think about you
When my heart starts to burn and I get that crazy and mean
I think about you
When that feel comes all over me it's true
I want to see nobody but you
When I need to satisfy me without revving
Oh yeah I think about you
I think about you
You
You
Oh I think about you
I think about
You
You
Oh I think about you
When my body starts to sweat
you can say that I think about you
When I start to pass of through
all that I can't hey hey no no I think about you
I think about you
You
You
You
Oh I think about you
I think about you
You
You
Have a feeling, a different thing
