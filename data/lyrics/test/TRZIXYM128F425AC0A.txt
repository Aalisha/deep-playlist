Had my share of disco nights
Tinsel talk and rainbow lights
Easy smiles that shine like gold
Burnin? hot, then turnin? cold Led that kinda life before
I lost enough to learn the score
Somethin? tells me that there must be somethin? more This time I? m holdin? out for love
Made up my mind, I? m holdin? out for love
Mister, this time, I? m holdin? on
Holdin? back, holdin? out for love Had my fill of party scenes
One night stands and neon dreams
