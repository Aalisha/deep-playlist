Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Everyone comes in and out
Staring like a cinema
Shut these doors (shut these doors)
You're wrapped up in a uniform
Just a cigarette away from shedding tears (shedding tears)

Screaming for someone to come
Pick you up and take the weight

Screaming for someone to come
Pick you up and take the weight

Off, off, off, off
Off, off, off, off

Can't sleep, it's just too hot
I can't sleep, I can't believe

I can't sleep, it's just too hot
I can't sleep and I can't believe

Just how far it's gone, just how far it's gone
Every day and night, every day and night
How they get along, how they get along
...
