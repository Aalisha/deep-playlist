Thrown into sorrow
Raised into fear
Shadows of heartless commandments
Wasteland of zombies
That never lived
A ghetto grey and grey
A future so black
A past so extreme

A boy in a shell
The chains around your wings
To block your integrity
Before they will be amputated

Amputated!

Where the dogmatic
Ignorant rule
The spirit must agonize
Empire of Satan
