You don't drive a big fat car

you don't look like a movie star
and your money we won't get far.

But Baby yeah
yeah
you got what it takes to satisfy
you got what it takes to set my soul on fire
whoa oh yea - you got what it takes for me.

Now you don't live in a beautiful place

now you don't dress in the best of taste
and nature didn't give you such a beautiful face.

But Baby yeah
yeah
you got what it takes to satisfy
you got what it takes to set my soul on fire
...
