Björk
Wait for me underneath the water,
Wait for me I have to go now
Into the big city,
She pulls me firmly towards her.

Wait for me underneath the water,
Wait for me here,
You'll be fine underneath the water,
I'll be back early next summer.

Einar
We met again at the lake,
After all these years,
You said "want a drink?"
