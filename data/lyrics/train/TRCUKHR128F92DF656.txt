Head under water
And they tell me
to breathe easy for a while

The breathing gets harder,
even I know that
Made room for me

but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages

No easy way to say this
You mean well,
but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you asked for it
'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's

make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leaving
...
