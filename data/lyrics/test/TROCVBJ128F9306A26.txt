It's the fame that holds you in vain
But in your letter it's playing your game
It's so hard when love gets dark in the summertime
And I got a bird here in my ear
Telling me stories all made by fears who will come true
When you get old, just pray
And I just got it all from
Mr.Feeling wrong with money
And I'm gonna tell you one thing now
The last time infected me
The last time infected me
