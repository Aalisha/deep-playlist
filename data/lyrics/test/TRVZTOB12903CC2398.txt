she's a pretty girl.
she's a model in the studio.
she's a beauty queen.
she's a knockout.
she's my beauty queen.
she's a fucking knockout.
blonde bombshell, blue eyed beauty you rock my fucking world.
and she turns me on.
like her names lit up on sunset.
a model in the making and i've fallen for her.
and ill fall for her tonight.
