The road to hell was paved with good intentions
That's the path that brought me here
You sell your soul for roles you take
And then you have to look into the mirror

So feed us cancer, give us drugs
Sell us half-ass educations all so we can
Pick a job to pay the rent
Forget your dreams and what they may have meant to you in your youth

Find a bride and raise the kids
Teach them from mistakes that you have made
Are we predestined or just well-trained?
Invent a god and place the blame for all this hurt you feel

And on and so on
...
