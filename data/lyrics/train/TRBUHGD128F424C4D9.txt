She said "Your party's jumpin' and ev'rybody's havin' a
good time
Now you know what's goin' through my mind
Do you mind if I get comfortable and kick of these
shoes
While you're fixin' me a drink
Play me some o' them down home blues"

She say "I don't get out much on the town
And you know I done cut out a lot of that runnin'
around
All week long I've been keepin' my cool
But tonight I'm gonna let my hair down
And get down with these down home blues"

Down home blues (down home blues)
Down home blues (down home blues)
All she wanted to hear was some down home blues
...
