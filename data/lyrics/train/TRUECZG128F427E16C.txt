I've used hammers made out of wood
I have played games with pieces and rules
I've deciphered tricks at the bar
but now your gone
i havent figured out why
Ive come up with riddles
and jokes about war
ive figured out numbers and what there for
Ive understood feelings
and ive understood words
but how could u be taken away

And wherever you've gone
and where ever we might go
it dont seem fair
today just disappeared
...
