Rails until the city sun
And the longest hallway on Valencia
Are screaming your name
Through a mess of sweat-soaked covers

And the bottles that you've been pissing in
Used to be filled with your medicine
But the signature on the prescription is your own

I want you to say that you understand
How it fell right through your shaking hands
It's making me sick
...
