Shackles and chains and bloody meat
Walls of stone entomb
Torture chamber victim's punishment
Savage execution
Branding iron engraving your flesh
A searing horrid crime
Manacles incarcerate
Prongs impale your eyes

Endure the Iron Maiden
Insidious device
Avoiding vital organs
Coffin laced with spikes
Gruesome tools of torture
Strategically applied
Prolonging mutilation
Condemned and necrotized

Turning hte screw, increasing the force
Cranial compression
Pressure of the skullcap, crushing teeth
