well
it used to be easy for me
to hang out and get high
what you're going through is killing you
now you're shooting me the evil eye

you holler at me, it's ugly to see
you hurt yourself and lose your pride
'cause the villain in me is in ecstasy
and i'm taking it all in stride

all the rumors will start, don't let 'em tear us apart
don't let our love become unbound
you gotta learn to take the destruction, babe
what goes around comes around
