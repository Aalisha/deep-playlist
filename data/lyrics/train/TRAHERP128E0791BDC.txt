SAVE ME!
Somebody save me
SAVE ME!
Somebody save me, yeah

Promised myself after the first romance
I wouldn't give ya a second chance
Said you see, you're sure to find
A but the closer I get to ya, baby
You drive me stone out-a-my-mind

SAVE ME!
Oh, yeah, SAVE ME! yeah, yeah
Those who love always give the most
