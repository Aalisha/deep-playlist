Japanese Half
Miscellaneous
Can't Get Enough
Can't Get Enough (gimme your love)
Gimme your love
Can I get enough get closer
I can't get enough
Can't get enough
Gimme your love
setsunai mune no oku
kimi e no omoi kaku
yasashii kimi no koe
But you don't understand my heart and soul
Don't be afraid to love me
toki bakari sugisatteiku yo
I'll tell you what I want
'Coz I've wondering soba ni itai yo
sou open up the door
Uncover the mystery
ima shika nai ima dakara
I'll tell you how I feel tonight
Open up the door
You'll never have to worry
