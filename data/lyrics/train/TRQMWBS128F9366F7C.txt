It starts with pain
Followed by hate
Fueled by the endless questions
No one can answer
A stain covers your heart
And tears you apart
Just like a sleeping cancer

No I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe that the world can't be saved
How did you get there and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart

What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold

Are you sane
Where is the shame
A moment of time passes by
...
