I come awake
With a gift for womankind
You're still asleep
But the gift don't seem to mind
Rise on this occassion
Halfway up your back
Sliding down your back
Touching your behind

You look so self-possessed
I won't desturb your rest
It's lovely when you're sleeping
But wide awake is best

Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
...
