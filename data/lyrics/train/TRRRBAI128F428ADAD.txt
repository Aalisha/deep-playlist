Every night before I sleep
I thank the Lord for givin' me another day
So I can be with you
'Cause I ain't never seen a face
So beautiful in every way
I can't believe that I'm here with you

And I cry-y-y 'cause I-I'm so in love
'Cause you don't know what it means to me to finally find someone
I was searchin' for the perfect girl, the woman of my dreams
And now she is in love with me

And even though I've been around the world
Never did I find a girl
That makes me feel the way you know you do
And even though love has been kind to me
Never did I dream
I would find me a girl like you

Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, yeah

When I'm makin' love to you
...
