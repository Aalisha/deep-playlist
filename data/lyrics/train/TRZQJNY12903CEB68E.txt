Never know how much i love you
Never know how much i care
When you put your arms around me
i get a fever thats so hard to bare
youre given me fever, when you kiss me
fever when youre holden me tight
Fever
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
