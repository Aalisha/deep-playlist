All the years of loneliness
Came crashin' down on me
But like a storm that's just been buildin' up {And buidin' up}
Too long

When I look inside to find me, mmm, hmm
There was no one there to guide me
And I'm tired, tired of trying so hard
To be strong

I need, I need, I need
The comfort of a man, oh, yeah, yes, I do, I can feel it
I need (Ooh), I need (Oh, yes, I need), I need
The comfort of a man
Man that understands
{Like the comfort of a man}
Woo, yeah, no, no...

Don't you think it's awfully sad
How empty life can be
I'd give my soul to someone who needed me {Just needed me}
For me
