Ye-ah-ah
Yeah
I would be your man
You would be my girl
Oh yeah
I beleive
I do
If there's any justice in the world

I would be your man
You would be my girl oh yeah
If i'd found you first you know its true
He would be alone
I would be with you
When you decide, dont let me down

Coz there's nothing to be certain in my life
And you've seen a thousand times
There's not much justice in the world
oh no uh
