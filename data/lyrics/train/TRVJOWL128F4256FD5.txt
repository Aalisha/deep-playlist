Flesh peeled exposing the rotting scent of death
The center of damnation
Tears Shed Falling into the abyss
sorrow wraps its arms

On knees I bend wounds enrapture
Breaking - Writhing - God's pain eternal
Into oblivion once again - sights focus
With blind resolve - killing the child

(x2)
Born from life
The stench of pleasure
