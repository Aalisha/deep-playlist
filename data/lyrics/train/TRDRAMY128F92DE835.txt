Oh, punch the clock
Put it on me baby, ain't that much time, oh I
Tic toc, want you to love me like the flowers love the sunlight
Don't stop, oh baby take me and touch me until I pop, ooh

Do that, do that, do that, yeah
Hit that spot like you knew that, yeah
Rock me till I'm clueless, yeah
I'm foolish, yeah

I like when you work me like that, like a 9 to 5
Oh boy, work me like that, make me feel so right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
