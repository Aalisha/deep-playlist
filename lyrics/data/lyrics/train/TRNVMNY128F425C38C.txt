I hate those guts
Someone vanishes today
You stupid, sick, crippled bitch
The payback time has come

You are living through these days
By killing everything that lives
Where do you stand
And which way are you looking at?
I will eat you feet first
You slow minded bastard

All your friends are gone
It must feel bad to be alone
