You say your time has come
You're tired of waking up
Don't be obscene
I can't conceive of living without you

You say you drag me down
No one should want you now
When I start to cry you kiss my eyes
And say I'm not allowed to

Burning beacon in the night
Can't feel its heat or see its light
That single solitary guide
...
