ooh, take a walk in the park under the stars
baby take my hand the night is ours
i never knew what loving u could do
om feelin like i wanna follow through

u look into my eyes and u make my temperature riseand u keep me
fantasising, baby

u can take me home tonight
im not makin promises
dont meke it more than what it is
u can take me home tonight
take it slow boy we can chill and if im feeling u i will

maybe, would u let a thug give u a hug
maybe, maybe stroke your back til u fall in luv
maybe, if its cool can i kiss u please
maybe, love u down til we fall asleep
