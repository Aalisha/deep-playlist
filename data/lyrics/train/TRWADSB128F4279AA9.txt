I never thought
I'd change my opinion again
But you moved me in a way

That I've never known
But you moved me in a way

That I've never known

But straight away
You just moved into position again

You abused me in a way
That I've never known

You abused me in a way
That I've never known
So break me, shake me

Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops
Then you will be alone

Just break me, shake me

Hate me, take me over
When the madness stops
