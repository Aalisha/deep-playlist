Waiting for something
I'm waiting for my luck to change
Fearing the routine,
Of that which I cannot escape
Racing to touch fire
I always arrive when there's just ash

I know my luck has got to change
To change, I'm waiting

Waiting for something
I'm waiting for the time to pass
Pushing through windows,
Then I'm left holding broken glass
Racing to touch fire
I always arrive when there's just ash
