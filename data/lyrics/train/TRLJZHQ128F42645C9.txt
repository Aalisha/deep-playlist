Hypnotized
With just one look at you
I'm paralyzed
I can't explain
Why just one touch from you
Drives me insane

You've got me head over heels
Better believe it baby
And I love how it feels

Cross my heart
Hope to die
May lightning strike me
If I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart
I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone
More than I'm loving you
Cross my heart it's true

Believe me

Heavenly
Something happens
When you're next to me
I get chills
You can ask me anything
