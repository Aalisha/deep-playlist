"Come home", a whisper is heard
your name is called
alone
a flower sits and withers
waiting for the faceless one
in your dreams
you haven't met
who will wear the flower just for you
and no one else
wait painfully

Come home alone
without the past
the future
the promise that you kept from there
hush the noise
quiet and still
no
...
