I told you how long we've got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me

I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me

I told you how long we've got
All the time in the world
I've got a thing for you
You've got a thing for me

I've got my mind made up
You've got my heart you know
You've got a thing for me
You've got a thing for me...
