In the valley of the dying sun
I walk a crooked path alone
I came across the shadow of a man
With an angel's breath

"Oh, boy," he said to me
"I see your future
Though you long for peace
The sword is your father"

I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you when I kill a good man
To keep myself from being killed by him
I'm thinking of you
I'm thinking of you when I hold my girl
And wonder if she'll ever love again
I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of you
Wash the blood off my hands
I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of you

Bathed in the powder of a thousand guns
I am the king of sorrows
Watered by the tears of the innocent ones
The river grows
...
