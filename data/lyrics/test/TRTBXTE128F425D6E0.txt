All along the western front
People line up to receive
She got the power in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the amazon
With the voltage running through her skin
Standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

I said ooh girl
Shock me like an electric feel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
I said ooh girl
Shock me like an electric eel
