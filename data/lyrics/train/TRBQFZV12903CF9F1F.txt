Lord, Won't you give me the strength to be strong, and be true
Cos, Lord, when the devil gets into my head, I'm so blue

You knock me, if you're so mighty, why waste your time with me
If I'm bad, ignorant and sad
Why waste your time, you're mad
You're just mad, because your life is sad
You've done nothing worth while
Twist the knife
Because you hate your life
