I'm in love,
I'm in love,
I'm in love with a girl,
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love,
I'm in love, with a beautiful girl,
But she don't give a darn about me
to make her love me I tried,
How I sighed and I cried
But she just refused
And ever since she's gone away,
I've got those lovesick blues

Got the feeling called the "blue hoo's,"
since my sweetie said "Good Bye"
