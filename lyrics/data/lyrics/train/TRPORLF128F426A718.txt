Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
Oh, feelin' maybe he'll see a little better set a days, oh yeah
Oh, hand out faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ah
Oh, dark grin he can't help when he's happy he looks insane, hey
Evenflow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away, oh
Oh, someday yeah, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again
