Rosalita, now our summer's gone and you've left me all alone...
You know I never expected, no I never suspected that
You came to me to steal my love away

You said I've always been a dreamer
'Cos dreaming is all I've ever done
Just like our summer - I thought it would last forever
But as the autumn came, you had gone away
All the promises you broke meant more to me than gold
Now I'm all alone in the heartbreak zone
...
