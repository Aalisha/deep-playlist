Wildcat Kelly, lookin' mighty pale
Was standing by the sheriff's side
And when that sheriff said, "I'm sending you to jail"
Wildcat raised his head and cried

Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wild open country that I love
Don't fence me in

Let me be by myself in the evening breeze
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
Send me off forever, but I ask you please
Don't fence me in
