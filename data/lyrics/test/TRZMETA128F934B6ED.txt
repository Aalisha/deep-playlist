I drown in depressions. 
Countless addictions wear me down. 
Here's a confession. 
I'm gonna kill myself tonight. 

The downward spiral. 
An endless stream of accidents. 
I feel so useless. 
I'm better off dead. 

Hating life. 

Look in my eyes. You'll see the dark. 
A sharpened knife. Will set me free. 

No more frustrations. 
About all the bad shit in my life.
