I realize that I'm just naturally inclined
To go and let you down, alright
I've heard this argument made thousands of times
I guess I get it now, alright

If physics dictates things are going away
Just when the pressure's on, alright
Science will just have to surrender to fate
'Cause I won't let you down, alright

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

You know that I wouldn't say
Something I didn't mean
How many times can this be repeated
Before you believe that I do believe?
I believe it

I know that evidence is gonna suggest
That I will let you down, alright
