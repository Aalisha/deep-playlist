I'm surrounded by sub-entity
I knew it would happen
Figure in black would take me into the shades
Six-feet under and it's hard to breathe
I knew it would end here
Sheep in wolf's clothing entombed in waste
Today I wish I'd have a gun

Gasping for air I'm rotting all alone
Just how I wanted
With Karma's blades carving my flesh to bone
I am reaping everything I've sown
The filth I have planted
And digging south towards the great unknown
Oh yes I wish I'd have a gun

Been playing the bitter game with leeches sucking blood out from my veins
