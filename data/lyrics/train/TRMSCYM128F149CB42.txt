I can't feel my love anymore
I can't feel my love anymore
The mystery and the splendor
Don't thrill me like before
I can't feel my love anymore

I don't want to talk to anyone
I don't want to talk to anyone
All the words that used to work
Have melted in the sun
And I don't want to talk to anyone

Faces look familiar,
