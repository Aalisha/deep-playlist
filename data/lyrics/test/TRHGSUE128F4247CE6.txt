I wished that we'd gone back in to bed
Through? with? each time I try to tread?
And when I have to stop and think awhile
It's funny but have to smile a little smile
I'd go through hell and high water
Just for your embrace
I'd go through hell and high water
Just to see your face.

Ohhh... nobody could love me, Lindsey
The way you do
Nobody could turn my rain to shine
The way you do
Ohhh... nobody could miss me, Lindsey
...
