Where there is grief, there will be hope
And if ever a hand is in need,
know that I'll be holdin' on
Know that the peace that comes from above
is the same everlasting love

Remember me whenever you're all alone
And if it helps you to sleep know that I'll be looking on
Know that the peace that you dream of
is the same everlasting love

You know I've watched you carry all this weight upon your shoulders
As if no one understands what you go through

But with all the might in you
believe what I say is true
When I say that I will never ever leave you...
or forsake you

So you just reach out as far as you can
Should the whole world just stare in disbelief
...
