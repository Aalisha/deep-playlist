Rain trumps the lifeless ground
Drops as cold as Ice
The doors breaking
The trench are shaking
The fire hits us all around
When the siren cries
Forward, forward we go into attack!

May today become the day
As I plunge into the grave
Let it slide in
All the signs are there
They all think that I'm brave
The strongest link of our chain
...
