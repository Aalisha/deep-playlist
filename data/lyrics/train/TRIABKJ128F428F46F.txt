The tables are empty, the dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song, it's the tenth time you've heard it
That's the beginning, just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson in learnin' the blues
The cigarettes you light one after another
Won't help you forget her and the way that you love her
You're only burnin' a torch you can't lose
'Cuz you're on the right track for learnin' the blues
