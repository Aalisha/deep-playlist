You think that we can't see your face
I think you need to give us our space
You know that we can raze this place
And leave you without a trace

Storm trooper, storm trooper
Why are you here?
The youth them getting restless
And they don't want you near

Your watching us, your watching us
It's so improper
We've seen your kind
Before we call it informer

Storm trooper, storm trooper
Where will you go?
This world she no like you
So you better stay low

And up from the mountains
And out from the trees
That is where you come from
You crawl like the one disease

So now you pass me the laser beam
And you want me to join the team
Well, I'm not used to these kinds of things
But this is what the evil brings

Let me tell you 'bout the fire
You could bring the waters up above
I'll bring my favorite people
And I'm bringing all my love

You want a battle
Well, don't look very far
You want to fight somebody
Come fight the superstar

I knew you wouldn't stand a chance
You left without a passing glance
There's nothing you could ever do
...
