I remember, every word you said
I'll remember all until my dying day
I can't forget just what you said meant
But I'll try my best still anyway

Every promise broken I remember
Don't ever think I don't
Can't forgive can't forget
While I try to heal my wounds

I remember like it was yesterday
All my days were filled with joy
Then you came in lie a black cloud
And my happiness was destroyed

Every promise broken I remember
...
