[Intro - Louis Logic]
Every time I leave my house
Pork patrol wanna seek me out
Did I see it? Did I do it?
C'mon on down to the station house
They scream out, "Hey, how's that high?"
Shine the flashlight around my eyes
Every time some coward cries
They doubt that I have an alibi

[Verse One - Louis Logic]
It's bizarre how I got a disregard
For prison bars but it isn't hard
To see why I hate the mainstream and daydream of beatin' Dave Matthews with his guitar
I live to scar you with a lit cigar
If I miss the charts I'll put a mail bomb in your Christmas card
'Cause you jealous of the fact that I'm blowing up and you?
My true intentions are cruel intentions
New ways to hurt you with new inventions
You figure you're a star I'll hit you with a car and flatten you down to two dimensions
You want me to be non-violent?
It's only gonna happen on the day that I'm signin'
Which isn't too often
'Cause I can't be sober when you're standing over Lou's coffin
And any other time I got a beer in my hand
And mysterious plans to put fear in your fans
Until degenerates shit for the champ of born losers here for the weirdos and porn users
My last three last shows were fiascoes
This dude came up like, "You see that ho? I dare you to grab her ass."
So I grabbed her snatch and had a fight with these three assholes
Now I'm mad at that and there's an A-P-B
The cops kicked my ass when they came for me like they hold a grudge
So I stood up in the court room and told the judge I got A-D-D

[Chorus - Louis Logic]
I'm mischievous
I make people wanna slit they wrists
A whole lot of parents and critics
