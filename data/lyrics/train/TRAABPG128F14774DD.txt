Sex is on everyone's tongue
Everybody wants to be tied up with someone
Expectations are higher than kites
I see through it sometimes 

Sex is on everyone's tongue
Everybody wants to get a quick hit a quick fix
And that's just what's going on 
Makes me wonder sometimes
Why we all play the game

Kissing perfect strangers with no shame
We don't catch their name
Cos we'll never fall in love
That's a word we don't get 
Enough Of
