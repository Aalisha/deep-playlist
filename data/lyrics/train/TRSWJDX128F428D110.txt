She'll turn thirty-four this weekend
She'll go out with her girlfriends
They'll drink some margaritas
Cut up and carry on
There'll be guys and there'll be come ons
She'll probably get hit on
But she thinks all the good ones are gone

She's got friends down at the office
And she can't help but notice
That when the day is over
How they all hurry home
Everday there's guys she works with
...
