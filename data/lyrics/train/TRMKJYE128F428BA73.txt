The moon was all aglow
And heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

The stars all seemed to know

The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I try, but there's no forgetting
When evening appears
I sigh, but there's no regretting
In spite of all of my tears
