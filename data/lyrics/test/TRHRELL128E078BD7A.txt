From the flames of a burned down heart
Ripped off and torn apart
Life to ashes and life to death
I twist the blade and take your breath

In the twist of blade I feel
The passion to hate arising

Cruelest mind, my thoughts are running through
Deepest fear, no light shines on you
Son of no one and breeder of fear
I'm coming to take you away
Shadow hearted, me, wild one

Bringer of pain and darkest despair
...
