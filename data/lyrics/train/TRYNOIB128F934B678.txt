Yeah here we go
I know I said this once before
It takes one bullet to hit the floor
And make wrong things right
I remember yesterday
Falling through the broken glass
I tried and tried and tried again, for what
Remember how we used to laugh
When tempers fall from the sky
And sound poetic but I don't care
We'll dance the night away
To keep our heart giving out
For loss of words, We'll paint a perfect picture
