Straight up funk in your ear
If you really want it
It's over hear
Straight up funk in your ear
If you really want it
It's over hear

Yo, it's mad funkiness
And we be blowin' up blough
Tell me what you want boo
And I'm a do it now
It's my turn da boss
Baby time to set it off
Be all up in your action
With passion of course

Level with your mental
Funk I get into
All of the things
That you need to get into
Rock the set
Straight up the concept
'Cause we be goin' down
Diggy diggy down, diggy diggy check

I know that you want something from me, yeah
Well, I got something I know you need

From the east to the west
Everybody get up now
(Get on up, get on up)
