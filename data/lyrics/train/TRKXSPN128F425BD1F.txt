Disappointed
You know there's never gonna be a cheery face inside this crowded room
Think you're the shit now
Because my lingo is so out of the the loop, why yes I'm out of the loop
Let's turn our nose up
Become a snob because we're treadin' on rooves, 'cause we're so fuckin' cool
Oh, give the act up
You know you're geeks that conglomerate in the city we speak of

'Cause you don't always get what you want
I know you can, I know you can, I know you can
'Cause you don't always get what you want
I know you can, I know you can, I know you can

Attack, attack
My disposition, get the vulnerable, predators on the loose
Yeah, let's be vulgar
Internet sex, naked computers!
