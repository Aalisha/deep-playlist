You just keep on pushing
You won't let it get away
You've got my mind thinking
We won't see another day
If you keep on reaching and stressing me
You might just push me away, hey...

Girl, you've always got some drama going on
Somebody told me that they saw you in an ex-man's arms
Kissing and laughing, passions splashing Alizae
And you caught an attitude when I asked you what you had to say
Don't get it twisted, 'cause I catch it on the low
But you got me open like I've never been before
You come home late at night, I'm chilling with my friends
Then comes an argument
You got me thinking about leaving you again

You just keep on pushing
...
