Everybody's going out and having fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none
I can't get over how he set me free, oh, lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
Well I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool that's blind and just can't see, oh, lonesome me

Well, I'll bet he's not like me, he's out and fancy free
