(Allman, Sloyer, Cadden-James, LaBrie)

I never saw it coming
Somehow the heat of battle
Sure dulled my senses to the real world
Or was I dreaming?
She held my hand and knew me
She looked right through all I knew

Lie quiet, let the rain wash over me now

Inside the royal chambers
She's staring out her window
Tears well hidden by a crimson veil
This is the poison
Clutching a Turkish dagger
By the moonlight I feel it begin

I'm wounded, let the pain wash over me now

Loneliness again
Sits here alongside of me
Gotta make my way
...
