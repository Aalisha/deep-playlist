I took another step
To find out which way my feet would fall
The right way must be left
Straight ahead is never good at all

I found myself beside
A boat about to leave for foreign tides
I shouted for a ride
But no one answered me, no one replied

What's a room when we are gone?
Just some walls that don't belong
What's a body when there's fear?
Of love man, we're so near

I'm so near, I'm so near, I'm so near
...
