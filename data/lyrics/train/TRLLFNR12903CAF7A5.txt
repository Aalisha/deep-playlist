And then she took my soul, but I didn't know
That gypsy woman's got me under control.
She fed me lies while she cast her spells.
That gypsy woman's really ringing my bells.

And to Hell, I will go, 
Knocking right on Satan's door.
Heavens no, this ain't it.
Honey, I won't beg, I'll just take it quick.
She took me to my knees, 
And now she's got me praying.

Save me, she's a liar, 
And I can't seem to untie
The rope she's got wrapped around her finger.
Think I lost the last bit of my self control.
