(Yeah...)

Gonna make me scream
Wanna cause a riot
Make a lot of noise
I don't want to be quiet
When it gets real loud
Make it even louder
Gotta turn me on (Uhhhhh...)
Gotta make me higher

You gotta know what to do
If you wanna get down
So don't go off too smoothe
You're running out of time
Turn it up (Ohhhwaaa...)
Turn it up
Turn it up (Ohhhhwaaa...)
Turn it up
Turn it up (Ohhhwaaa...)
Turn it up
Turn it up (Ohhhwaaaaa...)
Turn it up

Can you make me hot
Make me touch the ceiling
Can you read my mind
Can you gimme that feeling
When I lose my clothes
You like that, don't cha?
Let's get exposed
Cause you know you want to

You got to know what to do
If you wanna get down
