Down at the arsenal they keep the nerve gasses
Guarded day and night by caged white rabbits
Been sitting there for years I'm gonna have at it
I cut through the fence, I run in and grab it
Go crazy, crazy, crazy
Now I got my own mustard gas in my pocket
Climb on a tree on a branch and drop it
On a country club full of Saturday golfers
So I can watch them die chokin' shakin' in convulsions
Go crazy, crazy, crazy
Chemical warfare, chemical warfare
Chemical warfare, warfare warfare
