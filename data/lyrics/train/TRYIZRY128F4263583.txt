Cigarettes
I'm all alone
With my smoke and ashes
Cigarettes
I'm all alone
With my smoke and ashes
Take me night-flying
Maybe
Mars has good news
Who?
Who am I?
I am the blues

Sooth me
Horn's warm red love making
Funky music
Move me
Night wind, red taillights
And funky music
'Cause I'm restless
In my love for sale shoes
Who?
Who am I?
