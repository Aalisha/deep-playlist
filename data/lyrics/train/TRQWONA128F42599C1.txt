I play around don't stay around
This old town too long
Seems like I got to
Travel on

A lotta people won't get no supper tonight
A lotta people won't get no justice tonight
The battle is getting harder
In this iration, Armagideon time

A lotta people running and hiding tonight, ah
A lotta people won't get no justice tonight
Remember to kick it over
No one will guide you, Armagideon time
...
