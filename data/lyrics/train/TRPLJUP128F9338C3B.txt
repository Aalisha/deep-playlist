A thousand stars in the skies
Like the stars in your eyes
They say to me
That there'll never be
No other love
Like yours for me A thousand stars in the skies
Make me realize
You are the one love
That I'll adore
Tell me you love me
Tell me you're mine once more(You're mine, you're mine once more) Each night I count
The stars in the skies
