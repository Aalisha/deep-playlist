(#1) Everytime I wake up late
(#2) Everytime it rains
(#3) Everytime I'm thinking straight
(#4) Everytime I pain
(#5) Everytime I'm sittin' in the morning
(#6) Everytime I read
(#7) Everytime I'm not expecting that yearning
(#8) Everytime I leave

(#9) Everytime I cross the street
(#10) Everytime mundane
(#11) Everytime I feel the heat
(#12) Everytime I pain
(#13) Everytime I write to you
(#14) Everytime I read
(#15) Everytime I write to me
(#16) Everytime I plead

Everytime I think about you - I think about you
