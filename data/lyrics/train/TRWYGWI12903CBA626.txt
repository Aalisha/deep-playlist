Every night I remember that evenin'
The way you looked when you said you were leaving
The way you cried as you turned to walk away

The cruel words and the false accusations
The mean looks and the same old frustrations
I never thought that we'd throw it all away
But we threw it all away

And I'm a little bit lost without you
And I'm a bloody big mess inside
And I'm a little bit lost without you

This ain't a love song, this is goodbye
This ain't a love song, this is goodbye

I've been lost, I've been out, I've been losing
I've been tired, I'm all hurt and confusion
I've been mad, I'm the kind of man that I'm not

I'm throwin' down, I'll be coming back fighting
...
