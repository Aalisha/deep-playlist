Beam me, beam me, beam me, beam me up Scottie
Not as to where I have no control of my body
Tweaking diodes I walk the roads like karate masters
Most the time my mind be ghost like Casper, sinkin' faster

But coming up in this shit, sometimes I'm alienated under rated
Suckas hate it that I made it as a misfit
But you know if the shoe fit's I'ma wear it like a glass slipper
Hike to the big dipper, dip like a skipper not top could be tipper

Say what? But fools be tryin' to rape friends to make friends
And that's one big twisted ass picture like Jack the Ripper
Caught up in the net like Flipper on a Tuna protest
Yeah, where's the focus

Got me fuckin' with these friends
And they're crackin' my lens
And now shit be'z foul as a mutha
Word to my sistas and my brothas and my color

Hey you, can I take up a moment of your precious time
