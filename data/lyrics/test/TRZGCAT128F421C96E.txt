Joke about nothing and you'll be forgiven
the laughs are just dying out one by one
the lonelies are coming to gather their forces
left on a string, the emptiness forges us on and on
on and on

a weakness so strong you could wrap your arms around it
smother cheeks and smothered arms
sad but it's not maybe just for a moment
why won't you hold me?
why won't you carry me on and on?

No more patient
on and on
no more patient
