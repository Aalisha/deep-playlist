Stop this runaway car
I wanna get off, I wanna go back
If I left you there then I left it all behind

'Cause all I'm feeling now
Is the weight of the world bearing down
I don't have answers to any of my questions anymore

'Cause I might have been wrong
I might have been scared all alone
Might have been standing on the top of the world

What a difference a day makes, I turned and watched you walk away
I might have been standing on the top of the world
'Cause I might have been wrong

Tail lights and a seat on the right
...
