You got me all screwed up
So much I can't turn 'round

And I've been running about with some funny girls
I'm not so tough

But if you let me down
I'll tell ya

I'd give you just one day to explain
I'd like to know if there's somebody else in this game
Say it isn't so
Tell me I'm the only one
Say it isn't so
Without you I can't go on
How was I to know
If you keep me guessing I don't understand
I can't sleep at night

I keep on dreaming you're gone
I'm staring into a space that was filled by your face
Facing the day
