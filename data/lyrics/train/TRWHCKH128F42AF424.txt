(Missy:)holla, new monica shit.yes.oh baby.yep

I been feeling something
U been treating me cold
U no longer want to touch me
the love has turned cold
and i don't feel special
the feeling i need to feel
in my gut i'm feeling something...
another woman, keep it real

(CHORUS)
I, I had to go move on(had to go move on)
cause you're not worthy of my love and all we did was fight and fuss(fight and fuss)
and she would, she would call your phone
and you would act like i was wrong for cursing you all night long

Now to you if zip means nada
so don't call don't page don't follow
and you can see me in the club, don't holla
and if you see me looking good don't bother
i know you hate to see me with my baby father
