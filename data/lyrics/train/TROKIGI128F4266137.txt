Words and Music: Austin Roberts, James Dunne, Mike Reno

Oh what an illumination love can be
Open up your eyes to its light and you will see
You did that for me, you opened up my eyes

Then extraordinary changes started happening to me
My temperature would rise and fall inside of me
Words came naturally, you were more than I could fantasize
And I'll never know, why someone's heart wants to die
If you ever need, if you need to tell me goodbye

Don't keep me in the dark
Silence won't protect you
If you're gonna leave
You got to let me know

Don't keep me in the dork
...
