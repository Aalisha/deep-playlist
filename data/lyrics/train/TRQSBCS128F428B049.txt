With one light on in one room,
I know you're up when I get home
With one small step upon the stair,
I know your look when I get there
If you were a king up there on your throne,
Would you be wise enough to let me go?
For this queen you think you own

Wants to be a hunter again,
Wants to see the world alone again
To take a chance on life again, so let me go
...
