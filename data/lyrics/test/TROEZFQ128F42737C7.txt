It will be whatever it is you're looking for
It will be whatever it is you need
It will be better even though I know you're not sure
Remember the rain even comes down in Shangri-La
Look up as it soaks into your skin
And remember who you are

And come on home
When the road that you've
Been walking gets too long
Don't be scared
In case the grass you thought was
Greener, isn't there
You could come on home

If you find the sun don't shine
Through every window
If you find a moonlit night
Still makes you blue
...
