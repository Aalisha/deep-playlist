I'm moving closer to the danger zone
Can't believe these feelings on my mind
There's no answer to the question
Thoughts go round and round
Maybe it's time to cross the line

I'm living in a matchbox waiting
Got to find a key to her heart
Keeping up so intoxicating
Where in the world do I start

Give me an inch
Give me a chance
To find, to find, to find our love
It all relies on you
Give me an inch
Give me a chance
