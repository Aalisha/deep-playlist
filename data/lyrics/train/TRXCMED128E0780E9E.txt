Let me lay it on the line
I've got a little freakiness inside
And you know that a man has gotta deal with it
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
Coz it's all about the dog in me

I wanna freak in the morning
Freak in the evening
(just like me)
I need a rough-neck brother that can satisfy me
(just for me)
If you are that kinda man
Coz baby I'm that kinda girl
I've got a freaky secret
Everybody sing
Coz we don't give a damn about a thing

Coz I will be your freak until the day
Until the dawn
And we can (pump pump)
All through the night
To the early morn'
Come on and I will take you round the hood
