I love my freedom
And speaking out of my mind
I can see how that could get somebody down
Tho' you can't always see them
You can feel their vicious vibes
They somehow seem to find their way around

And you'll never see me fail
And you can't make me disappear

BEEN OBSCURED BY TOO MUCH DARKNESS
OVERCOME WITH SO MUCH SADNESS
BUT I'M STILL SHINING BRIGHT AS EVER
