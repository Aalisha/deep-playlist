Chorus:
Midnight is my time
I'm the shadow rider
I come from the other side
I'm the shadow rider

Dark shadows and shifting eyes
There ain't no trust on the street
Broken windows and alibis
You can feel the tension in the august heat

I hear the call from the firing line
I hear the sound of the bell
When there's some action, i make it mine
And i do it well
...
