Molland

I couldn't believe it, the look in your eyes
You said you were leaving and this was the night
You told me your reasons, something inside
And knew in your heart, girl, love was alive.

You were just passing time
Taking love in the easy way
Wasted mind, giving nothing away.

I tried to relate it, to something I said
Maybe I should have waited, gone ahead.
