Hit the dank and took my glock off lock, and off
To the 21st blocc, I'm rollin in a drop top
Three for zero that black criminal mac mac nigga
That pap! pap! me hittin a couple of rounds
And while I test him, hey f**k a Smith & Wesson
I got my, nine at my chest and I got my dime bag
Of stress weed, a 40 oz. of OE and I'm creepin
Up on some niggas in a mob and a nigga claimin OG,
Pap! hit him in that dome and it was that nigga's worst
Put him on the ground wit a brain, full o' dem nine slugs
So wrap that nigga up, put him in a hearse
And I'm hittin 50, right around that curb, tight,
Rollin up in a 64, 4 doors sideways to the next light (YOU KNOW)
An I hit that corner of 24 street, some nigga mean mugging
Lynch, and I pop in a clip and I'm not finna get got,
I'ma shoot before I'm shot for the fact I'm B-U-Double D-E-D
I'm reaching up in my glove box, for the welfare weed
That's fillin a nigga's siccness so I miss dead bodies
In an, oldsmobile, up on the curb and while I'm skirtin
Pass the view wit an empty 9 and some bourbon (riiight)
I just adjust to the fact that niggas aint got no hope
I'm fillin em up with 16s, and letting em know
...
