(Guy CLark)

Coleman Bonner was a fiddle playin' fool
He's a backwoods rounder and a breaker of mules
Coleman Bonner's got a wore out bow
He's been playin' all day down the new cut road

Coleman's little sister said you better act right
Daddy's gone to Louisville he'll be back tonight
He's gonna get another wagon and a good pair of mules
And we gonna move to Texas we just waitin' on you

Coleman's daddy pulled up in the yard
He said pack up your lives kids it's gettin' too hard
Kentucky's alright but there's too many people
