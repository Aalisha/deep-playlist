Yeah

Lookin' back on the track for a little green bag
Got to find just the kind for losin' my mind
Outta sight in the night, outta sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track, gonna do it my way

Outta sight in the night, outta sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track, gonna do it my way
Look back

Lookin' for some happiness but there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
