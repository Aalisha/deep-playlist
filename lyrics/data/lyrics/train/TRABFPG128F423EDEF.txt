Promises you learn to keep your distance
It's your best defense
And you've never looked a bigger mess
An attitude protects you from the world you view
But medicine protects the world from you

As though you had a good reason
As though you've made a fool of them
They told you now things are even
But you carry on the same old song
You carry on

Tell me why you ran away
What's the problem
You won't say
