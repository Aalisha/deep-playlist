Snakes in your mouth
Their tongues whisper a venomous lie
So well disguised
They deceive even you

They're not to blame
They're just part of this game
Where egos make the moves
And hearts always lose

[Chorus:]
Anger grows in me
Twisting my sense of reality
This sweet dream shattered
Beauty and bliss that could have been

Now – as you're weak and bleeding
Dwelling in your tomb of misery
I – still undefeated
...
