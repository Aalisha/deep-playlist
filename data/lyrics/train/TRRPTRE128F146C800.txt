Woah! Spring is here and the sky is so very blue.
Wo-o-o-oah, birds all sing as if they knew,
today's the day we'll say, "I do,"
and we'll never be lonely anymore.

Because we're goin' to the chapel
and we're gonna get married,
goin' to the chapel
and we're gonna get married,
gee, I really love you
and we're gonna get married,
goin' to the chapel of love.

Bells will ring and the sun is gonna shine.
