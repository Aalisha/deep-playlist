Are you a man who loves, and cherishes, and cares for me?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Or are you a guard in a prison of maximum security?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Do we stay home all the time, cause you want me all to yourself?
(Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?)
Or am I locked away out of fear that I'll find someone else?
(Is that you? Is that you?)

Well I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy
Oh I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
