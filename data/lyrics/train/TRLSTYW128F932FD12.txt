Free country, I hear you say.
Well I ain't satisfied, I want it my way.
Banning everything under the sun,
Life's just fuckin boring,
You've killed all the fun.
Tax the fuck out of cigarettes,
Then tell us all about the regrets.
Lose your money on the stick of death
so tax our speed and beer instead.
