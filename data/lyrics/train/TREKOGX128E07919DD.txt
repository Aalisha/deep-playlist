(Harlan Howard - Matraca Berg)

Can't believe the way I let you use me
Can't believe all the wasted time
For a while baby, you confused me
When you said I was your sunshine.

But I'm just someone to call
When you need a place to fall
Baby come back when it ain't rainin'
Come back when your skies are blue
Come back when it ain't rainin' on you
It ain't rainin' on you.
