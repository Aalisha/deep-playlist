We must fight
The good fight
Changing wrongs to rights.

Like malcolm x -
Kissed off his slave name,
Kissed off his masters god,
Raised his fist in righteous rage.

And dr. king doesnt rest in peace
Due to the spread of this disease.

The clock
Has struck thirteen
For all us pups in centerville -

cause this triage
...
