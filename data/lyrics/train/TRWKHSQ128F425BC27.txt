High above the roof tops
Higher than the milky way
Slipping through the hourglass
Shooting up the desert plain

You are one life older than before
But you can't stop this chill
Now you're falling in slow motion
Though the air is still

If you close your eyes
Then I will take you all the way
Let me close your eyes
And I will take it all the way
