Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly hell
The devil stepped right up and he said
"Well you look so countrified, leave your hat and boots outside
You won't need 'em, you're in hillbilly hell.

Well, they had a band without a steel guitar
And not one good ol' girl stood at the bar
No jukebox and no beer, am I the only redneck here
And the parkin' lot, was full of foreign cars.

Chorus:
Hillbilly hell, I'm not feelin' so well
Where did I go wrong
...
