The prophets in my dream came by again
Transmitting me their master-plan
The future seemed to hold

A dream within a dream of agony
Changes my reality
The secrets I've been told

Feel the sign of the times
Silent Wake
Speak the downwritten rhymes
Silent Wake
Cover my eyes from the force of the glance
The might of the scrill
Silent Wake
It's controlling the will
