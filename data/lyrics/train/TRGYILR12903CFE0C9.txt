Heaven help the soul that's severed
From the place where it belongs
Caught up in the mindless struggle
Of the weak against the strong
Headlights along the border
Keep the peace, their law and order

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
It's their kind of strength, their only defense
An imaginary line

Just a kid and his younger brother
Headed for the wire
Had no rights in the telescopic sights
Of the vigilante's rifle fire
But now he's buried on the border
Where the rivers are blood not water
