I wanna join the army,
I wanna see a foreign land,
Learn to speak an exotic tongue and,
How to kill with my hands,
I wanna go to the middle east,
I wanna go to Vietnam,
Keep the commies out of W3,
For HRH and Uncle Sam.

See, I'm burning with ambition,
I'm waiting for a mission, woah woah yeah,
Face me in the right direction,
I'm full of good intentions, woah woah yeah,
But I sometimes have these doubts and,
I don't like to talk about them,
But it's good to get things out now and then.
