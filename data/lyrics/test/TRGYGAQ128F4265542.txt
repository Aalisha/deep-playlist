In the little town where I'm from
We've got a two-way street where everybody runs
Big silver moon shines through the pines
Just about says it for our skyline but
No one's complaining about nothing changing here

Local paper has a page or two
Just about covers the hometown news
One kind of button on the radio dial
Crankin' out country for a country mile
No one's complaining about nothing changing here

All summer long the nights are hot
...
