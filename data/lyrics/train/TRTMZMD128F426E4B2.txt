So I sing you to sleep
After the lovin'
With a song I just wrote yesterday
And I hope you can hear
What the words and the music have to say.

It's so hard to explain
Everything that I'm feelin'
Face to face I just seem to go dry.
'Cause I love you so much
That the sound of your voice can get me high.
