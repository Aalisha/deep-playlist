In and out
Culture and a swollen mind
You're passing through the circle that you thought you'd find in me, when you found me

Head along with a breaking mind
The love was never ardoured, but the heartstrings chimed in me
When you found me

You run away, you never mind me
You run away, you run away despite me
You run away, you run away
You never mind
You run away, you run away
You never mind
You run away, you never mind me
You run away, you run away despite me
You run away, you run away
You never mind
You run away, you run away
You never mind
