(Dave as The King) (Mike & Jian)
Once I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
Oh... my unspeakable wife, Queen Lisa now I eat humble pie
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
And now I work at the Pizza Pizza

(Jian yelling)
1 2 3 4!

(Dave)
Royalty, lord it looked good on me
Buried in silk in the royal boudoir or going nuclear free
Or playing Crokinole with the Princess of Monaco
Telling my jokes to the OPEC leaders, getting it all on video

(Dave) (rest)
Once I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
A palatial palace, that was my home now I eat humble pie
I'm telling you I was the King of Spain now I eat humble pie
And now I vacuum the turf at SkyDome

(rest)
Once he was the King of Spain

(Dave)
I can't wait, I'm lowering interest rates, my people say:

(Jian speaking in a funny voice)
King, how are you such a genius?

(Murray speaking)
