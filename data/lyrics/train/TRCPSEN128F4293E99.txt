Starin' at you takin' off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do but baby you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby don't move, right here it is
T-shirt hanging off a dogwood branch
That river was cold but we gave love a chance
Yeah to me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank first time feeling
