Now, when I was just a little boy
Standing to my Daddy's knee
My poppa said, "Son, don't let the man get you
Do what he done to me."
'Cause he'll get you
'Cause he'll get you now, now.

And I can remember the fourth of July
Running through the backwood, bare.
And I can still hear my old hound dog barking
Chasing down a hoodoo there.
Chasing down a hoodoo there.
