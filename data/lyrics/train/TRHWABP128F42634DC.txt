(Billy Mann)

I was lost
On the outside
I almost gave up
I almost put love aside
Then I saw you
A little spark, then a flame
I felt the blood rush a million miles an hour
Through my veins
I'm not ready for this
One last breath and a kiss
'Cause my heart knows you're the one
And baby living without you
Would mean living is done
I'd say

Turn off the sun
Take down the moon
Eliminate the words "I love you"
There would be no point
No reason to live
...
