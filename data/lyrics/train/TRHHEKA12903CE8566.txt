I saw Abbie Hoffman? s ghost in the distance
We got Saul Williams keeping up the resistance
And punk rock and blues music keep dying
We keep buying

Matt Stone and Trey Parker have taken over the mission
'Cause our politicians they don? t have a position
Who? s to blame for this shallow existence?
Our existence

We try and fight, but this wall? s too high
Have we lost tonight?
But one second chance could change everything

And I think I? ll go write my Senator a letter
But they just talk shit, they ain? t gonna make nothing better
Me and Bev we ain? t two birds of a feather
