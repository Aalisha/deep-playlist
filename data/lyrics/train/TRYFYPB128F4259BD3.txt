Causing a great headache
Now, look my face
When you cry, i hear
My love is your fear

My world is incomplete without you
It's so quiet in my room
I feel more, and more
My mind is around you

Soft, soft, soft smile
In your face i see a child
Your eyes demost
You love me almost
Never leave the phone
Which one!

My world is incomplete without you
