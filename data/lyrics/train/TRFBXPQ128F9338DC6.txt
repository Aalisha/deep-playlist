It's a teenage dream to be seventeen
and to find you're all wrapped up in lo-o-ove
and i found that you made a dream come true
now i do believe in what they say-ay-ay
You've got to give a little love, take a little love
be prepared to forsake a little love
and when the sun comes shining through
we'll know what to do-oo
Give a little love, take a little love
be prepared to forsake a little love
and when the sun comes shining through
we'll know what to do
When i walk with you there is just we two
