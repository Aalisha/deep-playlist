What I excel in best
Is my excessiveness
Self deprecation
I hate myself sometimes

How can I be down
When all that I want is in my reach?
What's wrong with me?
Fuck it

Sometimes I can feel so touch and go
Sometimes I feel my self esteem is low
Sometimes, well, well at least
I know sometimes I'm beautiful
Beautiful

And if I wasn't me
I'd still just laugh at me
And point the finger
And blame myself as well

I will not succumb to any of my peers
...
