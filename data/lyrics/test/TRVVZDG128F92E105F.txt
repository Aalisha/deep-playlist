Icaros, I dare you
For I possess the wings of faith
Though, heavy on my shoulders
(No measurement can prove their weight)
Still, a burden are they not to me
I am the challenger of gravity

The fear is not the fate I seek
My destiny will build upon
The mighty turbulence beyond
If I fall I will rise again
...
