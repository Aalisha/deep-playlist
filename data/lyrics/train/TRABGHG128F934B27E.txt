Jack of diamonds/ is a gambling man/ He played the tables /whenever he can/Take some advice boy stay clean stay out of his way
Little jeannie is a dancing queen
/she's been/ shaking it since she was sixteen
Skips across the tables acting out her passion play

It wasn't for money, it's only a chance
You take a gamble, got shot for romance
