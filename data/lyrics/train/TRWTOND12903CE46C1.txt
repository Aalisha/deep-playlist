Where the grass is always greener where the grass don't grow
you see everything in colour till you see it close
everybody else's street looks like it's painted gold
don't it always go that way
Suzy wanted money to spend wanted some rich older man
to take her from the world she was living in to the world on the other side
Suzy was bored with her life wanted something more to do with her nights
she said "Someday I'm just gonna pack it up and leave this all behind"
She wanted a piece of paradise she wanted a change of scene
she wanted to live the privileged life and nothing in between
Other people's lives always look so easy 
when you're standing on the other side
oh oh oh other people's lives
Johnny was tired of working all day working for the pennies for pay
he said "Anybody's life in the world has gotta be better than the life I got"
