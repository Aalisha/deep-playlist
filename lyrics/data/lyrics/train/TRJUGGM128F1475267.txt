Thugga, baby

I won't move without my gun, yeah
And it's cause I'm the one
She wanna pull my trunks
Yeah, yeah

But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
If she don't like it she don't see it
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son no Phoenix

Ay, lil momma showing me she don't play
And she never diss her old boy, no way
And I never told her nothing bout bae
And every time I leave she want me to stay
But she just don't know how to say
And that's deep but I could say
And to think I want, I run the day, whoa
Hand her my taste
Cum on her face
Drank all I waste
Okay
