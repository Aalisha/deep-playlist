(Everlast)
Yo, I've been rhyming since my daddy's dick first got wet
Kicked a hole in the womb of my mother then I jet
Back to the scene of the crime
A true mastermind
I'll never do time
(Slaine)
Nah, but I do watch my watch till the second hand stops
And the bars close down and the records get dropped
Piss drunk in the parking lot speaking dumb
Gun all sticky from the Puerto Rican rum
(Ill Bill)
I keep it real like the 80's when we flooded the block
Stick up kids went from baseheads to suckin' the cock
The hottest bitch in my projects discovered the rock
A year later had the monster climbing out of her twat
(Slaine)
This is a stick up
I told you you could reach for the sky
Fuck a chip off the brick or the piece of the pie
The worst thing they did to the kid was leave him alive
