You start with spin the bottle
Then you learn how to forget
A broken home but now you've grown
You play Russian roulette
And the dogs bark out in defeat

Scars of love
Like a silver chain that bears no name
Nevermore
I'm a dinosaur
You're waving me goodbye

I could fall into your eyes
And never have to speak
...
