In the pub where we learnt how to talk about bands
You stand all dressed up with your vodka in hand
Oh girl, you're waiting for a pitiful man

In the pub, at the bar with the old men I am
Alone with a pint of bitter in my hand
For a girl this is not an acceptable plan

Wipe your eyes darling, it's OK
Meet me on the dual carriage way

Separated by motorways
The A14 and the A1 (so long)
...
