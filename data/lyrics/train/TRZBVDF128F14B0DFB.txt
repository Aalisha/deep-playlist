Yesterday...

Yesterday, I had a dream of you
I gave your love away but I belong to you...

Yesterday...

Rainy days on my hair without you
Sunny days on my skin around you
I feel better when I remember yesterday yeah

Memories in my heart how does that feel
Memories in my mind seems to be real
What a wonderful tale about my yesterday
