Oh, the sisters of mercy
They are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me
When I thought that I just can't go on

And they brought me their comfort
And later they brought me this song
Oh, I hope you run into them
You, who've been traveling so long

Yes, you who must leave everything
That you cannot control
It begins with your family
But soon it comes around to your soul
...
