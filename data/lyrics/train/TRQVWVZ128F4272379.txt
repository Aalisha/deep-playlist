I thought I had been every place a man could be,
'Till I met a lady who brought me to my knees.
The day I stop loving is the day that I die,
But now I'm running from her game 'cause the lady is a lie.

I've got a choice
Run away or be torn to shreds.
I've got a life and I want to live
Don't want to be dead.
