Ah, Scorpio
Show no shame
Shake it baby
He is DJ Flash and he came here to give you a blast
And we are the Furious Five and we're rocking, shocking all the way live
Show no shame
Shake it
Shake it baby
Ah, show no shame
Don't be shy girl
Show no shame
Higher baby
Higher now
Higher baby
Higher now
Higher baby
Break it down
Show no shame now
Throw your hands, way up high
And everybody's gonna try to reach the sky
Because you can't stop, won't stop playing the game
And I know that you can do it if you show no shame
Hey girl, don't be shy
Shake your body the way I, the way that I like it
With no shame girl
