I remember the smile on her face
When I put you on her finger
I felt the love in her sweet embrace
And all the happiness you brought her

I still see it all in my mind
The way she loved me all the time

Ring, ring, you ain't nothin' but a thing
Yesterday we used to hold her
Little band of gold with a little blue stone
I'm sure gonna miss the hand that you were on
...
