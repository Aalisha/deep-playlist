First gate of hell is where I first fell
Seeking for eternal life
Blood boiling heat what a wonderful treat
Feels like getting fucked with a knife

Immortal life

Running and fighting
There's no turning back
Kicking and screaming
A full on attack
Hunger for power
Is nowhere in sight
Searching, I'm dying for

Immortal life

The second stage and I'm trapped in a cage
Lucifer spits on my face
...
