Let me tell you all a little story
'Bout the man who lives down at the top of the stairs.
Well he worked all his life for his children and his wife,
and he opened up a little store down there.

One night late while he was lockin' the gate
A kid came in and said,
"You know what I want." And he said...

"I ain't lookin' for trouble
and I know what you came here to do

And the kid said,
"Trouble's come lookin' for you."

Well I swore that I would find him.
