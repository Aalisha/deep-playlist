You take the first blow, I taste revenge
Let anger come my will is done
Malicious in my intent

The hate is rising, the swell of fear takes over
And oh, the taste is sweet my friend
So bitter sweet

No more anger, I've had my revenge
Beg for mercy, I'll take you down
No more hatred, I've had my revenge
Eye for an eye, taste my revenge, revenge

Caught in a time warp, rage in the wind
