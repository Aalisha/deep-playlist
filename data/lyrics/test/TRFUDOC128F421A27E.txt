telling me what to do with my life, 
telling me that i'm no good, 
telling me that you are the very best 
you're driving me up the wall. 

at one time you were on top. 
you thought you were a hot shot, 
you never thought the ride would stop. 
now the roller coaster's over, 
your only pal is your dog, Rover. 
so much for your stay at the top.
