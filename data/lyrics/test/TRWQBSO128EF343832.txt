Tell me something away from trouble and away from doubting
Tell me straight from the spirit, from the top of the mountain
Let love be the reason between me and you
As real as the morning as fresh as the dew
If fates got a hold then it's up to you
It's a simple thing we've got to do

Just a listening man
Try to understand
Just a listening man
Doing the best I can

Tell me something before I stumble and show my weakness
Tell me right on the limewire fighting for progress
I can hear there's a sound that's coming through
...
