Candle is blue, could see me through
I'm colorblind
You tell me it's blue, I'm a believer
That's why I'm blind

Live on the freeway, listen to signs
And we drive by fields
Be a believer, believe everything
You'll be right half the time

Candle is waxing, takes my apartment
Now bask in its magic
All of the firefighters put out my fires
Took all my matches

Staying up later, waking up old
And I'm leaving her never
Ordering in all friends and lovers
