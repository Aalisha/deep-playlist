Head top

The session is nice feel real good
The set is playing some wicked riddim
I see some girls wining on their head tops
I see some girls wining on their head tops

Police pass through, don't even try and stop it
'Cause they know who is running it
Send for the suru board lala give it to me on the dance floor
Cedella just fly in from New York she deh pon the scene

Girls from Backtu, girls from Spain
Girls from Trenchtown, girls from Payne
Girls from south and Matches Lane
When the music hit you feel no pain

A park outside some youth dem come to greet me
A got to shine some light to make the youth dem walk more freely
I talk on the mic a sing a song them call stop joke
And then a rope in Steve fi come DJ rat trap for me

Wining on their head tops
Wining on their head tops
Is African ting

Wining on their head tops
Wining on their head tops
