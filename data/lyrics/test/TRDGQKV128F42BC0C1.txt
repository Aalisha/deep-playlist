I can feel your heartbeat and you didn't even say a word
I can feel your heartbeat and you didn't even say a word
Oh, I know, pretty woman that your love can be heard

You can feel my heartbeat, too. I can tell you're feelin' me
You can feel my heartbeat, too. I can see you feelin' me
Oh, I know, pretty woman that your love can be heard. Ohhhhh...

We paint the night, let it shine in the light of our love
This is the night - yeah, this is the night of our love
I'll treat you like a woman, love you like a woman
Lord, I'll prove it baby, I'm a man of my word
