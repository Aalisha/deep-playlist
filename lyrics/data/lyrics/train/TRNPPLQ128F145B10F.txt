The summer is almost over and I haven? t met him yet
I sit here all alone, right by the phone
Who would ever guess?

With my heart as big as the ocean
And with all this love to share
Couldn? t find someone right to light up my life
But then I saw you standing there
Don? t you know that?

It only took a minute
The moment I looked in your eyes
It only took a minute
To see all those love signs
I? d never thought I? d find

I can? t believe how you touch me
You? re like a breeze blowing through my hair
I get a rush when you tell me to hush
