You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me that kiss?
It was something like this and made me go ooh ooh
You wiped my tears, got rid all of my fears, why did you have to go?
Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love, guys are so hard to trust

Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl the one who gives it all away, yeah

Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?
Did you think that it was somethin' I was gonna do and cry?
Don't try to tell me what to do
Don't try to tell me what to say
