She likes to read her Bible I like a good bar room rival
Sunday morning she's in church while my hangover just gets worse
We see things differently but she's hell-bent on saving me
She's got her life in tact and mine's been to hell and back
She's an angel, she's a saint there's two things that I ain't
I fell from a different tree but she's hell-bent on saving me

I know she could make me better if I would only let her
Guess a little compromise couldn't hurt
