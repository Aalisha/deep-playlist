Last time when you were waiting for me
I tried to tell you all we had was a
Wrapped up scene like I knew that it would
It all seems thin but it sure feels good

‘Cause it’s the best I’ve seen
When you fall down good
Sink in the water
But you’re walkin’ on wood

This time, what are you waiting for?
Is it your time to walk away?
Because the law’s unseen, levels all good
The hurdles all down like another time would

‘Cause it’s the best I’ve seen
What a fall down should
Sink in the water
But you’re walkin’ on wood
