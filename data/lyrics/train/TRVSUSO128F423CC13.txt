I wonder more and more
If prevention is better than secure, woa naah
I want to see that girl next door
But mek sure I have dem in store

Mi want a jook offa Jacqueline
But mi haffi draw for my rubbers, for my rubbers
Sex nice but the AIDS ting
Wi mek yuh die like flowers, die out like flowers

Mi want a jook offa Jacqueline
But mi haffi draw for my rubbers, for my rubbers
Sex nice but the AIDS ting
Wi mek yuh die like flowers, die out like flowers

When mi stop an mi look inna mi crystal ball
Mi get fi find out say, no man a nuh wall
An most pretty gal yuh caan trust dem at all
At all, at all Hey
