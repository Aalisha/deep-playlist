My whole world is falling down
My whole world is falling down
I wake up in the mornings, I think I want a drink
I canâ€™t even get water, from the kitchen sink
The dog that we both loved and raised from a pup
Tried to bite my hand lord every time I pick him up

[chorus]
Because I need you more
My whole world is falling down ooh yeah
Crumbled around, all around

All your tears and my hard work, we built the home we live
...
