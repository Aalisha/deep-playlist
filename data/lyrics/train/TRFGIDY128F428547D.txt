Stayin’ up all night my heart won’t stop
There’s a fire in me to feed
I can’t touch you baby
All you’ve got to do is beam it into me
So won’t you hurry

Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Telegraph telegraph your love to me
Won’t you telegraph your lovin’
That’s what I need

Send your kisses here, send them through the air
