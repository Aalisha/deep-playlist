[Big L]
Yo once again it's the Big L, that kid who got much props
from killin corrupt cops, with motherfuckin buck shots
So don't step to this, cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big but they make coffins yo' size too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali, it's Harlem nigga we do walkbys
No one can match me, tax me or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps G just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin, that's idiotic
Cause if Big L got the AIDS every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
and I put more holes in his ass than swiss cheese

Chorus: Big L (repeat 2X)

(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

[Big L]
I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone chief
or catch a buck shot to your domepiece
