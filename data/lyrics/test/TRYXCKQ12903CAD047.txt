You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why, why?
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
...
