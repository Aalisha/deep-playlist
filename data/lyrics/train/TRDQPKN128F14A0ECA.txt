And can no hood fuck with gangsta shit

Stone cold, baby, stone cold, baby
Stone cold, baby
(As cold as can be)
Stone cold, baby, stone cold, baby
Stone cold, baby
(As cold as can be)

Stone cold, baby, stone cold, baby
Stone cold, baby
(As cold as can be)
Stone cold, baby, stone cold, baby
Stone cold, baby
(As cold as can be)

Hey, let's party y'all
All I wanna do is have a good time
Tonight it's goin' down
Hey, just roll it up
It don't matter who's at the party
Somebody's leavin' with me

Hey, let's set it off
I see the girl that I want, that I want
I see the girl that wants me
Hey, it's gettin' hot
But before my body gets bothered
Let me tell you this about me

Momma kicked me out when I was sixteen
Woke up the next mornin' with some D O G
I felt a little bad but I had money
Went and bought some dope and some blue khakis

While you were hangin' out in the promised land
I was growin' up on the Long Beach sand
So if you're intentions were to leave with me
Remember when I'm satisfied
