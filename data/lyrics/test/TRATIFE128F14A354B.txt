Pass di dubplate, pan di left and side

Me sit down a me yard 'bout a quarter to one
me hear a knocking pon the door a gwaan bam bam bam
me open the door and me see the postman
the postman a bring me one telegram
me take di envelope and a read the telegram
telegram a say: Ring Ding come cork the session
It haffi Ram...

me go outside the house and haffi make decision
should I take the limousine or one a fe me minivan
me decide fe meself and the BadManWagon
likkle after dat me come fe cork di session
as me reach the dancegate there is a contention
