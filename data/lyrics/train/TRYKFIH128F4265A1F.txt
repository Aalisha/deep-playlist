Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road
Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road
Bet I ain't gon' stop till I come up in big mama's door

Folks down in Chickasaw say, they all know my name
Folks down in Chickasaw say, they all know my name
And when I'm down there, man, sure be glad I came
