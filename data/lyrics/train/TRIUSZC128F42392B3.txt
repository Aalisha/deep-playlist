(Jon Anderson/Alan White/Chris Squire)

Have you heard before, hit it out, don't look back
Rock is the medium of our generation
Stand for every right, kick it out, hear you shout
For the right of all of creation

We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration

Power defy our needs, lift us up, show us now
Show us how amid the rack of confusion
Drive in thoughts of high, satisfy, in a plan
Set it out for all to understand it

We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration we are ...

Lost and wondering, maybe, how it is
...
