Pathetic parasites
Breathing down our necks
Antisocial elite
Useless in a broken society
Fractured minds
With subversive thoughts
Raising the flag
Of mankind's downfall

Sinking further
Sinking deeper
Into aggression
Into depression

Sinking further
Sinking deeper
Into aggression
Into depression

We were supposed to be more
Parasites
Is this where it ends?
We were supposed to want more
Parasites
