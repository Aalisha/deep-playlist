Black Snake Living In A Black Hole, Hiding From The Sun.
Black Snake Living In A Black Hole 'Till The Game Is Won.
Black Snake Living In A Black Hole, Hiding From The Sun.
Black Evil Hides In The Darkness When The Night Is Come.
Black Evil Hides In The Darkness When The Night Is Come.

Black Snake, Black Snake, Black Snake, Black Snake.

Black Snake Living In A Black Hole, Waiting For The Man.
Black Snake Living In A Black Hole, Doing What he Can.
Black Snake Living In A Black Hole, Hiding For The Sun.
