The future hides your history
When it comes to the end
Like a dream, it fades away
You're too tired to defend

You stood there waiting for the dawn
Searching inside your haunted soul
The brightest light will shine so strong
You better do what you've been told

I see your soul got torn apart
I seal the pain in your heart

Stay alive and close your eyes
As you fall from the sky
Your soul is lost, the hope has died
...
