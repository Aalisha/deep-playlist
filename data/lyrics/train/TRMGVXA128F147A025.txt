This is what I brought you.
This you can keep.
This is what I brought.
You may forget me.
I promise to depart just promise one thing.
Kiss my eyes and lay me to sleep.
This is what I brought you.
This you can keep.
This is what I brought you.
You may forget me.
I promise you my heart just promise to sing.
