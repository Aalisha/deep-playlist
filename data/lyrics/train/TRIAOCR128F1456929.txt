Politically correct and mentally erect
I'm doing everything I can to conserve the best
But life ain't nothin but a bowl a grits
And this United States proud crap makes me sick
People tell me go make a name for yourself
Cause that's the only way you're gonna get outta this hell
I'm gonna try and try and try and do all that I can
But I'll never understand

It's guaranteed I'm making minimum wage
I can't survive this day and age
Home of the free
Land of the brave
I can't survive this day and age
...
