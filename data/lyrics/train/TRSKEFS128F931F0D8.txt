From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem.
An entire existence revolving around what we can't acknowledge.
A brain malfunction we'll never admit as defeat...
a constant determination to find truths... to find reason... to find comfort.
An unspoken religion in being the ALL-DOMINANT... This is what we call a brain.

This step will allow the universe to run its course. We have a short ticket and a lot is in hiding...
so lets take in what we can for now. Just like here on Earth (a notion we do comprehend)
Hide what "others" can't understand. The universe is the biggest threat...
overachiever that commands attention. Brute force of hysterical reasonings...
...
