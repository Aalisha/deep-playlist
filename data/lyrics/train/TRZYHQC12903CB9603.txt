Today he told he that he loved her
Put a ring around her finger
And promised her forever, together

Today, she smiled for all the pictures
And he was right there with her
Making all the memories without me

And it hurts to say this out loud
Looks like she's really gone now

Today is the happiest day of her life
I should be happy for her today
So tell me why are these tears in my eyes?
I know I should be happy for her
