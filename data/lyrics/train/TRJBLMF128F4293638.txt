I dig my heels into the dirt
'Cause this one's gonna hurt
Won't let the waves wash me away
Is what I always pray
In my heart I know you couldn't see
In the dark or find your way through me
Now I'm alone, my hands are numb
How do I carry on?

At the turn of the tide
I feel this part of me die
Am I washed on your shore and barely alive?

Now I'm held hostage in my head
With every word you said
God, all those lessons in my past
