Burning down the theatre, fire crawling from the ground
Bands up to the sky, we bring you down into hell
Coming from your nightmares raise the deepest of your fears
All night long we'll shake your mind on the edge of sanity

My blood runs cold tonight
High upon the stars my endless will
Is talking through your eyes and me
Every single sight's forever
High upon the stars my will
...
