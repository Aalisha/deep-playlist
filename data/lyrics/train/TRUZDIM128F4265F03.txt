I don't want to be a rusty suit of armor
Or a tumbled out forgotten castle in your mind
I just want to be a twisted willow
So I can leave you shallow thinking far behind

I can feel the darkness in your shadow
And the melting of the ice behind your troubled eyes
And the discoloration of all the words you're saying
As you're hunted without mercy by your lies

I've flown so high I'll never return
...
