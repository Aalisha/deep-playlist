Well you know I hardly speak
And when I do, it's just for you
I haven't said a word in weeks
'Cause they've been keeping me from you

But there's a way where there's a will
You know I got no need for stairs
So step out on the window sill
And fall with me into the air

So here we go
Hold on tight and don't let go
...
