'Cause all that I ask for
Is turning to ashes
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for
There's nothing to die for

'Cause I'm burying my sins
I'm a prisoner and waiting
I'm drowning within
When the world is all I'm hating
This is my hell

We conform from underground
We arise from your defenses
Through this constitution revolution end

'Cause all that I ask for
Is turning to ashes
When all of my passion
Crumbles around me
I'm still gonna get to
All that surrounds me
When everything comes down
There's nothing to die for

If I cannot be saved
...
