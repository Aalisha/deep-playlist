(Verse 1)

(Valure)
I met this young man
Just the other day
Set my world on fire
In a special way
He had the prettiest smile
That I ever seen
Had my feeling like a day dream
(Eddie B.)
Hey are you goin my way
Baby can I take you there
(Valure)
It was the first night of spring
And love was everywhere
I didnt think twice
As I jumped into his ride
Street Lights Flashin By
Then I whispered in his ear

(Chorus)
(Gabrielle)
We can ride on cruise control
