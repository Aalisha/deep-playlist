[Master P]

Yo C-Murder
Nigga you woke?
Keep your eyes on the rollers nigga.
Pass the weed (ok)
We gon' head up interstate 10
We gon' pick up Pimp C, and Bun B (that's my niggas there)
We gon' get rowdy rowdy and bout it bout it
We gon' handle our business
We gon' smoke
We gon' make it back to the N.O.
Cuz u know whut?
Us South niggaz don't playa hate
We got love from the South, East, West, to the Nizorth
But it's your time baby
We gon' handle our business
And we gonna do this shit like g'z
We gonna represent the gizame
Ya heard me?

[Pimp C]

This game fucked up
I ain't got no friends
I done spend my last 70, 000 dollars on a drop-top bienz
Ugh, and I'm a real nigga
Down to put a forty-five to his head nigga
Lay it down muthafucka because I'm bustin' for mine
Take that ine everytime and I ain't try to dine
Niggaz dyin' podarthur (huh nigga what?)
Thank that I'm playin? (huh nigga what?)
Bust 17 times and let 'em feel what I'm sayin'
UGK and C-Murder
Cadillac and a Tank (Master P)
Bout to fade the platinum
Smoke some dank and some drank
But bitch luv me when I come to your city
Serve my dick out her pussy
and bust my nuts on her titties
Ugh, it's just a matter of time before I'm up in your house
With my mask on my face and my thang in your mouth
Now get your mind right nigga (mind right)
and make a pimp bitch
and never put trust in a trick ass bitch (trick ass bitch)
