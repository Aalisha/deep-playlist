Where would you go?
Not long ago
I've been thinking out loud
Why so suddenly?

Don't you know?
Don't do it
What you do

Oh What you do to me
Forever is a long long time
When you've lost your way
Trying to follow your ideal

Oh sorry but your so called life
It is such a waste
Wear your real eyes
No you don't realize

What you say yes to
But you say yes too
Where would you go
Where would you go
...
