I'm calling you out on what you've done.
I want you to feel the way I do.
I'm starting to hate what I've become.
and its all because of you.

The guilt you put on me
was enough to get me down.
Took everything i had to keep me hanging on.

I've been down so long.
I've seen the bottom from below.
I watched you walk all over me.

I'm over this.
I beat my head, against the wall.
I pushed my pieces back to whole.
I find my way back from the dead.
To mend my life again.
