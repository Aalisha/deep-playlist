You can pop ya collar thinkin' you gonna get it
Touch me with your dollar thinkin' you gonna get it
Keep your money, you got it too, you just don’t get it
Show me your A-game, you betta come with it

'Cause I be ridin', switchin' lanes, crusin' real slow
Workin' up the fast lane, puffin on dro
You're lookin' like I’m the one that you wanna get to know
Until you get the green light, it’s not your time to go, so you're

Never never never
Never gonna get it
Never never never
Never gonna get it

I might think about it
If you treat me like a lady
I might think about it
And you just might get it

Never never never
Never gonna get it
Never never never
Never gonna get it

I might think about it
If you treat me like a lady
I might think about it
And you just might get it

'Cause all you fellas be trippin'
Everybody frontin' like dey pimpin'
'Cause I can guarantee you
I can do it better than you
I’m not for fakin' or pretendin'

I be in the club with my girls stayin' low
Fellas rubbin' all up on me trying to get close
Wantin' to unwrap me like a candy in a store
