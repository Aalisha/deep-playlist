I don't need a reason to be breathing, just you do what I can
No I don't want a family, who would damn me, and resent everything I am
I don't need to prove to, all the one's who, feel that I need to fit in
No I don't ever tell you, that I failed you, I'd rather start life over again

No I'm sorry to say, there'll be no sacrifice today

Now I can see clearly, why you feel me, why you gotta bring me down
No I don't wanna fight you, just to spite you, but I'm not afraid to take you out
