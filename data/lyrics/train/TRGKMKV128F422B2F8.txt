You made your first mistake
The way you let me down
You're always on the make honey
Fire burning in my soul
It cuts me deep inside
Talking like you just don't care
You know that ain't right

'Cause I've had enough of walking out that door
I realize you'll never change

Never said I'd be no bed of roses
You know all through the love an'
Pain you keep me hanging on
You keep me hanging on
