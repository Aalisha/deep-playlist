Ooh yeah

Honey you are my shining star
Don't you go away, oh baby
Wanna be right here where you are
Till my dying day, yeah baby

So many have tried tried to find
A love like yours and mine
Girl don't you realize how you hypnotize
Make me love you each time, yeah baby

Honey I know I leave you lonely
Give my love to you only
To you only, to you only

Honey you are my shining star
