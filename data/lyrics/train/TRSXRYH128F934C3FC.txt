Life is empty, can't remember anytime before,
On a plain lit cold December, see it evermore,
Gliding through this life, and another is a child,
and we're doing games, and losing things,
Always playing gigs.
Somewhere in the sky, where the moon the stars shine bright,
Where the sun is shining, in the night.
I am in disgrace, yet i see a smiling face,
and i hope you let me, share your place.
I don't live today.

Rain in the sky, make the world fly,
Into time, beg me your time.
Sun in the sky, make the world fly,
Into time, beg me your time.
