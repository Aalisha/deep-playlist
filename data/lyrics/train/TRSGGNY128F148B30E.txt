All the things I see in you
All the things I know that are true
And when the light in the morning
Comes shining through

I see, I see

I see the sun shining
(Down on me)
I feel the heat of love's flame
(Down on me)
I love the thought of you comin'
(Down on me)
And I'm so wet from love raining
(Down on me)

Down on me, down on me

All the things you mean to me
All the things I want us to be
And when the man in the moon
Looks straight at you
