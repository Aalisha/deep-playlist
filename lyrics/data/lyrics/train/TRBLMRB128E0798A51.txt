I'm so far, so far away from it now
That it seems like I may never know how
People stay in love for half of their lives
It's a secret they keep between the husbands and wives

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes a modern fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me
But I look at myself
Wondering if I'm just too weak
To have such faith in myself

Once upon a time I was so restless in love
When things were fine, I changed my mind just because
Now I see how wrong and reckless I've been
Each frog has a prince just waiting inside of him
