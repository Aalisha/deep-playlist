Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you, oh, baby
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you, oh, baby

When my eyes went out to you
I made up my mind
That every little thing I do
Be designed to glorify you

Ooh, my whole life through
I've been walking in the rain
Until that day, I chanced on you
And the sun came pouring down too

Sunshower, just a sign of the power
Of loving you, oh, baby
Sunshower, got me by the hour
Wanting you, oh, baby
