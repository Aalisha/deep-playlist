Would you mind if I pretended we were somewhere else
Doin' something we wanted to?
'Cause all this livin' makes me wanna do
Is die 'cause I can't live with you
And you don't even care.

Would you mind if I pretended I was someone else
With courage in love and war?
I used to think that's what I was
But now this lyin' hurts too much
And I don't know what for.

I'm weak in the knees for you
But I'll stand if you want me to
My legs are strong and I move on
But honey I'm weak in the knees...

Would you mind if I walked over and I kissed your face
...
