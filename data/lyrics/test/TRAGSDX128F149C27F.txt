Torch the moon, burn the schools
She wrote in red on her bedroom wall -
"Nothing's pure", the paint runs to the floor

She laughs too easily and cries too hard
Shouldn't drink alone, the colours run
How can she forgive
When we know well what we do?

Feather scratches on her wrist
Dry run with a bread knife for a final twist
It wouldn't be for show if it should come to this
