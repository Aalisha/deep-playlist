Well, I led an evil life, so they say
But I'll out run the Devil on judgement day, I said

Move hot-rod, move man
Move hot-rod, move man
Move hot-rod, move me on down the line, oh yeah

Well, me and the Devil at a night stop light
He started rollin', I was out of sight, I said

Move hot-rod, move man
Move hot-rod, move man
Move hot-rod, move me on down the line, oh yeah
