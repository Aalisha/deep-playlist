Yeah-eay
Lord, Lord, ooh, Lord
Yeah, baby, hey
Lord, oh Lord

I saw a dark cloud a-risin'
Wonder what's gonna 'come of me?
I saw a dark cloud a-risin' baby
I wonder what's gonna 'come a-me-e?

As lonesome as I can be

Next time I start out to hobo'in
With my baby by my side, right here
Next time I start the hoboin'
