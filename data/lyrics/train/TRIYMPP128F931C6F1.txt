I wanna sit you down and talk
I wanna pull back the veils and find out what it is I've done wrong
I wanna tear these curtains down
I want you to meet me somewhere tonight
In this old tourist town

And we'll go
Low rising
Cause we've gotta come up, we've gotta come up
Low rising
Cause there's no further for us to fall
Low rising
Cause I feel we've had enough, and we're
Low rising
All for the love of you
