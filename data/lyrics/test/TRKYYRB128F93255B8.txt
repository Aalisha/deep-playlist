Baby, although I chose this lonely life
It seems it's strangling me now
All the wild men, big cigars, gigantic cars
They're all laughing at me now

Oh, I've been used, ooh-hoo

I broke all the rules, ooh, yeah
But I won't let the show go on

Baby, there's an enormous crowd of people
And they're all after my blood
