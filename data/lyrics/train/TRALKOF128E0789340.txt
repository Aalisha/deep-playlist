Green - it's never enough
Different shades bought and sold, illusion control
Extortion incest
Greed - it's never enough
They're building us up while they're tearing us down
On their hands is the blood of the ones who had made them
Praise them, save them, break them

Eyes - they watch from inside
So in God do we trust? Paranoid? Not enough
