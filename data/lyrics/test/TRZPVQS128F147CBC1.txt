Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean

Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't
Take it
Any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is
Going to
Take your breath away
