Brainiac, with a zany act, cleptomaniac
Before I go to work I smoke me a fat sack
Of indo, then climb through the window
And eye the VCR, and load it in the Pinto, huh!
Yes I'm on my way to the bait
or should I say the pawn shop, but I don't smoke rocks
Some people say I'm crazy and they think I'm on crack
Cause I hock all the shit and I never get it back
Coolio loco, you better call Bronco
Stole a link from my auntie, and sold it to my uncle
Took the flowers from a hearse, romanced a nurse
Put the girl to sleep then I went through her purse
Bandit, underhanded, yes I'm skanless
Snake in the grass fool, I'm taking chances
If the price is right, you can call me a killer
Before I was a rap singer, they called me Sticky Finger
("But he's stickin you, and takin all of you money" -- Guru)
("I ain't never got gaffled like that" - JD)
("Don't, you blink, or I'ma rob your ass blind" - Sticky Fingers)
("What you doin stickin in that people's window?" - Richard Pryor)
("Gimme that...") big fat dope sack
("Gimme that...") ca-di-llac
