Well God bless Texas
And Deacon Shackelford
He read the Bible seven times
And he believed every word
That old beat up leather book
Had been through it all
He sat on the back pew
So he could chew him a chaw

Singin' amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

He carried candy for the kids
In his Sunday dress coat
He'd take me fishin' after church
And taught me things I needed to know
No, deacon didn't have a family
Lord knows he wished he did
He told the whole congregation
That I was his grandkid

And today he joined up with Jesus
Wearin' shiny pearl snaps
We sang a few gospel hymns
