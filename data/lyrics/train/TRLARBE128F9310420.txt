It's all right to wait your turn
Watching as the bridges burn
So long, good luck
Promise me you'll keep my name


Take good care
I know you'll be fine
You always came back better now


All hail to myself
Let's see if we can work as one
This lines, not right
This ship crashed before its time


Take good care
