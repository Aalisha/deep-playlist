(Ruck)
To all my hardcore niggaz don't forget me (don't forget me)
I know the game change and all of these niggaz wanna switch me
* repeat 2X *

"Hardcore, far more than the average"

(Rock)
To all my hardcore niggaz yo I'm still the same
Won't let the game change me, I'm trying to change the game
This shit is mad lame -- hip-hop party rules no jeans, Timbs
or hoodies or hats, sound like you mean me -- fuck ya!
You still get shot up ain't nuttin there but players
Fuck you think? Nigga steppin on your thousand dollar gators
Stupid-asses -- you shook at the site of party crashers
At the door actin, like you don't know who Bummy Jab is
They tell you Rock, tellin me, "Don't act no fool"
"You heard of scotch on the rocks?" I make the whole shit cool
But I'ma stay the same ghetto-ass, baggy pants draggin
Deep rollin heat holdin nigga til I'm triple platinum

(Ruck)
To all my hardcore niggaz don't forget me (don't forget me)
I know the game change and all of these niggaz wanna switch me

"Hardcore, far more than the average"

(Rock)
M.F.C.!
Hey hey, that's my partner Price man
The whole industry's against him and me
Like thugs are to death penalties
but we got the remedy for all that punk shit
One clip up in the macra
make wiffleballs out all of you popcorn rappers
Callin my crew haters, knowin damn well you hate me
But scared to stick it to me, knowin damn well I break teeth
Alcatraz, forever Rock hard, got scars for this rap shit
Got locked behind bars, fluck the actin
