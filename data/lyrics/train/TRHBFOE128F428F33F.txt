Eh marara i lle llea
You are about to embark on a journey
You are going to visit monkeys, dolphins
And people

I look around and all I see are politicians on the take
I look at me, I am the same but I don't notice
And I have learned that everybody
Has a price tag on his head

Though it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey dance
And it's money that will make the monkey dance
Yes, it's money that will make the monkey, monkey
Monkey dance

On Sunday mornings when I went went to church
A buck was always made
