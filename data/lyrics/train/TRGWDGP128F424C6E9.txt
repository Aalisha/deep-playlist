Don't need this crap this TV's pushing
I'm just gonna get my skate and hit the streets 
I know a place not far from here
Where I can ride a gnarly bowl and get some air
Ain't gonna be like my parents
Rottin' away in easychairs
Ain't got no time for sunday football
Or watching cartoons after school

Where you gonna go - shred central
Whatcha gonna do - grinders
