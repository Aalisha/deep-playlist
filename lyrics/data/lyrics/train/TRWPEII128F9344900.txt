The nights are wearing me down
And it's hard getting through the day
'Cos I need you right now
And right now you're so faraway

I guess that I should have known
That I'd end up this way
But I swear I'll come home
And then nothing will drag me away

Don't you ever leave me baby
Don't you ever leave me now
Don't you ever leave me baby
If you leave me you will kill me now

Now that some much time has passed
I know that this love of ours will last forever
Cos we feel it, take it, hold it and believe it
...
