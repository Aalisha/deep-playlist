I prayed for somethin,' I could never understand
The sword of Shiva to deliver me to unimagined lands
And there you were
I asked for somethin' that could catch me by surprise
To leap into the belly of the beast to rip me up and bring me out alive
And there you were

Into your eyes
I'm falling rain
Into your eyes
A hurricane
Into your eyes
I'm coming home
I'm holding on
I'm letting go

Oh, I'm flying free
Over the land of the prophecy
All my future's below
Oh, I pledge my life
All I am to be by your side
Then you whisper that all you need of me is just to breathe
