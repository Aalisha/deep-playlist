I can see she's in for this
She can't see her
It can make her happy
And I can see

She's says she's gone forward
And she's crying
And see she's calling

Leave house
Leave house
Leave house
(And it's the first thing that I would do)
(And I'll make sure he'll follow you)
Leave house

They say that I'm lonely
That I hide away
That I hide away from all of you
And I can't see
