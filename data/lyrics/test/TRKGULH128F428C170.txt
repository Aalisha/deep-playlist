Check it out now.
Word up Son, shit is ill kid.
Knahmsayin? Bein that we livin the motherfuckin trife life
Don't have another day right?
It's only right
Let me put you on to what happens Son, never believe this shit
Kick that shit

(Prodigy)
It's just another day, drownin my troubles with a forty
That's when I got the call from this brownskin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at? Said we could do whatever
She got her crew too, and said that we should get together
I said, "Aight -- just call me back in a hour
so I can take a shower and gather up the manpower"
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the hoe lonely in tears
Ain't no tellin what her friends puttin up in her ears
Ideas of settin me up, I'm not tryin ta hear
(Check it out, Son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole batallion of Bucktowners
Waitin for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe, I'm blowin this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen, to niggaz very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, fuck the world is my mental
We put together five soldiers, the bitch called
My blood curdled, told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waitin for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with fire piece, nuttin sweet
