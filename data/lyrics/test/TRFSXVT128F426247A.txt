Waking up every day in the same bed
For nine long years and it all goes by
I'm glad with what I got so you won't hear
One word of regret coming out of my mouth

I've wasted so much goddamn precious time
Worrying and complaining
I'm so spoiled my eyes sewn shut
I thought I was caught in a rut but I'm in no danger

Yeah, I'm lucky
Some people are more dull than me
Yeah, I'm lucky
Some people are more dull than me

Yeah, I'm so afraid of turning into a blank face
