(Colin Blunstone - Lead Vocal)

We're living in a different reality
We're toeing the same line
We give in we call it neutrality,
A joke with no punchline
The silver plated hero
Meets the golden hearted whore
The odds'll give you zero
She'll be leaving in a few days more
Movin' on forever, maybe she don't care
...
