I see you walkin' down the street
You're turnin' into paradise
The boys are crawlin' at your feet
Burn them and turn them to ice
No one gets a piece of your heart
It's over 'cause you won't let it start
You keep your love in chains, love in chains
And only fear remains and keeps your love in chains
But isn't it time (enough), isn't it time (enough)
Oh yeah
