Once upon a time
Before I took up smiling
I hated the moonlight!
Shadows of the night
That poets find beguiling
Seemed flat as the noonlight
With no one to stay up for
I went to sleep at ten
Life was a bitter cup
For the saddest of all men
Once upon a time
My heart was just an organ
My life had no mission
Now that I have you
To be as rich as Morgan
Is my one ambition
