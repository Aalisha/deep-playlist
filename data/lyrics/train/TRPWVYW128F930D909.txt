Yeah, Funkdoobie in the house
1994, representing, keeping it real
One time

I stepped out the door and left undisturbed
I made the beer run and saw them hookers on the curb
Them pimps got the curls, rollers fancy fur coats
Talking to the brothers in the alley
The word of the party's at 7 and girls are with their babies
Kids are playing handball and it's about 80

I rolled out with T-Funk in the t-bird, pump the t-bass
Hell of course, then we made that u-turn
The doobie got rolled up, the homies had showed up
'Cause we made a left and saw the liquor store hold up
Stopped at the light, actin' like nothing happened
We went about our way, brothers domino slappin'
Pulled up on the side to see what girls were wearin'
T popped the top and had all the hookers starin'

On the real, the real, what the deal
For my brothas who live and die on the corner
On the real, the real, what the deal
For my brothas who live and die on the corner

On the real, the real, what the deal
For my brothas who live and die on the corner
