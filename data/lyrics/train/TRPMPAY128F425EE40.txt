I was givin' up on givin' love another try
But were easy on the heart
And easy on the eye
I wouldn't have believed it if I'd been told
I'd have my very own angel to hold
Like a warm blanket I can wrap around my soul
You're good lookin'
You're good luck
You make me feel like a million bucks
That's what your love does for me
Like a child, a little wild
And like everything I do is in style
That's what your love does for me
...
