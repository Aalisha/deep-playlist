The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
The world keeps turning beyond the control
What I can't hold by love I won't hold at all

I want my pretty baby
He says he wants me to
We wanna be together
Hope that is something we can do

I want my pretty baby
He says he wants me so bad
He knows that I got a thing for him
Hope our thing won't turn out sad

The world keeps turning we can't change its course
What I can't hold by love I won't hold by force
...
