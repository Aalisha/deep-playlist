I remember as a child I used to hear
Music that they played with a feel
Some call it folk, some call it soul
People, let me tell you it was rock and roll

I was raised on rock, got that rhythm in my soul
Every day when I get home I turn on my radio

And listen to the music that my idols made
I knew every single record the DJ's played
The 'Honky Tonk', 'Hound Dog', 'Johnny B. Goode'
