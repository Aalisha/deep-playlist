I know you, you know me
I'm the black sheep of the family
I'm in an' out of trouble
I'm the talk of the town
I get wild in the street
When the sun goes down

I steal around like a thief in the night
Dancing till the break of day

Bad boys
Running undercover of moonlight
Bad, bad boys
Getting wild in the street
Wild in the city

I see you, you see me
Just a black street boy in society
With high-heeled women
Full of champagne an' lies
Getting wild in the street
Till the hot sunrise
...
