Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

My life's a masquerade
A world of let's pretend, dear
Since you took your love
Pretending never ends, dear

But I can't let you know
That I still need you so, no

(Darling I hide the tears that I cry)
