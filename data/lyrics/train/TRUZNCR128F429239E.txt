It's a good year for a murder
She's praying to Jesus
She's pulling the trigger
There's no tears
Cause he's not here
She washes her hands
And she fixes the dinner

But soon they'll be coming to rush her away
No one's so sure if her crime had a reason
But reasons like seasons they constantly change
And the seasons of lies still like reasons are flowing, away

Away with this spilled milk?
Away with this dirty dishwater?
Away
