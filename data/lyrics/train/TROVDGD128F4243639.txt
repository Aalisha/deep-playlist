Rachael, I'm sorry that we never had the time
Matching love could of last forever
I will never let you go from the corners of my mind
Never, say never
Rachael, I'm dreaming of a day when you were mine
We could have been so good together
Lonely sitting here with just my thoughts beside me now
Never, say never

When you find the time
I'd like to nestle in your arms
Tangled in the deepest jungle
...
