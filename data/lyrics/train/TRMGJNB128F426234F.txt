Just kiss me
And forget all about that other stuff
Kiss me
Your big red lips, I think, will be enough

Don't worry with your lipstick
I'm gonna kiss it all away
Throw away your lipstick
That ain't your color, anyway

My lips are your color
So lips, stick with me!

Ooo, when you kiss me
I've got to know just how much you miss me

Kiss me
And I'll take your lips to paradise
