I've taken all the locks from the door
And I've picked up all your clothes from the floor
I'm feeling all fingers and thumbs
And i'm gonna need a beat from the drums...
I was gonna make a difference today
I was gunna go and jump on a plane
But who you gonna run to?
Who you gonna run to?
i was gonna call you up on the phone
But the thought of watching tv alone
Yeah who you gonna run to?
'cause I'm the one who loves you.

Cant we pick up where we started?
Cant we be adults about it?
What you saying? What you take me for?
