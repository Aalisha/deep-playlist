You see I'm always talkin'
When I should be drivin'
But everybody does it these days

You say I'm gettin' cancer
Every time I answer
Yeah, whatever you say

Wish I could change my service
Should have never signed up
Heck it never works anyway

The signal's always breakin'
I can't hear nothin'
Hey, what did you say?
