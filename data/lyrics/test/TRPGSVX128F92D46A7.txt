I have built a city here
Half with pride and half with fear
Just wanted a safer place to hide
I don't want to be safe tonight

I need You like a hurricane
Thunder crashing wind and rain
To tear my walls down
I'm only Yours now
I need You like a burning flame
A wild fire untamed
To burn these walls down
I'm only yours now
I'm only yours now

I am Yours and You are mine
You know far better than I
And if destructions what I need
...
