With you by my side I feel intoxicated.
Your perfume invades my senses.
Each breath, like inhaling gas fumes,
Asphyxiates the inner voice that begs me to leave.

Angry acids lay siege upon my stomach,
The mere thought of food repulsive to me.
When I force myself to eat, even my favorite dishes
Taste like I'm feasting upon your cigarette ashes.
