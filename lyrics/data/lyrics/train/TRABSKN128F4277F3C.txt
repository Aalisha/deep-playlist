If our world falls down tomorrow
You be sure I'll be there with a net
To catch the pieces falling
And I was always there
And I was always there
I was always there but you
Just never knew where

(ay oh, ay oh) I hope you weren't waiting long
I hope this night makes up for time lost
(ay oh, ay oh) Feels like I met you years ago and
We're picking up right where we left off
