I used to be concerned
With what it means to be alive
We tried to have our moment
And the moment passed us by

Let's take a deep breath now
Make it all slow down
We've got a good shot, 
This time it's now or never

We don't wanna stand here
Waving ourselves goodbye
We'd rather break down
And leave it all behind
There's no tomorrow, 
There's just tonight
