The heart isn't blind it just sees what it wants to see
I hope yours is lookin' at mine the way that you're lookin' at me
Girl I've been around I've taken chances before
But this time I'm hopin' for more you're makin' it easy

Nobody falls like a fool, nobody loves like a believer
After so many dreams have fallen through it's time that one came true
Nobody falls like a fool, nobody loves like a believer
