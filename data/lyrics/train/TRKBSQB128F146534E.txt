Willie and Laura Mae Jones were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us in a shack, just like our shack
We worked in the fields together, and we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land you don't have time to think about another man's
color.

The cotton was high and the corn was growin' fine
But that was another place and another time

We'd sit out on the front porch in the evenin' when the sun went down
Willie would play and Laura would sing and the chilluns would dance around
And I'd bring over my guitar, we'd play into the night
And every now and then Willie would grin and say
'Boy you play alright' (and that made me feel so good)
