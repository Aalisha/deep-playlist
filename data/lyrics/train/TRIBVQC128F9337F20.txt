Hear my cries, white is everywhere
There's no way to escape from this strange nightmare
In front of me attached on a bed
Lies the corpse of a child
With a face so pale
He turns his head and his glance meets mine

Religious incantations desecrate my will
"Come to me little child, 
See in my the resurrection of your god!
