Don't bother going through your motions
Nothing that makes sense ever works out
And don't kid yourself, you know they want money
Well nothing can be good on its own just a merit

Spinning and spinning
Do you believe in what you want?
Dancing in plastic, shake-up snow
Do you believe in what you want?
