It's the time when I spend all my hours in fear
Emptiness just comes and goes
Hopefully it doesn't show
Cause it's calling my name
Deep inside of my brain
They don't stop
Cause they're trying to drive me insane
Don't know why you went away
Ooh the memories will never fade
December once again
December once again
December once again
Like the stars in the sky
I can still see your eyes
It's the same old pattern
