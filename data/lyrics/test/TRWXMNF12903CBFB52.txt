I wanna Dance with Harry Dean
Drive through Texas in a black limousine
I want a piece of heaven before I die
I wanna pair of pink high heels
That catch the lights up on the Ferris wheel

What I really want I just can't buy
Here comes the twenty first century
It's gonna be much better for a girl like me
Cause I want everything I can
But most of all I want that man
I want that man
I wanna move like what's-his-name
