Looking for a way in, searching for the way out
Angels ride free in your mind
But you're never gonna find it if you're never gonna try
Get your eyes on the road and suck the wild

Hey man, get hip
Climb aboard our pleasure ship
Speedboy, we know
You're king of the wheel, yeah, go man go, go, go, go

Go Apollo 69
Rocket baby, walk the line
Feed my fire, now's the time
Fly Apollo 69, yeah, yeah

Go Apollo
Go Apollo

Drifting like a stoned dog, sister rebel outlaw
Agent for a vacant world
Living in the shame club, working for that same love
Shake it while you can, sunset girl

Big man, so wild
Tune into our groovy style
Freakout, freak this
Ride upon erotic bliss

Go Apollo 69
