Boy look into these eyes
It's time you realised
I've had my share of life's
Heartaches and misey
Too many times before
Oh how I've been so sure
It's meant to be

And each and every time
I step across the line
Just like the fool I am
I swear it will be the last
But here I go again
Listenin' to my heart

It's tellin' me it's time to move on
You gotta let it go
But something in my mind
Keeps sayin' no
No sad goodbyes
No one last tries
See I've had enough
Takin' chances on love
And I said I'd never do it again
