Maybe I could fall
Baby, I could fall apart
To conceal, to protect
To serve and to reject

I? m turning into something
Go all the way to the right
I? m goin' past, I? m goin' past
I? m goin' past the next two lights

Hit the streets, they talk to me
A fickle beast who? s nice today
It? s such a waste, another day
Such a waste, but it feels great

Everything has taken a turn
