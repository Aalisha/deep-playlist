I can't even believe we're havin' this conversation again
Oh my God

Here's the thing I need you to stop treatin' me
As if I'm simple or naive
As if I don't know nothin' 'bout the world

I understand you think you're protectin' me
Well, I could use a little room to breathe
And the respect you give a woman not a girl

Here's the thing I appreciate all the love
The constant caterin', kisses and hugs
But lately I'm wonderin' what you do it for

If the reason you act all over sweet is
'Cause you want to keep me on a leash
I have no choice but to show you the door

If you wanna cradle me like a little girl
And lock me down, I'm not your possession
I'm a full grown woman, I am not your porcelain doll
