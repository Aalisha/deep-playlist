Pardon me while I burst

A decade ago

I never thought I would be
At twenty-three, on the verge of
spontaneous combustion
Woe-is-me
But I guess that it comes
With the territory
An ominous landscape of never-ending calamity
I need you to hear
I need you to see

That I have had all I can take and
exploding seems like an imminent possibility to me
So pardon me while I burst into flames
