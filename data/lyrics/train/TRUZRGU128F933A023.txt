it's the human thing to do
On this life-like stage,
we act a play,
well that's so human too
Why don't you drink
from my ruby red glass?
Why don't you drink
from my ruby glass?
An unlit corner
in the world alone...
what shall we do?
Now I'm thinking less
of pain and lies
and I'm thinking more of you...
And I'm thinking more of you...

The empty room-
upon a black floor
...
