These are the days that i've been missing;
give me the taste,
give me the joy of summer wine.
These are the days that bring new meaning;
i feel the stillness of the sun
and i feel fine.

Sometimes when the nights are closing early
i remember you and i start to smile.
Even though now you don't want to know me
i get on by...
and i go the extra mile.
