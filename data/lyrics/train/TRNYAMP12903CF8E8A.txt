The users, The leeches. The washed up. Throw the word around and have no respect for its roots, it's you I despise.

Easy come, easy go.
I'll turn on them just like I turned on you.
I guess it's safe to say.
I'll always be the enemy.
I won't unite with what I despise.
I won't unite with what I despise.
