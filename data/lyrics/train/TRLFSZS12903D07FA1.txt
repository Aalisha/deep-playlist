I was walking, was living
My melody was acapella
There's a beat I was missing
No tune, or a scale, I could play

The sound in the distance
No orchestra playing together
Like a boat out to sea

The silence was too deafening!
So come and revive me
I can't feel my heartbeat

Just me surviving alone
()
Before you
My whole life was acapella!
Now a symphony's

The only song to sing
Before you
