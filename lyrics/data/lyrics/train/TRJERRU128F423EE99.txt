Tonight, the world screams passed our window
Another 15 hours to go
Headlights and statelines are all that we know

The sun is breaking over the horizon
We greet the day with bloodshot eyes
No sleep, no chance that we'll ever make it on time, make it on time
We're still so far behind

We'll never get back home before the summer
Never get, get back home before the leaves start to change
Hang our hearts on the road, Virginia won't be the same
We'll get back to her some other day

Pass out on our friend's floor
My head is pounding from the night before
A drink and I won't feel sick anymore
We spill our guts all over the stage
