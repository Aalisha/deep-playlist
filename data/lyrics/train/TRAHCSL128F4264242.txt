When your guy has got his hat
and made himself hard to find
It doesn't mean you should go crazy
It could be that way sometime

Find yourself another love
Who will treat you good and kind
Return that love he gives to you
It also be's that way sometime

Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
