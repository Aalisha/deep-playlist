Inside it harbors
Desire bruises my skin
So near I? m hungry
I? d like to have more

In control, I? ve lost it
I? d like to try it again
It warms inside me
We? re moving one step closer each time

There? s nobody like you
Nobody like you
Nobody like you
Nobody like you anyway, oh anyway

There? s nobody like you
Nobody like you
Nobody can touch you
Nobody like you anyway, oh anyway
Everyone knows

We fall, slow motion
I taste your breath in my veins
