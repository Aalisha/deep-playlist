We go deep
And we don't get no sleep
'cause we be up all night
Until the early light
We go deep
And we don't get no sleep
'cause we be up all night
Until the early light
I'm feelin' fine
'cause in time i'll be out tonight
I'm startin' now
Makin' sure i look fine tonight
Call rene and boo
Gotta meet them soon
Tell t. to call shawn
I'll be here at 1: 00
When we show up
All the guys at the club
Wanna get our backs
We look good in black
We go deep
And we don't get no sleep
'cause we be up all night
Until the early light
...
