This is the swiftly tilting planet
Where perfect vision may not offer
The correct point of view; a place where
Right angles may not produce
The correct geometry

By far, a discerning eye is better than a critical mind

We are quiet like birds
With swiftly tilting minds
And wings that are made of humility, yeah
We are quiet like birds
With secrets like butterflies
And we can only fly if we use our wings

Bridges are built to get us from where we are
To where we are going
In order for them to be built in
A decent fashion
...
