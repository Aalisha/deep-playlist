You made my day
You came my way
You heard me every time I pray
You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face

You brought the sunshine in my life
You are the lifeline
Since that I have found Christ
There has been such a change in my life

You made my day
You came my way
You heard me every time I pray
You gave me peace
You gave me grace
You put a smile upon my face

You brought the sunshine
You are the lifeline
Since that I have found Christ
There has been such a change in my life

You made my day
