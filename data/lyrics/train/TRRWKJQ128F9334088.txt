Apathy:
Ladies and gentlemen
Introducing
The Get Busy Committee

RYU:
You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain't gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar
You see us coming through the door with our hoods up
Eyes low sipping on that good stuff
And you ain't gotta ask if you need a couple bags say Daddy come and give me some sugar

Kids idolize us, mothers all despise us
Cuz I keep 'em higher than the bottom of a sky bus
Try some powder sugar pie crumbs
Hundred dollar booger hooker look at you girl you'se a fine one
I could make your mind numb if you so decided
You don't want to try it quiet I can make your mind up
