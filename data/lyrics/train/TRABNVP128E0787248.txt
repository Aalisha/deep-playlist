There's a grey horse standin' still
As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride
As the rain pours off his hat
You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes

Now the cannons are silent
His friends are all gone
Gotta put it all behind him
If he ever wants to find his way home
He's the last rebel on the road

Just a boy with his old guitar
Keeps to himself
but everybody takes him wrong
But he carries on
Got a dream that will never die
...
