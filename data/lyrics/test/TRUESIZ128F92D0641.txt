B*witched's Message To Santa
*three telephone rings*

Santa: ho, ho, ho, i'm not in right now so please leave a jolly christmas
Message after the music.
(play jingle bells in phone sound)
Beep!

B*witched: hi santa, it's b*witched. merry christmas. yeah!

Edele: we know you're making your list and checking it twice but we just thought
We'd call and tell you that our fans have been really nice.
