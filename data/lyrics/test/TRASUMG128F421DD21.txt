(Don't hold your breath) 
Things will never be the same
From another point of view
I am wise to what you do

You left the door unlocked
And when I came home
I saw the keys on the floor
By the phone tonight
I knew that something wasn't
(something wasn't right).

Give me one chance, give me one chance 
To settle up the score between us
Before my trunk becomes your fate
Give me one chance, I'll plan a perfect murder
Give me one chance, no one will ever miss her
And now your bloods upon my hands 
To wash away my sins.
