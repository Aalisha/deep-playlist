Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing on a sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Oh oh ooh, Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh oh ooh, Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh oh ooh, Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh oh ooh, Santa Claus is coming to town

Oh oh ooh, Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh oh ooh, Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh oh ooh, Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh oh ooh, Santa Claus is coming to town

Frosty, the snowman was a very happy soul
With a smoky pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made from snow but the children know
How he came to life one day
