Look at my watch it's nearly half past hour
I feel, I sense that you are gone
Check out the hypocrits rolling on the floor
They've seen and heard it all before.

Now I'm on my own - I don't know
Just thought that I'd drop you a line
Before the blade action is twisted.

Strange but true
I just won't get next to you
You're my lover everybody knows you are
