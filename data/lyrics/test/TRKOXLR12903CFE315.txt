The Assassin of love has your name on a list
He kicks down the door and he takes you away
Snuffed and cold there's a face in the glass
You're locked in a room with the smell of decay

Something is in the air
You better say a prayer
Something is in the air

A spasm of faith that flickers and fades
...
