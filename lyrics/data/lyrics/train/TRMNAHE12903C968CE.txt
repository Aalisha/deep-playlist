Holdin' me close
On a hot summer night
Clothes are drippin' wet, babe
You feel so nice
Teach me, teach me darling
Teach me something new
Oh oh I wanna make love to you

We'll fit together
My hand in your glove
Little little girl
I need your woman's touch
My hot desire
Is runnin' away with me
Come on baby
Set it free

Stay with me tonight
Stay forever
Stay with me tonight
You'll discover
That this feeling's right
Like no other
