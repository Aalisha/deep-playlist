I'm smiling, my friends say I'm losing my mind
But it feels like I'm walking on sunshine
Since she's come into my life

I call her five or six times in one day
For nothing at all, not much to say
Just to let her know she's on my mind

And ooh, the feeling I feel I don't quite understand
I lose my mind with the touch of her hand
To talk on the phone isn't really enough
I guess that it's almost like being in love, in love

I'm floating, doing strange things without knowing
Don't know if I'm coming or going
...
