I need someone, a person to talk to, someone who'd care to love -- could it be you? Could it be you?
The situation gets rough, and I start to panic; it's not enough, it's just a habit and, kid, you're sick...
Well, darling, this is it...

Well, you can all just kiss off into to the air,
Behind my back, I can see them stare.
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind...
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time... (Yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time... (Yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time... (Do it all the time!)
They do it all the time... (Do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time...
