Spring is alive in Carolina
Deep in the forest where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain, down in a holler
Thunder and lightning, so it goes

Over a hundred years ago we came to Carolina
Far across the water it's a long hard road
With little more than courage we came seeking independence
A little less than nothin' is a heavy load

From the heather to the highlands
We have found the Smoky Mountains
Hard work and simple ways
And life is good, life is good

Spring is alive in Carolina
Deep in the forest where the foxfire glows
High on a mountain, down in a holler
Thunder and lightning, so it goes
