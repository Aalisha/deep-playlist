(feat. V-12)

[Verse 1]
I want it to pop, I want the revolution to start
Watch niggaz get exposed straight lose their heart
God willing I be the one doing the killing
Say nobody got no love for the hood and its children
I'm the illest in the world fuck it the universe
Make your life hurt when I start puttin' in knife work
I zoned with Curtis Mayfield vibed with Marvin
Cause the black snake is the worst snake in the garden
They used Judas made him turn his gun on Christ
Shots riddled Malcolm X and destroyed his life
Even Martin Luther King got hit with the flame
And you wonder why the black man stuck in the game
Fuck it I stay dirty Timbs and grey shirty
Pop your hard hat put two in your derby
My life too many questions and not enough answers
Get 'em all back for what they did to the Panthers

[Chorus: V-12]
Lift every voice and sing true love that heaven brings
Filled with the harmony of liberty
They sing the rising sun a brand new day begun
Let us march on'til victory is won

[Verse 2]
And this is for the pure souls who died at birth
And the mothers in the struggle still feeling the hurt
