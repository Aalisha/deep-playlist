It's too late to be smart now
I'm all out of clever things to say
You're gone and I'm alone now
I never meant for things to end this way

But it seems you can't help it
You keep on flirting 'til I can't see straight
It ain't fair, but I guess you've gotta roll with the punches

It's true, I can't get you off my mind
It's you, and the mess you left behind

Knocked down, I'm on the ropes now
...
