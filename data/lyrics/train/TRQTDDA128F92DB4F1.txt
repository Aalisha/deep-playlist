It's like we know the words and melodies
But we're singing them in halftime
I lean in closer feel you breathing
You're eyes look away and I stop on a dime
But I believe in the the life that we seek
Can far away the risks we take
Could this be everything that I wanted
Could I be the one your waiting for
The difference time and place we can't erase
these footsteps anymore
A second chance a subtle smile
...
