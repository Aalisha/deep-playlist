Remember darkness
It's full of strangers meeting strangers talking code
Remember voices
Sometimes these voices print out danger
And I am just another stranger
Find another stranger
Who's lost another stranger
Trying not to love you
Trying not to love you...
Remember nonsense
You were it's witness while computers searched for fame
Remember judgement
Sometimes the finger points to blame us
Would you believe another stranger
Find another stranger
