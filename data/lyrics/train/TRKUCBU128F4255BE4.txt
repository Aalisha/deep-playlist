I dream of you draped in wires
And leaning on the breaks
As I leave you with restless liars and dealers on the take
And I can read you like a gun
She watched this meeting hall, sweat and shake!
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you all on
I'll take you on
Oh, I'll take you on
I'll take you on
I'll take you on

I will stride you with desire of fault line
No crutch, no stall.
And I can bind you with no ties and leash and watch you fall

You see I've got this soul, it's all fired up
...
