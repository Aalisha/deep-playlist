Oh, it didn't take too long before I ran out of things to say
You know my baby and me we was going on our first date
And I hope she's not the kind who likes to make a man wait

It didn't take too long before I ran out of whiskey and gin
We came closer to her house it's right around the very next building
I gotta loosen her up or she ain't never gonna let me in
