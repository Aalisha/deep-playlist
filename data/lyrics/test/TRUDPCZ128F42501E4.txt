(Clarke / Hicks / Nash)

Will you try to justify the meaning
Of the note you sent this evening
To my door, you're not deceiving me
I'd have thought that you'd have known much better
Sending round an unsigned letter
Facing me would be much better now

Is it just that you can't face the future with me
Can't you tell me to my face
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my place
