Speaking: What are you trying to say Yolanda?
Look forget about all that other junk
this battle ain't yours, its the lord's
think about it, and then start shouting help me sing

v1
There is no pain, Jesus can't feel
There is no hurt, that He can't heal
For all things work [yes they do]
According to the masters purpose
and his holy will
no matter what [you in the balcony]
are going thru, remember that God only wants a chance to use you
for the battle is not yours its the Lord's
[we gonna tell the devil that all right?]

There's no sadness, Jesus can't feel
and there is no sorrow,
that the master is not able and willing to heal
remember that all things work
...
