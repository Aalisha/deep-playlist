Make waves, make waves, I'm sea
it's all you can take
come back, back down, now I'm drifting away

away

your ship's sunk It's gone down, now your captain is dead
your saints become sailors when my ocean is fed
by these bloody waters, mark my words
come on

Alright I want you all to clap along and sing with me
