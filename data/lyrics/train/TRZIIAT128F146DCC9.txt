I thought that I was over you
How I was mistaken
Why did I bump into you
And start this chain reaction, mm

I felt it building up inside
When suddenly
Oh, it was more than I can bear
Mm, more than I can bear

When I saw you
Walking down the road with someone new
I couldn't believe it was true
It was true, yeah

I find it hard to sleep at night
This jealousy is burning bright
Visions of somebody else
Torments me to distraction, oh yeah
...
