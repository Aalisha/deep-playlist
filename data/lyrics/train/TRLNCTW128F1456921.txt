ohohohohohoh

Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try, it's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

Baby, you told me that you love me and you never leave my side
Through the bitter end, through the thick and thin
You promised me baby, that you weren't going anywhere, yes you did
Baby, keep it real, let me know just how you feel

Tell me it's real
This feeling that we feel
Tell me that it's real
Don't let love come just to pass us by
Try, it's all we have to do
It's up to me and you
To make this special love last forever more

I can't explain the way you made me feel
Every time that you told me that you loved me
And you know you did
Too many times
