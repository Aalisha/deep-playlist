Sweeter than a honey bee, yeah, baby been sweet on me
Sweeter than a honey bee, yeah, my queen bee
Oh she rock to my soul, mama love me to my soul
Love me to my soul, oh she rock me to my soul

She's a strutter, she can shake it some yeah, oh watch her now look at her run
A strutter, she can shake it some, oh dancing having fun
She love me to my soul, oh she love me to my soul
Oh love me to my soul oh rock me to my soul
