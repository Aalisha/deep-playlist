Rising from the darkside
Arriving from beyond
The lord of death approaches
To end all human lives

The pleasure of the torment
Will bring him back to Earth
The time has come for closure
The final hour calls

But there's a way out of the misery
You can join the massacre
Once you're in you're never out
A soldier of the dead forevermore
