Bonnie and Clyde were pretty looking people
But I can tell you people
They were the devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doing
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way
They robbed a store and
Hightailed outa that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down

Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation
...
