Girl
I tried to run but couldn't get too far
My heart is pumpin' but still I'm runnin' in place
No matter how hard I try to get your touch
When you're away too long, oh girl it's too much

But everytime I run I need you oh so bad
But I'm running scared, my heart is beatin' so fast
I heard that you could make a man change his plan
that's why I'm running fast, I'm running the 100 yard dash

I ran for the hills and girl there you were
How you appear, you see I never know
