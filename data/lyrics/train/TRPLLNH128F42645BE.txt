I know I made mistakes before
But girl, I never lied, still I apologize
And I know sometimes I made you cry
And now I realize, I need you by my side

When it comes to you, I swallow my pride
'Cause you're the reason why I feel so alive
Girl, please tell me you'll still be my lady
Without your love in my life, I'll go crazy

I know I made mistakes before
(But I never lied)
Tell me if you're leaving me
(Or staying by my side)
You know that I love you
I wanna know what to do
Please don't forget about me

I know I shoulda thought about
The things I did before I did 'em
If I can stop your tears
Oh girl, I can't see a way
To stop the pain that you're feelin'
If I can make it right, God knows I will

Please give me a chance
To make things right, once again
Before we fell in love, remember we were friends
So don't let it end

I know I made mistakes before
...
