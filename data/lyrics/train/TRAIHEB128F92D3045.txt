I wrote this song in a paper bag:

Oh! MMM!

I watched my body as it disappeared
I watched my body as it disappeared whoa
I saw the blood dripping from my beard uh huh
I couldn't tell you no
I couldn't tell you no

I walk around all day inside a dream
I walk around all day inside a dream whoa
Inside your head no one will hear you scream uh huh oh no
And no (no!) one can see your face
no (no!) one can see your face no! ah ah
...
