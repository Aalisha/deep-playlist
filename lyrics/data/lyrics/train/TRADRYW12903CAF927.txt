(S. Climie/C. Carter)

I don't need you to mend my broken heart
Not afraid you can throw your sticks and stones
But this love is tearing me apart
I've got a wounded heart
And it won't stop beating
Tried to keep it a casual affair
Nonetheless we get careless 'cos we care
Why does love make me fall apart
It only hurts my heart
And it won't stop beating
Got a wounded heart
And it won't stop beating
No matter what I do
A wounded heart
That keeps repeating
I'm missing you
Missing you
Got a wounded heart
