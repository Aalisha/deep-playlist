I don't want to hear another word
You're over it, it seems
I don't think you'll mind the end so much
It justifies your means
All this silence once disturbed me
Now there's nothing more to say
Unless you speak what's on your mind
Go your seperate way

Wake me up when it's all over
I've got things to do
I'd like to get on with my life
If it's with or without you
And it breaks my heart to see all that we've done
...
