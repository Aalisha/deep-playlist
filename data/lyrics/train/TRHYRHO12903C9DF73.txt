[Big Noyd]
yea, yea, yea, I didn forget about the Queensbridge mothafuckas
Roll the Mobb Deep in this mothafucka, yea, yea
Mario drop the beat... yea, uh Rappin' Noyd
'Bout ta destroy any man, woman, man, boy
I don't give a FUCK, word is bond...

[Hook*Big Noyd*]
(check it) Rough Neck, you soldeir suspect
You hear me boy, Recognize, Rappin' Noyd
Now Destroy, nothing changed, blew you out the frame
Was a small thing, I kept you shook
Cause you know my gat bang

A Usual Suspect, a soldeir suspect
You hear me void, Recognize, Rappin' Noyd
Now Destroy, nothing changed, I blew you out the frame
Was a small thing, I kept you shook
Cuz you know my gat big

[Big Noyd]
Mr. Untouchble, the unlovable, crimi-nul
Reppin' Queensborough, the rappers back on another level
Matter fact black, check the gat stats
I keep access ta the max
For those who don't know, how ta act
Get laid on they back, and its a fact
You bustin' me - Im bustin' back
So kid dance ta the track or analyze the rap
Before you get trashed-smacked-clapped and thats that
Im strictly hardcore, even more than before
When I was shooting up doors in Baltimore, try'na score
Nappy born hustla, the Hennessey guzala
I been a-black-a-mothafucka
Don't make me buck ya, the .9 pound I struck ya
'9-6 you ask about this convict
Niggaz can't harm this, regardless
Niggaz claiming heartless, Easy for me ta tear
'Par bitch, you don't want ta start this, Im lethal
Don't make me jump (?) B.Q. we ain comin' see you
You best have your mothafuckin' people
Cuz when Im rollin' in the viga, strapped wit' my nigga
When I see you, Im leavin' lead in ya liva

[Hook*Big Noyd*]
To the Rough Neck, a soldeir suspect
You hear me void, Recognize, Rappin' Noyd
Now Destroy, nothing changed, I blew you out the frame
