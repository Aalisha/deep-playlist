(Paul Kennerley)

Oh, I got me a woman she's a pretty good woman at that
We live with a monkey and a Chinese acrobat
She calls me 'Tex', makes me wear a cowboy hat
But I don't care she's a pretty good woman at that

Nothing in the world make me treat that woman mean
She shaves my beard and she keeps my tractor clean
She burns my bread, makes me turn [Incomprehensible]
But I don't care she's a best little woman I've seen
