I left the east side for a west coast beauty
A girl who burned my thoughts like kisses
She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat painted lips on a live wire beauty
A tangerine girl with tambourine eyes
Her face was my favourite magazine
Her body was my favourite book to read

They say that all poets must have and unrequited love
As all lovers must have thought provoking fears

But holding on to you means letting go on pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you

I left the rough side for a seaside baby
A chamomile smile that pouts on cue
For every moment I breathe her sigh
