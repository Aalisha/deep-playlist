Sometimes I feel you
Like a beautiful light
Guiding my hand
Through the darkest night

Sometimes I hear you
Like a whispering breeze
In the call of a songbird
In the distant trees

And sometimes if I close my eyes
I can see another place and time

Chorus:
And sometimes I cry
And sometimes I hurt
Thought I will always know
I've been loved
And sometimes I bleed
From my broken heart
Though I will always know
I've been loved
...
