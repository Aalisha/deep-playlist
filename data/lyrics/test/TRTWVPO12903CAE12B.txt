Falling in hate with you
More and more every day
Falling away from this
In every way
Is it right
Is it wrong
You and I don't belong

Falling in hate, nothing to say
Don't want to hear you
Falling away, nothing to give, no
Falling in hate, nothing but fear in your heart
Falling away, nothing to live for
