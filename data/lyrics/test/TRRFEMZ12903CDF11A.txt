Black cities hidden in the dark
Among the waters, beneath the seas
Horrible thoughts destroy the minds
Thru the endless nights

You don't know what's to come
While I'm chanting incantations
Stay away and don't play
With This, you'll never understand

Buried in the frozen seas
Tombs of forgotten Gods
Who came forth from blackened stars
A breath of centuries here

A different, inconceivable cult
Shreds of the eternal, endless Circle
...
