Do you remember all the innocent once were sacred
Do you remember the time we once all were heaven sent

These darkened clouds have lead us here
Oh how I wish that I could die
You faggot you ruined the code of honor

You ruined the code of honor and now we have to live amongst the dead
You ruined the code of honor no turning back
