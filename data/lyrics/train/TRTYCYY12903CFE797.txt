You've sunk lower than I've ever seen,
and even though you deserved this
I tried to catch your fall
I've grown so tired of your childish threats
Know that I'll never run from anything

And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die
And I'll pray you're a failure
And that you won't make it out alive
