The world is my oyster
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

Do you wanna,
Do you wanna,
Do you wanna yeah.

I feel I'm a comin' your the go ahead kind.
You are warmly invited to come inside.
You have five minutes Christians yeah.
It was a joke yeah.
Because I'm a comin yeah, to cut your throat.
yeah give me more.

You are warmly invited to come inside.
You are warmly invited to come inside.
Come inside, come inside, come inside.

Your on your way up.
Gonna jack you up,
...
