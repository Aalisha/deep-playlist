Gather round to hear this tale
A story which has grown old
Torn of their pride
Stars crash and collide
The wrecking yard's grown cold
They may laugh and they may say that
This doesn't happen oh no
If you happen to see them just listen
Take away some of their pain tonight
These are saddened times today
This sickened place we live
We walk right through the wrecking yard
