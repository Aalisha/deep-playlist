When the lights go down in the California town
People are in for the evening
I jump into my car and I throw in my guitar
My heart beatin' time with my breathin'
Drivin' over Kanan, singin' to my soul
There's people out there turnin' music into gold

Well my buddy Jim Bass he's a-workin' pumpin gas
And he makes two fifty for an hour
He's got rythm in his hands as he's tappin' on the cans
Sings rock and roll in the shower
Drivin' over Kanan, singin' to my soul
There's people out there turnin' music into gold
...
