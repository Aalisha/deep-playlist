[Intro]
Let's get it Homeboy, y'all already know what it is man, this ain't that New York man
T.I.P. pimp squad click, ya understand that? King of the South, 
Westside to A-town you don't know any better
Nigga... understand? Bankhead!

[Chorus: TI]
Come and ride wit me nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
Where them suckers get it at, and hustlers keep them chickens at
Ride wit me nigga, let me show you where we kick it at
Where ho niggas be snitchin at, and often come up missin at
Ride wit me nigga, let me show you where we kick it at 
Where them killas livin' at and T.I.P. be chillin at
Ride wit a G, come and ride wit a G, all through the ATL'
Come and Ride wit a G

[Verse1: T.I.]
See me ridin through Atlanta, in the Phantom with the double-door
Make these bitches wonder what it been so much trouble fo
Im touchin for, anytime they tryin Grand Hustle folk
Come bussin fo, What the fuck these all tha bussin cussin fo
You like it ho, a couple years ago I woulda probably cut ya throat
Fuck it though, when im spittin something on the nucka fo
This well known flow, man i got this shit from [?] Cicero
Adamsville, goin home, sellin' him his own phone
A drop top, flip flops, shine as the chrome glow 
Tip hop out the booth, what he up and hurryin home fo 
Wit long dough, shit he just doin what he known for
Blowin dro, twenty fo, livin how the song go
Rubber bird, turnin, and beatin like a congo
