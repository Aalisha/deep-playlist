The flickering TV reflects in the needle
Someone's little baby just overdosed
The highway patrol just killed a speeder
Who's responsible for all this grief?
Who puts the guns in the hands of the killers?
The cynic just reached another high!
Innocence lies slowly dying in a sad and lost America

When the light goes out we just can't help but falling
You see, we all dig the dirt and we all dig the moaning
When the light goes dim and all the bad keeps coming
We all can dig \familiar smells of thousand years of torment

We get intrigued by crime, 'cause death is mystifying
See, people dig their lives, but love the art of dying
And when the mercury falls I see the soldiers coming
It's just another move in a pointless game to justify the torment
