Damn, you look good

Rap by P. Diddy

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is goin my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling...
