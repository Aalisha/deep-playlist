Ooh there's somethin' bout the skylight tonight
Something that makes me know everythin's gon' be alright
There's somethin' in the way that the stars align
There's not a single moment I'm a pass by

The hour's now
The bass is loud
The disco lights
Shinin' through the crowd
We're holdin' time in our hands and it stops when we say
We say
And we ain't stoppin' 'til the morning light

We gotta hold back the sun, don't let it come
Ain't stoppin' for no one
The night is young
Don't let them turn on the lights
Let us decide when they play that last song
The night is done
When we break the dawn

We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn
We break the dawn

Ooh there somethin' on the surface right now
Somethin' the keeps me movin' diggin' deeper down
So I just let the speakers speak to me
Vibrations movin' on the floor all around
...
