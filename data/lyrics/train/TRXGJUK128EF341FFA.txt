Way too long you had me in a headlock
Played my head till I was really brain washed
All those years you tried to really screw with me
Played the perfect son to everyone
Even loved by all the family
Foolin everyone around you boy but me

No more cryin all alone
No more wishing you'd come home
No more checkin' out your calls
I'm free
No more messin with my head
No more tryna understand
...
