One ticket, please
Lord have mercy, everybody's there
Hey, what's goin' on man, yeah
She's at home, yeah, she's at home

Yeah, she's at home
Let the music play
I just wanna dance the night away

Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay

All night long, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, wee
Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
...
