To think I showed such promise such potential as a lover
But I guess I had my hands full with myself without another
To occupy my fancies to take root amongst the woods
Hell I should have known I'd never come up with the goods
I never could

I will laugh and I will cry
And I'll take comfort in that someday I shall die
