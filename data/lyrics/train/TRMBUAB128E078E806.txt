Who was there for you
When you needed a real man to hold?
And who was there for you
When you needed a shoulder to cry on?

Through all the men you supposedly have loved
I'm the only man that stayed be your side
I promise you baby till the day I die
Whenever you need me I'll be there

When you need me, oh, when you need me
When you need me, I'll be right there
When you need me, oh, when you need me
When you need me, oh

When you need me, oh, when you need me
When you need me, I'll be right there
When you need me, oh, when you need me, oh

Before you go to sleep don't forget to say a prayer
Say a prayer to the Lord above that he would keep us near
'Cause true love is hard to find, so baby, let? s not waste no more time
Only God knows how much I really love you
I don't want nobody else but you, baby
