Walk the walk
Talk the walk
Be somebody you would like to be
Play a part
Hide your heart
Oh, you'd be surprised how good it feels

Dress for success
Not anything less
That's the way to go if you wanna impress
Always thought rules
Were for babies and fools
Don't you wanna think outside the box
outside the box

Oooh, oh, oh, oh
Thinking about it lately
Thinking about it lately
Speaking your mind is so overrated
Get into character it's so much better
Oooh, oh, oh, oh
Thinking about it lately
