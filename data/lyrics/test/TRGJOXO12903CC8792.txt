If you see me on the street
Looking like I ain't slept in a week
Hey, don't worry, baby

Find me closin' down the bar
Catch me crawlin' to my car
Hey, just look the other way

And if I'm by myself with a twisted face
Filling up on comfortable space

Never mind me
 (I'll be fine just talking to myself)
Never mind me
 (Sittin' all alone inside my personal hell)
I'm goin' just fine, never mind me
...
