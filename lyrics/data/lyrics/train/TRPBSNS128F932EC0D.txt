You came with the season as the first swallow sang
A brown headed stranger with a five-letter name
We planted our kisses where the wild berries grow
My feet sprouted wings and I flew all the way home

My cheeks red like fire engines racing straight to the heat of your skin
And I know our days are numbered early bird of the summer
You'll fly south just as the fall begins
