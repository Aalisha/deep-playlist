These old boots will keep me walking
To a place i long to be
High upon a mountain-top
Down in tennessee

Said good-bye to new york
Country living on my mind
Crowded streets and hard cement
That's what i left behind

(guitar solo)

Well just outside of oak ridge
About a fifteen minute ride
Well all i need is clean fresh air
