There's a girl in the crowd
And she's balling her eye's out
Only girl in the town
With her fingers in eyelids

And we're all fine in the back of your mind
If we do what we like then we could be with you tonight
If we bleed you dry

We're alright in the back of our minds if we do what we like
Then we could be with you tonight
If they bleed you dry

Taken half the tide
Taken all your tide
...
