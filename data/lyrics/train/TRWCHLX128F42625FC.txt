The pet he found at the bar, the status of the new car with it
Big money made a new job to make him feel a less slob of it
New standards changed the ego
The villain now a hero looks at life and takes a bite

A piece of paper makes him proud
The silence of success has got to seem so loud
His future in a uniform
He's just another number in the eye of the storm

Obstructure too late
Is a price he cannot pay
The cost of pride
And still he hides inside, dies inside

Alone he sheds a tear for the memories of before from it
A tribute to the good lord, the bottle is a way to forget
New standards changed the ego
