I've been away 10, 000 times and still I look in the mirror
What do I see?
An owl tryin' to fly in the light of day
Unaware of what's in my way
I can only find my place and I hope I'm wrong
I hope I'm wrong

By step by step...

Ooh here they come
Destroying my youth
And the other side's the same
When the rain pours
They'll cut us a loop and another nail
...
