Cold this night as you feel your fright
The horns of doom resound
White knight shines and you know why
The sky burns the giants light
Winter ends but what will come
The wolf the serpent the end
This the time for You and I
All Einherjer are gathered to fight

See the ship from Helheim comes
See the dead with Hel in front
I can't believe - Then the sun went down
Hear the roar - The wolves age
The clink of sword - death's rage
Brothers shall be brothers bane
In the end you kill in vein
Do you believe
