I see the fire through the trees
Hear the hollers through the breeze
Drowning out the season like there's none
Hold the blue steel in my hands
Moving my feet over land
While I'm thanking God I've got a gun
Nothing like a war at hand
To turn a boy into a man
Learning bout surviving on the run
Dodging whistles in the dark
Walking soft and hiding sparks
Praying bullets find another home

Oh here we go, another stand you know.
