Verse 1
Speculations are that there’s many way to get up there
I have a different view to share
I don’t claim to be a know it all
But I know someone who knows it all
And whatever He says I believe, so there can only be just…
Chorus
One (way to get where he is)
One (only life to give)
So I gonna do what I gotta do so I can be counted
Just one (gave up His life for you and me)
And then one (sacrifice to make us free)
So no matter what you heard
When it’s all said and done, there’s only one
