Why does this man
Defy the storm and burn us all
Each time his hand waves
The sun it sets on lonely graves
Haven't we read this page before
We're gonna lose the war
Put down the glory flag
Nothing will be the same

This is the world he wants
Pray for the brave and the young
It won't bring them back again
