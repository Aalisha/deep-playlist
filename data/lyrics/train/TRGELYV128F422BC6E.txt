Tell me about the place you're from
Tell me about the things you've done
Tell me what you really need
Tell me what just makes you bleed
â€˜Cause sometimes I can't be myself
I can't feel inside what people say
So I just close my ears, my eyes
And I feel like shutting my mouth
But I saw you were in need of help
That is when my heart just melts
When I see sorrow in your eyes
There's nowhere you can hide the lies

I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
