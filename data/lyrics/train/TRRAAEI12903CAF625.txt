Tonight we lie awake
Remember how the coffee made us shake
On those long drives?
One more long night

Another seven days
Heartbeat racing the interstate, my home tonight
For one more long night
I'm sure as hell the happiest I've ever been

We can't hide, we let go
We've got more than we know
My friends are a different breed
My friends are

There's a ghost in this room
I think I'll name it after all of you
And watch it hang over my bed like decorations
Celebrated memories that came and went
In light of all that time we spent
Listening to everything our parents told us not to take in
...
