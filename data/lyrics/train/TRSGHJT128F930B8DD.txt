Oh spiritus, oh sanctus
Adoramus domine
Te deum laudamus
memoriam, gloriam, gloriam

Warriors, immortal knights
We walk our way alone
Eternally, we're born to write
The sign of victory
Warriors, immortal knights
So far away from home
Eternally, we're born to fight
Forever riding free

And the day has come
Time to die
Somewhere far beyond
On the stairway to the sky
On the rainbow soaring high
We are born from the sun
...
