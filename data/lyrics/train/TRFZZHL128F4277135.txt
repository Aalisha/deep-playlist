Battle follows battle
To the death to take the hill
Blackened leather warriors
The chill as steel meets steel
One survives by cunning
The other lives by might
The death defying warlords
By the firelight they fight

With the power of steel
They're raiding our land
They're marching from hell
With the devil as chief
In command!
