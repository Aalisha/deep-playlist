Jumping music, slick deejays, fog machines and laser rays

Chorus:
Lookout weekend cause, here I come
Because weekends were, made for fun
Repeat (1x)

I work hard, everyday, its all work and no play
With the boss on my back, he don't give me any slack

Chorus (1x)

By the time wednesday comes, I feel the beat and I wanna have fun
