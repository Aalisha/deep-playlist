I bet you think we dont't know
how to be a part of this game
we don't wanna talk about
the reason what is true
We are not the saint
I bet you think what we have
is like a picture in the frame
Baby don't worry and remember
why people know our name

Refrain:
Try to figure out is it real is it show
I don't wanna hear this nasty stuff
cause you don't know the things I know
don't ask me what it's all about
you've gotta understand
we do the things
we wanna do we've chosen to exturnly
as real as we can
it's something about us
straight from the heart
we belong together
right from the start
destiny told us
there is no doubt
respect - is what it's all about
...
