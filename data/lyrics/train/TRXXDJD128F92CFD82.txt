You say that you love me.
You tell me you care.
You promised me love til eternity, a future to share.
But I've had my doubts boy., more than a few.
The games that you played in the past
All catching up with you

Now I'm paying the price
For the things I didn't do
It's taken some time I was out of my mind,
Now I finally figured it out.

My problem is you
So in love with you
My problem is you
So in love with you
