Is that a guitar or a machine gun?
Don't make me take it away.
You know I think you are a bad one.
I can tell by your face.
G-G-G-Get down on the ground now.
Don't make me do this the hard way.
You're just a shadow in the back seat now, 
As they drive you away.

And couldn't you see
This is no place to be
At the wrong time.
You know you're not the only one here
Looking for some at the wrong time.
And just that look in your eyes
You're just not quite uptight
Enough for our town.
And now don't try to fight
Because we know that we're right.
In our town.
Our town.

And it's just you behind the bars now
Staring into space.
