And this I know his teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her every day into a shady place
With her lips she said

She said, "Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball
Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul
Let's have a ball"

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
...
