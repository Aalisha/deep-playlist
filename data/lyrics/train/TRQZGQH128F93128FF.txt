Mmm... mmm...

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
Rising desire
Felt it from the start

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
Rising desire
Tears my life apart

Why do I feel this way
About you in my life
You weren't here for me
When I asked to have you near
Now things have turned around
You want to be with me
I'm tried to fight your love
But it so agrees with me

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
Rising desire
Felt it from the start

How can it be your eyes
So deep inside of me
Strange magnetism
In your personality

It's getting scary how
Your presence shakes my life
I lose all self-control
When I'm with you through the night
