Head

There was a lonely boy or should I say
He was seventeen ? You went away
There was a long lost song or should I say
It was almost May, I loved a long long way.

Where has he gone from here ?
What should I do or try to say ?
There is a way unless
Where has love gone from here ?
How can I try and find a way, way ?
