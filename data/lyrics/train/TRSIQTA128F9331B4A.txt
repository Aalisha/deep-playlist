[chorus:]

[Come on we can do whatever you want
I don't mind do whatever you want
It's alright do whatever you want
I'm not gonna say no not tonight
Come on we can do whatever you want
I don't mind do whatever you want
It's alright do whatever you want
I'm not gonna say no not tonight]

[verse 1:]
No please say yes cause I need to feel you next to me
I need your lovin I'm not gonna say no not tonight tonight
It's not the night that I'm gonna run from you
My body needs your attention you're not gonna hear no not tonight
What I feel is takin over
I lost myself I'm through
Can't control what I'm feeling been runnin but I run back to you
Your eyes is like a mirror
