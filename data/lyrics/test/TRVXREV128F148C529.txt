two years and extra days, a block away he'd head to hang
same corner, neighborhood, his friends, the gang
two years and extra days, a bigger kid would crack his eye

no one spoke, no one moved, no one made a sound
both his eyes would twitch
the left one was always black
his lips they never moved
they stayed still with each attack
