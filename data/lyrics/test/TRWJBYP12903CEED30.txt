Fam, you know what I'm sayin'? No doubt man
The motherfuckin' shit just get me so motherfuckin' mad 'cause
You know, that was my nigga, you know, and like
I had just got the nigga Puff card and shit

I knew the shit was 'bout to go down
And my man was like hypin' me 'bout everywhere we go, me and O
Pluggin' it, me and O be together
And the nigga be like "Watch, I'm tellin' you when my man get on"

"It's gonna be some shit, we ain't gonna have to sell this shit
No mo', I'm tellin' you"
And the nigga just got moked out like that man
That shit fucked me up man

That shit fucked a whole lot of niggaz up man
Yo man, I loved that nigga O too, say word
That was my motherfuckin' heart

Yeah, dedicatin' this to my nigga O, we miss you nigga
Goin out to all the niggas that died in the struggle
Word up, shit is real in the field
You know, sparkin' blunts to all you niggaz
Word up

Each and every day, the daydreams of how we used to be
See your family and that baby's lookin' just like you
Why'd you go away, I've been missin' you lately
Tell me what you're goin' through, oh yeah

I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fish scale, rained on competition like a shower
