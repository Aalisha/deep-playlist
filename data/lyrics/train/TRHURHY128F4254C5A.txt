Yea man
Mi nuh know nuttin else but music yuh nuh
Dat a my talent
Mason man know him job and carpenter man know him job
Physician must know his

Ooooh na, yeeea yea yea
Long time Rastaman a gwaan

[Chorus:]
Any where you want it
I'll be giving it to you
Because Jah command this

You betta obtain this
Music is for me and yooouu
Inna yuh brains sustain this
These words I'm saying are truee ya
