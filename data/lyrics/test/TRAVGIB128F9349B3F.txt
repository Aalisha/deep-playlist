Why do I do the things I do?
Sometimes I feel like I am so insecure.
If I could learn a thing or two from you,
then popular opinion I could ignore.

You are enough for me, I don't need anything but you. Ya.
You are enough for me, and I don't need anything,

CHOURUS
Cuz' you have given me more than I could ask for,
more than I could ever imagine.
And you keep givin' me love,
you keep on liftin' me up,
it doesn't get any better.

Why do I do the things I do?
Lord, everyday is showing me something new.
I need to slow down, need to learn from you.
Cuz' you're the only one I should listen to.
