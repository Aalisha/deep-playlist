You're comin' tonight
To my home town
I've been to yours many times before
And it's always been a thrill

You'll stay in a hotel or at friends near by
We haven't spent the night together in this town
Since nineteen seventy nine
Not such a long time

I could steal a melody
Of this I am allowed
'Cause you would never sue me, baby
It wouldn't look good, it'd be weird
...
