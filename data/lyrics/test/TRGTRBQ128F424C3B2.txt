Into the fire again
I'll light it up
Deadly with venom and sin
Your time is up
I'll poison your mind
You'll poison yourself
With things you can't find
No, you can't find
I can't see frustration
Within me and

You're on your knees again
And so are you
Want to escape my hand
I'll take you down
I rule your every move
no, I rule you
You're tempted by groove
Aand you by sound
I really need this

Pushing the sticks
Right into myself
I've got no way
To control this
I need the pain
More than anything
I need to feel I'm alive

Pushing the sticks
Right into myself
I've got no way
To control this
I need the pain
...
