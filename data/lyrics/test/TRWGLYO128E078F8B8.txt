Yo man I don't think they heard you
why don't you tell 'em what ya name is.

My name is Eazy yeah this is true
keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
hardcore yo I could never be soft
askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
and if you didnt hear me boy I'll tell you again
my name is Eazy or just call me E
but It doesn't really matter to me
cause I'm the same person
whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
this is for the radio so I better chill
they won't play it if I co get ill
but I'm like that and thats an actually fact
because the street is where my heart is at
yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
but I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
if the rhyme I'm dispayin'
and the beat thats playin'
yo you could try all day
and you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W.
cause Eazy's doin it Compton style
thats the city and you say you could get some
yo it's Eazy-er Said Than Dunn.

Wooooooo!
