Our love dies tonight
Come on and take your best shot
You've already hit me with your worst
My heart is broken, my mind is weak
Come on and kick me while I'm down
We will both collide bid your farewell
I've been through your hell
I've come this far
Take your best shot
Their eyes were watching God
And he was watching back
...
