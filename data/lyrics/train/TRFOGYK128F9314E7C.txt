"Start tha movie."

"I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me
insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye. Yes, it was this. One
of his eyes resembled that of a vulture. A pale, blue eye with a film over it.
Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold. And so, by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man and thus rid myself of the eye forever."

So I'm headed door to door
With my grandmother's cookie jar.
I'm sellin' cookies, 12 for a dollar.
I ring the doorbell, nobody wants any.
I resort to goin' cheaper - 2 for a penny.
Anybody, everybody, they hate me.
I can tell when they spit and degrade me.
There's only one house left, the last on the block.
Old Man Willie on the hilltop.
I ring the doorbel, the door creeps open.
And there it was starin' and scopin'.
The man's left eye, red, big, and drippin'
I was trippin'. "Ahh, seeya!"
I ran home. I couldn't stop thinking
About his eyeball winking and blinking.
And it looked not a damn thing like the other. Ugh!
Shoulda wore a patch on the motherfucker.
It hypnotized me, mesmorized me.
Traumatized, paralyzed, terrorized me.
Creepers, where'd you get that ball?
And tell me how it even fits in your skull.
