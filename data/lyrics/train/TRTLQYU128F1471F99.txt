You want the beating of another man's heart
You want that face to tear us apart, oh baby
You want that love to take you high in the sky
I watch you fly with tears in my eyes
now this is the end, this is really the goodbye
Break another heart, find another foolTake another heart, run and treat it cruel
Go break another heart into pieces, baby baby
Well, I don't want to know and I don't want to stay
Go cry to someone else, I will walk away
