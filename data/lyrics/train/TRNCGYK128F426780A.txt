(Robert Ellis Orrall)

Hey baby doll, hey sweet potato
I love you now and I love you later
I'm gonna love you for your whole life through
Hey jelly bean, hey belly button
You ain't gonna have to worry ‘bout nothin'
I'll be there to take good care of you
Hey there honey, you're so funny
You're gonna help me spend my money
We're gonna travel ‘round the whole wide world
Hey sugar bug, you're driving me crazy
I can't believe what God gave me
Everyone's gonna know your my little girl
