They say time waits for no man
And neither does this woman
I've been trying hard to understand
Would it be?

Many moons have come and gone
And this little heart's still holding on
To what could be, maybe should be, baby
Crazy is all it's making me

I've been holding on for way too long
It can't go on

You've got 4 and 20 hours
Just one day to prove to me
That your love has got the power
Make me believe

You'll take me where I wanna be
4 and 20 hours
And that's me, hmm, baby
That's me, yes

They say Rome wasn't built in a day
But, hey, they've got nothing
On the patience
That it's taking me to wait
