Melvin Harold And The Blue Notes
Miscellaneous

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me like I understand you
Now baby I know the difference between right and wrong

I ain't gonna do nothing to upset our happy home
Oh don't get so excited
