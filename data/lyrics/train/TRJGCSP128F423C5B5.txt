A cry for help, a hint of anaesthesia
The sound from broken homes, we used to always meet here
As he lays asleep, she takes him in her arms
Some things I have to do, but I don't mean you harm

A worried parent's glance, a kiss, a last goodbye
Hands him the bag she packed, the tears she tries to hide
A cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy
And leaves him standing cold here in this colony

I can't see why all these confrontations
...
