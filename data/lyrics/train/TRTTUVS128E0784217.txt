You gotta keep on making me high
You gotta keep on making me high
You gotta keep on making me high
You gotta keep on making me high

If you're feeling sad and blue
Come on and dance with me
I can make your dreams come true
Come on and dance with me

Ladies, get up off your seats
Come on and dance with me
Gentlemen, get on your feet
Come on and dance with me

Say the word and I'll
Summon the band with my hand
Let your minds and
Your bodies be free
Dance with me
