I see a man with a flag
And he leads the procession
And a woman shedding tears
For a man locked in prison
Yeah...
Then the two locked eyes
And for a moment I was taken
And all paths lead
To a single conclusion
Yeah...

Everything is good for you
If it doesn't kill you
Everything is good for you
One man's ending
...
