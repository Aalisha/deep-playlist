Chasing your shadow
Senses together
Four-leafed and clever
I come from behind
Chasing your shadow
I wander in circles
You're one in a million
We're two of a kind
It's you that I long for
It's you that I hunger
Oh, you are the maker
Of waves in my mind
We dance in the moonlight
A run on the wire
Drawing a fine line
A never ending love
The fever turns slowly
Into a fire
Drawing a fine line
A never ending love
Chasing your shadow
Moon and the water
Field and the reaper
Star and the sky
