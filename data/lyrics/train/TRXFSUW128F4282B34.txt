All the hate I've grown for you
Since it all came down
Hold still and sleep for now
Bite the pillow

All we shared was dirty tricks
And the urge to play
You know, deceiving leads to a bitter end
All we cared was how to hurt
And make things dead
(It's all coming clear now)
You wanted to have it all

Praise the love
Your broken smothered heart charity
You know!
From now on we are enemies!
I tried to search
A place for some sympathy
...
