Where no one hears your distant cries
Where you end up, there you stand
Your life has passed before my eyes
A crime of passion once again

I curse my fate, but know too late
I will leave by night and leave by day
I pledge my heart to serve the truth and reinvent my life
I am the echo of your past but leave no trace behind
