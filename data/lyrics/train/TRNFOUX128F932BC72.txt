Here comes the train
Pained and wailing
Eye focused on you warily
But still unblinking
Is this the one I'm supposed to bring
For this next journey
Endless and complex
Injuries you'll never be prepared to dress
A hundred stops you'll sleep away
Then wake to wish you hadn't and
You take your time packing light
I never could comprehend
How it took you hours to finally end
Up with a list of twenty forgotten things
To the naive eye not the headlight
You might appear to actually care for something
But you're not guarding this life with your own,
Just risking mine
What a fucking waste
This time

Remember when I said you were bound to make another mistake
