I'm 'bout to jump in! Splash!

[Chorus:]
I want to take a dip, dip inside your love
Underwater love, never comin' up
I want to take a dip, dip inside your love
Underwater love, never comin' up

[Verse 1:]
I just went down
And never comin' up
I don't need air ba-a-by
Stay here between you ba-a-by
Got my things that I'm gon' need
'Cause I'm gonna stay off in you indeed
'Cause that's just me ba-a-by
