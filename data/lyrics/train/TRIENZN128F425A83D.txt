Boy, you are on my skin
You have melted in
You are on my skin

Boy, you are on my mind
I am wastin' time
You are on my mind

If you see me passin'
Please don't look me in the eye
I don't deserve this situation
'Cause I'm barely get envy
I need to know
Will you take me back where I belong

Well I don't know how many hours
I've been staring at the phone
I don't deserve this kind of treatment
'Cause I'm barely holdin' on
...
