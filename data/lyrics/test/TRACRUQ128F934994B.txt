I worked all day long out in the cold and snow
I come home lookin' for my supper
You're around some whiskey store

You're just a whiskey drinkin' woman
We never will get very far
Because every time I wanna find you
I just go around some whiskey bar

I leave house written grocery bill
At home every week and every Monday mornin'
The landlord puts my clothes out in the street
