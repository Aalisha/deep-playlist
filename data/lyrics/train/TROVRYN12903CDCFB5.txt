Transmission radio, radio...
respond if your alive.
Give me a sign of life.
I need to say to you...
I've found a way to fight.
One hope for all mankind.

We're gonna take control.
Dancing is your weapon.
Let the moves unfold.
Kill 'em with your steppin'
We can win this war.
Its time to come together
Now we're stronger then we were before.

They're trying to take our lives.
But we will survive.
