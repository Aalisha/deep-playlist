Don’t move off your position
Rasta man don’t move
Show them
Like how the system dread
We coming dreader
We flashing dreader than dread Rasta
Don’t move binghi man
Rasta man don’t move
Show them
Like how the system dread
We coming dreader
We flashing dreader than dread Rasta

We are the lions
We coming dread
Dread in our walk
Natty dread ina we head
Dread out of Judah
Straight down to zed
Addis Ababa
Crown the king

We are the lions
We coming dread
Dread in our walk
Natty dread ina we head
Dread out of Judah
Straight down to zed
Addis Ababa
Crown the king

Gather my flock
Send I the rude boys
We will educate their time
Black am I
Rasta neva call you fe linger
Teach tem to read the road sign
Rasta

We are the lions
