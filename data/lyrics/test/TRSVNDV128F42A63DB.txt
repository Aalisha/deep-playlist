I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be

Waiting patiently for so long
I knew the dream I had was not wrong
Every night and every day
Wishin' the same!
Thinkin' how one day you'd be mine
Hear you scream my name so devine!
The time's arrived, the time is now
We're gonna play the night away!

I wanna be:
the one you say to: ti amo!
the you dance to forever
the one to take you all over
the one to make you dance!
I wanna be:
the one you ask: don't let me go?!
the one to make you go loco!
the one you shake and do more for...
the one to make you dance!

I wanna be, yeah yeah,
I wanna be the one, for you baby

Now I'm here there's no letting go
It's up to live the life that I chose
I'm ready for, the bad the good
...
