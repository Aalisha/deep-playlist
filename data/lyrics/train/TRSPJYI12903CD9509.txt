I touch your skin and warm my finger tips
Feel something burning when I touch your lips
I'm gonna make at least a million trips
Back to youuuu
Oooooooh

You brighten my world if it's rain or shine
You touched my life and got it back in line
Sometimes I can't believe you're really mine
I love you

Because you're everything a woman ought to be
Sweet and kind and pure of mind
And beautiful to see
Yes, you're everything that I could ever need
You are everything to me
