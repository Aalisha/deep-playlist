Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You know that I love you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You know that I love you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
More than anything

We've been living in here, two years
You've been wearing this ring, one year
Times good, times bad
You said I'm down for whatever
Say down for whatever, say
Telling me that you've changed your mind
Said that I ain't been giving you time
Hustlin' morning till night, all the time
I know what you're feeling but you can't say

1 - You can't say
That I'm not there
You can't say
That I don't care
