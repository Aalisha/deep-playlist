I wake up in the afternoon
Empty walls make up the room
And I'm wishing for one thing
To give myself the strength to keep myself alive
Long enough to make sure you don't try
To turn out anything like me
Another fraud, another fake
Don't pretend you're not the one who's wrong

You're keeping me sane when I'm feeling alone
I wield my heart and my flesh and bones
Don't leave me to die by myself
I can't live without you

Saw my treatment through the blinds
Calling me from these confines
There's only so many more days
...
