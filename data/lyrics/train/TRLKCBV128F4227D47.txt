Never know but nothing less
Couldn't see that I have guessed
Couldn't see, couldn't stay away
I never even stopped to dream and
That Id see anything and
The world is coming out so cold

Oh, and it's raining again
Loud on your car like, bullets on tin
Oh, and its raining again
Open the door and pulling me in

Nothing here but nothing less
Cold heart is stuck in this
Couldn't say the kindest words we knew
Everything I tried to say but
No one listens anyway
I had to give up everything that I knew

Oh, and it's raining again
Loud on your car like, bullets on tin
Oh, and its raining again
...
