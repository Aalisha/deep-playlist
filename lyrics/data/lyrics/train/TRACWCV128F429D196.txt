The city lights, the pretty lights
They can warm the coldest nights
All the people going places
Smiling with electric faces
What they find the glow erases
And what they loose, the glow replaces

And life is love
In a neon rainbow
A neon rainbow

Moving lines, flashing signs
Blinking faster than the minds
...
