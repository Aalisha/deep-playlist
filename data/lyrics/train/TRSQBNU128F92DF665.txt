I see you've got another bad line
You're playing rhythm and it's out of time
You're holding tickets to your one man show
But I can tell you something you don't know

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Get back, back to the track, get back, back to the track
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

You do what you want and you play what you want
But it's shit what you do and it sucks what you play
It's professional suicide, professional suicide
Saving all you've got for a rainy day

You do what you want and you play what you want
But it's shit what you do and it sucks what you play
It's professional suicide, professional suicide
