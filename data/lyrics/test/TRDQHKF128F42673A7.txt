I know that you've been thinking
I see it in your eyes
You're holding on to something
But still you don't know why

So walk by faith and not by what you see
Trust your heart and let yourself believe

I can do things, things you never knew
Change your world, make it all brand new
I can do miracles, if you want me to
Anything is possible for you

Anything, anything, anything, anything is possible
Anything, anything, anything, anything is possible

I know your heart's been broken
You feel so all alone
