Little lady
oh little lady you're dancing me off my feet
Little lady
oh can't you feel the heat when you hold me

Oh when you hold me it feels like I'm going insane

Little lady can't get you out of my brain.

You fill me up with desire
you take me higher and higher
You kisses burn me like fire
fire
fire
