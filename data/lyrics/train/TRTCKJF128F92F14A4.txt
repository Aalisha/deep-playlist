Woke up in a strangers house
Through a shivering sleep on a tattered couch
Sifting through my laundry an evangelist was pointing at me
Through a flashing tv screen

That something left on from the night before
Beer bottles and records strewn all over the floor
Rubbing my eyes to the dawn
Where will I find the strength to carry on?
I don't know what to believe

Ponder the last few years on dilapidated steps
That never seems to lead to anything-lead to anything at all
