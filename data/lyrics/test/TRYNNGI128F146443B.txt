It's gonna be all right
All right, all right
It's gonna be all right

The day you came my way
I knew I would stay
Close by your side
To keep you satisfied

It's gonna be all right
All right, all right
It's gonna be all right

When you look at me
In your eyes, I can see
The love that grows each day
That's why I've gotta say

It's gonna be all right
