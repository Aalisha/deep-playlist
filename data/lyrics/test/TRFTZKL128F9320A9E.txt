Smoke fills the sky in the blink of an eye,
Staring from the streets below
I witness thousands die
In this moment, I see this world for what it is

You, you don't know pain, allow me to introduce you
In fact I'll fuel this fire, watch it burn
I'd like to see your God try and save you now
Save us now
