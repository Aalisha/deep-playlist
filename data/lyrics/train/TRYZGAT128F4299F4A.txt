I pack my bag, put it on my shoulders
Take my scarf, and kiss my mother
It's still dark outside
It's so early, I rub my eyes
I say Hi to the baker, I say Hi
I meet my friends at the corner of the street
And we talk and we laugh like every morning

On Monday, on Tuesday, On Wednesday too
I'll always remember you
...
