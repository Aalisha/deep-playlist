We've got to get ourselves together
Take some time and talk it over
We've got to get ourselves together
Try to understand each other
The time has come it's now or never
We cannot wait until it's gone

Maybe it seems like everything's gone wrong
Misunderstandings are the "who's right, who's wrong"
I don't know who can stand it
