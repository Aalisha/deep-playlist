If you've got the money, I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
We'll make all the night spots, dance, drink beer and wine
If you've got the money, honey, I've got the time

There ain't no use to tarry, so let's start out tonight
We'll spread joy, oh boy, oh boy, and we'll spread it right
We'll have more fun, baby, all the way down the line
...
