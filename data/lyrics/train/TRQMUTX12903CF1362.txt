(m. anthony/k. fowley)

Clean rock n roll
Makes the midnight flow tonight now
It's hot tonight
Come on let's have a good time
In the dark of the night
We hunt for fun
Chasing after the moonlight
Hiding from the sun

American nights
You kids are so strange
American nights
You're never gonna change
...
