I know of a heaven...
and damn sure...
I know of a Hell...
if you could take a look into this fighter's mind...
the things you'd see.

What would you think?
How would you feel?
If you could really know me... mmm...

Can you see this Hell I feel inside?
A tragedy in a human mind.
Aaaaaaargh! That's what I am!

So turn away, turn away and go.
