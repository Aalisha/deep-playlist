2075
The Freeways were still alive
See the People for Miles and Miles
2075
We were searching for a place to hide
easy rider meets the end of time
you were young and i was wild
2075
and they blew down the buildings
and we stood in lines for bread
just like Mother Russia back when she was still Red

and they said
Ding Dong The Witch is Dead
from the shores of Nantucket to Los Angeles
she was swallowed up in petty greed
...
