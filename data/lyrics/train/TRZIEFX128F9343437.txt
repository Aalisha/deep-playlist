Always be momma's baby, always be daddy's girl
Right now she's makin' 'em crazy
Little Red Robin' Hood, big bad world

She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
She ain't missin' not a minutes of fun
She ain't worried 'bout one day older
Pretty little rebel on the run
She ain't trying to be hard to handle
She gonna do what a girl gonna do
She ain't waitin' on twenty-one candles
Sure ain't gonna wait on you

Can't be innocent forever, ain't never done anything
She'll tell you no but she don't mean never
...
