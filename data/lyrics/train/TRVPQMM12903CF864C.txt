You got me pushing imaginary buttons
Step away from me lover, away from me lover
You got me counting imaginary school children
Get away from me lover, away from me lover
Yes I can see that your carpet is animated
Walk away from me lover, away from me lover
Yes I see open wounds in everyone I've dated
Away from me lover, get away from me lover

I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
