I shiver like a child
I see my life pass before my eyes
I'm crying blood
I shout out loud
I'm just a man among the crowd

I'll cut my hair, I'll find a job
I'll do anything to conceal my scrubs
But I can't believe it, it isn't me
I don't know who I'm trying to be

Turn 27, Rock 'n' roll heaven
24-7, Rock 'n' roll heaven
