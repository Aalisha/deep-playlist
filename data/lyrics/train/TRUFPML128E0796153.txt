I'll take you at your word
and as far as I can throw you
leave you with the baby
and I hardly even know you
it's gut check time for daddy
when it's loaded and unlocked
got to go in to press some skin
and leave it gleaming in the dock
would you watch her for me sir?
I'll have to take you at your word...


I read up on the stallions
marked an X inside the box
I just want the strong one
not the one who counts and talks
...
