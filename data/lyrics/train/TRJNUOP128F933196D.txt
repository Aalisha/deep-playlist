Nothin' like tomorrow

Vapor kiss memory of such longing
Whispered dream gone before the morning

Time is such a funny thing
It pulls you on like silly string
Oh, the pain and sorrow

Never thought the haunting of
Is such a temporary love
Could make me beg and borrow

Nothin' like tomorrow
Nothin' like tomorrow, yeah
