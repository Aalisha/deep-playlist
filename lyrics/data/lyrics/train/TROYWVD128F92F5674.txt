The oxtam ad makes you feel bad
You put a few coppers into the slot
Pretending that it's all that you've got

Hungry conscience
Charity, hilarity
Starving millions
Prevention, cure
A few pence shed and both are fed
A few pence shed and both are fed

The money we donate to charity
Is too small to be of real consequence
