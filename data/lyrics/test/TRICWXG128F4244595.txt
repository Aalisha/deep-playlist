You've been drafted with a grey flannel tie
another uniform to cover your life
So uniform and things stay the same
In your uniform when things
when things stay the same
In your suit
In your suit
In your suit
In your suit

You've been caught with your
hands in the pie
Identify your interests and where
your hate lies
