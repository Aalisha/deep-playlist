My baby
Sexy Cinderella
Its almost midnight
And I've been dieing to kiss you under the moonlight
Sexy Cinderella
Theres no need to run away
Girl I'm begging you please wont you stay

I've only just met ya
Feels though I've known you for a life time
Tell me do you feel like I do
I really wanna get ya
You came along at just tha right time
I get a blue sensation with you

Sexy Cinderella
Its almost midnight
And I've been dieing to kiss you under the moonlight
