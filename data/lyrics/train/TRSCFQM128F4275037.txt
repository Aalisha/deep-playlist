She walks forward over, over and backward
Forward over and over and backward
This meeting takes on a life of its own and my position is

Thoughtless and it goes
Forward and over and over and back
Thoughtless and it goes

Caught left hand right away
And laughing, heard her want to say
She swore she'd rather stay

Livid I am, on top of the world
And my position is
Livid I am, on top of the world
...
