Hey Chico 
Can you feel it 
Ah yeah ah ah oh 
Hey Chico 
Ooooh 
Aah na na na 

The rhythm makes you wanna dance 
Wanna dance, wanna dance 
The rhythm makes you wanna dance 
Wanna dance, wanna dance 

Can you feel the rhythm 
Can feel the rhythm 

There is no fancy house of music 
You can't escape you have to move 
We don't stand still we just imagine 
This mystic house this perfect groove 
Turn around (Turn around)
