My life's scars run so deep
Deep as in before birth
Some things just won't ever change
Feed myself some more pain

Bad memories of childhood
Corrupting innocence
Not teaching me, misleading me
Leaving me on my own

Why questioning? No answering
This shit's just so fucked up
Ignoring my own personal
Self characteristics

Why no one was there to look after me
Torn in between myself
Lost everything taken away from me
Words they can't hear, deaf to hear

Born out of somebody's audacity
Not given a fair chance
Lies spoken in words that I do not know
Pain teaching me suffering

I can't ignore my feelings
My own hostility
Wearing my hate on my face
Look into my eyes
