Cold night, New York,
Air hangs like death,
Last train to Brooklyn
Pulls in out of breath
King of the blade Holds court in the aisle,
His young face beams danger--Menace with a smile
But if he touches me,
I'll blow away his confidence--He'll wish he's let me be...

I'm Judge and Jury--Executioner
He'll pay the price,
But justice won't come easily
...
