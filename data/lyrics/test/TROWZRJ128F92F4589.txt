Only through the teeth of life
I see my ancient figure
My hands are strong
My eyes are endless

Oh, and my mind is the open ocean
That swells and broils with wild invention

In my great sun
Without boundaries
My love's a giant welt
My heart is burning

Oh, through the teeth of life
A brilliant flame in a dark time
...
