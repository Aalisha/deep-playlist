Armed with a arrow you're pointing it straight at my heart,
Watching me break as I try to find my way out of the dark,
They say each moment comes to an end
So my pain is its consequence,
It's a battle and I have no defence.

Sure as you said that you loved me you turned me away,
Suddenly everything changed right in front of my face,
They say sometimes loves just unfair
