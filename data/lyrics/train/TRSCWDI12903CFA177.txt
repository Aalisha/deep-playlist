Magic lady of the Snake Cult stands, high on the Voodoo Mountain
Society does the Congo Dance, to the Serpent Queen's chanting
Baby - Feel the demons burning
Hypnotized Hostile World. To her presence is falling!

Flame on - Soul Possession and Sacrifice
Voodoo Fire's setting your world alight

Voodoo Fire
