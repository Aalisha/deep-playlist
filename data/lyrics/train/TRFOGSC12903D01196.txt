This is a call a call to all
It goes out to those who've been there
And I should know because I've been
Maybe once a week on Mondays

You should have seen what I've seen
She doubles up and comes back Sundays
And she will come into your heart
It goes on and on and on

Here it comes
Here comes my days in the sun
Here it comes
...
