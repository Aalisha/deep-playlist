Well my world used to be sunny
And jokes used to be funny
But now you're gone and everything's turned around

Well my world used to be warm
And there never was a storm
But now you're gone and everything's turned upside down

And now it's cold outside (it's cold outside), and the rain is pouring down
And the leaves are turning brown
Can't you see
That now it's cold outside (it's cold outside), and it's all because of you
...
