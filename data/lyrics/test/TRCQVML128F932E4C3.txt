What are you doing? How did we get here?
What is this feeling tell me it's mine
Where did you take me? I want to stay here
What I been missing all of this time

And as I whisper in your ear
Somethin is changing and I'm unclear
Touchin' and kissin', my body feels different
I've lost my senses

When you find the right spot take control
And you lock on me and you won't let go
I wasn't ready for all that you had in store
Baby, I want more and more and more
I don't know

What have you got in you, makes me emotional
What is it you do to bring me in tears
'Cause I'm cryin', you got me in tears
Boy, you make feel so warm

I can't describe this mood, I feel so vulnerable
What is it that you do to bring me to tears
Got me cryin', you got me in tears
You got me in tears
