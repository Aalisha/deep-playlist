I was born in the Hollywood part of town
School teacher sure knew how to bring me down
While the clean-cut kids washed away their sorrows
with beer
Well I knew I wouldn't find no miracles here
It's a bad town for rock 'n' roll

If you got a car and if you got the gas
Brother don't you wait any longer
I know how to stear the wheel and how to close a deal
Right now I need something stronger

Don't see me using the fast lane
I don't travel by high speed
I'm trying to get away
Before I stay the same
Don't wanna stay the same

Take the road as it comes 'cause it comes so slow
Take all of the love you have abandoned
Time makes your goods look damaged, look upon it as an
advantage
