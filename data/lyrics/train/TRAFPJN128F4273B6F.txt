My love
I'll never find the words, my love
To tell you how I feel, my love
Mere words could not explain

Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin

This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
