I can't stop the moon from rising
And the sun will set exactly where it should
I can't stop the rivers from running
God only knows I'd stop you if I could

From not seeing me how you used to
From walking out the door
I can't stop you from not loving me anymore

I can do nothing if your mind's made up
No matter how I feel it's not enough for the both of us
So don't lie to me cause there's no need
I have fooled myself for too long
Cause you're still here but you're already gone
...
