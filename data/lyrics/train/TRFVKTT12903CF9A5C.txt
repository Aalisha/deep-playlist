We used to live in a better world
Where sky and water were free
We point the finger, we point the gun, yeah
Is that the way it should be?

We rape the land and we tear the skin
Burn the blood in the stone
To fuel the fire of the selfish mind
Do you want to live here alone? Come on

Lay down your arms, surrender
You know you'll never get out of here
Lay down your arms, remember
No force, you'd better lay down your arms, ooh
