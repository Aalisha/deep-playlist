There's a brand new car in your driveway
And a blonde new girl in your bed
You've everything you ever wished for
Happy little bubblehead
And you can't fill it up with promises
You can't fill it up with lies
And you can't fill it up with business lunches
Oh but you can try
Who am I to criticise you?
Just a girl that you despise
Welcome to designer living
