Whatsoever I've feared has come to life
Whatsoever I've fought off became my life
Just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded and now I'm doing time
Now I'm doing time

'Cause I've fell on black days
I've fell on black days (black days)

Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
Whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
searchlight so they say, but I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking when I get it right
When I get it right
