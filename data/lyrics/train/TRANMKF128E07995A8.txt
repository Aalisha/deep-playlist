It's there in the eyes of the children
In the faces smiling in the windows
You can come on out, come on open the doors
Brush away the tears of freedom

Now we're here, there's no turning back
We have each other
We have one voice

Hand in hand we will lay the tracks
Because the train is coming to carry you home

Come dance with me
Come on and dance into the light
Everybody dance into the light

There'll be no more hiding in the shadows of fear
...
