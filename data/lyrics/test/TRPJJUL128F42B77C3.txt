I'm addicted to electric pulses,
I'm addicted to electric pulses, 
How? Let's see.
All decisions cutting of our voices,
All decisions running out by voices, Now, for me.

Oh, i'm incapable, i live for habit
Oh, i'm incapable, i live for habit
Just me.

Life's accountable if i don't grab it
Oh, life's accountable if i don't grab it
But, you'll see.

Aren''t you sick of being automatic?
Don't you wanna have it your way, always?
Aren't you sick of being automatic?
Somethings wrong with me,
I've gotta pull it out 

I'm changing, 
Turning corners,
This town aint big enough for me
I pushing all the problems
I'm stepping to the n'th degree
