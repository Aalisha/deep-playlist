Accepted, highly favored of the Lord
Forgiven by Your love I am transformed
It's not what I'll do but what You've done for me
And by Your grace oh God I stand with my head held high

I receive Your love, I receive Your love for me
I receive Your love, I know I am accepted, oh

Established, ever blameless in Your Son
Forever I am chosen to be loved
