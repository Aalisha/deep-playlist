I can't sleep a wink anymore
Ever since you first walked out the door
Then I just started drinking to forget
But I don't think the worst has happened yet

All you ever do is bring me down
Making me a fool all over town
And they all wonder why I wear a frown
That's 'cause honey all you do is bring me down
...
