I think you're full of bullshit
When you say that I bring you down
Wont you just admit it
Yeah, you like having me around

You're taking off?
It's the last time I open my doors to you

So open your eyes
You'll see your pride
Steers you in the wrong direction
Your too young 
To lose your fun
By trying to be Ms. Perfection

Tell me things are different
And you don't think it would be right
