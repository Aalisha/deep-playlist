I'd like to say it's good to see you,
An old face from the past
Reminding me of moments,
The times we were all mad
Times we stuck together
And times we fell apart
Memories to be proud of -
I treasure here in my heart, yeah

(Bridge:)
And now I see you,
(See you - you)
I've realized how we have changed
How much I've missed you
Our mem'ries of the past -
Stay the same

(Chorus 01:)
