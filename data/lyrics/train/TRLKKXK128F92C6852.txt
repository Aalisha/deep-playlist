I can hear the cries of the dead
Maybe it's your neighbour beating his dog in the basement
I can hear the cries of the dead
Muffled by the ground but still loud enough to make it out

Monkey-webs of concrete road disappear in time
Weeds and trees that grow from seed will cover us in time
Swallowing all of the buildings
And every single piece of trash
...
