I know there's things you never thought before
That have to do with walkin' out old doors
You've been prepared as long as time allowed.

Well I don't know how but you're a big boy now
Come on and take a bow 'cause you're a big boy now.

You know the girls are taking notice of you
They say your hair is getting curly too
