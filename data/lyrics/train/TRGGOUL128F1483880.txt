LATE AT NIGHT - MAYWOOD

Intro
Between eight and half past seven this place is awful quiet.
Have to do my shopping, take care of my diet.
I run around in circles, never see a soul.

1. Refrain
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can see, see them all.
Late at night, early in the morning light, you can feel, feel them all.
