We have roamed the plains a millon years
Gathered at the shore
When we had run out of all fears

We have come from everywhere
Crumbling worlds behind
Reason is what we're gonna give
To be given peace of mind

Crimson is the pavement
Blood is dripping from our dreams
The sound of smashing yesterdays
We dance in ecstasy

Oh craving devour me, take me away
Oh to infinity, take me away

Take me away
Oh yeah take me away
Far away

Don't turn your face to the night sky
Said the fainthearted one
You may see through the charades
An instant that won't come undone

I can feel the ease of my pain
Decline the blood reason level
Gazing in awe bystanders scream
Mentally critical fettle

We're sailing on gentle waves
We read the sky

Stargazers, stargazers
Behold the key
Stargazers, stargazers
Infinity
Reason left behind

Where are you detecting the wrongs
Spirit that always denies
I've gone insane
Release me from waiting
For the sparkle to rise

I can see they're nailed to the cross
Cannot live till they're gone
Immortal they cry on terrestrial embers
...
