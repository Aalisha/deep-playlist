RALPH:
I've been away for much too long
I hope you still feel I belong
I didn't mean to cause you pain
Nothin' to lose, much more to gain
So can you stand the rain?
BOBBY:
Just when I thought that we were through
I found my way right back to you
I can't change what happened in the past
And won't promise this time it would last
Can you stand the rain?
(Can you stand the rain?)
CHORUS:
So on the story goes
Heaven only knows
