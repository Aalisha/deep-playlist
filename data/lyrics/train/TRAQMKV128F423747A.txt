I grew up in a town where tough was a cigarette
And a souped up car on a county road
Nothin' much to do back then
So we'd make bets
On how much drink a guy could hold
And I held my own
Learn to hold my own

Daddy works some dead-end job at the concrete plant
Mama taught the Sunday bible class
For eighteen years I remember thinkin'
There was more to life than that
So I ran the streets to beat the Devil
Goin' just as fast as I could fly
'Cause I came here to live
