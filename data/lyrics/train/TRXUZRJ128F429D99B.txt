Looking like a Born Again, living like a heretic
Listening to Arthur Lee records
Making all your friends feel so guilty about their cynicism
And the rest of their generation
Not even the government are gonna stop you now

But are you ready to be heartbroken?
Are you ready to be heartbroken?

Pumped up full of vitamins
On account of all the seriousness
