Strugglin so hard everday to stay alive
strugglin so hard as i work my 9 to 5
boss is talking shit and he's getting on my back
but he don't realize that i'm ready to attack
pressure gettin to me, as i'm about to break
don't know how much more i'm gonna fuken take
holdin back, self restraint, i think i'll be ok
then i realize that it's just another day

come on everybody it's the breaking point
loaded up like dynamite i'll blow this fuken joint
no turning back gone to far, now i have to kill
loaded up take aim fire at will
