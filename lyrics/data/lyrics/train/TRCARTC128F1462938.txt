Life in London is bittersweet
Spray can slogans along the street
Some kind of revolution in the town
Razor blades and safety pins make you look like a clown

What's goin' down
Is just the same old sound
You know that energy
Has always been my drug for me

you know, I came across a lot of water
Just to see, if it could be
The place to go, the life for me
