Ooo... ahh!
Yeah, yeah... oo-ooh...

It's been a long time coming
Yes, I was running
Away from my destiny
Finally found my direction
No need to feel rejection
Now I have some faith in me

Jumped on the right track
Straight for the climax, there'll be no turning back
It's just the beginning
Now I'll be winning

I'm in the prime of my life
and there's nothing that I can do
Can't lose
I'm in the prime of my life
Growing stronger every day
Moving mountains standing in my way
...
