Ya know sometimes in your life
You may find it hurts to be in love
Specially when you and the one ya love
Already belong to somebody else
You're tied to her and I'm tied to him
And we don't wanna hurt either one of them
That's how it is

When you're married but not to each other
Ya gotta go home in the middle of the night
Try and pretend every things alright
But it ain't, no it ain't

When you're married but not to each other
Make believe that you've been good
Give your love to the one you should
But you can't, no you can't
...
