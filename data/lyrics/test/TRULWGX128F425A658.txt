We were rockin' up
Roll it over and lay it down
We were shakin' up
We were breakin' up
We were rockin' to the shang-a-lang sound of the music

Hey hey, rockin' to the music
Hey hey, rocking to the music
Rocking every night and day, hey hey

Doin' doo wop be dooby do ay
We were all in the news with our blue suede shoes
And our dancin' the night away

Yea we sang shang-a-lang and we ran with the gang
Doin' doo wop be dooby do eye
With the jukebox playing and every body saying that
