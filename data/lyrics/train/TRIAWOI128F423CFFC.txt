All I want for Christmas
Is something you won't give
But if you did I'd cherish it
As long as I live
You failed me on my birthday
Again on Valentines
Denying me the only thing I
Wish was mine

All I want for Christmas is you
Nothing old, nothing new
Borrowed or blue
I'm afraid nothing else will
Ever do
All I want for Christmas is you
...
