Devious to those unknown
He walks below the land
Alluring victims to their death
Perish to the sand

Master of the blackened arts

Thrives amongst the Seven Gates
Searching for the keys

I have seen the darkened depths of Hell
Sorcery beyond the witches' spell
Robbed the crypts of Death's eternity
Killed the priest and cursed him endlessly
