There can only be one me
(Can't nobody, can't nobody do your body like me)
There can only be one me
(Can't nobody, can't nobody do your body like me)

I wanna make you moan, do it all night long
Once I get you home, baby girl it's on
I'm gonna kiss your lips, then I'm gonna raise your slip
I'm gonna take your hand and let you feel these ribs
I'm a winner, I'm a winner, I'm a winner, I'm a winner in bed
Go to dinner, go to dinner, go to dinner, go to dinner in bed
Listen babe

There can only be one me
(Can't nobody, can't nobody do your body like me)
There can only be one me
(Can't nobody, can't nobody do your body like me)

I wanna show you love, from the bottom up
Once the light goes off, you can't get enough
I wanna be your man, not a one-night stand
And if you take my hand, I bet a hundred grand
I'm a winner, I'm a winner, I'm a winner, I'm a winner in bed, yes I am
Go to dinner, go to dinner, go to dinner
And the dinner in bed, there can

There can only be one me
...
