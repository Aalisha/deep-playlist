i can't believe the time - it's getting to be late, 
so crowded in the state of my mind 
i can't seem to think straight, 
it's hard to tell my fate anymore 
so would you be so kind to tell me which direction is the door? 

how will i manage to survive while i'm fighting this fiend? 
welcome to the american machine
