I must have rehearsed my lines
A thousand times until I had them memorized
But when I get up the nerve to tell you the words
That never seem to come out right

How much I do, do need you, baby
I dream of moments we share
But you're not there, I'm living in a fantasy
But you don't even suspect, could probably care less
