Many a good time just to say you're sorry
Finally move on it's the best you can do
Got to be got out that train from the station
A new train is coming right just for you

Many a door shuts in the face of Freedom
Breaking the bad news 'til they're finally gone
Only to find out when one door is shattered
A new door is opening in your heart

Ready for lively love
Ready for lively love
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Call it a new day get the magic ticket
Only the right way you eventually say
Didn't you know yet it's your God given freedom
Never imagine a worried mind as Magic love

In the magic dream
