Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad
And cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool

And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet

Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
And lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs and hillbilly music
