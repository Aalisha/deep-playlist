Gone are the days of my mistakes,
I'd give everything, if everything is what it takes.
I'll bring the sun and I would chase
the rain, if I needed to.
But those many ways of mine, but
I've been down that road so many
Times.
And if you depend upon me, then
Maybe you'll see.

[CHORUS]
You can't stop the river from flowing
To the sea.
