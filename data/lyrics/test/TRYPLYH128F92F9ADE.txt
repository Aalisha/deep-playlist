[Don't do it]
[Don't do it]

Don't break my heart,
Please don't do it,
[Don't do it],
Ah don't break my heart
[Don't do it],
Oh please don't do it babe
[Don't do it],
Ah don't break my heart
[Don't do it]

Nothing for myself,
Now your gonna leave me,
For love with someone else,

I cried my eyes all open yeah,
