I'll plant a row
Of eucalyptus
And they will grow
Up to protect us
They'll block the rain, oh
With their salty leaves
They'll keep the wind oh
From our short short sleeves
Well if he comes
And tries to find us
We'll just grab hold
Branches above us
And we'll sit up here
We will wait a year
We'll come back, oh
We'll come back when the coast is clear
...
