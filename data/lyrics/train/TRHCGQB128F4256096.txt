The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?

You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me

I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely
Every road I walked along
I walked along with you
No wonder I am so lonely
...
