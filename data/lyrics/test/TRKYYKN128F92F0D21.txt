I know you said it all would be just fine
And i know that changes come with time
So sometimes i don't want the times to change
And i know that tomorrow you'll be gone
So i know tomorrow we'll move on
But maybe part of us will stay the same
Don't fall asleep
We don't want to miss a moment
Cause tonight might be the best night of our lives
Don't close your eyes
We could stay right here forever
Cause tonight might be the best night of our lives
I know sometimes i fight to keep things right
