The poor man's soul is a diamond made of coal
He's trying every day to survive
He makes his way, through the night and through the day
Sayin: don't it feel so good to be alive?

Ah but I don't want to end up like him
For he's down on his knees every hour to pray
Sayin: Lord, I been so good, just like I knew I should
So won't you free me on my judgement day?
