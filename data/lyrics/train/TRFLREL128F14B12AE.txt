Nerve, here I borned feeding on his lung
Verve, is his curse because he wanted to meet Christ alone

Bitch, you're no good, we could be so flown
Misunderstood, we could be your God

There in my bones we could be so flown
Misunderstood, because he wanted to meet Christ alone

But you will

No you will never find me, breach unborn
Never, come here watch me burn
...
