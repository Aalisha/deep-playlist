Pass the word, it's a call to arms
Midnight man at your door
Blackened faces run in the night
Daybreak under the floor

Bring my bow
Fill my head with flame, and we must
Let them know that the torch is lit again
Crystalize the pain behind your eyes
Are you ready to fight?

(You hear the drum and) run for your life
(Sweet Avalon the heat is on)
