I'm gonna kiss you in a special way
Make me your baby
I'll find a way to please you every day
Make me your baby

Make me, make me your baby
 (Doo aaa)
Kiss me, kiss me and maybe
 (Doo ooo)
You'll see, paradise is waiting for you and me
If you'll make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
If you'll make me your baby
(Make me your baby)
Ooh
