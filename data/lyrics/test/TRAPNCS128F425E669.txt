Sitting in my chair and thinking
Thinking of the crowd I've been with
Thinking of the music I make
and all the things I don't wanna give

Well dig everything I want
The girls are fighting for me
But everytime that I take one
Their indisposed poor old me!

Well, this is my life of sadness
This is the life I live
This is my life of gladness
This is the life I live
