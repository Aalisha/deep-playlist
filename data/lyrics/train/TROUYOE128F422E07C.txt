[Eazy-E]
First up high on a roof top
like a bird I'm havin' evil thoughts
a black hood covers my face
and death flows through my mind at it's own pace
sometimes I feel like a super hero
urgin' to free my kind
I'm so accurate
I shoot ya heart with a dime
now I'm back to the moral of my tale
I see a victim, and then my thoughts fail
my minds still fumblin' with the present slavery
I'm here to save you but who's to save me
I hold my strap so long that my palms all wet
I put finger on the fit and then the side a check
I make the kill here's the deal
after the trigger's pulled then the death is sealed
so it's the shots that sing out like a piper
everyones scared I'm the neighborhood sniper
