The burning sun hangs over the city
You and me baby, we don't feel nothing at all
From nine to five we're lost
This life ain't so pretty
But when the sun goes down
We know that we can stay and talk

I just can't wait
For the night to come
Cause when the shadows cover the light
We're the only ones
Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
Yes, baby, we
We belong to the night
By day we just survive
But after dark, we come alive
Cause baby, we
We belong to the night
