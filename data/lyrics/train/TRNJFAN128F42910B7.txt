Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I'm watching the sun say "good morning"
Chasing all the shadows away
I stand face to face with tomorrow
Troubles lost in yesterday, hey
Well, the night seemed to last forever
The darkest hour just before the dawn

You bring on the sun, it's you making it shine
You light up the sky like this heart of mine
You bring on the sun, it's you making it shine
You light up the sky like this heart of mine

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (wooh ooh ooh) ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh (wooh ooh ooh)
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I was lost in a lover's confusion
Waiting for this moment with you
