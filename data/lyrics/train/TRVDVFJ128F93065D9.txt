If you're coming home, like your letters say

And the place you're staying now, ain't too far away

Can you write tonight, just to let me know

Cos since you've been away girl, I've missed you so

You won't let me down, cos I'm sure you're homeward bound

And you'll be back safe and sound, cos I just know

Baby make it soon, make it soon (I can't wait another day)

Baby make it soon, make it soon (Lord I know I need you, come on)

Baby make it soon, make it soon (I need you right away)
