Even though you offered, I still refuse
Though your face is pretty, I don#t have to choose
Goodbye cardboard city, you've nothing to say
Though your face is pretty, I don't have to say
She's my friend and you know what I like
She's my friend and you know what I like
You know what I like

Going back to Bradford, it's what I prefer
