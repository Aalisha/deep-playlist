Have you ever felt this way before
Felt this way
Pushed to be someone you don't know
I don't know!
I've never felt this way before
Felt this way
Pushed to be someone I don't know!
People telling lies all the time
Another part of this pointless game
I don't want to be part of your lie
Give me a chance and you'll know
