Found myself just the other day
In the backyard of a friends place
Thinking about you
Thinking of the crowd you're in,
What you're up to, where you've been,
Just thinking...

You know the clothes that you wear, and the colour in your hair,
Shouldn't change you,
Now you tell me why is it so,
You're bigger than Almighty Joe
At least you think so

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know,
If I can call you, and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down,
...
