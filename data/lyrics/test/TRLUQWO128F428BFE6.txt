Ba-da ba-da-da-da
Ba-da ba-da-da-da
Ba-da ba-da-da-da

Monday, Monday
So good to me
Monday mornin', it was all I hoped it would be
Oh Monday mornin', Monday mornin' couldn't guarantee
That Monday evenin' you would still be here with me

Monday, Monday, can't trust that day
Monday, Monday, sometimes it just turns out that way
Oh Monday mornin' you gave me no warnin' of what was to be
Oh Monday, Monday, how could you leave and not take me

Every other day (every other day), every other day
Every other day of the week is fine, yeah
