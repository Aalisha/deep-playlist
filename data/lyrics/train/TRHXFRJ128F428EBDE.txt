I wanna love somebody
I hear you need somebody to love
Oh, I wanna love somebody
I hear you're looking for someone to love

'Cause you need to
Get back in the arms of a good friend
And I need to
Get back in the arms of a girlfriend

I didn't know nobody
And then I saw you coming my way
Well, I didn't know nobody
