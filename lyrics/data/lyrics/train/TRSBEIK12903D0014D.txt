You ran cryin' to the bedroom*
I ran off to the bar
Another piece of heaven gone to hell
The words we spoke in anger
Just tore my world apart
And I sat there feelinâ€™ sorry for myself
That old man sat down beside me
Looked me in the eye
And he said Son, I know what you're going through
You ought to get down on your knees
And thank your lucky stars
That you got someone to go home to
