Once in a while
For a few days
We must fight
Amongst the brave
Live for your sword
Cause we are at war

I always come alive, you always come to life
Come on, come on (Kill it all, Kill it all)
And we are never gonna be the same
I always come alive, you always come to life

If you like, if you like the Caribbean
Come and dive
There's a sea that you can swim in
Bring a knife
There's a life that you can finish
Open up sing along to what you're fate is
If you like, if you like the Caribbean
...
