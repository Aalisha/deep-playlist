You're a rhyme without a reason
And you know it so well
Who's the king of the season
Well you never can tell
Though it's so plain to see
You think you like to be normal
You think you're in control
But the action you take only makes you small
Just like the way it should be

Ref:
Surround sister take care of me
Surround sister take care of me
