When was the last time that you cried
And what was it about?
Were they tears of joy?
Were they tears of doubt?

It's bigger than we'll ever know
From the furthest star
To the center of our souls

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Living in a plastic bubble
A bubble in a plastic world
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Living in a plastic bubble
And it's good.

All this up and down
...
