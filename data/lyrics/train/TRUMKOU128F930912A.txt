Wistful for disco
We get a little misty
Remembering Menu do
And all those old pros
The bay city rollers
And Pinky Tuscadero

It must be our breeding
Call us like cattle
We come stampeding
To the new romantics
Everybody wants a love Titanic
And tiger beat keeps us on cue

It's true
We were born to worship someone
It's true, I do

Yeah, yeah, you
You are my superstar
And they know who you are
