(Intro 4x)
Lalalala-lala-lalala

(B-Real)
I'll admit, I was a wild seed when I was a kid
Slangin dope, poppin Shroomz and droppin lots of sin
Psychodelic visions would ensue
My view feelin the alter-states as they altered my fate
But I?, all that distorted shit brought it up
I came short and couldn't afford to store it up
So I began to record it on audio
The autobiography of Luis Mario
Something that's unbelievable, inconceivable
That half the shit I set out to do was achievable
But alas, look at all the shit come to pass
While we remained strong, others broke like glass
Cos you lack style, and you need all the help brother
Cos you're fragile, and it should say it on your cover:
This side up, for the celebrity
Who lacks intelligence, integrity, intensity
Oh it's true, I got you in that angle like Kurt
But don't go gettin your fuckin feelings hurt
I spit many bars of heat, that burn like a furnace,
I pour rhymes out like coffee spillin out your 'dermis
...
