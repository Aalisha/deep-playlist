Do you miss me at all?
Do you turn off the light
When you sleep?
I always leave the light on

Do you crawl when you creep?
Do you fly
When you fall from above?
I always fall for someone

When the rain comes down
Are you there in your room
Listening hard for the thunder

When the rain comes down
Are you where you need to be
To appreciate the great unbeauty
