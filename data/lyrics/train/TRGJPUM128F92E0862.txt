(Keith, Skeoch)

Down to the wire, on the end of the road
Down to the wire, and the kids don't know
Mother Nature's on her knees, and we're the reason of her disease
Hangin' off the ceiling, climbing up the walls
Crawling on my hands and knees to make it through it all

Now we can change or stay the same, one's the answer and the next to blame
Solution is a world of change

If we're gonna make it through tomorrow

Down in the dirt and fallin' out on the street
Crossin' the line myself (to make it to me)
