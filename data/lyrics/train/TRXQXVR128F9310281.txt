Got your freedom now boy
Who do you serve
Took for granted what you, should have preserved
No time left, no time left, to make amends
Keep burning bridges while you're buying your new friends
A day of reflection hits, you're a shell, skin and bones, counting costs
Is it worth your soul
A day of reflection hits

It's funny how times can change, rearrange and distance makes
The pain fade away
So important then, doesn't matter now
Both feet on the ground
Come full circle, yeah, come full circle
