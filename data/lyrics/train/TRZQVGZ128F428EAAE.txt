Is this just a feeling
That comes between us
When I see your face
When I meet your eyes
A mean reflection

I can't help you to
Be nobody's fool
It's just that
I can't help you too
Be nobody's fool
Be nobody's fool
Be nobody's fool
Be nobody's fool
Be nobody's fool
Be nobody's fool
Yeah

It's just that I can't be your fool
