i don't know why it's the way of the world
but meanwhile...

you've seen her sway when she walks down the street
look at her eyes see the glow in her cheeks
it ain't no secret she can't hide it away
there's someone special she's the dish of the day

she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman

this chemistry you'll never find in a book
...
