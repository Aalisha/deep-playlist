Style of your hair
Shape of your eyes and your nose
The way you stare

As if you see, right through to my soul
It's your left hand and the way
That it's not quite as big as your right

The way you stand in the mirror
Before we go out at night
Our quiet time
Your beautiful mind

They're all part of the list, things that I miss
Things like your funny little laugh

Or the way you smile, or the way we kiss
...
