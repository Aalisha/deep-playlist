18 karat gold wouldn't fill the hole
The bleeding hole in her heart
That's made from circumstances at home
Cus they kept pulling her hair
So they choked her words
She don't sleep at night, afraid to turn out the light
And she's home

I thought: 18 karat gold, would save a lonely soul
But she don't sleep at night, afraid to turn out the light
Cause they kept pulling her hair
Wouldn't leave her alone
But if only I could read her mind
And release that stone

In her heart where the sadness grows
I'd operate with this knife
And cut a big fat giant hole
...
