I be the first ever Asian astronaut
Blastin' off, castin' off
The ties that bind like a smashed guitar
Rode a mastodon out Jurassic Park
Chased by a fan in a Tyrannosaur mask
Travel the traffic cop
Past the spot
Where the ostrich got across for the ocelot
What I couldn't of bought
Cos they wouldn't a popped y'all
Just for me to cop it one

So I had to be up
I'm going gradually up
Into the galaxy bus
Until I can't feel my lungs
I pass the family up
I see an enemy's bus
Saw the anatomy up
I catch the ballerinas

Now I was walkin' down this one block
Didn't hear a gun shot
Smellin' hell or nature
Pickin' fruit off of a kumquat
Tree another day up in this life under the sunspot
Light upon my innervision searchin' for an answer
Heredetory, man-in-glory, days of the missle fury inventory took
And while I raise
Rain began to fall from the verbal dance I did amaze all the natives
And the ladies said "You're crazy - would you love to have my baby?"
And I plays with the chief of the Mohicans and the Sheikh
And travelled everywhere from Delaware way up to Mozambique
Was givin' praise with the Deacon at the steeple
Spirit-seekin'on the weekend with a tea can and a pair of old shades

It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
And shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes it's a mutual thing
Cos it's the root of all things, and we aims to be
...
