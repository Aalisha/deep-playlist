We care a lot!
We care a lot!

We care a lot!
About disasters, fires, floods and killer bees
About the NASA shuttle fallin' in the sea
We care a lot!
About starvation and the food that Live Aid bought
We care a lot!
About disease, baby, rock, Hudson, rock!
Yeah!

Woo!
(Whoa, whoa)Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
Oh, it's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it
We care a lot!
We care a lot!

We care a lot!
About the gamblers and the pushers and the geeks
We care a lot!
About the smack and crack and whack that hits the street
We care a lot!
About the welfare of all you boys and girls
