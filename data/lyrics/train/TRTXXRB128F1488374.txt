Well, I come home when I go out
and I play money
when nothing really matters
I shout at the men
Who fight for their lives
And you know why

Well, it's just so safe
It's safe in a little world
It's safe when you have a girl
It's safe in a little town
Where money grows in your little white hands

I'll breath passions from any blue house
I love to love you so dry
Just to challenge your life, challenge your life
For Christ's sake it's something you like
...
