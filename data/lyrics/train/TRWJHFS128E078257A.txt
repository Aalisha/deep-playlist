Modern people tend to dance
With this music I'll put you in a trance
Now dance

The music of lights spreads within
And from the rhythm came the king
And from this new day dawns the light
And now the light shines bright, dance

Children grow, some women produce
Some men they work and some steal
Everybody's got to make a livin'
The time will come my friends
And we'll all be together 'till the end

Well, feel the connection of the base line
