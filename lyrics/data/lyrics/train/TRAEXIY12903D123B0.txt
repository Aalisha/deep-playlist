A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air,
The monkey thought that everything
Was on the square.
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey
Off his back,
The monkey grabbed his neck and said,
"Now listen, Jack..."

Straighten up and fly right,
Straighten up and stay right
Straighten up and fly right
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.
Ain't no use in divin',
What's the use in jivin'?
