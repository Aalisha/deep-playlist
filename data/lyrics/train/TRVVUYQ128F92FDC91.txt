Someone help me
I heard her scream
The old man clutched her chest
Said ambulance on the way stay with me
And Johnny called said there's been a murder on the green

Someone help her
It can't be me
Standing over her with a gun in my hand
I made my baby bleed
It's not my fault, she shot first me

And in the blink
Of an eye
Another young lover dies

So they took me
To a cell
Threw away the key
And damned me right back down to hell
...
