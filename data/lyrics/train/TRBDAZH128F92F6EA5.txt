Lost in gliches
Demeaning of purpose
Tied so tight
It's trying to expire

Lack of faith
A greater imagination
A perfect perception
Of cats raining

Photographs of you... of you
Besides, Besides
Simple lies
Are what we are

And what we have
Won't hurt anymore
Simple lies
Are what we are

And what we have
...
