On a magical misty morning
I was standing in the Autumn rain
Suddenly the birds fell silent
Would I ever hear them sing again...
Hear them sing again...

Without a word of warning
I saw a shadow in the Autumn rain
Just like in my nightly dreams
The Lady In Black had come again...
The Lady had come again...
