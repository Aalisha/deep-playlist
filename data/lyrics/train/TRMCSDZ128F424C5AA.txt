I like the way you hold your head
If your brother knew, he'd have my head
But I wouldn't care if I was dead
If I had the chance to hold your hand
But my love goes undeclared
Yeah, my love goes undeclared
And my love goes undeclared
Yeah, my love goes undeclared

You let me stay here for a week
On your couch but I would rather sleep
In your bed, or even better yet
...
