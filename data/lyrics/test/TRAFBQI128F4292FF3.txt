Cut it out
Your self-inflicted pain
Is getting too routine
The crowds are catching on
To the self-inflicted song
Well here we go again:
The art of acting weak
Fall in love to fail
To boost your CD sales
And that CD sells
Yeah, what a hit
You've got to repeat it
You gotta sink to swim

First you don't, you don't succeed
You gotta recreate your misery
'Cause we all know art is hard
...
