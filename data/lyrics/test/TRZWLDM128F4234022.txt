I saw you 
I saw who you really were 
You were something 
Truly to me 
Not that you would ever know 
For anything 

How I watched you (how I watched you) 
And everything that you did (and everything) 
In spite of them 
Didn't you know (didn't you know) 
That you had everything to lose (had everything) 
Why didn't you care? 

What drove you to? 
Why would you? 
With everything to lose 
What drove you to? 
How could you? 
With everything to lose
