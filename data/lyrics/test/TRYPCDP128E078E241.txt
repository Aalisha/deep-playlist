Oooh, I was created for you
So glad that I've waited for you

All night lover
Use your magic power
You can thrill me
All night lover
Thrill me by the hour

Every time you hold me
You just about control me
For so long, so strong
I'm gettin' weaker

Each night with you
Is like a beginning
Oooh, renew me, do me
Send that lovin' feelin' right through me

All night lover
