Shower your love on me
Don't make it so hard to cry
Oh shower your love on me
You don't need a reason why

'Cause I'm not even half the way there
Oh I'm just too stupid to care
So help me now
When I've fallen through

There are scenes in my open mind
Confusion and flashing lights
Oh shower your love on me
...
