[Cover version of the legendary Accept song and taken
From the tribute to Accept album]

I hear a rock'n'roll guitar,
Screamin' wild on the radio
Well, I know what I like,
Know and it's right
Gotta take me through the night

The sound is comin' out,
It's breakin' down the doors
Like an earthquake
Explodin' your brains,
Do it again, power is a natural right

I say, hey Rock'n'Roller,
Power in your hands
You and your music,
...
