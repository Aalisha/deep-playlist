Soft trace of your fingertips
The round shape of your pressed lips
Why can't this be easier for me?
Why don't you?

Why don't you step a little closer, closer?
And we'll show you how to make your heartbeat
Why don't you dance a little closer, closer?
And I'll spin you around
Your heels will never touch the ground

I thought we went through this
I know that I can be the only thing that matters
(Whoa)
I'll never settle down, settle down
