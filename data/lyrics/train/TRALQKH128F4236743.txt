Love Rastafari...
If you do wrong they complain
Even if you call the father's name it's the same
What they want us to do
Don't they know this is nothing new
Why won't they do what they want
And let me do my thing they should be thankful
There's lights of hope are still shining, shining

If you do wrong they complain
Even if you call the father's name it's the same
What they want us to do
Don't they know this is nothing new
Why won't they do what they want
And let me do my thing they should be thankful
There's lights of hope are still shining, shining

Let Jah rise and the heathen scatter
Have to give thanks and praises no matter
Even if the flames is getting hotter & hotter
Every one should know I don't believe in a rumor
Children arise from sleep & slumber
Don't come to bow, come to conquer
Strictly love why you envy your brother
Don't let them re-arrange you in a different manner

If you do wrong they complain
