Welcome to the land of questions
Welcome to the isle of lore
Where the veil came crumbling down

There it all began
The Germination
Unveiling a cryptic door
There it was revealed
Hopes and aspirations
Unclosing an enthralled door

...
Escalate the sense

Enhancing to join the dawn
I close my eyes, Inis Mona
And reminisce of those palmy days
I moon o'er you, Inis Mona
As long as I breathe
