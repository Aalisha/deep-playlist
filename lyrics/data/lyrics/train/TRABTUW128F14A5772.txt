Winchester

I was taken with a younger thing
Known to me as Rosie Shy
She had bells of brass to ring-a-ding
And danced to please your eyes
It seems like lovely Rosie Shy
She shrank from my caress
I think I'm dying from Rosie Shy
Cause my heart can't get no rest
No my heart can't get no rest
And I can't find grace
In the human face today.
Reborn with a baby ear
I'm singing with Rosie Shy
...
