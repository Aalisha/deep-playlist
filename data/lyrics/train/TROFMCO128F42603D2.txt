(Monty Powell/Jules Medders)

When I was young and just a boy
I Had myself a dream
I'd get a horse and ride the range
With Roy and Gene
We'd save the girl in the nick of time
And have the fastest guns
Sing a song while the credits rolled
And disappear into the setting sun

I didn't want to play football
