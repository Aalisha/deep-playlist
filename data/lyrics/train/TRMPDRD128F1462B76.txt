Your eyes followed me here
Your eyes, seamless and sure
They leave me broken and
In need of a cure

Your eyes followed me here
Your eyes, sifting my soul
They leave me broken hands
Forge diamonds from the coal

They lace me along
Infinite synapse of white lines
Then chasing the dawn
Story book syntax
Your eyes

Slit the throat
Of all I know
About myself and this life
Silhouette lies
...
