* This song has two parts:
A. "The cutting edge of hardcore rap; the most
innovative stuff
for 1993" -- gangsta parody following the
"Classroom" skit
B. Paula Perry introduces the _real_ Slaughtahouse

Part A:

(Yeah... yeah... yeah...)
This is MC Negro
And this is this Ign-ant MC
And this is our new motherfucking single
OUR NEW SHIT
Slaughtahouse
This shit is called Slaughtahouse
Negro! Coming off our last platinum LP
Platinum LP
_Shit's Real Killin' Motherfuckers Dead_
Killin em dead
And this is how we gonna rock shit for the nine-tray

Verse One: MC Negro

Here come the craziest niggaz on earth
Cutthroats, ever since birth
Blood and guts are gonna spill
Cuz it's murder murder murder, and kill kill kill
Chainsaw in my holster
Barb-wire rope, and I'll hang ya like a poster
So when I grab my axe you better drop
Cause I'm "swing swing swing, and chop chop chop" in
the Slaughtahouse

Yeah, yo Ign-ant MC
Whassup?
Show these niggaz what the dress code is
Aight

Verse Two: Ign-ant MC

Strictly Raiders and Kings gear
Only wear black and I don't know how to act
no more... so come and take a chance and
Mess around with the black Charles Manson
Body parts in the freezer
I'm not Jeffrey Dahmer but I'll slaughta ya momma
...
