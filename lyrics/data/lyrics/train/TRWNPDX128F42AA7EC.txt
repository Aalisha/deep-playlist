Well, he walked out in the arena,
All dressed up to the brim,
Said he just came down,
From a place called Highland Rim,
Well, he said he came to ride a horse,
The one they call The Brute,
But he didn't look like a cowboy,
In his continental suit.

We snickered at the way he dressed
But he never said a word,
He walks on by the rest of us
As if he hadn't heard,
A thousand bucks went to the man
That could ride this wild cayuse,
A meaner horse was never born
Than the one they called "The Brute."

The horse that he was lookin' for
Was in shute number eight,
He walked up very slowly,
Put his hand upon the gate,
We knew he was a thoroughbred
When he pulled a sack of Dukes,
From the inside pocket
Of his continental suit.
