[C-Rayz Walz]
Where there's a will there's a way, no? Where there's Will there's Jada
I catch then PISS in the face of a hater
Congratulate us at afterparties in heaven
Thank God my intro was peace to the 7's, let's go!

[Chorus: singers]
Battle me, so you can see
How I blast flows, so easily
Battle me, so you can see
How I blast flows, so easily

[C-Rayz Walz]
I'm the foul author of styles out of order
I got skills, I could drown you with a cup of water
So don't waste my time with stupid questions like, "Aiyyo you rhyme?"
You don't need to hear my verse, you got enough on your mind
You work for WHO, so?! I don't wanna get signed
My shadow's chasin me, basically, I'm ahead of my time
Tryin to get this green out the heat like spinach rolls
So don't make me put 6 in your Kevin Cole
Yo Walz they hollerin at you - in a minute yo!
Tryin to score points with the right hooks like Riddick Bowe
Battle me - don't challenge me with them simple styles
I'll have your crew sayin WHO like some Temple Owls
I'm like John Stockton, I don't even have to score
I just make the game better, by bein out there on the floor
