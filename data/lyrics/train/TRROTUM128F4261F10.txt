Huh, at this ah point in time I'd like to let you know
We give thanks and praise onto the most high Selassie I
Whoa, cast away all your fears, yea
You don't worry let me see you wipe your tears
Yea you know I love you
CHORUS
All my Black people and all of my thugs
All you little children and those woman I love
They ain't gonna see us fall,
they ain't gonna see us fall
Share all my riches and sing for my fans,
love Mama Africa let me see your hands
They ain't gonna see us fall,
they ain't gonna see us fall
Plethoras of praise oh, they don't stop me
Wow with the youths that's where my stash be
Oh with the people that's where my cash be
Oh those pagan think they can get at me
Oh judgement we face them,
from they're pagans we got to erase them
Girls on the roof and the thugs in the basement
Playing music for the war love is the replacement
