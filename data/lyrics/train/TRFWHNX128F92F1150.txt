See the stars come falling down from the sky
Gently passing they kiss your tears that you cry
See the wind come softly blow your hair from your face
And the rain comes falling down in its crazy ways

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

For myself my tears just fall in the dust
Day will dry them and night will find they're lost
...
