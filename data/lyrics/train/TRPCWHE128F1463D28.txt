I found him by the stage last night
He was breathing his last breath
A bottle of gin and a cigarette
Was all that he had left

I can see you make the music
'Cause you carry a guitar
But God, help the troubadour
Who tries to be a star

So play the chords of love, my friend
Play the chords of pain
If you want to keep your song
Don't, don't, don't, don't play the chords of fame

I've seen my share of hustlers
