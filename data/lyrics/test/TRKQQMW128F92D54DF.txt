When about midnight roosters at the hip tight
Played the blues with Cool Kite
Shot a round with Heather Smite
Mixed my drinks with Mia Town
Smoked hip hop with Roger Down
Dulled the lights from 5th Ave
Played the colours Jonny Par

Down at Delta Bay
Down at Delta Bay
A chord a light a paralight abyss
New tricks in moonlight
Sad sumo, a silly sea
