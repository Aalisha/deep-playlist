Wandering endlessly upon the shores
For something that I will never attain
Banished here for a life of nothingness
My only comfort is the sand I bleed on

Hope is gone, it will never be the same
All I feel are the repeated stings of pain
Pungent stench of the sins of the worthless ones
Faithless cries of the sins of the godless ones

Marching on in deathly silence
Upon the shores we go
Crashing tides applaud the violence
Upon the shores we go

I'm dying endlessly upon the shores
For something that I will never attain
Tortured here for a life of nothingness
