Go ahead and say it! what have you got to lose?
Go ahead and say it! no need to hold back
Go ahead and say it! voice your opinion
Go ahead and say it! while you still have the right
Why keep it all bottled up inside?
Say it loud and at least you've tried
Someone hears and you're on your way
Something on your mind you have to say
