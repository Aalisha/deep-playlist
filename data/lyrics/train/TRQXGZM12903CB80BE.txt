Happytimes are here again
And I've been gone a while
But you can still call me friend
We can play in the sun and laugh forever
I'm so glad that we're back together

'Cause the wait's been good while I was gone
And the air's been high and free
You've been out with other guys
But I want you I want you to know
...
