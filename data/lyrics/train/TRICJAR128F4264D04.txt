Creeping 'cross the canvas of color, 
crawling in a cold delight
Bitter sweet perversions, 
paint their picture cross their precious sky
And it's all I've been searching for
Wretched is the filth, 
that grinds the holy with it's doubt
Embrace it's heart and tear it out


Reach into the fire
See if you can feel my soul
Burning with desire
To be free from this
