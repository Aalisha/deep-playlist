So you think you're safe now, well think again
I'm not holding back now so let the games begin
My bones are breaking from the weight of the world
On my shoulders

I heard all of them say you've sold your soul
Now all that's left is the pain, you've destroyed us all
You've destroyed everything I know
But I've lived through it

All the shame, all the pain that you have caused
My heart can't beat
All the fights, all the lies you put me through
It's your disease
...
