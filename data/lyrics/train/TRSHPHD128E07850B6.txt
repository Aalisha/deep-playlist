It's been nine days, eight hours, forty minutes, ten seconds
Since you called

I've been so crazy, I've just about taking our picture
Off the wall
It's been three months, over hundred days since you
Held my hand
And I miss you in a thousand ways
Will I ever see you again

PRE-How did it change so fast
(I won't give you to the past)
I really thought it'd last

All that we had was so unbelieveable
Now that it's gone it's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams, you were so damn beautiful
How could it be that you ruined my
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
...
