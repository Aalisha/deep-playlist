Black tears coming from nowhere
Black tear coming to ease the pain
I know better than no one
I know there's no one else to blame

There's no turning back, no one to succeed
The blood on the tracks will spread this desease
Now we're making this life a game that we play
Where nobody wins, where no one can say
