I still think about the way it was
When you could still speak your mind
Back when uncle Sam put a gun in your hand
And you laid it all on the line

Well, my grand daddy never did have any trouble
With standin' up for what he believed
People today seem to be ashamed
Of the price that we paid to be free

My flag's still flyin', there ain't no denyin'
I'm American, born and bred
Still proud and united, bring hell and I fight it
This blue collar done turn red
...
