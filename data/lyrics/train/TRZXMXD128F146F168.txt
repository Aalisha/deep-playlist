Inside four walls
I live my life, doesn't matter what I've done
The government's always right
They tell us what to be they tell us what to believe
They're wrong my friend is gone

Inside four walls,
Inside four walls
The day they took away my friend

Injustice made it's mark
All the political whores only come out after dark
...
