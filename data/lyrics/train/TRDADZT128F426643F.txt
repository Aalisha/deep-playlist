i got a used leather jacket and an old
pair of boots
with holes in the soles
and my 501 blues have seen better
of days
now i don't have a place that'll keep
me warm
and i can call my own
when you ain't got any money you can't
pay no rent
and you're out

i'm gonna be all right

so i pack my bags and ride into
the sunset
i don't know where i'm gonna go but
that don't matter at all

i got a college degree that means
nothing to me
and i ain't got a job
...
