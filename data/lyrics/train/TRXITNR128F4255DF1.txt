Lot of knots, lot of snags
Lot of holes, lot of cracks, lot of crags
Lot of naggin' old hags
Lot of fools, lot of fool scum bags
Oh, it's such a drag, what a chore
Oh, your wounds are full of salt
Everything's a stress, and what's more
Well, it's all somebody's fault

Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Hey! Get, get, get, get, get over it!
Get over it, get over it! Oh!

Make you sick, make you ill
