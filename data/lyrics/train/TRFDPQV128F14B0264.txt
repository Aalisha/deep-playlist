I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
A shadow of a man, a face through a window
Crying in the night, the night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes I see a memory
I never realized how happy you made me, oh, Mandy

You came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh, Mandy
You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
