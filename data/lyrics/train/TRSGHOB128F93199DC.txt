Hit the switch, the DJ plays the fine dish and adjusts the high-pitch level
Hint to miss, hand your girl the wine list, she smells of hibiscus pedals
Whiff the grit, I show up with my rhyme clique, not in designer fit dress codes
Get a wince, and they think we're timeless and starting singing along to our pirated down loads
Admit the shit, I've never really been that social, most the times I'm disheveled
Is this it?, since it's Fear of a Black Tangent, do I got to call white kids devils?
It's the pits, or do I got to say nature's ovaries are bleeding at a poetry reading
The kids are pissed, because the thoughts of an underground rap guy don't really go that way
The kids are pissed, I think the mainstream vs. independent argument is so pass√©
Pick my disc, thanks to my 10 stack-high cd duper, I'm an uneasy sleeper
Get this, but a pacified TV viewer, read about me in a weekly reader
Fix the myth, and he said I'm a hip-hop treaty breacher with my vivid tales
I spend less time alienating my audience then I do trying to solicit sales
So lick the dick, because the scene is more than bitches, brew, and stinky reefer
It's a trip, all the pee-wee leaguers kiss rings on our pinky fingers
We spit the hits, but why? I am meaningless product on a crowded shelf
A shout for help, I simmer in my dilapidated glee
