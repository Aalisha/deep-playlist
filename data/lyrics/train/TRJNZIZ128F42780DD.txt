Drag my face through the dirt again
I know I'm where I belong
For you're a constant reminder
Of all the rights that I've wronged

Give me the strength to move this mountain
To block this line of sight
This was more than I could ask for
Tear down the sky
Black out the sky
Sever these ties

As you further your tragedy
To prove to me you're alive
Sooner or later we'll have to choose
