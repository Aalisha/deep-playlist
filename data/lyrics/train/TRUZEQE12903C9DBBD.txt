I pillaged your fairytale
I've scattered the seas to find a reason why
My whiskey tongue leaves sweaty palms
On a sawed off way to say I own the night

Keep your women and children inside, he's looking for a good time

Embodied in my mind is where they all reside
Here lie my darkest passengers
They lie awake tonight, until she's put to rest

In search of a sailor, the headlines have said
This man is a monster, a vermin at best
You don't give a fuck that I'm a rat
