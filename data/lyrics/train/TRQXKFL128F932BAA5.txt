(Yeah) People have been talking
About what I should do.
But I just can't listen,
I keep in tune to You.

But I'm not gonna fall;
I'm giving it all to You, my Lord.
I'm not gonna fall
I'm giving it all to You...
If I fix my eyes on You,
Will You show me what to do?
I'll lay down my sorrows,
I'm all Yours. (yeah, yeah, oh oooh)

If I could make the world
Fade away for just a moment
To be (to be) alone with You (with You)...
Too many voices,
Too many noises,
...
