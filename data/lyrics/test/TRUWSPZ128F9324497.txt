I know an island where the people are kind
And the rest of the world seems far away
Maybe it's only in the back of my mind
But I know when I go that's where I'll stay

"C'mon, c'mon" dice la Inglesa
("Come on, come on" says the English woman)
"C'est bon, C'est bon" dice la Francesa
("It's good, it's good" says the French woman)
"Ay, que lindo" dice la Cubana singing far away
("Oh how handsome!" says the Cuban woman)
Que buena fortuna
(Such good luck.)
Esa es mi vida
(This is my life)
Como el mambo de la luna
(like the mambo of the moon)

I know a land where they live for today
'Cause tomorrow is too far away
Maybe one day you will go there with me
And we'll dance underneath the ceiba tree

"C'mon, c'mon" dice la Inglesa
("Come on, come on" says the English woman)
"C'est bon, C'est bon" dice la Francesa
