None of this matters, none of these words. Common and silent we will die in this world.
Weve only spoken to those who agree, and without them weve fallen on deaf ears.

Stand on conviction and you will walk alone.

For once I have stood (I have stood), no one will know, 
But alone I was born and alone we must go.

In my convictions I've found my own grave, but amongst the dead we all fade away.

Yeah... 
Yet solitude is better than a life not worthy of reaction.
