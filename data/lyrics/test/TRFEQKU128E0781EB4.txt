Some summers in the evening after 6 or so
I walk on down the hill
And maybe buy a beer
I think about my friends
Sometimes I wish they lived out here
But they wouldn't dig this town
No, they wouldn't dig this town

Try not to think about it, Alice Childress
Try not to think about it anymore
Try not to think about it, Alice Childress
Anymore
No, not anymore, oh

Alice, the world is full of ugly things
That you can't change
Pretend it's not that way
