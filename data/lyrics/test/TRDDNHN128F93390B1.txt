Here i lay all alone
tossin', turnin'
longing for some of your, tender love
i've waited for the right, moment to come
so i can thank you for,
all the tender love you've given to me

Tender love (tender love)
love so tender
holdin' me close to you
baby i surrender

candles they light the dark,
now i see how
lovely the feelings are
all the tender love you've given to me
...
