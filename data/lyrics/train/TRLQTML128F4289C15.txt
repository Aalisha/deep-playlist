Let's take a trip down memory lane and pass by all the nights,
where I'll find myself in your arms agian.
There's no inspiration here, lets go, I think we better get out.
But we're stuck deep in the depths of yesterday.

Did you know it's been too long?
This movie never ends, I need you more than anything now.
So much has changed
