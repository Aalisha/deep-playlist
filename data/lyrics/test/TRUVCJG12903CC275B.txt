This is my vow to you (to you)
After all we’ve been through
I would’ve given my all (my all)
No matter how near or far
This my vow, give my all
This is my vow to you (to you)
After all we’ve been through

You took my heart
My train of thought
I can’t think straight
Know it’s you I’ve sought
Miles have passed and so have years
And through all this you would still wait here

Broken walls and no restrain (hold me down)
I can’t take back what’s not the same
I won’t live down what I have done (don’t look back)
