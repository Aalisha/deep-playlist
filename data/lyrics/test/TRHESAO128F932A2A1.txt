There are secret cities buried
somewhere underground
But whether or not we find them
The world keeps spinnind 'round

Everyone's pretending that there's nothing left to say
But no matter what you tell them
The truth shows anyway

But don't walk out that door
You know I ned you here
So I won't disappear into myself
...
