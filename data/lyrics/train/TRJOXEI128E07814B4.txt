She draped herself in widow weeds
Veil of black and buttoned sleeves
Hid her face from the world
A shadow where once had been a girl

Her husband of past twenty years
Had passed away leaving her in tears
Heart full of the future's fears
She kneels beside his grave

Where should be colour every day
Just widow weeds, her friends all say
"please stop your tears and throw away
Those widow weeds of black and grey"

Then she did wail a chilling sound
Beat her fists and hit the ground
She moaned his name, she pulled her hair
She chanted verse and muttered prayer
How could a man so just, so good
Leave her a widow like he could

Where should be colour every day
Just widow weeds, her friends all say
...
