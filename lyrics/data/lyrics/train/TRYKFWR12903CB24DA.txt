So you need me to say that I'm sorry
That someone undressed me as professed to me
In Spain with their eyes

Ba dum-bum ba da dum.

I'm sorry 'cause someone told me to watch
And I watched for it all over
Spain with my eyes.

Ba dum-bum ba da dum.

If I'm sorry, then so are you
Cause I, I go where you tell me to.
On horseshoes.

The Casanova ran
Toward the Eastern lands
His cock was in his hand
You got to ride away from him
You gotta ride away from him.

"But if you ride over there
they'll put bows in your hair
they will stand back and
stare at you to Spain with their eyes."
