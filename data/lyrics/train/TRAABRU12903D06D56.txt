Roll more, rock more
Roll more, rock more
Roll more
Rock, rock, rock, rock

Roll more, rock more
Roll more, rock more
Roll more, rock more
Roll more, rock more

Roll more
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock

Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Pac-Man is loving it

Rock more, roll more
Fuck more, Pac-Man is loving it
Rock more, roll more
Fuck more, Pac-Man is loving it

A cloudy vision, absence of granter
I don't care what is wrong or right
The earth is bleeding and secreeding madness
Petrified, gone dry inside
