Isn't very difficult to see why
You are the way you are
Doesn't take a genius to realize
That sometimes life is hard

It's gonna take time
But you'll just have to wait
You're gonna be fine
But in the meantime

Come over here, lady
Let me wipe your tears away
Come a little nearer, baby
'Cause you'll heal over
Heal over, heal over someday
