haha
yeah
are you ready to do this one?
alright then
let's go
wooooh
ah come on
ooooh yeah

(don't stop doin' that thing you do)
oh, your sweet love is making me high, yeah yeah
(don't stop givin' me all your love)
I've been waiting for you all my life
yes, you know I've been waiting
(don't stop, don't stop)

don't stop doin' it baby

...
they feed me all of their lives, yeah
but I can't be messin' up, no
got a love, keep me satisfied
and baby what I see
whenever I, look at you
is all I ever wanted in this world
nothing else is gonna do

sing on
(don't stop doin' that thing you do)
aah, your sweet love is making me high, heya heya
(don't stop givin' me all your love)
I've been waiting for you all my life
