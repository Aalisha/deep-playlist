It’s a world divided, my pleasure my pain
Has it been decided this struggle in vain?
It’s a harsh reality, is someone to blame
Is it me again? Tomorrow’s another day

(Chorus)
What I know is all that I’ve got to offer
Living off the memories still alive in my mind
Now it’s breaking me down, but it’s not over
One Last Time Around
