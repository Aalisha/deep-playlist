I ain't giving up, keep on living up, I'm indigenous

Lord of Lords wid him Lioness
so hear mi no?

Repatriation is a must to Ethiopia, Africa

Chorus
Rastaman wi taking over and we've got nothing to fear
wi taking over righteousness mi declare
wi taking over and we've got nothing to fear
come on, come on mek mi see your hands in di air

Yo cause a full time now let the trumpet sound
a full time now Babylon going down
a full time now mek di youth dem wear di crown
yo inna di country and di town
