Spider web stockings
At the pearly gates
Ruby lips, Revlon kiss
Born to seal your fate

Beautiful and deadly
Making love in a suicide bed
Once you taste that poison, darling, you're dead

Catch you in those dark eyes
Steal your breath away

Black Widow
The curse on her calls your name
To this wicked game called love
Black Widow
Though you know her kisses kill
