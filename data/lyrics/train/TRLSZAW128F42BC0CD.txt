I've been alive forever
And I wrote the very first song
I put the words and the melodies together
I am music and I write the songs

I write the songs that make the whole world sing
I write the songs of love and special things
I write the songs that make those young girls cry
I write the songs, I write the songs

My home lies deep within you
And Ive got my own room in your soul
Were such good friends, when I look out through your window
You make me young again, even though I'm very old
