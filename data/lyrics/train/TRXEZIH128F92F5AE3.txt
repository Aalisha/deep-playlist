I believe in the sand beneath my toes
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

I believe that everything is free
Try just to help me breath
Nothing is ever the same
Whos left to blame
Were all the same
The people that fight for our name
That is your reasoning (x2)


(Oh oh oh oh.)

Oh my god shes back again
The music made her happy and
Shes hold'n hands
She brought a friend
Forever shes a dancer
