Free people will never remain free
If they are not willing, if need be
To fight for their vital interests

[Incomprehensible]

I watch your bullshit from the outside in
Your disrespect and hate
You think you're better than your fellow man
Controlled by fear you seal your fate

How could you step on me
Violate, desecrate and hate me
But I'm just like you, like you
Flesh and blood, I'm only human
