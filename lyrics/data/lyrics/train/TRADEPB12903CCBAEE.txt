We used to laugh, we used to cry
We used to bow our heads then wonder why?
Now you're gone I guess I'll carry on
And make the best of what you've left to me
Left to me, left to me

I need you like the flower needs the rain
You know I need you
Guess I'll start it all again
You know I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know I need you, I need you

An' every day I'd laugh the hours away
...
