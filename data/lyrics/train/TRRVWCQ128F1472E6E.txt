I know what I said
was heat of the moment
but theres a little truth in between the words we've spoken
its a little late now to fix the heart thats broken
please dont ask me where i'm going
cuz i dont know
no i dont know anymore

It used to feel like heaven
used to feel like may
I used to hear those violins playing our strings like a symphony
now they've gone away
nobody wants to face the truth
but you wont believe what love can do
...
