Refrain:
[comin' straight from the underground] 4x

Erick sermon:
As I pump up a brand new funk swing,
And bring back the chill of thrill from b.b. king.
Old fashioned is the way that I be waxin' a mc,
I bust a grill, and the reaction I check,
Inspect, make sure the head's wrecked;
[crunch] snap a neck for some live effects.
A machine, my functioning, that's mean.
I stay together, my man, like al green.
I'm a slayer, the e-r-i-c-k and I'm back
To attack a punk chump that ain't sayin' jack.
Boom, I'm buckwild when I'm stoned,
I close only one eye like a cyclone.
So I throw on my black shades that's rhinestone,
Summer to my benz that's outlined in chrome.
I'm the grand royal mc, I'm no joke.
