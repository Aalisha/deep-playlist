Unweaving strands of failure
Propagating the obscene
Intentions gone asunder
Tearing down the human facade
(I will give life) Relentless pursuit of action
(I will decide) The traits that blind humanity
(Regenerate) Reliving the generations
(A boundless chain) Correcting their mistakes

Solutions we seek to our mortality
Tampering in greed, inflated arrogance
Nature's course diverted, by men who interfere
Rampant emptiness, reject this world
