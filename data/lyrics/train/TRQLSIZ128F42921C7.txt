Ah! Yeah
Keep alive y'all, nine to five
My name is Maxi Jazz and I ain't no joke
I make you choke on the mic when I go for broke
When I come in to a jam I tear off my shirt
I have no knowledge of fear ‘cause I'm here to do work, huh
When I rock a party it's a serious thing
I'll make you feel so good
I'll make you wanna sing
Make you scream, cry, wonder why
You ever listen to those other guys telling you lie
You know my position, the top of the tree
And it's a make or break decision to ramp with me
So, let's see who wants to kick it all the count of three
Don't try to take this lightly ‘cause I'm fun and I'm mighty, huh
Maxi Jazz, you got the name correct
And I'ma show you why the name gets enough respect
You see, it's not easy to by ad funky as me
