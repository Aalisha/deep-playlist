I was raised up on the west side of town
That's where I met Jimmy Gillum
Baddest man around

He'd rather fight than eat
Mister that's no lie
If you cross him up smile and wave goodbye
Bad bad Jimmy baddest man alive

He was dynamite in a small pack
His fuse was short
He didn't cut no slack
Oh that Jimmy Gillum was a bad cat

Talk about trouble, you talk about mean
Jimmy was the baddest cat I've ever seen
You talk about trouble, should've been his name
Jimmy never pulled a punch, he was a fightin' machine
Yeah, he was he was a fightin' machine
