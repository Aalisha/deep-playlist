i know i don't control you
i know i don't own you
but i still feel a sense of pride
'cause i know what we have is a lie
it's a lie and it always used to frighten me
now i know it'll always be a part of me
it's a lie

i know sometimes we're strangers
i know there's still some danger
but i still feel a sense of pride
'cause i know what we have is a lie
...
