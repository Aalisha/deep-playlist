In chicago where i live, there's a... there's a outfit that'll tow just almost anything off the streets but they deal mostly in automobile. and we call 'em the lincoln park pirates*.

The street lamps are on in chicago tonite
And lovers are gazin at stars, the stores are all closin'
And daley is dozin' and the fatman is counting the car;
There's more cars than places to put 'em he said
But i got room for them all, so round 'em up boys
I want some more toys, hit the lot by the grocery store


(chorus)

To me

Way hey tow'em away
The lincoln park pirates are we; from wilmette to gary
There's none that so hairy and we always collect our fee
