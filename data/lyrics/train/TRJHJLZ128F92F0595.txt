Well, my temp'rature's risin' and my feet on the floor
Twenty people knockin' 'cause they're wanting some more
Let me in, baby, I don't know what you've got
But you'd better take it easy, this place is hot

So glad we made it, so glad we made it
You gotta gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin' every day
