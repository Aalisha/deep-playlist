The Gutterati?

Well I was chasing down flies and shooting up women
Trying to get the whole thing straight in my head
Lookin for a girl who'd come with me swimming
And come and play tunes at the end of my bed

And all the hardmen were drinkin down petrol
Bamming up the girls when in came the law
Heading for the door and getting tongue tied
When they asked me what exactly I saw

Chorus:
So I'll get some Monte Christo's
And we can all go see the band
Well I may not be a looker yeah
