The blue it speaks so full.
It's like a beauty one can barely stand.
Or too much things dropped in your hand.
And there's a green like the peace in your heart, sometimes.
Painted underneath the sheets of ashy snow.
And there's a blue like where the urban angels go, very bright.
Now the Calder mobile tips a biomorphic sphere.
Then it swings its dangling pieces round to other paintings here.

Your behavior is so male.
It's like you can't explain yourself to me.
I think I'll ask Renoir to tea.
