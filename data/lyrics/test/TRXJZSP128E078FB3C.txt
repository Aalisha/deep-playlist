(Intro: Bink)
Yo, you ready by there?
All right, One Shot Deal Productions
Bring it to ya live straight from South Jamaica, Queens
LB FAM

(Mr. Cheeks)
YouknowhatI'msayin?
Number one man bandit!
Shout-outs to JB, can't forget my man J Mose
Some of that Gangsta Flex, my man Sexy Flex moved out
I can't forget my man JR, what, what
Say no more, Scott, Big L, my man, what, WHAT
Hahaha, it's all real, it's Lost Boyz baby
This how we do now, back now, you on this here now

(Mr. Cheeks)
Yo, yo, yo a nigga like me is in this here rap game
Niggaz actin like Mr. Cheeks ain't the same
But first of all I make cash moves outta state
And I can't help but if my shit is tryin to go platinum
Lately, you see my team is X-rated
Ah, the deal, peoples know how I feel
I still love my family and friends
Just because I'm bouncin in and out of state, and we collectin ends
They think shit has change, like up the words
Psst, this is some ex shit that sounds absurd
I be spendin cash on everybody I know (I KNOW)
So don't act like I know

(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
This is how we do
Represent for my fam and crew
My man Bink got that shit that makes me smoke and drink
We tickle bitches pink, bring the feathers
Yeah everybody we know how we do
Everyday we smoke, we drink the brew
Bounce with the peoples that love to have fun
We've been getting down since Day 1
Everybody just know how we do
