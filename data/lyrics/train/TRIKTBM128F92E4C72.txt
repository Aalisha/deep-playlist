You lived the life you dreamed the dream
You built the wall that stands between
Blocked out the light that gave you hope
Withdrew your words before you spoke
You watched the world slip out of your hands

And you laughed and you cried
And that made it all worthwhile
And you hoped and you prayed
That your world would never change
But all that it's become
Is Avalon
