(J.J. Cale)

Some like this and some like that
And some don't know where it's at
If you don't get loose, if you don't groove
Well, your motor won't make it and your motor won't move

If time don't tell you then don't ask me
I'm riding on a hurricane down to the sea
If you can't hear the music, turn it up loud
There's movement in the air and movement in the crowd

Bow-legged woman doing the boogaloo
She got a jive, she got a move
