You're blessed with a gift
That's somewhere inside yourself
You're blessed with a gift
That sometimes is hard to find
Look at yourself and be who you are
Then one day you'll find
You've never been that far
And when you stay that way

You'll never be the same
Until you'll feel the change
Once you fall in love with that beautiful heart
