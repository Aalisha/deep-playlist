I can't undo the day
It won't go, won't go under the rug
I pull out the stops
And you, you pull the plug

These are sober days and I know it can't be
But I'll miss you the way you miss the sea

Just (Don't look down) Keep staring like you've never seen the stars
(Don't look down) If you need me to remind you who you are
(Don't look down) Little blossom there's the shiniest soul
(Oh) Just behind those eyes
