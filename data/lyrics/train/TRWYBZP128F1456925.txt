Tell me he didn't break your heart
Tell me he didn't lie to you
Tell me there's no way that he set you up
Tell me there's no way that you'll let him use you
You'd think by now you'd know him by all his signs
So how could you be a fool?

[1] - Girl, here he comes again
Tellin' lies to you
Girl, here he comes again
To break your heart
You'll find out, you know he's no good
