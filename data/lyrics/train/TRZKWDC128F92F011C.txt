I tell myself lies sometimes
Yeah, I say he and I are gonna be alright
But he don't know me
He thinks I'm happy here
And that this big old dark cloud gonna disappear
If he just holds me

He feels the distance grow between us
I just can't wait to slip away

[Chorus:]
Every night I know where I can find you
I just close my eyes and I'm right there beside you
Every time I reach out and touch you
