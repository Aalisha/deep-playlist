If I wanted to ask for your opinion I would
Dreams have reasons and my reasons are good
Dear your logic will never work on me, oh
Work on me, baby

Could be the story I've been reading makes me dream this way
I've got all the lights in the kitchen to keep the ghouls at bay
I could be wrong, you could be right
Out of mind, out of sight, Lord knows I've missed you

Been taking no drinking too far this time
Sit here all morning, try to figure this dream out
