While stars fill my eyes, when you're by my side
And words weren't intended for feelings like this, only a kiss.
So don't ever feel; I'll always be there...
And we'll build our life, filled with moments of gold, and memories to hold

So let's look after love, and we'll be alright, hold on to all we've been sharing, caring.
Let's look after love, and we'll do just fine, keep all those good dreams alive, every night.

I don't have to try; I know I can smile
Cuz you give me magic that shines through my day, lightens my way.
And each time we touch, I fall more in love
...
