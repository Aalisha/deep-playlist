Put A Little Love In Your Heart



Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart
You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

Another day goes by
Still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart
If you want the world to know
