Look out the window, the sounds in the wind
You hear the siren again and again
Screaming a whine, deep in your mind
Follow the sign and you'll soar

Piercing shrill that keeps you awake
You're the example he's ready to take
Though it seems wild, go for the ride
A change has been made for you on the other side
