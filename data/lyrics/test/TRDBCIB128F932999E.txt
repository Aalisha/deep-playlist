Our sense is not a fiction
Our remains are the best
If you have a pact
With your own hell

Immersed in dangerous ways
Take the knife
Kiss your second cross
And drop your kingdom
Now is your turn

You´re not cursed
You are a soul
That all the time is freak
And doesn´t have a lord

You are a soul
That all the time is freak
And doesn´t have a lord

Incomplete never hear that thing
...
