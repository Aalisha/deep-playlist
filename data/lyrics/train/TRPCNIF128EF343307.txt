They're on the streets with their eyes of hunger
It's a disease it's a death to one another
There's no stopping it it gets too late
Don't be a (?) change us all now
They're on the streets with their eyes of hunger
It's a disease it's a death to one another
There's no stopping it it gets too late
Don't be a (?) change us all now

When there's no more room in hell
The dead walk the earth
Feeling out, the night is one together
We need time and they'll get us in the air
When there's no more room in hell
The dead walk the earth
Feeling out, the night is one together
