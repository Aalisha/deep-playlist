It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on
With the best of 'om
You are beautiful
Like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold, miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
I, I love you like a love song baby
And I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
Constantly
Boy you play though my mind like a symphony
