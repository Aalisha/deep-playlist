Should you go to aberdeen
Tell me what you find
A girl i known in aberdeen
Who left her heart behind

Tho the northern lights
Have claimed her as their own

Tell her that i hope she's well
And beg her to come home
Tell her that i hope she's well
And beg her to come home

If the cost of livings high
I can pay my way
...
