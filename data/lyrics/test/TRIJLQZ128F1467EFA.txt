Yeah...
I got a rhyme for those dudes who lie about me and mine
Yo run it back, run it back
I got a rhyme for those dudes who lie about me and mine
I squeeze them nines, from behind the blinds
I leave flat in ground in the pine-
box! I'm not a killa wit mine
But I get rid of nigga that get piece of mine
Well if you got the bar separate me from mine


I must be dope for you to steal my style
Tryin to take my sound
Yo run it back, run it back
I must be dope for you to steal my style
Tryin to take my sound
You don't want those pieces out
Better yet you better kneel in church
Dont these hurr, put a hole through your detrich fur
Your little style that you got is subminimal
Is you ready to swing, blows wit a griminal

(Chorus)2X
Things we do to you
