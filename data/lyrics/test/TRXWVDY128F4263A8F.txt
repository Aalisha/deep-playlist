I can see the beginning
And I don't see the end
Wanna hold you and never let go oh no

For as long as we're giving
And we never pretend
I believe in the future untold

We'll be stronger together
Than we would be apart
I can feel you inside my heart

Every day every night
Fill my shadows with light
When I feel all alone
Your heart is my home
Every night every day
You'll show me the way
Show me the way to your
Show me the way to your love
...
