Salin' can save me
or I drown evermore
but I'm on the waves
with you on the shore

never mind
one find day
in some bar
by the harbor
I'll find you
there you'll be
as you where
corner stool
by the jukebox
watin' for me

I can remember

sweet child
gone a mile
swayin' your head
to the crazy ragtime
sayin' "hey you got a quater?
hey you look familiar
hey you got a quater?
let's dance to the ragtime"

slow down
don't time fly
...
