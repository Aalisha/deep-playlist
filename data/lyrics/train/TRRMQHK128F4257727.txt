Well I turned left just like you told me to
I get excited by the moves you do
I'm on a mission and I'm gonna get away
Well I saw her standing all colored in red
I felt the blues just by the things she said
I want my mission so I can escape today

God knows - I ain't sleeping but I want my line
God knows - I ain't happy so I want it bad tonight
Oh brother can you help me out
God knows - I've got nothing so accept my time
God knows - it ain't easy to behave in this spotlight
Oh brother can you help me out
brother can you help me out
Oh brother can you help me out
