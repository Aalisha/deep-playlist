It's just a world apart, you said
It's like nothing you've seen, this place
The fiction's given, the ending bled
Into a space across your page
Why did it wrap you like
Morning fog chokes the trees
Believed it will - there's something bigger than you know
Are you waiting on me?

Hold you deep and lonely
The centre's here, you fill, you own it
Popinjay
