Is this just a matter of
Me getting what I needed?
Till I was safe upon the other side
Of the international date line
And it's just a matter of
Me keeping myself seated
Till the pilot killed the overdrive
And landed in a place where you can't
Find me there
Find me there

When you hold one chance
And you break your hands
When the secret's safe
And you call my name
Then I am gone

I'm tired of you and me
(Tired of you and me)
And the space that's in between
(Space that's in between)
And I would rather be somewhere
With better thoughts and warmer air
...
