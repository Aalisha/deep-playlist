Take me into the night and I'm an easy lover
Take me into the fight and I'm an easy brother
And I'm on fire
Burn my sweet effigy, I'm a road runner
Spill my guts on a wheel, I wanna taste uh-huh

And I'm on fire, and I'm on fire
And I'm on fire...
(Im going, you tell me, I feel it, I say it
I'm heading back into the tunnel for my soul to burn)
And I'm on fire...
(I'm coming, you coming, no hiding, my feeling

I wanna take it to the highest over me, yeah...)
Wire me up to machines I'll be your prisoner
...
