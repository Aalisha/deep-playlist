It was one of those days when she couldn't find a single ray of sunshine
There wasn't even a cloud up in the sky
After thirteen years at the factory they sorry mam but we're downsizin
That's the way life is, good luck with the rest of it
She looked me in the eye and said this ain't the first time I've taken the fall,
but let me tell you girl what's gotten me through is keepin faith through it all

Cause there'll be
Dead ends and road blocks, Tough times and hard knocks
Seems like you're always wonderin why you're at the right place at the wrong time
Wheels movin but you feel stuck, like your life's spinnin in a big mud
When you're out there runnin around on a wild goose chase,
There's a reason to keep believin,
God don't make mistakes
