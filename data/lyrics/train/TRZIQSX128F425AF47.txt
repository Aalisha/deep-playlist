The time has come
For me to start packing in
I'm folding the shores of my life
Into valises
I can't stand
This desert heat no more
I'm going away
I'm going away

I waited too long
To catch your signal
I counted the numbers, the letters, the days
Something tells me you're
You're not coming
I've got to go away
I'm going away
...
