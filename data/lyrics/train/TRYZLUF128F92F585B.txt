(Ashley Gorley, Bryan Simpson, Wade Kirby)

You're a modern day miracle
Anything but a typical girl
Mona Lisa on a sidewalk stand
Superstar in a common man world
Nothing's been so beautiful

Wanna stop and ask your name
Take a picture of your pretty face
Shot to heaven, steal a kiss
Leave the world at your throne
I want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
