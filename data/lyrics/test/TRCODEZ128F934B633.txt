Early on there came a time when I was facing
A turning point in life
So many years I tried to find it

Thinking not of what is left to see in the future
Take another chance to find
That fading light shown in the distance

Falling in place was I
As I'm walking over edge
A sea to join of wasted life
Living on a broken ledge

Deep inside a force not weak
Ever longing for a way
To break the streak that's holding me
And leads myself astray

Walking forever the life of the never
...
