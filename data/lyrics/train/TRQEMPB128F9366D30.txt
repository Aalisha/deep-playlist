I knew you were sitting in your room all alone
I knew I was the only girl for you
You have told me so
But somehow it slipped my mind
Whilst walking home
Whilst you were sulking I could have been raped
In Ladbroke Grove
Well, you can have your records back
And take your comics too
I'm going to have some fun tonight
Life with or without you
So I spend an evening without getting my face cut
And another evening without getting run over
Again another evening without falling in love
So I listen to the radio
Smoke a cigarette
Same old thing, yeah, I know
Everybody does it
