Did you ever get the feeling
That the truth is less revealing
Than a downright lie?
And did you think your head was hip
To certain things it's not equipped
To qualify?

All day long the sky is blue
And everyone says "How'dya do?"
In Shangri-la
Everyday's a perfect day
And you can go your own sweet way in
Shangri-la

In Shangri-la, in Shangri-la
You can be whoever you are
In Shangri-la

Investment with a good return
Provides the means through which we earn
Our daily bread
Insisting on an equal cut
Some people even bust a gut
To stay ahead

All day long the sky is blue
And no one has a lot to do
In Shangri-la

In Shangri-la (in Shangri-la!)
In Shangri-la (in Shangri-la!)
You can be whoever you are
In Shangri-la

(Roll up! Roll up! This way! )

It's a strange world we live in
But surely we're forgiven
If we don't know where to turn
With paradise for hire
On the back streets of desire
We all live and learn

All day long the sky is blue
And everyone's in love with you
In Shangri-la
Lovers dance and children sing
And everybody does their thing in
Shangri-la

In Shangri-la (in Shangri-la)
In Shangri-la (In Shangri-la!)
You can be whoever you are
In Shangri-la ha ha ha
