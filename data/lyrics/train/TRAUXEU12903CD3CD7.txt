When I'm getting home to you
I gotta show you what I can do
But everything connects and that ain't nowhere
Well, but maybe they're just giving you all you've ever wanted
And maybe you never ever know what that was
And maybe you're just finding it out now
With a Vietnamese baby on your mind

Technology satellite, well
What's wrong today and why was
Everyone so busy they've forgotten why they're playing
That he said, what's wrong today is what wrong with you
