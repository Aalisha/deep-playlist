Here I am my knees are on this floor again
Take away my pride, reveal this heart within
And send Your rain of mercy, let the healing begin
'Cause You've brought me to this place and I can honestly say
That slowly I've forgotten all the where's and why's
Forgotten all the times You've been right by my side
And I've begun to think that life has passed me by
