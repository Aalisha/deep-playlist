It used to be every night
I would cry my heart out over you
It used to be every day
I would wish you here close to me.

I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat
I'd just sit at home and I'd weep
but now all that has changed
I've found someone to ease my pain

And it don't (hurt now no not now)
Nini it don't hurt now (no not now)
well there's no more sleepless nights
no more heartaches, no more fights
and it don't (hurt now, not now)

It used to be every time
I would hear a sad song, I would die.
It remind, me of when you and I
were sooooo much in love
