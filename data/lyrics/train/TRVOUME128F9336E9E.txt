[Verse 1]
The rain falls
down on my window pane
the silenced whispers things you used to say
I close me eyes and I feel you near
how I wish you were here
holdin me close in your arms again my dear
whispering sweet nothings in my ear
the passion burns
on how I miss my baby

[Chorus x1]
Postcards and photographs
loveletters to you
late night phone calls to say
you love me too
oh how I miss you
