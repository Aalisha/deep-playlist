Nothing really changes
everything remains the same
we are what we are till the day that we die
Nothing really changes
Everything remains the same
We are what we are till the day that we die

If we could live in Shakespeare's days
I wonder who we'd be
If people then could live today
I wonder who we'd see
They'd prob'ly stop a corner cop
and ask what the whole world 's coming to
If people then could live today
I wonder what they'd do
yes I wonder what they'd do
...
