Too many normal people on the television
These people are the stars but they should be tuning in
Get rid of them, get rid of them, get rid of them
Because they're boring the children

Too many normal people on the box
A great invention has been ruined by the bosses
Of the channels and the stations
And it's quality you cannot trust
Don't waste my time, time, time

Or I'll turn you off, put the child lock on
Lose the code and never switch you
...
