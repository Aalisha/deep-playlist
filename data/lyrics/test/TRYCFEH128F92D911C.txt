The place I was raised was poisoned
Power in dangerous hands
All life long, we've paid a price
Of exclusion as inheritance.

Entering the embassy
Caught up forever, damn red tape
Sent away, not accepted
I'm not from the United States.

Priorities and privileges
Are given arbitrarily
Others, like me
Are damned to be the enemy.

Oh, oh, Hold On
