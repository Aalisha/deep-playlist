[Vinnie Vincent and Robert Fleischman]

You fired the first shot without fair warning
Love's silver bullet throught the heart
Shell shocked, you brought me to my knees... I've fallen
All is fair in love and war
I kissed your lips and heard the siren's call
Into your spider's web I fall

Onto the battlefield of lust we thunder
Like titans clashing through the night
Over who will wear the crown of passion
Let flesh and fantasy begin
Let pain and pleasure be our only sin
Let your heaven burn to take me in
