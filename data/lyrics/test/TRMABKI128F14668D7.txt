Hot town, summer in the city
Back of my neck gettin' dirt and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity?
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around people looking half-dead
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a matchhead

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it'll be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the nights
In the summer in the city
