Won't drink, won't smoke
Won't get home at a hundred o'clock
Nobody goin' to satisfy me
Except you and the baby and the colour TV

I was always in my prime
Now I'm falling over the line
The boys are sad to have let me go
But you got it all to get me home

You quiet me down
I been all over the place and I ain't found anyone
Can keep my feet on the ground, no

We can be bigger than my old habits
