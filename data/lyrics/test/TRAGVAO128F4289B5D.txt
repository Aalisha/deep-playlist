Verse One: Prodigy

It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookends, the way things is looking
It's Friday, you in for a long stay, gettin shackled on the bus
First thing come Monday, hoping in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowing, home is a place you're not going for a long while
Now you're up on the isle, in a position that you ain't got to, refusing
to smile
But keep in mind there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requesting Pee, see you fragile
It ain't hard to see, niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
cause the war populations are
If this was the street, my razor would be a mack demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screaming, what you in for kid
Busting nuts, taps heard of million street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that
Wising up young blood, before you make things escalate, and I would hate
To set your crooked ass straight

Chorus

Make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone, niggas is trife
Runnin from one time, ain't no time to slip, make one false move
And it's a up north trip
Livin the high life, make your moves at night, pack your heat in this warzone
