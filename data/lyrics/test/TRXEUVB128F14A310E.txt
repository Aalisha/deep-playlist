Lonely nights out on the run
Can't beat the heat of a smokin' gun
Moonlight in the mirror
As the city sleeps, death over me

It's been a long hard road
I can't fight it, it's out of control
Somebody save me

Runnin' for my life, it's hangin' by a thread
I can't get any closer to you yet
Hard luck's knockin' on my back door
It's easy to see why they're comin' for me
'Cause I'm guilty, guilty, guilty in the first degree

Can't get the chip off my shoulder
Just eighteen but I feel the choker
...
