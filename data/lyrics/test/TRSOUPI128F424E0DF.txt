He led you to this hiding place
His lightning threats spun silver tongues
The red bells beckon you to ride
A handprint on the driver's side
It looks a lot like engine oil and tastes like being poor and small
And Popsicles in the summer

Deep red bells, deep as I've been done
Deep red bells, deep as I've been done

It always has to come this
...
