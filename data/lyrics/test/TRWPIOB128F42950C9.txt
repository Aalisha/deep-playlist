Any people who don't spend enuff to provide for the poor
You won't be able to spend enuff to protect the rich
Think poverty a poor people problem?
Think again how much people problem

How can I be good?
When it is so much cheaper to be bad
How can I survive when the chances I don't have?
Me have to hustle

How can I promise me a go change
When me legal life is above my price range, me have hustle?
The law forbin' me to carry a gun but my enemies have one
Me na gone run now me have to buss it

They want me to call the police
But me a dem already in some serious beef me now gone trust it
We use to be the best of friends
But politcs a cause the whole a we face for bend me can take it

This one bag a orange turn green
And the whole a we a play for the same fucking team
That now gone make rude bowy not no make

What me say wo, a wo, o, o, o, o, o
(This a the sound of my tears)
Wo, a wo, o, o, o, o, o
