Gonna Make You Sweat
Here We Go (Let's Rock And Roll)
[guitar solo intro]

You all want this party started? Right?
You all want this party started ... quickly! Right?
Play that beat. Play that beat. (Bang)
Play that beat. Play that beat. (Bang)
Play that beat. Play that beat. (Bang)
Play that beat. Play that beat. (Bang)
Go Go Here we go!
Go Go Here we go!
Go Go Here we go!
Go Go Here we go!
Ah-h-h-h Freak out!

Hit me!

Slam it baby!

Enter the jam. The party is packed and I rapped
Girls wall to wall. There's my man hanging out at the back
Till I cruise slide through the dance floor
I've never seen the club so hyped before
Get off the mic if you're bored
Back to back, front to front, door to door
Everybody dance to the new sound rock and roll
Soul to soul. I bring it down.
From the bottom to the top. From the top to the bottom.
Hmm I've got 'em.
People everywhere they jump, they swing their hair,
They shake their derriere. Oh yeah.
So loosen your body and let me take control.
Let's rock and roll.

Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

We're gonna rock and roll
We're gonna move this sound
We're gonna make a groove
Everybody move
Everybody movin' yeah
Everybody move. Yeah.
Ah-h-h-h Freak out!

Whenever your at the club and dance to rap or acid
Come on get with it. That's it.
Throw your hands in the air. Scream go! go! go!
Rock and roll will go with the flow. Yo!
