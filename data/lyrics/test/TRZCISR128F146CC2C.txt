If You Love Me
Wish I could tell by the look in your eyes (where I stand)
Wish I could tell what you're feeling inside (but I can't)
Wish you would say what I'm needing to hear (you want me)
Give me a sign that would make it all clear (just show me)
Don't leave my heart out here on the line
If you love me let me know
