[Featuring Erykah Badu]
[Chorus] x 2
(Erykah Badu)
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
what club I went to with my homies
baby don't worry you know that you got me
[Verse 1]
(Black Thought)
Somebody told me that this planet was small
we use to live in the same building on the same floor
and never met before
until I'm overseas on tour
and peep this ethiopian queen from philly
taking classes abroad
she studying film and photo flash focus record
said she workin on a flick and
could my click do the score
she said she loved my show in paris
at Elysee Montmartre
and that I stepped off the stage
and took a piece of her heart
we knew from the start that
things fall apart, intentions shatter
she like that shit don't matter
when I get home get at her
through letter, phone, whatever
...
