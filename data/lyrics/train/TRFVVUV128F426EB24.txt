For a while to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
And our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For a while we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had
And after the love is gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around
After the love is gone
What used to be right is wrong
...
