Warm ride
rare earth
(bee gees)
Come to me baby, i got something to say
i been changin' your direction ev'ry step of the way
now i bring emotion and i bring desire
and i bring the potion to set you on fire
i know you need me, there can be no doubt
you got me held inside your love and i can't get out
we must surrender to the powers that be
the angel in you and the devil in me

warm ride, warm ride, baby just the way you are
