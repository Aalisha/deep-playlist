Knew he was a misfit since the age of seventeen
He had to do it his way they said, He should be quarantined
Looking to the East, and looking to the West
Looking for the courage, To see which way was the best.

Cause you can't turn back (can't turn back) - oh, no

Look out on his right, he would look out on his left
He would look out in the distance, where he could see the wilderness
When the thunderhead approached, he would pull off to the side
And when the sun would break through, he would get back out and ride

Cause you can't turn back (can't turn back) - oh, no
