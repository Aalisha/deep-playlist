Something I just might regret
Something you will not forget
Maybe I should throw away
Everything I've learned today

All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me

Pushing forward from the truth
Maybe it's me and maybe it's you
Sometimes I don't know myself
Twenty-eight years straight to hell

All over me, all over me
All over me, all over me
