Sorry, I never meant to hurt you
You know I really love you and
If you give me one more chance
I'll prove it to you

Stop, 'cause I don't wanna hear it
Please don't say your same old speech
Another time, think I have it
Memorized

Again, boy you lied to me
Again, and you're hurting me again
I've made up my mind
And I won't take you back this time

Again don't start calling me
Again no apologies, again
I won't change my mind
I won't take you back this time
