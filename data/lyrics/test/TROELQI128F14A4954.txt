You look forlorn
Too tired to yawn
As pale as the moon
on a bright afternoon

Your face is drawn
You've got Lonely-Phobia
and I only hope ya
get better


You sit and stare
beyond all care
But mirrors don't lie
and the look in your eye

is showing your despair
You've got Lonely-Phobia
and I only hope ya
...
