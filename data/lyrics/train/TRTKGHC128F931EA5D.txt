[Verse]
If I had the money there would be a lot of friends,
seeking always something if I gave it out in $10's.
And if I give a little more than what I really need,
I'd be a savior tell somebody 'bout the feat (?)
So why can't I give something more? I cry out to myself.
Selfish man I know I am, cannot help myself know I am now.
