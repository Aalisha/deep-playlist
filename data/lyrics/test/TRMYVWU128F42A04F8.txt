Looking from the window above,
it's like a story of love, can you
hear me?
Came back only yesterday, we're moving farther away, 
want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave, all I needed for another day,
And all I ever knew - only you

Sometimes when I think of her name 
When it's only a game 
...
