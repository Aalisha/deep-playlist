(Kurupt (talking))
Yeah, this is what you would call somethin' like
One of the things that, you know, when you meet your goal
You get to the top of the game, and the dream come true
Kurupt and KRS-One freestyle

(KRS-One)
Yes, yes y'all!
yeah yeah y'all! (uh)
KRS y'all, uh huh, uh huh (uh)
yeah Kurupt, y'all
Time to check it out, uh huh
Prophecy, y'all yes yes, yall (yea)
KRS, y'all, uh huh, like this y'all (yea)
you know what's up comin' through like that! (haha!)

(Verse 1 (KRS-One))
I laugh at that, your whole premise is off
I'm blastin' that, somehow my foot is exactly where yo ass is at
abusin' it, you know for 86 produce 77
i'm doin' to you on the other hand still kind of new to it
I spit lead into better men
you a veteran, aint no tellin'
what i send to get them yet another one
My voice-box send shocks of adrenaline so you sweat again
(unintelligible)

(Verse 2 (Kurupt))
Then again i noticed that everybody
Think they can fuck with us
But luckily i noticed
Everybody want to be close to us
Tryin' to bust when they bust
I seen them they ain't treacherous and they ain't fuckin with us
My style's out this universe
Words that serve all these emcees
They hear pre-verbs i break them down to nouns and verbs
They know exactly what i do, i run through crew for crew
KRS, it's on you, baby

(Verse 3 (KRS-One))
True underground, Boogey Down got them runnin' around
Comin' to town breakin' them all the way down
and makin' them frown, true underground
not a class clown
copy, guilty ass, papi
I roll with the mash out posse
The beatdown posse, terror squad, you'll find you was never hard
When the clip loads, and i yell FLIP-MODE!
My faster, fresh blows, give my foes death blows
The best nose, goes live at breath shows

(Verse 4 (Kurupt))
See i heard it before, word it before
Worded it before, before, every emcee tried to serve it before
Be Kurupt the raw dog hog servin' all y'all
Fuck around with us the top dog
Murder all y'all, my minds incredible
I'm out this mind state, lookin' at me, oh my goodness!
