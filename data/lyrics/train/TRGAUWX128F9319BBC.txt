Coke an' Jamaican rum sleepin' by your gun
Close my eyes an' I wake up with the phone
Yes I'm worried all the times I come to ya baby just to blow my lines
Every day's a wonder each night is a lone one

Poppers deal hands they play games making us the same
In this dream you're princess and I, a king
Exchanging tokens with the palace guards just plain livin' couldn't be that hard
...
