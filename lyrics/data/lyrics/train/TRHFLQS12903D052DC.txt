You've made a hole in my heart
You've made a hole in my heart
You've made a hole in my heart
You've made a hole in my heart

And they can say what they want,
but it doesn't mean a thing
and if they went inside me,
changed everything
this sure is nothing
that a dark look can't cure
its not a disease
no, that's for sure!

I was looking for a way to get close to you
but I got inside
I got inside
Nothing in the world could pull me back again
I'm inside
I'm inside

You
You turn me upside down
whenever you're around
...
