Blaze the night, lift the stake
Cause your world is broken
Everything's on the floor
Whenever the word is spoken
Lonely bed you're awake
Falling asleep you're hoping
Faith will come through the door
Open up cause there's still time

If you closed your eyes
If you took a breath
When the knife is on the ground
If you feel erased
When He's in this place
Then your life it will be found
