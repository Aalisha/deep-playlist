So you think the woman's crazy
She eat up your lies
Like it's good, your lies like apple pie
She don't even cry
She is not a fool
She's just tryin' to do what her heart says to
To love you
As you take to the wind
To the wind again she breaks down
As she breaks down within
Within, within, within
She waits for you patiently
Hopin' that someday you'll see
...
