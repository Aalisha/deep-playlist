Chicks, fix, superhits, jewelery for breakfast 
in a milliondollar suite at the Hilton Hotel 
I've got tweny playmates knocking 
at the door in hot stockings each day, oh yeah 
Cuz I'm the King of metal, God of pop, the rock 'n' roll Messiah 
Wasting twenty four hours a day, every night 
Im a sold out sensation 
with a nasty reputation 
Oh yeah, oh yeah.! 
You say, hey, it's hard to be a rock 'n' roller 
Try being a rock 'n' roll God 
In a world of pleasure 
Jackass, I'll get you soon 
Yeah yeah, hey, it's hard to be a rock 'n' roller 
Try being a rock 'n' roll star 
When the world gets crazy 
Baby, so do you, whoo 
I have a private plane taking me from L.A. to Bahamas 
Making records on the beach that sound like shit, but still sell 
...
