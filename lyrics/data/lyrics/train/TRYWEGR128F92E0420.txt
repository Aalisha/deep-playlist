woh woaah
woh woaah
woh woaah
woh woaah
You were talking to her
But messing with me
It's finally clear

You're blurring the lines
Are you disturbed?

Oh, now you care
Why do you race through my red lights?
Can't understand
I'll slow it down for you
Tell me how can you sleep?
How can you breathe?
Baby tell me how
How you love me now
