Times of woe
Uncertain future
Related talks
Events by past
Love to hate
Hate to love
Be a prey
Hunt or stay

False prophets ignored in ridicule
Treason by demons, we will fall
Skeptic minds will turn the tide
To imperial destruction

Don't let depression take control
Unmask your truly self
Ignore the rights and all the wrongs
Embrace the light

In the heat of the night
You feel the walls cave in on you
Can you feel what I do
...
