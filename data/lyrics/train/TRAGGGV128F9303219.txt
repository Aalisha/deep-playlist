Stay by my side
And help me through the night
The wind's blowing cold
Stay by my side
Lock out the world tonight
There's just you and me
So please become reality

Sometimes you feel a stabbing pain
Which tells your wicked rambling brain
That you're all alone
The lights go out all voices die
You're small and fragile but you try
To roll back the stone

So could you be a place
A place for me and all these days
When all that I know
Is that I want you to stay by my side
And help me through the night
The wind's blowing cold
...
