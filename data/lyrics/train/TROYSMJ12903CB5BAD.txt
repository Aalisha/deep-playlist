Friday night, I'd just got back
I had my eyes shut and dreaming about the past
I thought about you while the radio played
I should have got loaded, some reason I stayed

I started drifting to a different place
I realized I was falling off the face of the world
And there was nothing left to bring me back

I'm a million miles away
A million miles away
I'm just a million miles away
And there's nothing left to bring me back today
