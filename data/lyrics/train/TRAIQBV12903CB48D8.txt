I work a double-shift on Monday
Tuesday, I get up before dawn
Wednesday, pouring coffee
Thursday night, I'm tending the bar

Well, when Friday finally rolls around
I call my rough and rowdy friends and we're honky-tonk loud

I work hard, I play harder
I'm a good-timin', American daughter
Redneck, blue collar
And I party down to my last dollar

I work hard, I work hard, I work hard
I play harder
