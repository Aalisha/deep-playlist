If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby
'Cause I'm all alone and you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am askin' is for ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man
