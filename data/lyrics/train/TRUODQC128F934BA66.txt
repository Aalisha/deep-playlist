Did you really think i was going to wait?
did you really think that you were that great?
well yes you were, but now there is nothing more to say
you're fading away, and now it's just to late

Two faced bitch!

I'm out of your life now you say I have a big head
Well a bicth like you, were only good to spread in bed
You might be in leather, you ight be a metal head
But a bitch like you will never ever see me again
