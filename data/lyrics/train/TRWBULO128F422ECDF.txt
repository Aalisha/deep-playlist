It's slow
Falling in love again
How can you pretend?
You're so scared of rushing in
and risking everything
You're hanging on a prayer

So, you're looking for a miracle
To make something happen
It's slow when you're looking for a miracle
To make something happen

Life is flashing before our eyes
Like lullabies that end
...
