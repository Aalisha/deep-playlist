He sits alone in a one small room
Of a shabby railroad flat
He reads his yellowed clippings
Folds them up and puts them back
He knows that the world's not the place that it seems
And oh, oh, oh sweet dreams
There's somebody there

He stifles his emotions
And he wipes them from his face
He shuffles around his secret things
Hidden in their secret place
And nobody knows where the stranger will go
And oh, oh, oh you know
That nobody cares

And he comes when he's summoned
And he does what must be done
