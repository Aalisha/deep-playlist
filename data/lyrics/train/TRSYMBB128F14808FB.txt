No wonder you're looking thin
when all that you live on
is lipgloss and cigarettes
And scraps at the end of the day when
he's given the rest
to someone with long black hair
All those nights in, making such a mess of the bed
Oh you never ever want to go home
And he wants you so you may as well hang around for a while
call your Dad on the phone
He changed his mind last Monday
so you've got to leave by Sunday
yeah
You've lost your lipgloss Honey
Oh yeah
Now nothing you do
can turn him on
there's something wrong
You had it once
but now it's gone
And you feel such a fool
...
