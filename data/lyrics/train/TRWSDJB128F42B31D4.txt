Oh, I can't believe it, girl
You wanna leave me, girl
Let's fall in love again
Baby, she was just a friend

And now I'm tryin' to call
But your phone is off
I know I broke your heart
But baby, she was just a friend

Ain't nothin' different here
No need to disappear
Let's fall in love again
Baby, she was just a friend

Don't wanna fall apart
Tried to stop her from the start
I know I broke your heart
But baby, she was just a friend

Open the door, baby
I can hear your phone ringin'
Plus your car is warm
So I know you just got home

I hear you breathin' real hard
So close to you, yet I? m so far
Gotta talk this thing over
You still haven't heard my story, no

Baby, I need you
I'm gon' stand here until your heart agrees to
Let me in 'cause nothing else matters
My life is ungathered
Don't let us be a memory

I can't believe it, girl
You wanna leave me, girl
Let's fall in love again
Baby, she was just a friend
