sometimes words are hard to find
i'm looking for that perfect line
to let you know you're always on my mind

yeah, this is love - and i've learned enough to know
i'm never letting go
no, no, no - won't let go

when you want it - when you need it
you'll always have the best of me
i can't help it - believe it
you'll always get the best of me

i may not always know what's right
but i know i want you here tonight
