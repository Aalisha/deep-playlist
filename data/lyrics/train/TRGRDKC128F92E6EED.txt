I wander through the streets at night
Lost and cold, alone
Bloody visions fill my dreams
My heart is like a stone
A stranger comes out of the mist
Backons to call me near
He leads me down the path of hate
Down the road of sin

Can you can you canyou hear me
Can you can you canyou see me
Can you can you canyou hear me
Can you can you canyou see me

I fight o loosing battle now
To keep myself controlled
But it seems like no one cares
...
