Just because I'm all G'd up, doesn't
mean I'm out to cut
Just because, boo, I got game, doesn't
mean I'll forget your name
Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip
It's hard to believe a player like me, could treat
you like a lady ... Just Because

Hearing my name every other day,
people gonna say what they wanna say
But they don't really know me babe,
hate on me 'cause a brother paid
Only known you for a short time, things that you're
hearing weighing on my mind
If you feel me, here's what I suggest, let
me put your fears to rest

Baby I admit it, (I used to), hit it and
I quit it
(But I' trying to), learn to be committed, to
you and only, I'm your man

Just because I'm all G'd up, doesn't
mean I'm out to cut
Just because, boo, I got game, doesn't
mean I'll forget your name
Because I push a 6, doesn't mean I'll ego trip
It's hard to believe a playa like me, could treat
you like a lady ... Just Because
...
