Don't be scared no, no
We ain't prepared no, no
Dreamt of ventures and
Woke up to the sound of the trenches you dig in my mind

Ah, you've got a lot to learn

What's a kingdom
To the man who has sold off his soul just to claim it Sirens, harletts, bohemians
Coloured haze of the street horizon

Ah, you've got a lot to learn
Oh, he's got some time to burn
