Through the long sleep
Darkness bleeds
Through the silver and I
Reminded the layout as the wings
They all died
And it all hates like you
Destroys the message

Another open eye to secrets
With plans to scrape them clean
And I have stacked them higher than anyone believed
And it downplays the scene
It all comes crashing

Don't be removed
I got you where I said that I would always put you
And i'm heading for the bottom
The bottom of you
And i'm heading for the bottom
...
