All or nothing
All or nothing
It's sometimes life's between what's undecided
And all for nothing
It seems I'm wasting my time
Don't look down on me
Like I dont know anything that I've been doing
You talk down to me
It's time you take a better look inside

I'll never be the same
I'm moving back onto my ways
I'm looking for changes
To better my way
