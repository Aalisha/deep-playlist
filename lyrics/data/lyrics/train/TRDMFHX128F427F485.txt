Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesn't wanna do
Do I live my life with you as my wife?
Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream?

I gotta do this for me
'Cuz if I dont I'll probably regret it
But if I do I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

How do you cope when the one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothin' you can do about it?
How do you deal with the fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career?

I gotta take it though it's heart breakin'
It's somethin' that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live? How do I deal without you?

It's killing me to know that your heart's with me
But you're with him 'cuz I chose to be in this industry
Money, shows and hoes come along with luxury and pain
