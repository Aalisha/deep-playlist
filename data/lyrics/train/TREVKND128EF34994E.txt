I want a love I can see
That's the only kind that means a thing to me
Don't want a love you have to tell me about
That kind of loving I can sure do without
(I can sure do without)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I want a love I can feel
That's the only kind of loving I think it's real
Don't want to be quoted by something I heard now
'Cause baby action speaks louder than words
(Ah, louder than words)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I want a love that's mine
 (I want a love, that's mine)
In the rain or in sun, sun, sunshine
 (I want a love, that's mine)
