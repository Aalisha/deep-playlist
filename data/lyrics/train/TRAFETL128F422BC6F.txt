I'll get away, get in the car
I'll reach the shore before sunrise
And I'll watch the moon and the stars
I'll tell them everything about us

I left last night and I reached the shore
Trying to find everything I lost
In a thousand waves
A million waves oh
Still, somewhere I'm sure
That I will see your face
I will see you there

Oh, morning sun, before you'll rise
...
