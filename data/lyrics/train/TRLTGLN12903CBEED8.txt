Boogie fever
Got to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby to the drive in show
She turned the speaker down
And then she turned on the radio
I watched a silent movie, diggin' funky sound

She's got the boogie fever
She likes to boogie down
Boogie fever
I think it's going around

I took my baby too the pizza parlor
To get a bite to eat
I put some money in the jukebox for her
You know she ate her pizza dancing to the beat
