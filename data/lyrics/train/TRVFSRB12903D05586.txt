Like two ships in the night,
We're colliding and sinking,
Into the black sea of our love.
We navigated past the point of logical thinking,
Lost sight of the stars up above.

Now my heart is a mess.
Murder scene in my chest,
Not a clue how you got through the door.
But I'm glad that you came,
No regret and no shame,
As I'm lying here dead on the floor.

I took a blind leap of faith,
It's not crashing and burning,
With my heart fast asleep in your bed.
I got on the ground safe 
But with my insides turning,
And a picture of you in my head.
