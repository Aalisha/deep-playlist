I never thought that you would come / your sister said
your nerve had gone
You're trying to make it straight right now
but I don't think that you know how
Your sister knows / she wears your clothes / she laughs
at all those things you chose
Your sister knows / takes off your clothes
we use your bed for goodness knows / Ow
I left something where I knew you'd find it
Lift your pillow and you'll see / and he's coming round today
Hey hey / Check out if you're still alive / talking
dirt won't change your life
Listen hard and you can hear her saying not to be so afraid
