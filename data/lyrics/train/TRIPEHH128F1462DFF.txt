Eyes are feeling heavy
But they never seem to close
The fan blades on the ceiling spin
But the air is never cold
And even though you're next to me
I still feel so alone
I just can't give you anything
For you to call your own

And I can feel you breathing
And it's keeping me awake
Can you feel it beating?
My heart's sinking
Like a weight

Something I've been keeping
locked away behind my lips
I can feel it breaking free
...
