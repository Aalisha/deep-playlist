I know the reason you've been cryin'
And I heard she won't be needin' you
How does it feel, bein' the one left behind?

And I heard you found out she's been cheatin'
Oh yeah, and I heard she even told you she was untrue
Well how does it feel being on the outside lookin' in?
(What's a matter baby?)
What's a matter baby, is she hurtin' you?
