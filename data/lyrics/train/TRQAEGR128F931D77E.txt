Ain't another woman that can take your spot my

If I wrote you a symphony,
Just to say how much you mean to me
(what would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful

Would you date me on the regular (tell me, would you?)
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(say "I do")

because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside

Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

You could be my baby, when I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothing crazy
See, all I want you to do is be

My love

(So don't give away)

My love

(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)

Ain't another woman that can take your spot,
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
My love
(So don't give away)
Ain't another woman that can take your spot,
My love
My love
My love
