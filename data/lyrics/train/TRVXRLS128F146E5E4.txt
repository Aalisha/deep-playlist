I've got a quarter in my pocket of an apple left to eat:
It's a wonder that I'm standing on my own two feet.
In the shadow of a thousand veiled Victorian goodbyes
Jewels of litter come to greet me, and it stings my eyes.
Oh it burns like a fire and it pulls me through-
We are parted by desire for the strange and new.
I've got a quarter in my pocket, I'm advancing to the booth,
I am picking up and praying that I talk to you.

And now, I'm halfway home, I'm at the corner of our street,
Would you like to come and meet me?
Now that I am halfway home
Man, I never felt so lonely-
I long for you to hold me now I'm home.
