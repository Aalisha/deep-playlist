Everything 'round them is spinning and turning
But they can't understand
People around me just never stop learning
About the things that I've planned
I've got a way, way of my own

Just look around them they better start thinking
People will lend a hand
They better watch it or else they'll start sinking
With their heads in the sand
I've got a way, way of my own
