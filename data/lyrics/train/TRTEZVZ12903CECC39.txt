You call me up in the mornings
We'll stay on the phone until dawning
You tell me secrets I actually keep
You call me up around noon and
Bring me all the good gossip
You hold my head when I throw up
I hold your hand when you weep

And we talk about friends and we talk about records,
Talk about life and we'll talk about death
And we dance in the living room
Dance on the sidewalks,
Dance in the movies,
Dance at the festivals,
Dance, dance
No men ever really dance like this

Damn! I wish I was a lesbian
Damn! I wish I was a lesbian
