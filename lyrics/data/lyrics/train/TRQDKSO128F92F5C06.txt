Get your hands up
The sky's falling, get your hands up
It's the apocalypse got a mouth full of lambs blood
The dam broke down,
The whole town flooded
Your man couldn't cut it got his fake ass gutted
He uttered something monotone under his breath
Now he's out first round with his hand on his chest
Must've been a cardiac
Now he's searchin' for his Pontiac
To get back to?
To brush up on his battle rap
We hit the hi-hats and make it clap
We wear plaid after Labor Day and still get ass
...
