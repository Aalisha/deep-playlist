Well he's a creature without a care
Except for the fact that he'll only wear
The things he sees in magazines
He is a victim of mass production
I was brought up with my own beliefs
And well, I prided myself on being free
But the powers-that-be invaded me
Looking for some weapons of mass destruction
The first time that I met my mate
Was in a building that houses the things I hate
But she seemed to feel the things I feel
She is the object of my affection
I never thought that you'd care
I can't believe that you're still living there
But you'll always be the last who sees
