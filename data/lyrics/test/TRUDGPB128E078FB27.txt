I see a whole team of chicks tryin' to sit wit us
We're drinkin' dom, smokin' charm, they wanna get wit us
I've got my, VIP section game like that
Goin' bad for J Bad he just came in town

We lovin' Tai on the floor, smokin' Lai wit tips
Ladies in the amazin', 'cuz we in the mix
All the peeps from my hood wearin' timbs and jeans
Lost boyz represent from South Jamaica queens

I'm wit my mens spendin' ends orderin' liquors and beers
Ain't nuttin' new to this we've been doin' this for years
I got my drink on kid, and my cash is right
Shorty might think I'm not gettin' ass tonite?

And wit Malik and Melquan, my man Hassan
Yo shorty what you wearin' is turnin' me on
Takin' me, makin' me wanna bounce wit you
It's alright, we got all night to smoke an ounce or two

Get up and clap yo hands
Come on and clap yo hands
Get up and clap yo hands
Come on and clap yo hands

A few hours in the jam and a fighter
Jeans saggin', Timberland tied up
See my old crew from the mysteries
Big Phil from Queensville still gettin' cheese
