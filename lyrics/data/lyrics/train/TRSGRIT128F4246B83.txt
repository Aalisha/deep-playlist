You were born but you don't know why you're existing
You are unabled why is it you and not me

Your parents they're shocked but still they love you
You are their flesh and blood what else could they do

Not even modern medicine can help your tortured body
Hospitals are your world, doctors your friends
To keep your dreadful life

People never treat you like a normal human being
