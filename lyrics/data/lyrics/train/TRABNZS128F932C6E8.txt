Let me be your weeping willow tree
Surround you with my long limbs
My dear, Let me grow in the shade
In the sands by the bank of your river
Let I drink from your streams
The cool breeze fill my leaves

We will sing together
Water over the pebbles
And I'll stand by your side forever

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
I wish I was a weeping willow tree

I wish I was a weeping willow tree
...
