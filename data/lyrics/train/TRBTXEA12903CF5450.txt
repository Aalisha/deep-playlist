I can't stop this feeling
Deep inside of me
Boy, you just don't realize
What you do to me

Your lips are sweet as candy
The taste stays on my mind
You just keep me thirsty
For another cup of wine

When you hold me
In your arms so tight
You let me know
Everything's alright

I'm hooked on a feeling
I'm high on believing
