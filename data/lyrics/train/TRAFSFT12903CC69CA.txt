When you walked away from me,
And said your last goodbye
I never thought that six months on
You'd still be in my life

I have tried to forget
Get you out of my head
But the memories won't fade
I can run I can hide from this feeling inside
But the pain won't go away

Cause every time I hear your name
The world stops for a moment
...
