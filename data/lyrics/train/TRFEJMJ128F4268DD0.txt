Well, A Cherokee chief as he dances along
Sings an Indian boogie to a white man's song
Singin' "Hey-ho-a-lina"
"Hey-ho-a-lina"
Singin' "Hey-ho-a-lina
"Hey-ho-a-lina"
Singin' "hey-ho-a-lina" oh oh no it's in our heads

Well, he dances over here and he dances over there
Now he's dancing with a squal called standing bear
Singin' "Hey-ho-a-lina"
"Hey-ho-a-lina"
Singin' "Hey-ho-a-lina"
"Hey-ho-a-lina"
A well a "hey-ho-a-lina" oh oh no it's in our heads
