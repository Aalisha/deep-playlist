There was a time when you would come and go
Now theres no time left to react
Just as it starts to heal in comes a bitter end
Well you were already to leave my side and then...

You're coming too close and I can't pretend
That I'll pick you up or let you come in again
We've been through this before, so please understand
That nothing in this heart can save you from the pain you seek
If you pick up the phone please don't call on me
...
