I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets

All the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
When you're loving me

Ooh, girl, let's take it slow
So, as for you, well, you know where to go
I want to take my love
And hate you till the end

It's not like you to turn away
From all the bullshit I can't take
It's not like me to walk away

I'm so addicted to
All the things you do
When you're going down on me
In between the sheets

All the sounds you make
With every breath you take
It's unlike anything
