Did Tommy ask you for a date
No, but I will hope and wait
He's the guy that I am after
All your dates have been disasters
He's the guy I'd like to know
I think I'm in love with Larry
Yeah, he's extra-ordinary
I love my new science teacher
Do you mean that icky creature
Oh, I think I'd better go

refrain:
We'll tell it all about boys
About the way they walk
About the way they talk
...
