when it comes down to the wire
no one will help, every man for himself
when it comes down t the wire
you have to do what you can for yourself

there's a contract out on me
now there's no safe place to be
i'm on the run all day and night
laying low, staying out of sight

i'm not sure if i can take it
i don't know if i can make it
all the money in the world
can't buy a true friend

when it comes down,
down to the wire!
