She hates goin' anywhere in my old truck
She says: It's always muddy and it rides so rough
And there ain't no graceful way to climb up in a dress
Yeah, I'm about as country as she gets.

I might get her on the lake to fish with me
If the water's smooth and the sky is blue with a nice, cool breeze
But anything we catch, I'll have to clean myself
'Cause I'm about as country as she gets.
