And from the ashes a phoenix rose
With wings made of gold
It gently touched me a touch of relief
I was ready to start a new circle
Hoping it would never come to an end
Never too late for hope
The gray ice melted slowly

Where is my world, the beginning of my life bound
Surrounded by light, wandering aimlessly around
Hearing voices, calling my name
While I hover, world's a dark stain

Where is summertime? I'm longing for its warmth
