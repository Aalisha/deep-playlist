The rising moon so bleak and old
Its darkened grin poisons my soul
Mist pledges the darkness
I ride this night - lustful with pride

The lurking mist appears out here
Breaths of evil fire through the snow
This cloudless night smells of fear
Keep my soul - dark and cold

The rise of darkness in my sight
Black forces bound to the moon
