When you're on top of the world
When it's got you down
When your flying through the air
When your crashing to the ground
When your searching for the light
There is no where to be found
Just find me, baby

I don't wanna be the strings
That ever tie you down
I will never be the broken wings
That keep you on the ground

But when we start to sing
I will be the sound
Just let me, baby

I only wanna be the one you love
I only wanna be the one you want
...
