U.S.A. flag burns on the ground.
There is a girl in Rafah,
She's 23 years old, you can see.
She stares at fire with Gaza kids.
Freedom calls they wonder,
Yanqui girl, what a wonder!

There is a girl dancing with muslim girls.
There are people having no faith in you.
She had to tell you just how tired she feels.
There's no solution, I'm wishing my day away, away.

Every night that I come near her, I swear,
I'll protect her when, when with faith we face the day.
Every tear she cries for the city's ruins,
I'll be fighting for, I'll be stronger for,
