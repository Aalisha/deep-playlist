Asfetiu
Asfetiu

Fiends, criminals, slaves, blasphemers
The word of Ra is against ye
Ye are fettered and bound with leather straps
Helpless, doomed, wailing in unendurable torment
Lashed to the forked slave stick by the neck

Lashed to the slave stick
Abata ankh t khet
Neba t steb tcha
Lashed to the slave stick

Ra pronounceth the formulae against thee
The Eye of Horus is prepared to attack thee
