Milk and toast and honey make it sunny
on a rainy saturday, he-he-hey
milk and toast, some coffee take the stuffiness
out of days you hate, you really hate
slow morning news pass me by i try
not to analyse but didn't he blow my
mind this time
didn't he blow my mind?
(here he comes)
to bring a little lovin' honey
to take away the hurt
inside is everything that matters to me
is everyting i want in life
...
