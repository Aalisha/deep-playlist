(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)
(I really wanna be with you)

You and I (You and I)
Two of a kind (Two of a kind)
A meeting of minds
The time of our lives
The perfect night
Out of sight
As I look in your eyes
Never felt so right
Never felt so right

I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
