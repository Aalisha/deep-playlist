I'm fed up with my destiny
And this place of no return
I think I'll take another day
And slowly watch it burn
And it doesn't really matter
How the time goes by
'Cause I still remember you and I
And that beautiful goodbye

We staggered through these empty streets
Laughing arm in arm
The night had made a mess of me
Your confessions kept me warm
I don't really miss you, I just need to know
Do you ever think of you and I
And that beautiful goodbye
...
