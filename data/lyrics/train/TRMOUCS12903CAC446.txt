Don't turn your head
back to the wall
don't close your eyes
and wait for your fall
If you believe that you know in this time
you've got anything to win
if you believe that you know
then I say, "you'll lose all again"
[Bridge:]
In this time there's nothing to get for you
you cannot really do what you want
you're a child, a prisoner in your mind
you are a victim of this hopeless time
You better believe all you do has a sense
it's not for nothing
you better believe all the troubles you have
will play you someday
