In a week or two
I would have been ready
I would have known what to say
But I missed my chance
When the words, "I love you"
Came just a little too late

In a week or two
I was gonna bring you diamonds
In a week or two
A long, long string of pearls and
We would've run down to the river at night
Sailed away, just me and you
In a week or two
...
