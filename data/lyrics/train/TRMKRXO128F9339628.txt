Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

When you are ready I will surrender
Take me and do as you wish
Have what you want your way's always the best way

I have succumbed to this passive sensation
Peacefully falling away
I am a zombie your wish will command me
Laugh as i fall to my knees

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me
Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me

Cannot control this empty delusion lost in the fire below
And you come running your eyes will be open
And when you come back i'll be as you want me only so eager to please
My little song will keep you beside me thinking your name as i sing

Bring it back
Sing it back
Bring it back
Sing it back to me
Bring it back
