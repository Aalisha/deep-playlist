Break these chains 
Break these chains 
And do the things that you wanna do 
Break these chains 
That's all you've got to do 

Ooh it's close to midnight, church bells rings at time 
You open up your eyes and you start to realize 
That there's something evil in you that wants to take control 
Of you mind and of your body, your person and your soul 
...
