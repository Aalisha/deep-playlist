i can't run away from this thing in me
i'm weakening down another now developing
within

i can feel it it's inside my head
connected to my brain this other me is
slowly taking over deep beneath the
eye that
all can see energic visions of the one
i know myself to be

look into my eyes don't listen to their lies
...
