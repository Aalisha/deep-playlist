Staring out the window
I am blinded by
Thoughts surrounding you
I am hypnotized

I'm gonna make believe
You're gonna come with me
Just give me half a chance
Baby you will see

(I'm better)

The day I went away
It was a big mistake
Couldn't turn around
To see your face

(Forget her)

Cause I'd walk a thousand miles
Down this road for you
And I'd climb the highest mountain
And touch the sky for you
For you

(Forget her)

I can feel you growing colder
...
