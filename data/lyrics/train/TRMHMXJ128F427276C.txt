Yeah and this time comes in my life, hey what's your story
Save your conscience
For some other cheap soul Puerto Rican spiritual number
And I thought "The further from home, the closer to you"

I need a whiskey, I'm bleeding gasoline
You play the starring role in my psychedelic dream
Don't need no witness, don't need no referee
They're running hot tonight, her danger symphony

Please don't save me
Don't tell me when it's time to go
It could not faze me
I only want to let you know

Bitch is back, right on track
