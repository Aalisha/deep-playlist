Strolling along minding my own buisness
Well there goes a girl and a half
She's got me going up and down
She's got me going up and down
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
Well I got the notion girl that you got some suntan lotion in that bottle of yours
Spread it all over my peelin' skin baby
That feels real good
All this skirt lappin' up the sun
Lap me up
Why don't you come on and
Lap me up
Walking on the beaches looking at the peaches
