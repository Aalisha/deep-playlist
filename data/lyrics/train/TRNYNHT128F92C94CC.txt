She don't know that she's a lucky girl,
Got the best thing in the whole, wide world,
Got a love that's hard to find,
Got the boy I wish was mine, but.

She has his love but treats him cruel (SHAG-A-DOO-LA, SHAG-A-DOO-LA).

He don't know it, but she cheats on him,
With a boy like that it's such a sin.
