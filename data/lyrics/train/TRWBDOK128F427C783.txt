Who can hold the stars and my weary heart?
Who can see everything?
I've fallen so hard, sometimes I feel so far
But not beyond your reach

I could climb a mountain
Swim the ocean or do anything
But it's when you hold me that I start unfolding
And all I can say is

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Whatever's in front of me
Help me to sing Hallelujah

Oh, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Whatever's in front of me
I'll choose to sing Hallelujah
...
