I walk right by him and he's freezing his ass off
He could be dead I'm supposed to walk away
I won't remember a thing come the summertime
Handful of quarters make me feel okay

Ah ah who's gonna have to pay
Ah ah who do I love today

I love what's mine cause what's mine is all mine
Gives me a reason to go get more
Don't really care where I go to get it
I ain't too clear about "What's yours is yours"

You take it for granted
I guess that's what it's for
But before you demand it
Take a look out your back door
