All that stuff they wear in magazines
All that stuff they do on TV
All that ain't working out for me
So I

Like that, I'm free to comb my hair
Like that, I'm free to rock my wear
Like that, I'm modest with a flare
So I

When I dance I'm gonna do it like this this
When I prance I'm gonna do it like this this
Every chance I'm gonna do it like this this
Like this this gotta be myself
When I smile I'm gonna do it like this this
When I style I'm gonna do it like this this
Honey chil' I'm gonna do it like this this
Like this this
Gotta be myself
