If I said, I mean the world to you
Would you try to call me honey
I always thought I knew
I always thought I knew
I was a part of you, but now I know
No, I don't want to be

I always thought I knew the purest of your love
Everytime you called me honey
But now the words you choose won't ever be enough
'Cause what they mean will only hurt me

'Cause I don't want to hear it this time
I don't want to feel it this time

I don't want to be your baby this time
