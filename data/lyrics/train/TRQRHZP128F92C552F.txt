Keelor/Cuddy

Blue Rodeo

"I hear you talking everywhere
Words on the loudspeakers
Hanging in the air
Everywhere

And I remember the words
You told me too
This town's full of losers
Trying to get a piece of you
You really think that's true

How long will it take
Til you open up your eyes
I've been gone for years
You never even realised

How long How long
How long How long
