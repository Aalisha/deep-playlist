I found out that you care for another guy
I found out that you want for another smile
We are alone as two different people can be
And it's hurting me so just to know that you don't care for me

The other guy won't be around to talk to our kids
He won't understand when you're down the way that I did
We had it all you and I
We just need to try again

I found out that your hearts with another guy
You found out that you're telling another lie
We've come apart, we're going our own separate ways
