The boy left for new york
He left the woods and trees behind
And no one knows just what's on his mind
He says he's lost - he'll pay any cost
Just to find out where he belongs

But the girl left for the country
She left those blaring lights behind
And no one knows just what's on here mind
She says she's lost - she'll pay any cost
Just to find out where she belongs
