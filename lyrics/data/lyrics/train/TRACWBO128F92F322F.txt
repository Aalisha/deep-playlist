You're gonna miss me little baby, the day that I'm gone
You're gonna miss me little darlin', the day that I'm gone
'Cause I'm leavin' in the mornin', won't be back at all

You have run me ragged baby, it's your own fault, you're on your own
You have run me ragged darlin', it's your own fault, you're on your own
...
