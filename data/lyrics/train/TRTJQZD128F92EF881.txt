Too late, too late, too late
I'm tired of your deceivin' and I can't stand you breathin', I'm gone
I'm tired of your deceivin' and I can't stand you breathin', I'm gone

Too late, too late, too late
Tired of all the fussin' and I can't stand the cussin', I'm gone
Tired of all the fussin' and I can't stand the cussin', I'm gone
