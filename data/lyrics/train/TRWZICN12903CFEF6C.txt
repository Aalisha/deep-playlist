Packing up
Ready to leave
Heading out
It's been a good night
Now we're going home

Heading out
Into the dark
Moving fast
Lights cut a path
Through the gathering gloom

Arrive alive...
We're heading for home
Before the dawn comes

Arrive Alive...
Eyes in the night
They're keeping me right
They're guiding me

Arrive Alive...
We're heading for home
Before the dawn comes

Eyes in the night
...
