As I was slowly passing
An orphan's home today
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play

Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry

I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like a flower
I'm growing wild

No momma's arms to hold me
No daddy's smiles
...
