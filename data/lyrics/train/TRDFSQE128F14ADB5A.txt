Flicker inside, I've seen the end my friend
Cannot continue in this life
Abide in the promises told
Abide in the promises proven
Abide in the promises told, abide in

Fan the spark of hope in all is not lost here
I saw the outcome once before
So distant it seems so long ago, he's still alive
Intercession so strong, fan the flame, so close now
Awaken the strength, internal

Write it down, make it plan
I saw the end once before
