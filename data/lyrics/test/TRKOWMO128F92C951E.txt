I wonder who she's seein' tonight
Is she really goin' out with him, he's not her type
And doin' all the things she used to do to me
Well, I'd say something to her, but I get so jealous
When I think of her lovin' somebody else
And I can't think why we ever let go
I must have been crazy
Tell me what kind of fool am I to just let go
To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I, to lose you
She was cold sometimes, but she made me feel alive
