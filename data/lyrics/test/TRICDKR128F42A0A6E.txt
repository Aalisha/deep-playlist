When you wake up
And find me gone tomorrow
Don't think I meant to hurt you
I just did what we knew I had to do.

And all the time we knew
The time was never right for us
Time to leave this love behind
I could never leave you
Baby if I see you cry

I'll say good bye for the two of us
Tonight while you sleep
I'll kiss you softly one last time
And say good-bye

Like I know we must
There's just no other way
And I couldn't bear to see your heart break
So IÂ´ll wait till your asleep to say good-bye
