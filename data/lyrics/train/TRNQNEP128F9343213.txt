If you hurt me, you won't be the first or the last
In a lifetime of many mistakes.
But I won't spend tomorrow regretting the past
For the chances that I didn't take.

'Cause I'll never know 'til it's over
If I'm right or I'm wrong loving you,
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done
Than for something that I didn't do.
