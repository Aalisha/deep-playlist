My eye's a camera
My feelings film
One hour to develop into my own newsreel
I tell you one thing you take it as the opposite
Don't keep me too long
I see no future in this
No future in this

We dance together you got me for tonight
Forget we ever made it in daylight
I only told you, you got it all mapped out
