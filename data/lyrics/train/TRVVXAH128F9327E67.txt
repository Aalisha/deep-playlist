Ooooh yes
Oh babe
Yes babe
Ooooh yes
Oh babe
yes babe
(I hope she answers my prayer tonight)

Open your heart and let me pour my lovin'
inside of you, baby...
You make me feel like livin' and breathin' again
I wanna touch you

Don't say no, just say yes
Your body's what I need
Don't say no, just say yes
I can hear you callin me

Your my diamond that shines all of the time...
oh mercy me, yeah...
