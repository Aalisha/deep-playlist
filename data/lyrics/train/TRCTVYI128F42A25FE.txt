It's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from letting it show
Yeah it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from telling you so
I wasn't looking for love when I found you
Just someone to be with and have a good time
But I get these strange funny feelings around you
When you're not with me, you're still on my mind

And it's all I can do to keep from falling in love with you
All I can do to keep from letting it show
...
