(Real humdinger) yeah
(Real humdinger)

She's got soul
She knows her way to go
She's so fine
I'm so glad she's mine

Cause she holds me tighter
Makes my darkness brighter
And my burden lighter

(She's a real humdinger)
Ooh, baby (real humdinger)
Ooh, yeah

She's sweeter than all the rest
She's my baby, nothing less
