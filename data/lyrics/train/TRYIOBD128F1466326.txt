Every day I get a brand new show
Off TV record and radio
I breeze with the sleaze on my cassette
'Cause I got the affirmative

C30 C60 C90 Go
C30 C60 C90 Go
C30 C60, C30 C60 C90 Go
30 60 90 Go

A bit bam-boogie and a booga-rooga
My cassette's just like a bazooka
A bligger, a blagger, a blippity-blop
Well, I'm going down to the record shop

Yeah, and the boss said, "LP, single, picture cover or plain
I've got all the hits and all the big names
I've got biggest discounts in my store
If you buy three records, I'll give you four"

C30 C60 C90 Go
Off the radio, I get a constant flow
Hit it, pause it, record it and play
Turn it, rewind and rub it away

C30 C60 C90 Go
