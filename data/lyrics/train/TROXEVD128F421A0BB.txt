Everything that isn't from my time and place
Just fades away
And I know it's only my perception
That clouds the things I want to hear you say
All the years of desperation
I'm like a child without the sense to dream
About a life of foolish pride
How can I illustrate
Annihilate it now

This is everything I am
But is it all you've ever grown to see inside
...
