Abandoned word of god
Punishment for broken faith
Saturated floods of fire
Wave by wave i drown in flames

Undying
Condemned to walk this cursed earth
All that remains
Baron decay
Every nerve
Fires in pain
Eternal life in dying days

Condemned to walk this cursed earth
All that remains
Baron decay
Every nerve
...
