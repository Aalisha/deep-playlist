Don't call me
Leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
Cuz I don't
No I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
Cuz I don't
And I won't need you
Time to dial 911
Cuz we're gonna have some fun
Hey boy you know you better run

Cuz it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out
Without you
You better hold tight
Cuz girls nights without you
Let's go GNO
