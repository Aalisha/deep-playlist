Eyes of fire,
Voice like thunder,
She's like a knife that will tear at your soul,
She's out there, and she's hungry,
For the guilty and the innocent,

Like demon, like the angel of night,
She wants to take your soul and watch it ignite,
They want her dead or they want her alive,
But she's a wolf and just doesn't die,

She'll bring you to your knees,
Down to your knees,
No one will hear you scream,
She wolf!

She wolf! She wolf!
In the night she roams,
She wolf! She wolf!
Don't walk the streets alone,
She wolf! She wolf!
In the night she roams,
She wolf! She wolf!
Don't walk the streets alone,

A shiver down my spine,
Another thought running through my mind,
The word is, I'll turn around,
And from the night she will take you down,
...
