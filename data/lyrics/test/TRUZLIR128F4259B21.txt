She told me today I'm in your way
She says your heading somewhere
You've a long way to go
Even more than she knows
She thinks you're half the way there
You've learnt nothing much at all
No doubt you told her that you stayed with me through pity
Honorable you
Oh go away
Make it easy on yourself
Tell them I let you down
I'm not the girl you met oh no
And if I smile just a little
Forgive me but I've read that book as well
And I know. You know

Oh now I'm so intrigued
