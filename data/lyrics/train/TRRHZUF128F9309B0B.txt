I never thought that it would be
She'd get tired of me
And leave me all alone
But she did

Looking back on the argument
All of it seems to turn into a great big blur
Don't recall all that was said, yeah
But this relationship is dead

Dead in the water I thought her response
To my blatant disrespect would be heard
Regular thing, cry a bit
Then eventually get over it, get over it

Not this time, shorty got hip to the game
Not this line, oh, that line would work
I normally could talk a bum into buyin' dirt
I normally could talk a nun up out her skirt but

Not this time, she wasn't going for
For my sweet talk, no, not at all
Nobody to blame, was all my fault
Tried to be slick, messed around and got caught, oh

I assumed she would forgive me
Like every time
But instead she said she's leaving

Click, click, bang, bang
She hit me with click, click, bang, bang
 (Shot right through my heart)
