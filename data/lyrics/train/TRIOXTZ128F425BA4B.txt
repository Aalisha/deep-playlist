Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here?
Am I alone in here?

Knew you were here
Sister confirms suspicions
And besides the note you left on my
Bed where I held you so close...
Did you think I'd forget?
Couldn't be more of a mess
For to breathe used to be another
Way I'd take you in.

Well it's time to wake up
And separate feelings
...
