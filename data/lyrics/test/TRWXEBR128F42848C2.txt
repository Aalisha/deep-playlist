It's all brand new
A precious start with the newest beginning, oh
So fresh and true
You'll just be fine if you let it to set in

(Yeah) This plague will thrive on the weary and beat down
(Yeah) This plague will thrive in the heart of us all

Give me shelter
This place is killing me
Give me shelter
This place is killing me

Your weakness is fear, we're preying on it
Your weakness is fear
You're such a brave start and now we're preying on it
You're such a brave start and now we're preying on it

Just passing through
So out of place and feeling so uninvited, oh
Sad but true
...
