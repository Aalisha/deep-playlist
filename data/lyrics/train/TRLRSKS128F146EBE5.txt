If it's games you want I've played a few
Let me say up front I'll lose to you
I can see you're a beginner
Well beginner's luck runs out
You think you're a winner
But let me tell ya
The winning's not what it's all about
You see, it's about the losing
Can't rest until I'm losing

At first you feel hungry
Then you're thirsty too
Then a desperate feeling comes over you
You think you can beat
What no one has before
