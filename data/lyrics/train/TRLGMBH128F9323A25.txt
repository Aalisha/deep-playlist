You fire words but all they do is ricochet
You think I'm paying the price but it's not costing me
Ur love was a waste of time, you've been left behind
You made no mark on me, you're gone and you left no sign
Ur not on my mind, don't try to press rewind

It's like walking on snow, without leaving a trace
You know what you said never carried away
I came out untouched and in another place
When ya gonna get it
I'm so unaffected

When I was flying high you tried to clip my wings
(You shot me out of the sky)
You tried to make it up by buying expensive things
(My love you cannot buy)
Ur love was a waste of time, you've been left behind
