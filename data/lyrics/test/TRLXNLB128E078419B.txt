Sit yourself down, girl, and talk to me
Tell me what's uh on your mind.
Don't keep on tellin me everythings OK, 
Cause if it was, then you wouldn't be cryin.
You been tossin and turnin in yo sleep lately, 
Sittin round poutin all day long.
Now how in the hell you expect me to understand, 
When I don't even know what's wrong?

Lets straighten it out.
