Why the fighting why the hurting
We could live as one
Don't you see, are you with me?
Why the fighting/why the hurting
We could live as one
Come again, I know you're with me

Watching the world
Spinning on a screen
Nothing in this life
Is ever what it seems

Searching for a higher Vibration
Tuning into entire nations
There's too many sad situations
Come on you know that we could make it right
Searching for a higher Vibration
Tuning into entire nations
There's too many sad situations
