I'm not the most romantic guys,
No, I'm not the one she wants.
But now the night's here and the mood is right,
And the music has just begun.
You said you liked me just as a friend,
You never thought the other way.
Well I said there's nothing wrong with that,
But you never know what could change.

So won't you dance with me, dance with me,
And take my hand, and take a walk with me, walk with me,
I think you're gonna be the one baby, one baby,
I gotta make you understand.

(One Two Three Four)
You went to go dance with your man,
I thought I'd never see you again.
