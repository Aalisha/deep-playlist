[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Messina, Buratto, Lonobile]

More than sweet words, a stream of emotions,
Then around everything disappear,
Hands are cold, tough the breath,
In a moment you possess my desire

Somewhere I'll meet your eyes again,
Under the rays of the moon
you'll be mine, babe
...
