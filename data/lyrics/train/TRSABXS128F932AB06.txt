I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I want your hands on my hips
I want you kissing my lips
I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
I take off your shirt
You pull up my skirt
And I can't wait forever boy

And the moon and the stars
And the look in your eyes
Let 'em find it's way into me, oh
And your skin on my skin
And the bones that we're in
Let you slide your way into me, oh, oh, oh

I want the moon and the stars
I want the whole nine yards
...
