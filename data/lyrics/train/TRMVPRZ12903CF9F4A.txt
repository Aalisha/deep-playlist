started the search in the evening
when did you go?
i didn't understand
'til i got that sinking feeling
that you'd vanished, you're not coming back
i felt shivers on my skin, my heart speeding up
felt scarce under the bright lights
but i've got the will, and i'm gonna win
cos i can spark fear with my eyes


but then, should've known you were that kind of guy
i could see it in your face


you go and turn your back and walk away
