My life

My block, my spot, my stop stay hot
My truck, stay dropped, my weight stay glocked
My city, my hoes, my friends, my foes
Everybody knows, keep it real or get John Doe'd

My hair stay nappy, stay bush, stay twist
My attitude is shitty, my hands stay fist
My house stay searched, my cars stay getting stopped
Haters they hate, they wanna see me in a box

But my bulletproof vests, they protecting my chest
Life ain't nothing but a test, it's a big ol' mess
My money stay getting bigger, even when I'm in jail
My name C lil' daddy, that mean you better chill

My life, my life, my life
My life ain't right, so I'ma fight all night
My life, my life, my life
This be the truest shit I ever said, feel me

My life, my life, my life
My life ain't right, so I'ma fight all night
My life, my life, my life
This be the truest shit I ever said, feel me
