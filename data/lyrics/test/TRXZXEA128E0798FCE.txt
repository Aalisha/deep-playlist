Into my life you bought a glowin love,
like a ray of sunshine from up above, ha
One day out of the clear blue sky,
You darkened my world with the words good-bye.
That's the day you left me for a stranger yeah baby baby
When you left my life you've gone an you changed ah... baby I'm a tellin' you it Ain't no sun since you been gone... Ooo ooo...

Theres a big black cloud hanging over my head,
its a cloud of lonliness and I feel like I'm dead, Ha!
Ain't no flowers bloomin' down at the shore
Since you chose to love me no more.
