Oh, next light bust a right
It's not gonna be too hard
If there's no parking on the street
Pull up on their front yard

Don't bring no vodka or whiskey
We've got everything you need
Just bring a pair of your dancing shoes
And get down to this beat

Let's go down, wash that sugar down
You gotta realize

That there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
Better believe that it's gonna be
The biggest night of the year

Because there ain't no party
Like the party going on in my house
But it would be so much better
If you were only here
...
