When I said I had no doubts while I tried to comfort you - did I tell
you that I lied? When I gave you confidence though I feared the things
I knew only secretly I cried Even when I felt so sad always tried to
keep my smile still don't know if I was right But though my force was
fading away, even my tears they dried out some day ... finally I realised

And you gave me reasons forever
Did you feel the faith you brought into my life
