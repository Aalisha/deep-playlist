[Verse 1:]
Imagine I caan tek this country what we live in
Look how much money wi haffi fi pay fi chicken
Rice and flour and cornmeal is a sin

Caan even get sugar now fi do some sweetening
A soon run left Jamaica and go live in a foreign

Unno help me now hmm

But that was long before it raise si ya bwoy

Come again one more time deh fi mi oh, hear mi now
