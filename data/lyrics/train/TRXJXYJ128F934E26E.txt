I hope (that) into this morning
sun will explode on me
I hope (that) into this crawling
(the) floor will subside with me

"I embrace this mutation
now I hear laughing within me
seven days for seven questions
and the padlock still never opened"

I hope (that) into this morning
sun will explode on me
I hope (that) into this crawling
(the) floor will exchange for me

I believe in everything
