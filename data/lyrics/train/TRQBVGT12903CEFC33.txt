I'm gonna fight, in the Metal night
My guardian angel is my sword
I hear the call, I see the light
I'm gonna give my life for my lord
The quest is long and the end is near

I sail away in seas of doom
My shield is strong and I got no fear
I'm gonna face the enemy soon

The night is cold and the air is clear
The enemy could be anywhere (beware)
The serpent's eyes enlarge with fear
