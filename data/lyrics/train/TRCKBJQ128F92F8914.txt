I learned the lord is my master
Though his name I no more chant
I removed my silver crucifix
Harken not to the preacher's rant
My only bible has been burned
That was the last time I kneeled
Nothing in church I ever learned
Only my selfish urge I'd yield

I traitorous
Am treasonous

Sworn allegiance I desert
To sin and lust I convert
My unbelief prevaricates
The adobe of hell my soul awaits

So I burn
Oh they feed me flames
At the stake I taste the merciless fire
