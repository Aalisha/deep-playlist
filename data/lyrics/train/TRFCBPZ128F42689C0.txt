Lines are broken
They've given motor skills
Take at face value
The direction that suits you
Move with the pull
A generous function
The x-ray of today
The only one that greets you is the half-ass hand

Close to open
Don't give a shit
Take at face value
The half ass hand
The one that deceives you
...
