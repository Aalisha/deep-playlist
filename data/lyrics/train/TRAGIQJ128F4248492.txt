Another night turns into day
I haven't slept yet, but I'm okay
See if you dabble with fire, there'll be hell to pay
I might as well have a drink to wash away the pain

More cocaine, the devil's in my system, he won't go away
My mind wanders further but I'm not insane
This is just my life, my reality
I've got my pistol on the side of my waist

Don't start, no shit and I won't shoot up the place
My aims kinda bad and my eyes are glazed
But I brought extra clips just in case

Here I am again on the lower east side
Doing my thing, I'm damned
...
