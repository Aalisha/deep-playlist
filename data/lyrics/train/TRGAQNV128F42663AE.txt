Ooh, it's heaven here
Oh, baby, now
Oo-ooh...

Huggin' you and kissin' you is all I wanna do
Baby, I'm in heaven when I'm in your arms
Huggin' you and kissin' you is all I wanna do
Baby, I'm in heaven when I'm in your arms

I found an angel
You're the one who means the world to me
You brought joy that I longed for, baby
Your love is everything that I've dreamed

Huggin' you and kissin' you is all I wanna do
Baby, I'm in heaven when I'm in your arms
Huggin' you and kissin' you is all I wanna do
Baby, I'm in heaven when I'm in your arms

All of my life dear dear
There were prayers for love I'd been denied
It's wonderful every time you're near, sugar
'Cause you're the kind of guy that makes me feel my
Prayers have been answered, I've waited for years to be
