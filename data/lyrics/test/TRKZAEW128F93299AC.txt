You live the story
of the innocent life's defeat of solitude's dice
captivated by a moonbeam, chained to dispisers of your love
captivated by dispisers, lost in the canyons of your mind

left alone at some old window, leaving paper dreams to fly
hear the wind whispering gently calling you to dream away

So fly away in a staggering paper plane
don't be afraid when somebody takes your game

High above the town soars a little boy in his paper plane
astonished he peers down, the houses look like toys from his paper plane
