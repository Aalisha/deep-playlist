Woman of the country
Now, I found you
Longing in your soft
And fertile delta

And I whisper sighs
To satisfy your longing
For the warm and tender
Shelter of my body

Oh, you're mine delta lady
Your mine, be all mine
Delta lady

Please don't ask
How many times I found you
Standing wet
And naked in the garden
