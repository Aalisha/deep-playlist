I used to feel so invincible
'Til I was seconds away from losing everything
There's nothing worse than feeling alone
And my world was falling
With no one to catch me
It all seems to trivial
I guess I'm not as strong
Not even close

I'm on my own
Never been more afraid to leave
Our love has gone
Hand in hand and we'll sing this song
We've lost our homes
It's only gonna get better
If we work as one
Tomorrow can be brighter for us all
