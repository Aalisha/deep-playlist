I'm gonna tell the truth,
The truth about you,
Truth about you
You never been true
You ain't nothin
You got nothing to say
Shine a light on you
You fade away
Fade away

I'm gonna tell the truth,
The truth about you,
Truth about you
You never been true
You ain't nothin
You got nothing to say
Shine a light on you
You fade away
Fade away

I'm gonna tell you the truth,
Woke up.
the truth about you,
still drunk
truth about you
throwin' up
you never been true
pissin blood
you ain't nothin
sick guts
you got nothing to say
sore skin
shine a light on you
burned out
you fade away
holded in
Fade away

I'm gonna tell you the truth,
can't move
the truth about you,
can't speak
truth about you
cracked head
...
