Come on everybody, come in here and swing
Everybody come on everybody, come in here and swing

Move to a rhythm that's smooth, made to groove
Work that body baby it's a party
Shake it, funky ain't it?
Yeah, the long awaited return of fluent movement-enhanced music
Ain't nothin' but to do it
Manoeuvre to a sound that's makin' you wanna dance to it
Nod ya head, clap ya hands and shake that ass to it
Hit the floor, it's yours, assuming that's what ya came here for
Why play the wall'n'all
The flavour's so raw get in sync with the sound
Come on and get down
...
