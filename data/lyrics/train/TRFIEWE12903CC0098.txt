hey yo every time hear some real hip hop man I start thinking... yo I"m still in love man ...listen 
I'm in booth like prison 
lid like lift
if music's like woman 
i'm whipped like a nymph 
i love to keep it pushing 
like the basement speakers 
love hearing real hip hop and making heaters
born entertainer 
armed with the flamer 
if they bust shoots with it
come on it's the blamer
got the place to loose it 
booth shaking to it 
true gangster music 
screwface included 
macho lingo 
the beat'll remind you
of the quatro cinco 
or cinco de mayo 
put it in your car 
turn the sound sky high 
Ra down the block sound like a drive by
keep chicks moving 
heat keep them open 
put em in the mood and they leave something broken
D.J set the scene to it in the club
...
