Sittin on the shelf, they got me stuck up in this box
Choppin it up with the homies, havin visions of a glock 17
Niggas on my team can't wait to fill clip up
We jumpin out the barrel with my niggas, shootin shit up
See under niner ross, black talon, hollow tips flow
Aim me at the chest, I'm makin sure that vest don't get no love
Ain't even breathin, leave the body shittin like a seagull
See I'm illegal, I got pockets like that? eagle
F**kin around with me is danger, I'm talkin shit
Tryin to brainwash the trigger when I'm in the chamber
Don't give a f**k if it's a accident or on purpose
When I'm comin out the chamber, fool it's just inservice
Don't get nervous when you see what I do
I love to hit the target, and when I'm breakin that skin, ooh
Travel through his heart, ricoch√©t off the nearest bone
Rip his insides up, shatter his spine, now I'm gone
Layin by the body, waitin for the FEDS
Swoop me up for evidence, then I'm just some melted led
It ain't no thang, got me back where I started
In a box, with my homies, waitin for my next target

Ha ha ha, the mothaf**kin bullet
Shootin up shit everywhere
Every city in every state
Don't give a f**k about who when the bullet fly
The only thought that's on my mind is "die nigga, die"
Ha ha ha

But what do ya know, looks like I'm 'bout to be purchased again
I seen a nigga ask for them black talons and grin
