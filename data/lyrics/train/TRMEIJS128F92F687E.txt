If you'd had made a tag on the back
Of those designer jeans she's wearin'
It's some big name brand you can't buy at a Wal-mart
And you from what she's got on

From her Versace to her Louis Vuitton
You wouldn't think she'd know every Merle Haggard song by
heart

But when it comes down to the heart of the situation
She's a little rockin' honky tonkin' modern day Minnie
Pearl
I should know, I've been all across this great nation
