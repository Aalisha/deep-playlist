Kill your enemies
My brothers dead around me
Wounds are hurting
Death is creeping for me

Smoke is blinding
Hearts are pounding
Chaos soon ignites
The call is made, it's one for all
Will I meet my maker?

Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now, it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die

God has spoken through his conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken through his conscience
