I? m calling out but there? s no one to hear me
I? m so afraid 'cos there? s nobody near me
All that I? ve got are the memories of Tuesday
I can? t remember anything she said

Then in a moment my head starts spinnin'
Around in a circle, no end or beginnin'
An' just when I think that the whole world? s turnin'
I open my eyes an' discover that life is just burnin' down

But this man stands his ground
For when there? s nothin' left I? ll fight for every breath

Don? t turn your back on me, baby
I? m takin' all my chances
Why can? t you hear what I? m sayin'?
