We might be in for a late night
Stuck in a lava flow of brake lights
I can hear a rattling bass drum
Driving back to where it came from

Sit back, oh

I shop, therefore, I am the cause
Protect me from what I was

Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Timing is everything, timing is everything
Timing is everything, timing is everything
Timing is everything, timing is everything
