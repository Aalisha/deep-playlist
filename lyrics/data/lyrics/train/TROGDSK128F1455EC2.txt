(You Don't Want My Love)

In the summertime, when all the trees and leaves are green
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue
'Cause you don't want my love ...
Some other time, that's what you say, when I want you
Then you laugh at me and make me cry
'Cause you don't want my love.

You don't seem to care a thing about me
...
