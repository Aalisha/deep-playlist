Kiss me, kick me, anyway you want it
Just don't leave me hanging on
Smack me, slap me, anyway you like it
Just don't leave me at your feet
Please me, tease me, satisfy my needs
Your passion has me hypnotized
Feel me, heal me, wanna see the real me
Dance until you're paralyzed

You're a bad boy, I'm a dirty girl
You're a bad boy, I'm a dirty girl
You're a bad boy, I'm a dirty girl
You're a bad boy, I'm a dirty girl
You're a bad boy, I'm a dirty girl
...
