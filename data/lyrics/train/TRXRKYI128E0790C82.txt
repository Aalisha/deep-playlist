Get on up and get away
Get on up and get away
Get on up and get away
Get on up and get

Pick your feet up
Just a little higher
Move your legs
From side to side

Clap your hands
Just a little bit louder
Come on, girl
Let's dance

Get on up and get away
Get on up and get away
Get on up and get away

You can Shing-A-Ling
And sock, sock, sock it to me
Girl, and sock it to me
Girl, so take heed from what I say
