Glowing and blazing
In the wind of times
Ever lit
Searching and fathoming

The fire's arcane
Consuming flames
Sparks to imbue
Our very souls

Pervading
The very breath of life
Flickering from the depths
Of eternity

Never asleep
Never extinct
Not ever ceasing to gleam
Never sear
The sempiternal embers

Never profaned
Never fail
Not ever ceasing to refine
Never forfeit
Never faint
The sempiternal embers

The essence of being
...
