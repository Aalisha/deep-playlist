What were you doing when you sis the things you did
what were you saying when you said the things you
said no I can't comprehend anything you're saying I
don't understand this fucked up game you're playing
OK we've come full circle and are you willing to stand
by what you said cuz I'm not willing to go around and
around with you any longer
