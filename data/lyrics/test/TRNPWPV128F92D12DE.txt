Together we can beat those feelings alright
I'm sure no one's gonna show up for the fight
We'll just stand here, shaking, writing on the walls

And though you know for sure that this is the night
No one's gonna turn up and make things right
We'll just stand here, beating on the walls

Joy and pain switching lanes, so so lame
...
