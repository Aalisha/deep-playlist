Verse 1:

Im sick of all these folk telling lies to me
Trying to steal my dreams and I cant believe
The one I trusted with my life took everything
That he could steal from me I didnt know a thing
My momma crying to me cause she's tired of working
And she aint healthy, and its killing me
Cause I know I worked enough to help my family
But they still struggling, Im going CRAZY! OHHHH

Chorus:
No More, No More, No More, No More, No More
(I can't take this no more, No More)
No More, No More, No More, No More, No More
(No more, Just cant take this no more)
No More, No More, No More, No More, No More
(I cant take this no more, Oh Yeah)

Verse 2:
