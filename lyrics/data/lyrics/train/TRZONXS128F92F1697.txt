If I could be you
And you could be me
For just one hour
If we could find a way
To get inside
Each other's mind, mmm
If you could see you
Through your eyes
Instead of your ego
I believe you'd be
Surprised to see
That you'd been blind, mmm

Walk a mile in my shoes
Walk a mile in my shoes
Hey, before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes

Now your whole world
You see around you
Is just a reflection
And the law of karma
Says you're gonna reap
Just what you sow, yes you will
...
