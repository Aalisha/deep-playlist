With my raincoat on

It's alright baby hold my hand
I ain't tryin to be your man
Let's take it slow
Relax a little
Make it so it's naturable
As a matter of fact
Let's take it black
To the very first day I had your back
We shared a cab
Shared a laugh
Shared a glass
And I kissed yo ass
Kissed yo lips after class
We both had history after math
Passin' notes, teachers askin' for 'em
I read 'em out loud to the class
Like a poem or a rap
Say it liked I mean it
When my big toe tap
Hand them back and forth like that
If you like what your hearin'
You can meet me out back (out back)

With my raincoat on
In the heart of the sun
With my raincoat on
In the heart of the city

I la-la-lost my mind
I la-la-lost my lady
