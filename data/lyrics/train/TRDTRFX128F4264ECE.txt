It wasn't the books that I didn't read
It wasn't the teachers that tried to teach me
It wasn't that varsity baseball coach
Kept on tellin' them locker room jokes

It was Bobby Ann Mason, back in high school
She was way too cute, she was way too cool
How was I gonna get an education
Sittin' right back of Bobby Ann Mason

Well, Bobby knew her hist'ry, Bobby knew her French
Bobby knew how to keep the boys in suspense
She'd tease with a touch, she'd tease with a kiss
I was three long years being teased by, pretty Miss
