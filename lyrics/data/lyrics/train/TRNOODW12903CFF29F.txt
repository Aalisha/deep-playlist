Born under the moon of the elven goddess of battle.
Raised by the elves, the mighty dwellers of the woods.

Many shall be thy enemy,
and great is the danger that'll seek you.
Signs of your birth made you to be the one,
So carry your sword with honour.

For many years he fought, many years he spent in battle.
Soon was to be known the divine strength of this elven youngster.
