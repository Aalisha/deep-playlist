I wake up in the morning
and the sun begins to shine
the day did sneak up on the night
I see your face and I see myself
and I get a little taste of life
I try to stand it for a while

But I'm in a trance
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
I'm in a trance
I take too much in the Saturday night
Hey... Hey
Hey baby tell me can't you hear me calling
...
