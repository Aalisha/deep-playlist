A different attitude of mind is not something to be persecuted
No world government knows justice and truth from organised crime
Do you think that someone telling you what's right and what's wrong means liberty?
I don't

Film stars on the silver screen
If there's one thing I know from TV, good things don't happen to ugly people
A perfect smile's a good guy thing, they get the girl and they always win
Good things don't happen to ugly people

You were born to be the bad guy, make the hero look good and be despised
You know it's wrong but it feels so right, nothing to lose and you're going to die
You were born to be the bad guy, make the hero look good and be despised
