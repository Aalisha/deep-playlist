She`s black smoke forming across the sky
I ask for water and she brings me wine, she brings me wine
She's one part angel, the other part sin
I say I'm tired and she says, let`s go again
Let`s go again
[Chorus:]
My kind of, my kind of beautiful
Lover and friend
If I`m dreaming, please don`t wake me up
I wanna see how, how the story ends
