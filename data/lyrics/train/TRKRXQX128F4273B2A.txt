Dee Dee Na Na Na

Saturday night
I feel the air is getting hot
Like you baby
I'll make you mine
You know I'll take you to the top
I'll drive you crazy

Saturday night, dance!
I like the way you move
Pretty baby
It's party time and
Not one minute we can lose
Be my baby

Da ba da dan dee dee dee da Nee na na na
be my baby
Da ba da dan dee dee dee da Nee na na na
Pretty baby

Saturday night
I feel the air is getting hot
Like you baby
I'll make you mine
