In the morning
She gone crazy
With a painted picture
Her father's story.

Bone China, my friends...
Bone China, let the summer come again, come again.
I said oh, oh
She be dancing by the moonlit sky
Oh oh
She be moving like a butterfly
Oh oh
She be drinking all my early times
I'm just a waitin' on that dream
...
