How can You forgive me when I've often gone astray?
How can You think of me when I do things my way?
Turning my back from You, the one who loved me first
Having my own desires, renewing my worldly thirst

You told me You loved me and I should make up my mind
You tell me come back now, but I keep wasting time
Feeling so very weak, You say I can be strong
But I feel I've gone too far, but You tell me to come home
You love me still and I know this is real

And I am running back to You, I see You're standing there for me
