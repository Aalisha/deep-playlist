Don't have to humble yourself to me
I ain't your judge or your king
Baby, you know you ain't no Queen of Sheba

We may not even have our own dignity, no
This could be just a prideful thing
Baby, we can choose, you know we ain't no amoebas

But are you ready for this thing called love?
Don't come from me and you, come from up above
I ain't no porcupine, take off your kid gloves
Are you ready for this thing called love?

And you ain't some icon carved out of soap
Sent down here to clean up my reputation
Baby, I ain't your prince charming

Now we can live in fear or act out of hope
For some kind of peaceful situation
...
