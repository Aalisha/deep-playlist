From nowhere
To a caravan
Around the campfire light
A lovely man in motion
With hair as black as night
His eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotised me with love
Mmmmm
He was a gypsy man
Lord knows he was a gypsy man
Listen
He danced and danced around
To the guitar melody
And from the fire his face was all aglow
How he enchanted me
