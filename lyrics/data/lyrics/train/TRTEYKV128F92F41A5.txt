Cry in vain

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (Go, Go)
'Cause of the words that I wrote
I'm certified dope
I'm certified dope
I'm certified dope
'Cause of the words that I spoke
I'm certified dope
I'm certified dope
I'm certified dope

We do not need sleep we guarantee to break alarm clock clock clock
Certified dope we're pullin workin till on top top top top 
Certified dope I murder words please make it stop stop stop stop
Certified dope I murder words please make it make make make it

I'm certified dope (dope)

Straight to the top but what if i dont?
