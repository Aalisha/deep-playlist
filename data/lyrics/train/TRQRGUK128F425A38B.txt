Painted a perfect picture
And busted my frame
With all this cheap ass talking
You need an oxygen tank
If you're gonna do it, do it right
Got to catch the flow, got to hit em low
I get high between the thighs
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Someone's always watching me
Turn on the news and hear what I'm gonna do
Before it ever happens to me
With a slip of the tongue
I'm in deep shit
I'm so bad off I can taste it
Bury myself with a slip of the tongue
