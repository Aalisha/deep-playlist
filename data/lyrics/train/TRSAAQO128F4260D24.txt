Would you believe me
If I said I was sorry?
The question wasn't meant to hurt
It was just my fear of losing you

And now you're filling
All the space that surrounds you
I'll soon be tucked away
Underneath your bed

Where you gave yourself to me
Where I gave myself to you

Maybe it's all for the best
But I just don't see any good in this, no
Maybe we'll find something better
But the lovers that leave us
Will always hold the place
