I can see it in her letters on the paper with her pen
Her response is getting stranger
Think she's coming round again
So tell me, Mrs. Rita, what's it say in my tarot
Read my palm and tell me why do lovers come and go

Is she coming round for me once again
Around or was that the end
I just hope she's coming round again

I've been keeping myself busy with my books and with my tapes
And every day's much better since I've slowed my drinking pace
...
