The change will do you good
I always knew it would
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour

Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
The sins of the flesh
Are simply sins of lust

Sweat's running down your back
Sweat's running down your neck
Heated couplings in the sun (Or is that untrue?)
