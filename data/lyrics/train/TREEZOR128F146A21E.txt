I wish that I could fly
Into the sky
So very high

Just like a dragonfly

I'd fly above the trees
Over the seas
In all degrees

To anywhere I please
Oh, I want to get away
I want to fly away
Yea, yea, yea
I want to get away
I want to fly away

Yea, yea, yea
Let's go and see the stars
The Milky Way or even Mars

Where it could just be ours
Let's fade into the sun
...
