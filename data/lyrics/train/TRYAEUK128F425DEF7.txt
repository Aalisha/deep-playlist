I just shook the handshake, I just sealed the deal
I'll try not to let them take everything they can steal
People always told me don't forget your roots
I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots

[You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds and you watch it goYour fairweather friends on a parachute binge get lost when the wind blowsThe handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongueIt tastes like death but it looks like fun]

I was a loner, I was just waiting by myself
When you, warped temptress rose to bring me happiness and wealth
Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
