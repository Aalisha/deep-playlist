in the morning upside down,
in the evening round and round,
i'm so tired i've lost my eyes,
could someone prop me up 'gainst a wall?
got this thing what makes my lids fall...

if i bask i'm bound to burn,
if i read i'm bound to learn,
i'm a thief what stole you twice,
could someone glue these shoes to the ground?
got this thing what makes me spin round and round and round and round and round

no i'll never believe the truth in you, lies are much more fun.
no i'll never believe the truth in you, lies are much more fun.

no i can't, no i won't, no i can't, no i won't, no i can't, no i won't,
goodbye goodbye i'm closing my ears.

planting trees like planting leaves,
broken toes and then she leaves,
...
