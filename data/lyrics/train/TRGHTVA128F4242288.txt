Hey yeah, yeah
Oh-h
Hey yeah, yeah
Oh-h
Hey yeah, yeah
Oh-h

I've only got three dollars left in my hands
I walk down the sidewalk as I pass a dirty man
Walk up the staircase that leads to my hotel
I'm living in at a fancy hotel yeah, yeah

Then I'll go up to my room
Fixate on what's the deal I'm alone again
Then I will crawl into the bed
And call you up to tell you off

Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone?
Before I lose my mind because you lied and so did I
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y if I let you go tonight?
