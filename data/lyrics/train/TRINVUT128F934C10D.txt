This world is ours and we won't stand still
Infinitude sets thy vision toward the deep
Civilization will fall by the hand of all disease
Banished of all life and awoken from the grave
Eternal light will now be washed away
Desecration; proclamation
How it feels to be demoralized
The life you live is now rotten and cold
