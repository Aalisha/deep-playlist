We're all gonna die someday, Lord
We're all gonna die someday
Mama's on pills, daddy's over the hill
But we're all gonna die someday

Well, it hurts down here on Earth, Lord
It hurts down here on Earth
It hurts down here 'cause we're running out of beer
But we're all gonna die someday

We're all gonna die someday, Lord
We're all gonna die someday
Mama's on pills, daddy's over the hill
