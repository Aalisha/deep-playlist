written by J. Lieber and M. Stoller

There's a man in town all the women know
He goes by the name of Nosey Joe
He don't care if they're married
He takes his pick
Long as they're women, he's ready to stick

His big nose in their business
His big nose in their business
That's Nosey Joe, the nosiest guy I know

He ain't good lookin' and he ain't big and stong
