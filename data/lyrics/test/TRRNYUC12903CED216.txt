We climb aboard the eagle made of steel
Get ready for another flight
Another town, another city will appear
Through the darkness of the night

A flash of light
There's thunder on the way
The stage ignites when we play metal soldiers

And we're marching through the night
Metal Soldiers
Clenching fists of metal might

Out on the road, the battle has begun
...
