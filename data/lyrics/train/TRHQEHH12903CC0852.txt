It can feel so good to run away, I know the feeling
But you're not this person here today, your secrets keep you
Standing on the edge of what you'd be
Standing on the edge of what you'd be

And when you say what you saw, I'll be right there
Helping you feel through the years
Hiding your fear doesn't help you but I'm here
Helping you feel through the years

Open up your mouth and say the words
You know the ones
You danced around as if you never heard
