Do you remember on that day
We took you down off of the cross
And shot your ashes into space
Oh, what a waste of time to believe
You would ever come back to life
The resurrections were all faked
As the earth trembled and quaked
And all the stars fell from the sky
And all the pagans began to smile and sing

You remind me of a wolf in Jesus skin
I think it's safe to say the drugs are kicking in
(As you begin) to howl under the Baltimore moon
(As you begin) to shapeshift into a Christ-like cartoon

Come sting your teeth deep inside
This wet and elegant bride
Show her the time of her life
