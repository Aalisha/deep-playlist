Wanna know you better
Wanna push you baby
But never too far
Wanna show you heaven
Wanna be like you
Just as strong as you are

I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be love only stronger
I wanna be daylight

Wanna live forever
Wanna touch your hand and explode like a star
Wanna stand beside you
Always be together wherever you are

I wanna be daylight in your eyes
I wanna be sunlight only warmer
