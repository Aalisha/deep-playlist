When darkness falls and another world calls
I stand alone here in my cell
This new life tastes so bittersweet
An ironic twist in my private hell

(Counting) Counting the sands of time (time)
(Counting) Counting the sands of time (time)

These are my dreams and my voiceless cries
Cross the landscapes of my mind
