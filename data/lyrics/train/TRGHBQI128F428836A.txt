I said, Hello I think I'm broken.
And though I was only jokin'
It took me by surprise when you agreed.
I was tryin to be clever
But for the life of me I never
Would have guessed how far the simple truth would lead.
You knew all my lines. You knew all my tricks.
You knew how to heal that pain no medicine can fix.

And I bless the day I met you.
And I thank God that he let you
Lay beside me for a moment that lives on.
And the good news is I'm better for the time we spent together.
