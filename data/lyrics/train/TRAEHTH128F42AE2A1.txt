i've seen many countries
argue about human lives
but one thing that stays the same is
the clubs are always full at night

pick out any far-out place
like kenya or swaziland
doesn't matter what the place
they'll still be dancing to the band

(mumble mumble jumble)
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble)
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble) what he say?
(garble warble farble)
(mumble mumble jumble) what he say?
(garble warble farble) let's dance!
