Early in the evenin'
Just about supper time
Over by the courthouse
They're starting to unwind.

Four kids on the corner
Trying to bring you up.
Willy picks a tune out and he blows it on the harp.

Down on the corner,
Out in the street
Willy and the poorboys are playin'
Bring a nickel, tap your feet.

Rooster hits the washboard
And people just got to smile
Blinky, thumps the gut bass

And solos for a while.
