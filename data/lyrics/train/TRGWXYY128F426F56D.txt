Nah nah oh
Nah nah oh
Nah nah mmmm
Yeah yeah

It's been on my mind, on my mind
It's just a matter of time, cause I
No matter how hard
How hard I try to hide
I still be want you
Inside, inside my arms
And even if you said you would leave
Cause I ain't ready, ready
Would just give me the need
Give me a meaning to leave
And my heart would belong to you
Before I would even know
Damn if you stay
Damned if you don't
Cause baby I

oh oh (yeah)
I be hatin on you
Hatin, hatin on you
You, you
Every time it feels so right
Cause of the things that you do
Do, do (oh)
I be hatin on you, Hatin
Hatin on you, You
You, you
Hating on you, oh
You, you, you
Hatin on you

And I
I don't wanna believe
That we could live the life I'm dreaming of
