There ain't no use in me trying to tell you how I feel
'Cause what I feel ain't what you're feeling
I don't know what we did wrong, I just know if you come home
I ain't gonna let you break my heart again

There ain't no use in me trying to find out where you've been
'Cause where you've been ain't where I'm going
'Cause if I ask you where you've been the hurting starts and it don't end
So I ain't gonna let you break my heart again
No, I ain't gonna let you break my heart again
