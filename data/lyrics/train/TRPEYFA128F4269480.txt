x2:
Mesopotamia, Mesopotamia
You fucking give me the creeps,
You fucking give me the creeps

x2:
I've never known another city to burn

Face down in the bottom of a river,
Swimming with the dead makes me wanna shiver,
If you really wanna know,
I'd rather just drown alone

Clay fingers reaching for the ceiling
Once numb, now tingling with feeling
You'll see in the end that nothing really gets away
