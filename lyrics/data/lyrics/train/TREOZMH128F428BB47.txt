I've had one of those days today

I'm in one of those moods and it's just no good
Nothin' I want to talk about
I just need for you to take me out
And do the town, turn it upside down

I need one of those nights tonight
Wanna go left where the world goes right
Lost my appetite for this side of midnight
Wanna burn out those neon lights
Past the point of Fahrenheit
I wanna feel my heart ignite while you hold me tight
I need one of those nights tonight
...
