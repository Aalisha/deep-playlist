The girl has got the touch
What she got is a little something
That kind of girl
Maxi Priest just make them know
She's the kind of woman
Who lets you know
When she knows what she wants
She won't let go
Takes you to a place of your fantasy
Walks you to the door
But she holds the key
CHORUS
That girl(ooh) that kind of girl
That girl(ooh) that kind of girl

No matter who you are
Or what you do
She knows how to click
In everything you do
She can make you hot
When it's cold outside
Take you on a high
Even make you fly
CHORUS
Mmmmmmm, she's outspoken
I'm heartbroken
