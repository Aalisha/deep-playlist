I got my plans from trembling hands
I knew just what to do
Follow each step carefully
And hope they pulled me through

My father ran to different lands
And not a word we spoke
But I was here to conquer fear
And bring some glory home

There’s a world of hate and sorrow
Out there standing in your way
There’s a load of compromise
Before you die

And each time you step forward
You get burned a little bit
No longer know the way
To say goodbye

Now I’m down here underneath
Your bedroom light
Oh, Rena please come out
With me tonight
