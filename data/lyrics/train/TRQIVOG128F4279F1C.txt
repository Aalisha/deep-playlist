I used to think the world was flat
Rarely threw my hat into the crowd
I felt I had used up my quota of yearning

Used to look in on the children at night
In the glow of their Donald Duck light
And frighten myself with the thought of my little ones burning

But ooh, the tide is turning
The tide is turning

Satellite buzzing through the endless night
Exclusive to moonshots and the world title fights
Jesus Christ, imagine what it must be earning

Who is the strongest, who is the best
Who holds the aces, the East or the West
This is the crap that our children are learning
