NATURAL QUATERNION (Performed by the Elements)

I. SYLPHS

I see the border of the wild wood
An endless raving tide
Electric view from altitude
The forest spreading far and wide

I'm staring on these discomposed seas
Imbibing gummy smells
The blankets rise above the trees
Decolourising scenic dells

THE LABYRINTH OF LANES
AMONG THE GALLERIES OF MEADOWS
A CHARMING OUTDOOR MUSEUM
THE PATHLESS ROCKY CHAINS
AND SOMBRE HOLTS IN SHADOWS
MAGNETIC VISIONS FROM A PREDAWN DREAM

II. GNOMES

Amid the stalks enamelled by a silver web
Bestead by oaks drowsing in the nature's lap
I sop the motley chips of dreams they saw the night before
I hear the pulsing flumps of the enormous wooden core

THE LABYRINTH OF LANES
AMONG THE GALLERIES OF MEADOWS
A CHARMING OUTDOOR MUSEUM
UNSETTLED GLOOMY FENS
