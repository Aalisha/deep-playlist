When I was a little boy
Living in the last century
I thought about living in the future
Then it occurred to me
I turned around, the future was now
The future was all around me
Nothing like I had imagined
It was totally confounding
Hey-ohhh

21st century life
I got swept away
I got 21, 000 things that I got to do today
21st century life
Well what can I say?
The new world's got me feeling so dirty
Think I need to get down and play
