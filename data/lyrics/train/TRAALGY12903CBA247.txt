I've been Banana'd, Cabaret'd, stuffed in a truck for days
Leathered out, flannel'd in, paid to play, thought we'd win
The talent show that would break the band
Wrote the words that hit the fan
Flogged and prog'd, revival'd to death
Released and reviewed and signed with the best!

Leave me out, I've had my fill
Stand on my own, I've been through it all

I've been AOR'd, alternadised, heavy-metal'd, acousticised
Pickled to an amber hue and never lied to me or you
To get ahead or create a vibe, for sympathy to romanticize
How hard it is to rock 'n roll
To be a pawn or gain control

It seems that lately we've become quite the target
Dodging verbal traffic, oh the fun of it
