i'm going crazy
everytime that i see you hold somebody's hand
it's not the jealousy baby, i can't hide
cause i dont think u understand

i'm like a river that runs for you
through the valleys of a troubled land
and if you wonder when good times
will come to you,
i promise you i'll understand

cause if you believe
in one love only
and no one can see the good in you
just call my name, i'll come running
i will be waiting for you (waiting for you)

i might seem crazy to my friends
