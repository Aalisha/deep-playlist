Seeds of the wind don't fight for the slipstream
Child of the love torn fighter of the love dream
Seeds that are wind born Return to the heartland
Minds that are hate-worn must return to its inner hand

Tears of the lonely should be flown like a stream
Love man and lovers only feel the power of a dream
The taking makes you weary it robs you of your patience
It kills your very contact with the journeys of the ancients

Whatever you strive to believe in; don't make a man a victim
The knowledge of our slumber is keeping people under
Awake and decipher the dreams and the music
