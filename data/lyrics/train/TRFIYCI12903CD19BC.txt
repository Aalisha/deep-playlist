(nickolas ashford/valerie simpson)

You think you're so wayout
And you get all the action
But still you can't find no satisfaction

You specialize in playing the field
But now that the game
Has lost it's appeal

Baby, try me
I'll make you see
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', babe
You ain't livin' until you're lovin', baby
Ooh, until you fall, you ain't livin' at all
At all

You like to kiss and run
And think that's where it is
...
