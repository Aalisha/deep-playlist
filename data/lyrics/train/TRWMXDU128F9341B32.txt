I know it's been a while, but I'm back again
Yeah, it's hurting time so throw the stone
'Cause you got nothing on me

Blood on my hands, I've been digging deep
But I found my way back up
Yeah, we carry the cross, the true believers
You will never break us down

Babylon's burning
Licking the flame
Babylon's burning
Feeling no shame
Babylon's burning
My soul's on fire, burning hot
Babylon's burning
Kicking the dust
Babylon's burning
Peel off the rust
Babylon's burning
We bring the goods
Like you know we would
