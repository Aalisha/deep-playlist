Everything seems to go wrong when I stop drinking
Everything seemed to go my way last night
Everything seems so wrong to me this morning
I know things will be brighter later tonight...

On Ludlow Street, Chinatown's coming
On Ludlow Street, Puerto Ricans are runnin'
On Ludlow Street, soon musicians will haunt it
On Ludlow Street, where Indians once hunted
And it's hard to just move along

While I surrendered my ego you fed yours
All my fantasies died when you said yours
I have dangled my pride to forget yours
Will my mind be at ease when you get yours?
