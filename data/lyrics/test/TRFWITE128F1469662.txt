INTRO:(ICE CUBE)
Brrrgh!
Ai! Ai!
In about four seconds, a gangsta will begin to speak

VERSE ONE:(MACK 10, ICE CUBE, WC)
Well it's the mad chickenhawk with the dirty lick style
And pullin 211's ever since TAA-DOOW
There's ten million ways to die
Choosin Mack and hit the boopin floosin
Off this gang-bang music
So all I'd wanna got the room stumped
I'm smokin, make dough like Trump
Cookin? to they chunk, punk!
Straight off dust, nigga trust I bust
And cross em out and put a'K if they ain't down with us

It's off the hook, nigga, I'm a Westside crook, nigga
The forty motherfuckin dollars on my books, nigga
I'm not an MC, I'm not a G
I mean I'm A-to fuckin-Z and everything in between
Rappers like gangbangin cos I'm in it to the fullest
And my hood ain't never dodgin bullets
It's all about the Bloods and Crips, no one tri-ips
Colours and dips, bitches and chips, nigga!

Woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
What's this my? low-grader system
That takes puff B-I-itches on the premises
Nigga be dissin on a down low
So now my motto's:"Fuck every rapper from the East and the West Coast"
New School, Old School, I hate you motherfuckers
I'm steady plottin, cracklin my ass wit'cha album covers
Cross em out and put a'K
Then no Saint days, nigga, then run the fuckin holidays

*Chorus (3x): Ice Cube, Mack 10, WC*
