Where was God when I needed a friend?
And where was God when I came to an end?
Where was God when I lost my mind?
Where was God when I can find?

Don't wanna be up or down
Don't wanna be up or down
I don't wanna be up or down

Where was love when I felt like hate?
Where was hate when I felt like love?
Where were you when you said you'd be there?
Where was the fear when I said I was scared?

I don't wanna be up or down
