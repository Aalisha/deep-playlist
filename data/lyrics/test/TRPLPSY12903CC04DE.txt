Come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back

This is the first time until today
That you have run away
I'm asking you for the first time
Love me [unverified] stay

(All right)
Hey
(All right)
Hey
(All right!)
Hey, yeah

Come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back
Baby, come back

There ain't no use in you crying
...
