Dog night I'm so alone
a million miles out on my own
No one to talk no one to care
Searching for someone they could be anywhere
Magic and madness it's so very strange
Soemtimes I think it's all pre-arranged
That same old feeling hits me again
Just the beginning but its feels like the end
Oh feel like I'm stranded out here
Oh I think I might disappear
