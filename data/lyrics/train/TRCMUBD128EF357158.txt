Train 

I've just taken a seat on the train 
I walked through busy streets down a shadowy lane 
I just bought my ticket for the ride 
There's no turning back now, no matter what I decide 

Steel body moves fast, hinges pounding against the ground 
I sink into my seat and I pray for it to speed up
While I wish it would slow down 

My body quivers with anticipation for what lies ahead 
Wood is thrown onto the fire that cries out to be fed 
Mist shrouds the dawn, so ahead I cannot see 
...
