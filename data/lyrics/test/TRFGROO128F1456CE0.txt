Pack up all your dishes
Make note of all good wishes
Say goodbye to the landlord for me
Sons o' bitches always bore me
Throw out those L.A. papers
Moldy box of vanilla wafers
Adios to all this concrete
Gonna get me some dirt road backstreet

Chorus:
If I can just get off of that L.A. Freeway
Without getting killed or caught
Down the road in a cloud of smoke
...
