You go and I'll be okay
I can dream the rest away
It's just a little touch of fate, it'll be okay
It sure takes its precious time, but it's got rights and so have I

I turn my head up to the sky
I focus one thought at a time
I do not let the little thieves under my tightly buttoned sleeve
It couldn't be a longer time, I feel like I am walking blind
I have no arrival time
There are no legible signs
