So here you are in Hoxton two years on
 Since you left that little no where that you're from
 First few weeks you stayed with your ex,
same old arguments but without the sex.

  Now you're renting down the road its not so cheap
Every weekend police stayed in the street
 wirey looking kids looked up eyes down
we then biked to the arctic crown

  Now they're sqauring up
"What phone you got bruv"?
 Yeah they're gonna give you grief
You still get home in one piece.
