Take another bite
It'll be alright
What's wrong will soon feel right
Dangerous tonight
Take another sip
Let it kiss your lips
And let a little drip on your thighs
If you let me I'll untie
Your sensuality
I'll open up your heart
And satisfy my greed
I'm dangerous, I'm a dyin' breed
Poisonous like a centipede
I'm capable of the foulest deed
(Aah)
Dangerous at night
I'm dangerous like a razorback
Deadly like a heart attack
Well, I don't bend and I don't crack
(Aah)
Dangerous tonight
