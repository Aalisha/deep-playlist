In November of '95, the sister of a friend of mine from high school
committed suicide. Having never been to a funeral, I was very
apprehensive, especially since I had been asked to play a song during
the service. Seeing her in that room along with all of those people who
loved her and cared about her really made me think. I mainly wondered
if whatever it was that had driven her to that point could have been
worked out in that quiet room with that group of people. I suppose
questions just lead to more questions. I wrote this song on the way
back home in the car. (Derek Webb)
Thank God I'm back in my car
And driving home
And driving home
'Cause the air was thin and so cold
Back in there
It was my first time
Won't be my last time
And the questions rise
Expectations fall
In light of it all
There aren't words to say
