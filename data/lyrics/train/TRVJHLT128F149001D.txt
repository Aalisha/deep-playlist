Take a look around the world,
Oh so many things you'll see
Even though it may not seem near
Predict a change for you and me


I know the days will come when men claim I am he
These things and so much more laid down in history


Man disobeys and we will pay
And the rumours of war go on and on
Won't you see the end is near?
