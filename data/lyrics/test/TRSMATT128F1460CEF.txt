Baby love
I need your love
I wanna turn it up
But the world keeps on turnin'

My heart is real
Tell me what you feel
But as you can feel
There's a truth that is yearning

I've been watching you, do you feel it too
I've been wanting to, see what you can do
I've been watching you, do you want me
Let's stand back and make a getaway

Getaway

Baby love
Do I ask too much
Are you strong enough
To feed the flame that's burning

(Time, time, time)
Don't let it getaway
...
