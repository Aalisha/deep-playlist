Blackberries ripe on the branches
Her skin is burning, she bends to pick them
Bake a delicious pie
For our aching stomachs we delight

Sorrow came in floods this April
With our reason humble warning
we're now in May, June, and July
Don't leave my love, don't leave my side

Bright heaven moonlight glows
...
