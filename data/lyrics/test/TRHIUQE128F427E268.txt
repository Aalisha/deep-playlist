We rented a truck and a semi to go
Travel down the long and the winding road
Look on the map, I think we've been there before
Close up the doors, let's roll once more

Cop's on the corner, look he's starting to write
Well, I don't need no ticket, so I screamed out of sight
Drove so fast that my eyes can't see
Look in the mirror, is he still following me?

Let it roll down the highway
Let it roll down the highway
Roll, roll

Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
