The gypsy woman told my mama
On the day I was born
Oh, you got a boy child comin'
Oh Lord, he's gonna be a sun of a gun
He's gonna make those pretty women
You know, he's gonna make 'em jump and shout
The whole wide world gonna wonder
What it's all about

Yeah, you know I'm here
And everybody knows I'm here
I'm your Hoochie Coochie man
Oh Lord, Everybody knows I'm here
