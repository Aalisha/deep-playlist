There's some things on my mind
I don't know that if I should be thinkin'
Am I wastin' my time thinkin' 'bout
You and I and these feelings?

'Coz I see you and me holdin' hands
Doin' things, goin' further
But they say we're too young
And those things will come, I'm just curious

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a girl
Comin' straight from the heart
I'm just feelin' us

Thinkin' 'bout you and me
Thinkin' 'bout how it feels
I'm curious
I just wanna know what
True love is, though
I'm just feelin' us

On the phone, in the bed
On my back, starin' at the ceiling
When I'm talkin' to you
What I feel, is it true? I'm wondering

Well, I tell it and I
What I feel deep inside, it keeps burning
Does my man understand everything that I am?
I'm just curious, I'm just curious

When can I touch you?
When can I kiss you?
I'm curious
Nothin' more than a girl
