(Allison MoorerDoyle PrimmKenny Greenberg) 

Please don't bring me flowers 
Tied up in a pretty bow 
I'd trade a thousand roses 
For just one hand to hold 

And I don't want no candy 
Sugar hurts my teeth 
All I want is you tonight 
That'd be really sweet 

There's nothing at the five-and-dime 
That I really need 
Your kiss is the only gift 
That means a thing to me 

Bring Me All Your Lovin' 
That's something you ain't tried 
...
