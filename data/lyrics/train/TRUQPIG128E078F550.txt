Oh desert speak to my heart
Oh woman of the earth
Maker of children who wheep for love
Maker of this birth
'Til your deepest secrets are known to me
I will not be moved
I will not be moved

Don't try t find the answer
When there ain't no question here
Brother letr you heart be wounded
And give no mercy to your fear

Adam and Eve live down the street from me
Babylon is every town
It's as crazy as it's evere been
Love's a stranger all around

In a momentwe lost our minds here
And lay our spirit down
Today we lived a thousand years
All we have is now

[CHORUS]
Run to the water
And find me there
Burnt to the core but not broken
We'll cut through the madness
Of these streets below the moon
These streets below the moon

An I will never leave you
'Til we can say, "This world was just a dream,
We were sleepin' awake."
'Til we can say

In a moment we lost our minds here
An dreamt the world was round
A million miles fall from grace
Thank God we missed the ground

[CHORUS]
Run to the water
And find me there
...
