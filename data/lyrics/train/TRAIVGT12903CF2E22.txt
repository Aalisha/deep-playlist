Hey, hey, hey, yeah!
Whey, whey, whey, whey
Now, aye, now
Who say!

(We jumping up, start jumping up)
(We jumping up, start jumping up)
(We jumping up, start jumping up)
Is the road calling
(We jumping up, start jumping up)
(We jumping up, start jumping up)
Take out yuh flag take out yuh rag people time to get on bad

Dead or alive
(Still we coming)
(Still we coming)
(Still we coming)
2005
(Still we coming)
(Still we coming)
(Still we coming)

(Fee, fi, fo, fom) Understand there is just no stopping
(For this day I’ll) Swim the sea, climb the highest mountain
(Rain or thunderstorm) Blaze the heat like a fire blazing
(Sorry Boss man) Carnival ain’t no way I working
Bossman threatening to fire me for sure
If I only leave work early once more
Bossman you better understand
Is time to take out yuh rag, take out yuh flag and jump up in a band

Dead or alive
(Still we coming)
(Still we coming)
(Still we coming)
2005
(Still we coming)
(Still we coming)
(Still we coming)

(We jumping up, start jumping up)
