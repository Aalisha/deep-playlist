Down by the boathouse at Shaker Lake
When there wasn't nothing but love to make,
They were two young lovers wishing on the stars above.

Well, they carved their initials in an old birch tree
with a heart and an arrow and a 'sixty-three.
You had to be blind not to see... It was a perfect love.

It was a perfect love. Ooh, yeah, yeah.
Well, they worked one summer together at the '64 World's Fair.
They met Robert Kennedy there.
Well, that was... right before the fall.
