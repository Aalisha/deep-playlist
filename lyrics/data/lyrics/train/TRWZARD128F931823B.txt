The dead is in the march
They're soldiers in the dark
They mourn the living, regret our sinning

Their bombs are roaring in the dust, they sing a song to us
Their march is heavy, are we ready yet?
The bullets fall loose through their skin
They're swinging in the wind
Their march is deadly, are we ready?

Lock the doors, don't let them in
Board it up because our time is slipping and they're not listening
Lock the doors, don't let them in
Board it up so they can't win

There's no surrender till the dust has settled here
They mourn the living, regret our sinning
The dead is in the march
