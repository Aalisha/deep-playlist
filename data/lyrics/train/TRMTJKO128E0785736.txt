There's smell of fresh cut grass

and it's filling up my senses

And the sun is shining down on the blossoms in the avenue.
There's a buzzing fly hanging
around the bluebells and the daisies

And tAere's a lot more loving left in this world.

Don't go
don't leave me now
now
now

While the sun smiles
stick around and laugh a while
yeah.

And I lie on warm and soft sancly beaches

And my toes are submerged in the water
and it feels good.
Children playing building castles on the shoreline
...
