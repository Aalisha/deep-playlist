Well well, are you ready
I'd just like to take ya on a little trip, come on

How would you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
Wouldn't you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
How would you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
Wouldn't you like to go with me on a peaceful journey
Just let me take you by the hand
I promise to lead to you a better land
