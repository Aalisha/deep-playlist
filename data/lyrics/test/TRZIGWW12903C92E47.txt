Playing dead in the vanity of perfection
But your razor smile keeps ripping inside
Burying me alive, greed of a swine
You eat and whine at left remains
Needled times in your hands to bolt the sky
So I paint the tears of your cry

I look around, define and overthrow it all
Your horizon is deceiving and tall
Spiteful and cold
Taste so bitter and so old

Bathing in the gloss of your fatality
