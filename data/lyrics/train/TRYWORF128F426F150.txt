Well I'm an alley cat
Some say a dirty rat
On my side is my gat
See I'm all of that
Spittin' out buck shots, for I'm gonna wetcha
Running hard, but I'm still coming to getcha
Thinking like a peace smoke, comin' on a homicide
You talkin' shit, try to take me for a ride
I'm not a bad guy
But I'm the funky feel one
Finger on the trigger with my hands upon the steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is going boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?
Being the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son
Yo I think you better run
Better run more, and move a little faster
Second of thought and I'm coming to blast ya
With my

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
left hand on a forty, puffin' on a blunt
Pumped my shotgun, niggas didn't jump
Lala la la lala la laaaa

Comin' at you like a stiff blow, fuckin' up your program
Ain't takin' shit from you him or no man
