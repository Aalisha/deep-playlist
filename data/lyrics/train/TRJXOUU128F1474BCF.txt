In this world of ups and downs,
My dreams all fall through.
Nothing seems to work out,
No matter what I do.
Disappointment haunts me,
Through each lonely day.
The world around I see,
In only shades of gray
But when the lovelight shines upon my face,
I’m in a different world.
A world I never knew.
I'm in a different world.
A world so sweet and true.
I’m in a different world.
I’m no longer just another face,
In a crowd.
Hey look into my eyes,
You’ll see I’m strong and I’m proud.
You were all the sweetness,
Of my life you see.
You have brought heaven,
Right here on earth for me.
No man of wealth,
I know I’ll never be.
