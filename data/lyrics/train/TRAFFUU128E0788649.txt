I watch the smoke drift, from my cigarette
I hear the roaches cross the floor
Slam dance around me, in my chair I sit
The grey's leakin' through the door
There's a shade of grey! I've never seen before...

My gaze fixed on, the space beneath the door
My life flash. before my eyes...
All this sweat grew from one solitary drop
...
