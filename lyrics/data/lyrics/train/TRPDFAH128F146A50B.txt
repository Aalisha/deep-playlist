I've done things, not proud of
Broken all the rules of love
Sentenced five
And doin' ten once again

Of all the damage done
Would've been easy just to run
But I stood by
Showed my hand like a man, yes, I did

I've paid the price
For some doghouse rights
Better wake up, wake up
Let me back in or let me go
