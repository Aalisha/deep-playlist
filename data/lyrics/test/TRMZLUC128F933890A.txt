I feel like going out for a drive
Don't know if I'll make it back alive
My head's so heavy, my soul is black
Lookin' like something that the cat brought back

I'm goin' Crazy
But that's alright

Outside, lookin' for something to do
Walkin' the streets, everybody looks like you
When you can't find love, you can feed your head
But you can't survive when your brain is dead

I'm goin' Crazy
But that's alright
...
