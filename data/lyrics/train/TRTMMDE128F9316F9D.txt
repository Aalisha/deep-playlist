Lights, cameras, stars, crowds, noise
After sets, cell phones, Internet, Vegas bets
Private jets, limousine chauffeurs, all of that
Money, clothes and oh, diamonds, cars, rims, shining
None of this compares to what I see in you

Materials don't mean a thing to me
Girl, you are the world to me
If I had to pick a favorite thing
It would easily be my baby

Materials don't mean a thing to me
If I lost you, lady, then I'd go crazy
And I wouldn't have anything

Black cars, fly homes, condos with the chefs
Personal assistants, corporate, real estate
Yachts that will take you far away to islands
...
