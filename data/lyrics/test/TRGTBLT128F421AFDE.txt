I'm gonna sit right here all day and night*
That's what I said, reckon you heard me right
Don't care about fame or fortune in the eyes of men
Just take what the law allows and say "Amen"

I heard the Memphis train speak to the moon
Whipped out my fountain pen, wrote down the tune
Don't care if it's been sung, I don't know when
Such a good old tune I'll sing again

I'll sing again (I'll sing again)
I'll sing again (I'll sing again)
Of busted dreams and god-forsaken men
...
