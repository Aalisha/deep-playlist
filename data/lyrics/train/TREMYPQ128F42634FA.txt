You're gonna be lonely
You're gonna be lonely

Baby, how you been? I been doin' fine
Been takin' my time to get myself on track
Why you? d never call, you used to have my back
Whenever I fall, you we? re always there for me
Now you? re not at all so it? s been awhile
Was tryin' to figure out when it? s my turn to smile
I think that time has come be careful what you say
If it? s game you want then you know I came to play

Don? t think too bad of me
It? s just so sad to see
You used to be proud of me
Now you're gonna be lonely
Without me as your friend
Goes around, it'll come back again
