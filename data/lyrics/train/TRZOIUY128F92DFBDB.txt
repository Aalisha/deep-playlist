Don't need no one to tell me what to do
I won't let anybody see me through
Won't let them blind my vision
I'll make my own decisions
No one to interrupt my point of view
No way
Oh no

Don't let no one invade my sanity
Or steal away my own humanity
It ain't no false illusion
They'll leave me with confusion
And try to penetrate my privacy

Too late
...
