Think of me when you're lonely
Think of me when you're blue
Think of me when you're far away
And I'll be thinking of you

Remember all of the good times
We had in days gone by
Remember all of the sadness
The day you said goodbye
You told me you would be leavin'
But you wouldn't be gone too long
...
