Well I was waitin' around for somebody to die
Nobody did but a part of me died
I suppose from all that waiting
These things they pass in time but the moments
Get real and it's hard sometimes
I think of someone that I'd like to be
And I hold that in my mind
But there's always tonight, tonight

And you, you make me feel like I'm here when I'm not
And it, it makes me feel like I'm not here
...
