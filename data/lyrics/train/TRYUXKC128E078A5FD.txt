There's a girl down the street
Works at the Five-and-a-dime.
Just lives her life ain't sugarsweet
But she is doing allright.
Friday night she goes out
Just for dancing the night away.
When she moves with the crowd
Makes her heart beat, and that's okay.
But deep down inside those eyes
A fire is aching each night
She's dreaming the dream of breaking free
Can't get enough
She's longing for love
Out on the street no one can see
What she's been hiding so long.
