This might hurt, it's not sane
But I know that I've got to make a change,
I don't care if I break, at least I'll be feeling something
Cause just okay's not enough
Help me fight through the nothingness of life...
I don't want to go through the motions
I don't want to go one more day,
without Your all-consuming passion inside of me,
I don't want to spend my whole life asking,
"What if I had given everything,
instead of going through the motions?"
No regrets, not this time,
I'm gonna let my heart defeat my mind,
Let Your Love make me whole,
I think I'm finally feeling something
cause just okay's not enough,
...
