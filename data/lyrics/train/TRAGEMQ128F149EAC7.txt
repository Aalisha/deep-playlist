love coffee, I love tea
I love the Java Jive and it loves me
Coffee and tea and the java and me
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup

I love java, sweet and hot
Whoops, Mr.Moto, I'm a coffee pot!
Shoot me the pot and I'll pour me a shot
A cup, a cup, a cup, a cup, a cup

Oh, slip me a slug from that wonderful mug
And I'll cut a rug till I'm snug in a jug
A slice of onion and a raw one

Draw one
