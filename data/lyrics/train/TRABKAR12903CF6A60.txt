Tonight, tonight's gonna be the last night I'll try
I'll try to get by
Maybe tonight if it goes just right
I started with a bottle
Bottoms up
I'm out of luck
Hope was it's best friend
Left them at the top
Cold hands in coat pockets
Clinching my daughter's locket
What would she think of her daddy now?

All you need is love
All you need is love
