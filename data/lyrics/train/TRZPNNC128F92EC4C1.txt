I fell so far, I did not know anyone could save me
I could not find a light as far as I could see
My body lay broken at the bottom of my prison
My hope washed away as the waves crashed over me

You reached down and saved me
You parted the sea and so I could breathe
You reached down and saved me
You pulled me from all that was drowning me

I could not see the top of the well in which I'd fallen
