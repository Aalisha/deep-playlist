Now listen to me closely cause I've seen the signs and I know that the end is near
There are others like me but we won't advertise cause we know we're not of the earth
Humans are afraid of the ones like us
And they persecute out of fear
They wanna lock us up for the things we say
But soon they'll wish that they had heart

Alright
We'll be fine
Let them die
