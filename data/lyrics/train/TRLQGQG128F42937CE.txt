You walked in and found her with tears in her eyes
She couldn't tell you exactly why
There ain't nothing wrong but there ain't nothing right
Try to figure it out boy, you're wasting your time

All it takes is a tender moment
A loving word or the touch of your hand
All she needs is a tender moment
Let her know you'll always be her man
That's the kind of thing a woman understands

It's a fast lane world that we're living in
Sometimes love takes a little test bend
But it don't take much to straighten it out
...
