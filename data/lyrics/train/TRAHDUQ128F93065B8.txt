I'm being held captive
Something's got a hold of me
Stay until death
Splits us up and calls the judge
To ask if you believe
You've lost your soul for eternity
But you've never been free
When it's said and done
We can run
It's our eternity

But for now, I've been trapped, oh
Too long to take these roads
Tell me when you see the smoke
Hear my cry and bring me back to home

Arrested by your love, girl
Constant search from the floor
Badly beaten in love, girl
Turn the key and lock the door [x2]
