By burden of blood we saw reflections of who we are,
As the knowledge that burns in our hearts takes charge.

Blessings made at a house in the distance.
An unworthy authority looking to find a worthy culprit.
Accounting lost, stranded hindsight, words were not enough.
Repeat the cycle with devils in your veins.

More than simply shaken, a line divides.
Blood ties are forsaken, grudges still are found
...
