There's an old friendly breeze that blows
In the Gulf of Mexico
Somehow it always knows
When I'm feeling low

So I'm gonna anchor down
Wait til it comes around

Yeah that's how I'll pass the time

Chorus:
Til I catch my second wind
Get back up and gain control again
Find the strength I lost back then
When you stopped loving me
