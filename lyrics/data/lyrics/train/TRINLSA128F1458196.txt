Hey

Hey, gypsy woman, roll your dice for me
Read my Tarot cards, so I can see
I'm razor sharp, cool sunglasses
Pocketful of backstage passes
Lady Luck, roll your dice for me

The boys are feeling hot tonight
Fingers crossed, they get it right
Women to the left, women to the right
The boys are feeling hot tonight

I ain't too proud to beg for what you got
You'd melt a heart of ice, babe, you're so hot
So pump it up, raise the dead
Squeeze it, honey, 'til it's cherry red
