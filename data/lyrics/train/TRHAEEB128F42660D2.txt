You drive around in your long black car
You're looking for bounty on another young heart
So young and pretty, does she do it for you?
You've got the whole damn world and now you want her too

You tell her lies and you, you use her up
Another trophy, welcome to the club
You're always playing with your loaded dice
I'll only tell you once, take my advice

Too much too soon
 (Too much too soon)
You got it all so easily
 (Too much too soon)
Too much too soon
Now somebody put the hurt on me

You're trespassing on my property
If you're looking for her, you've got to go through me
I can tell there's something up your sleeve
