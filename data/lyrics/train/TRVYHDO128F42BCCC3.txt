I thought it was forever, I thought it would last
I gotta try to make it a page of my past
You didn't even say goodbye
When you slammed that door

Now, I'm lyin' here alone in what once was our bed
Tryin' to forget all the cruel words you said
Oh, the radio is playin'
What once was our favorite song

Oh, enough is enough I won't take anymore
I'm pickin' myself up off the floor

'Cause you can't keep a good man down
Can't keep a good man down, oh no
Can't keep a good man down, baby
Can't keep a good man down

Gonna dress up in the finest clothes that I own
And take it to the streets, I won't be lonely for long
I'm gonna put on my best moves
On every single woman I see
...
