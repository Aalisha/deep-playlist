Times don't change
This I know
It's a sad, sad world
Wherever you go

But life has two faces
The frown and the smile
While it hurts so bad sometimes
You gotta laugh once in a while

You gotta laugh a little
Laugh into the wind
Close your eyes and lose yourself
Go on and laugh out loud, my friend

Go on and sway just a little
Underneath the moon
Feel the wind of heaven free your soul
As it blows over you

Deep concern
You should express
But hearts get weak
From too much heaviness

There's medicine in laughter
...
