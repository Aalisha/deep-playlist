The beginning of the end
Third world order we befriend
Hatred turns to genocide
It seems to be the trend
Civilians life at stake
And yet we still partake
On the cleansing of the human race
We've made a big mistake

We're at war
We're at war

Captured mortals for the thrill
You don't own me, you never will
Satisfaction on my skill
You don't own me, you never will
