You can be a million miles away
I will always love you
you can be a thousand throughts away
I'll be thinking of you
No matter where you try to hide
your always gonna find me
right where I belong
been here beside you all along
like some ancient star
forever we'll remain.
Even if the sky should ever fall from grace
if I die or fade away
in the end you'll always know
you're not alone.
