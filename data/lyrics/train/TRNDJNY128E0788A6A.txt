Things I say and do may not come clear through
My words may not convey just what I'm feelin'
But I, I hope hope you'll recognize what's right before your eyes
Oh, your heart should realize from where I'm dealin'

Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I love you
Baby, I'm tryin' to show you that I care
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I, I need you
Baby, I'm tryin' to tell you that I care

Oh, you may not understand just why I show my hand
The method to my madness you inspire
Perception is the key, it's evident, you see
What this is all about is love entire
