Okay, okay,
He's got my number and
You can't, you can't
Warn me baby here I am
Either you make the time
Or just forget me

I'm not, I'm not
Tryna run your life
That's why, that's why
I'm nobody's wife
But when I want, when I want it
You gotta be ready

I don't want it all the time,
But when I get it,
I better be satisfied
So give it to me right,
Or don't give it to me at all

I don't think you understand,
How real it is for me to find
A man who thinks he can
So give it to me right,
Or don't give it to me at all
yeah yeah
