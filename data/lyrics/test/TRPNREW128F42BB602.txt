[VERSE 1]

Take me downtown
It's where the people rock,
Three-hundred sixty five? cos we never stop.

Take me downtown
Cos' peoples runnin' wild.
See how we kick it in a brand new style.

Take me downtown
It's where I wanna go.
Everyone I know is going to my show-

Take me downtown
Where the city hum,
Then get your head numb to the beat of the drum cause,

[CHORUS]

I see you watching me watching you,
And now you see just where you gotta be.
I see you watching me watching you,
And now you see just where you gotta be.

[VERSE 2]
