"Now that i've lost my beloved brother, i took his advice
I've searched for the one he claimed to be my true father... the king of kings
The fearsome lord of the mithril mountain the king of dragons!
It was a warm yet expected welcome, i spent many a night there
And found out a great deal of my past, and i was told that there's still a
chance to
save our kingdom and world!
The leader of the dark hordes the dweller of night, the
destructor of light he must be destroyed in order to scatter the hordes
...he also told me that it is my real brother...
It will be done... i will find you bastard son"

I've wandered for months searching
Time grows short i need an answer
Now i know your name
...
