A holiday, a holiday
the first one of the year
Lord Arnold's wife came into the church
the gospel for to hear

And when the meeting it was done
she cast her eyes about
and there she saw little Matty Groves
walking in the crowd

"Come home with me,
little Matty Groves.
Come home with me tonight.
Come home with me, little Matty Groves
and sleep with me till light."

"Oh I can't come home and
I won't go home
and sleep with you tonight.
By the rings on your fingers I can see
that you are my master's wife."

"And what if I'm Lord Arnold's wife.
For he is not at home.
He is out in the far country
bringing the yearlings home."
