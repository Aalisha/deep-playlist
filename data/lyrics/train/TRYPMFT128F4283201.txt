Can I get a scream, from all the back row?
A teeth shine and a bloodied chorus?
A . help me, I'm sailing of the edge of fucking
feeling,.?
I really really really need forever
All the days I spend in my youth
A black lung, a black time
A generation bored out of their minds

Its a long dead thing
God loves a dealing fiend
Its a long dead thing
God loves a screaming queen
