Well me and a buddy named Cisco went down to sip some suds
First thing you know me and old Cisco ran through fifty bucks
We got caught in a card game they said they's bring us home
They must've changed their minds I've only got one dime
And one time to use the telephone

And I said hello honey go borrow some money get your sweet man outta the can
Well it's Saturday night they've got me locked up tight way off I can hear a band
