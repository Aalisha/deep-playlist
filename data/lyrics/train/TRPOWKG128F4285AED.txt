If I could I would change how it went for us
If I could I would redo everything
If I could I would change what they think of us
If I could I would

Out of a dream, a mystical dream
Where reason flies
A forever scene of one figurine
Where beauty never dies

It's all about moments and if you were there
You'd see all the lust and the fire in her stare
The context is fluid, the subject is sin
The moment of madness begins

Lady Macbeth
Marked for death
Lady Macbeth
With every breath

Lady Macbeth
I see you everywhere
