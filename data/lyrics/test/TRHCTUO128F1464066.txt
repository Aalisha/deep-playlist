We were rich and we were poor
Two children playing grown-up games
The prince and the princess

You loved me hard just like a rock
I threw away your building blocks
And left you with silence and who said the silence was gone

Now I'd trade one day of wealth and fame
For just one model airplane
Where is the love that you made me

If I had Aladdin's lamp
Here is what I'd do
I'd rub Aladdin's lamp until
Aladdin's lamp turned into you

You used to write me poetry
And emerald city love songs
The jest and the jester
