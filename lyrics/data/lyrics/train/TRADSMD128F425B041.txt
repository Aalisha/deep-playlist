She doesn't wanna brush him off
She doesn't wanna lead him on
She doesn't wanna give him any false hope
But she doesn't want him gone

He's just patiently wandering and waiting
For her to make up her mind
Is it all over already
Or could it be love this time?

It's just another injured heart
He's had it broken in the past
