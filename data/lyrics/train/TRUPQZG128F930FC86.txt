I was awake, dreaming about sleeping
And my mistakes and how I keep 'em
So close to me, so that I'll never, never forget
I can't get anywhere

Shedding tears over these bottles
Celebrating my life at the bottom
Of the barrel of a barrel so rotten
And I've forgotten what this like before I started stopping

Fuck this, fuck this, I'm out, I'm out
Of bullshit to cry about
You can pass these fuck you's around
I'll be dead and gone when this shit hits the ground

Tell me why, why, why, why, why
...
