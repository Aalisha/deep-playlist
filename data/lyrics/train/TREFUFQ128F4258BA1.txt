Sometimes I wish I had a pair of blinders
To cut down my point of view
Maybe then I could concentrate
On just living my life for You

I'm just a temple of flesh and blood
Who daily must decide
Whether to bow to the temple wall
Or to the spirit locked inside

Tonight I've got my heart
By the throat
I'm gonna stay here
Till my whole body knows

I commit my heart to the heavens
I stand to praise Your name
I commit my heart to the heavens
I am here to praise your name

I say this simply with no regrets
...
