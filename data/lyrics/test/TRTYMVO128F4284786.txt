There is nothing left for me
There is nothing left for you
There is nothing left at all
A wasteland of my mind

Don't think you ever will see
Don't think you ever will know
How much I actually cared
About everything we shared

Why the fuck did you lie then?
Why in hell did you bring me down?
Don't you realize?
No one gets out of this place alive

Hasn't been screaming all these years
Just to see the world crashing around me
Maybe this life is overrated
But I won't let the world burn around me
...
