She was insatiable, you know the type
And she was young, but she was ripe
And she was vicious, and she took a bite

Baby don't wanna feel this pain anymore
I've got a message, put it through emergency
I wanna hear it on the radio tonight

Calling All Girls, If you're looking for love (you got it)
Calling All Girls, If you're looking for a hot time
Calling All Girls, If you're looking for fun
Calling All Girls, If you're looking for a good time tonight

Seems all the good girls are home in bed
We're gonna party to raise the dead
I'm gonna love that girl right out of my head
...
