Stand Back! Said stand Back!
What are those dogs doing sniffing at my feet
They're on to something, picking up
Picking up this heat,
This heat, give me steam
And how you feel can make it real
Real as anything you've seen
Get a life with the dreamer's dream

You know your culture from your trash
You know your plastic from your cash
When I lose sight of the track
You know the way back
But I know you

You know your stripper from your paint
You know your sinner from your saint
Whenever heaven's doors are shut
You kick them open but
I know you

Give me steam
And how you feel can make it real
Real as any place you've been
Get a life with the dreamer's dream

Stand back, said stand back!
Can't you see I've lost control I'm getting indiscreet
You're moving in so close 'til I'm picking up
...
