They walk with their arms away from their sides
Cause it's all in the timing
Who wins the fight
All around them the signs are clear
It's gone too far
Now the showdown is here
Showdown is here

Hungry dogs follow
And the vultures lead
Self-preservation
The original greed
But there's too much fire
For the perfect match
Now it's just a matter of the first attack

Which one is right
That's no longer clear
Anger has no light
...
