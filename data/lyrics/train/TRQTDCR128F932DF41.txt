You can never really start from the start
The ending begins inside of your heart
Well the people, they love to remember your name
It's a hospital bed but it's all just the same

Why did you leave when you were returned
Your past is your future, your future will learn
The crows that fly, we'll try not to find
You do things once, you know you'll do it twice
