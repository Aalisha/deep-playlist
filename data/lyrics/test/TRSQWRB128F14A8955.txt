Every night my dream's the same
Same old city with a different name
Men are coming to take me away
I don't know why, but I know I can't stay

There's a weight that's pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Can't swim across a river so deep

They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they don't know where and they don't know when
It's coming
...
