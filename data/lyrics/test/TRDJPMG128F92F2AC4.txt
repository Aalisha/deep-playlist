I? d give anything to go back
Do anything to go there
To take my breath away again

I still see her face right there
Starin? at me, and I swear
I can feel you here

When I close my eyes
I know I should drop everything
And run straight back to your side

Maybe I should take a bus ride
Maybe I should put this car in drive
And go find the love that we both used to know

Maybe I can find the one way
Maybe you? ll forgive me someday
No red light stopping me, nothing gonna slow me down
