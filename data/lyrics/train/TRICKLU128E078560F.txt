Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

You're painting a picture of what you would prefer
Of what you want to see come out of your life
But every now and then you gotta open up your eyes

It's all running together taking forever
And I know just what the feeling is like
But you can't just let it all pass you by

How did you know [Incomprehensible]?
Why don't you let it show?

Wanna see you in your most outrageous style
Wanna see you in your most courageous smile
Live it, love it, oh, you know you wanna try
Hey, it's your life

You've got the love
