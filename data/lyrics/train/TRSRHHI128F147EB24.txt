I figured out why
My heart's as cold as night
It can't live in the day
There's a shadow in the way

And he won't die
The person I've called me
He binds me with his chains
Of twisted liberty

And I know myself well enough to know
I don't want to anymore, yeah
And I find myself wasted as I am
Living for the cause of me, cause of me

So leave me here to die
And even if I'm crying
Don't let me, don't let me
Live another day

Then raise the shell of me
Back to dependency
And don't let me, don't let me
...
