You are not anyone
Don't sadden my life

You got to leave on Sunday night
It seems I'll feel all alone
You know the tears are in my eyes
I need some time to let 'em dry

I can't keep insisting 'cause I'm going too far
I feel sad and that is just for you
I would keep insisting on these lonely nights
'Cause I just can't get rid of you
