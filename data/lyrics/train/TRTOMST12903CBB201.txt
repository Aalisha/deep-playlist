[Verse 1 - Young Buck]
That was your last chance (yeah), now eat your last meal
Your momma told you that your mouth gon' get that ass killed (alright ...)
You done got yourself into some G shit
Thought after Big and Pac, hip hop don't need this (NO! ...)
I was wrong though, cause now it's on ho (on ho)
You ain't ridin with him, what the f**k you on the song for? (you on the song for?)
You just want to battle rap, see who got the best verse
I just hope you got a strap, I'm a let that Tec burst (*brrrp*)
Y'all know I ain't havin that, I got to check first
See if it's some real beef (alright ...), before I put in work
We are on the real streets and this is real life
God if you hear me (HEAR ME!), don't let me die tonight
I can see it clearly, they puttin +Prices On My Head+ (NO!)
Their kids wear our shoes and they wives in our bed (YEAH!)
Now they mad at us, cause they takin our picture
So please Mr. Hater, can I have a word with ya? (can I have a word with ya?)

[Chorus - Young Buck]
Talk to me (YEAH!), tell me what is goin on
