Ain't easy being this kind of lover when you never call, me
Ain't easy being this kind of lover, won't you ever call, me

I'm dedicated, yes I'm a forgiver
I'm dedicated, sure I'm a giver
I'm dedicated, yes I'm a forgiver
I'll forgive you always

Although I know you'll turn it on yeah (turn it on)
I know you'll turn it on yeah (turn it on)
I know you'll turn it on yeah (turn it on)
Although I know you'll turn it on yeah (turn it on)
