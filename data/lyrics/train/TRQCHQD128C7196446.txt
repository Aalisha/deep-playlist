Show me the diamonds
Show me the gold
[Incomprehensible] me the answer, oh yeah
Call me anywhere
I don't have a care
This is my world

You're so pretty, we're so pretty

Show me the silver
Show me the gold
You're taking my name, Angel
Don't disappoint me
I see you smiling
Tie up my elbows, no joke

Talking to the Devil
Talking to the Lord
For one sweet touch
Talking me to Heaven
Talking to me to Hell
For your sweet touch
