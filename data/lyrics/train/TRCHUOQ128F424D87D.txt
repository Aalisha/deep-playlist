I wanna ride through the cannyon
I'm on the run with the horses
I wanna change with the season
I wanna live for a reason
I wanna sing for the people
I gotta hide from the needle
I'm on the run from addiction
I'm gonna dance with the devil
Yeah!

I'm already gone
wont you play along with all my stupid fuckin' games
I'm already gone
you're always playing the victim
you really know you're addicted
