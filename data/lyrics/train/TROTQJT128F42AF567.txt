Yo, come here darlin', have a seat, we need to speak
Look straight in my eyes, tell me what you see?
Is it that same nigga that you fell for from the door
Ain't I that same nigga
We was both on the train goin' hard and then your shit surfaced
Takin' the phone in the bathroom, whisperin' with your girlfriends
Try to play me on some jerk shit
Numbers underneath the sole of your lady Timb's
Oh shit
Kid, I kept it tight for you
Turned nigga's down, didn't go out all them nights for you
And I ain't even that type'a bitch
I heard about Jones Beach and Luke's Freak Fest
Nevertheless I still put my faith in you
You was my dog, so I stayed faithful
But I'll be god damned if I be some nigga dumb bitch
It's fucked up it gotta go down like this
Yo, have you ever had a bitch that'll pop guns for you?
Type of nigga you'll do anything he ask to?
Snake bitch turn around and backstab you?
Crab nigga found out he fucked around too?
Threw her cash, threw in the smash, that's boo
Rockin' your 4 wheel drive and tattoo
