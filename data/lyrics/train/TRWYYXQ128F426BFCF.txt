Sure feels good, sure feels right
Sure enough feels like love tonight
Ain't no movie, ain't no bar
Ain't nothin' out there beats where we are

[Chorus]
Lay back baby, catch your breath
This fire ain't as hot as it's gonna get
We're just getting' started, ain't close to done
There's a whole lot more where that came from

We've been workin' so hard, had no breaks
