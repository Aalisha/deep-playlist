Listen boy, I'll tell you a thing
I'll make you a career in the business I'm in
I'll make you rich, I'll make you a toy
I'll make you turn over into my little boy

Y'see, I'm going somewhere
I don't know what I'm gonna do when, when I get there
You know money's a thing your only inspiration
And your only meaning

You must think that all I do
Is spend my time making pretty pictures of you
You can fall when I will climb
But I'll be falling over just by having you in my mind

Mend that fight, oh listen to them
Kickin' up a ball inside a Jericho wall
Mend that fight, it's all twisted through them
If you ain't rich then you won't go to the ball

Having mercy and licking up love
And moving through your ocean like I've never had enough
Y'see, you ain't all I want
You're everything and more that I have ever hoped for

You must think that all I do
Is spend my time making pretty pictures of you
You can fall when I will climb
But I'll be falling over just by having you in mind

Mend that fight, oh listen to them
...
