Destiny cannot be shaken
Fate will send us where we need to be
Many turns our love has taken
But in the end you're standing here with me
Now it's a long road to forever
But together I know we'll find a way

Now we're standin on the edge, edge of the eternity
You and I
We're standin hand in hand
Nothing will break our love
I'll cherish you each day till I die
For all eternity you and I

My heart's filled with such emotion
