Que necesitas marijuana? lucas? cuetes? banko?

Aqui tenemos de todo

Aqui en MEXICO! (Mexican cry)

Mexico city (city)
A place you can go
And live your life in the low
Mexico city (city)
A place where you can hide
And everything will be tight

They want me on a murder rap which violates my probations
Ain't no fucking way I'm staying here with what I'm facing
Sold my car to a junk yard
And bought a one-way bus ride
Take me across the border I'll cool out and hide
...
