The man finds himself alone
For the first time in his life
He's always got a problem
He's got to work it out wrong or right

He's got to work it out
He's so lonely in the night
He's got to work it out, all alone

Now who in the world would believe
That he's got another trick up his sleeve
And who in the world wants to know
Which way should he go

Which way should he turn?
Which way should he learn?
Which day should he stop?
Which way to the top?

I remember him when we were friends
When we were young, way back then
I still can recall when we were small
How he tried his best to warn us all

This living on his own has turned his heart
To stone and it's all pain
He sits out on his own and eats his heart
Out alone in the pouring rain

Now who in the world would have know
That just a few years ago
His love could have grown and grown
...
