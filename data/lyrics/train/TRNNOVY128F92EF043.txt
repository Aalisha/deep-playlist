This is music for the people,
this is the music for the people.
Nothing more, nothing less,
we tip our hats to bands that give it their best
I hope that you will understand, if not we'll make you understand
To me punk music is real,
it's the energy thats the appeal.
You may be old school but that means dick
times are changing, we're the new breed!

Yes we've got a problem and I guess that problem's you.
