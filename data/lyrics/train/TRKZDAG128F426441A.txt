Last call for the moon tonight
Read all, rain on Friday night
Take back all the things I said
Lay down, rest your pretty head now

Last call no more drinks tonight
And it's not your fault, it's time to walk away from
This velvet box, full of alcohol
And TV talks, gone on far too long

Take anything that's better for me
Take anything that's better for you
Take anything that's better for me
Take it now
