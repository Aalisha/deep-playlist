I was young then
But I remember when
When I'd need to hide away

I had a secret place I'd go
Where I could just be on my own
And I didn't feel afraid

But even though I'm older now and things have changed
When I'm in your arms I'm right back there again

(Chorus:)
You're the place that I can run to
When I need somewhere to hide
You're my compass and my lifeline
All wrapped into one
You're where I feel safe
You're my secret place
You're my secret place
