Shocked Orwellian races
Gather united in grief
Nothing is left from the world they have known
Grotesque indifferent belief
Systems have failed
Rules can't control
Corrupt dictators forever dethroned
Lies of the priest
Trust of the blind
Failure of structures manipulate deviant crimes

All nations hail the end of peace
New dawn inception of disease
Age of revenge has now been born
By the mother of all wars

Enemy of god
Purity and innocence is killed
Enemy of god
Peace has died the day when life stood still

Clash of demonic religions
Hatred the human divine
Despotic aggressors in triumph they reign
Fanatics bring mayhem to life
War of all wars
...
