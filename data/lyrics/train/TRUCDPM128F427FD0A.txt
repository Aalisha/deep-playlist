Don't you ever try to solve a problem in distress
The infected smile upon your face
looks so godly in this mess
Shut down- all your dreams
Confess- you're released
You know- what I mean
can't stop this strangulation alone

wait for chaos, wait for the welfare at this point of no return
bleed for money, bleed for justice, going straight to hell
with a wounded soul
Reaching out for a solid soul
of compassion and excitement

-Do I dare to trust my faith right now
