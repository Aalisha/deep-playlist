I believe what you say
When you say you're goin' steady
With nobody else but me
I believe what you say
When you say you don't kiss
Nobody else but me
I believe (I believe)
Do believe (do believe)
I believe (I believe)
Yeah, I believe, pretty baby
Believe you're goin' steady
With nobody else but me

Well, there's-a one thing, baby
That I wantcha to know
When you're rockin' with me
Don't rock too slow
A-Move on in, get toe-to-toe
We're gonna rock till we can't rock no more

I believe (I believe)
