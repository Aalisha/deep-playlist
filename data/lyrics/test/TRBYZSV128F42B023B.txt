Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself we all lost touch

Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough

Body rise look what's over me

Oh chariot your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot I'm singing out loud
To guide me, give me your strength

Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy

There is a living promised land
