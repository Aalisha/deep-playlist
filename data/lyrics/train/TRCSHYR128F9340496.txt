Lying here beneath me
I could feel your soul
Wrapped in understanding
That was long ago

Face to face
Fast asleep
Empty space
Along I creep

Why go on?
Even try
You wake so innocenty
Then you rip the stars from the sky

I'm down in it
Underneath with nowhere to hide
I'm down in it

All I want is you now
That and nothing more
Black eyes see right through you
Farther than before
