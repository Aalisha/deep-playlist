I had a girl that I used to see
She's precious and so sweet
Like Velcro she was attached to me

20 hours outta 24
She's always knocking at my door
So I said,? Hey baby, I need some room to breathe?

Please believe, we'll go our seperate ways
Then like the critics, she had something to say

Talk about good times
Talk about bad times
Don't talk about me

Girl, talk about the good times
Talk about the bad times
Don't talk about me

Funny how you accuse me of something
That I know nothing about
Never said I was engaged to you

I never promised you a rose garden
Only said that we could go out
Now you're telling your friends I'm hard on you

Please believe, we'll go our seperate ways
And just like the critics, she always had something to say
...
