[Me] I can't move, I can't feel my body 
I don't remember anything 
What place is this... how did I get here? 
I don't understand, what's happening... Am I alone? 

[Fear] You've been deserted, everyone has left you 
You know it's always been that way 
Those frantic years, the people you've neglected 
Now the time has come to pay 
You're alone 
No one here is dancing to your tune 

[Me] Is this a dream or is it real? 
[Reason] Sometimes the dream becomes reality 
[Me] But I don't know what to feel 
[Reason] Then I will guide you through this haze 
[Me] But who are you, why are you here? 
[Reason] I am you and you are all of us 
[Me] I can't think, my mind ain't clear 
[Reason] Then I will free you from this maze 

[Passion] Can't you feel it burn 
Deep down inside? 
Won't you ever learn 
Don't try to hide

Can't you feel that fire? 
Scorching you soul? 
A wounded man's desire 
Out of control 

[Pride] I can't believe you're giving up 
That's not your way 
...
