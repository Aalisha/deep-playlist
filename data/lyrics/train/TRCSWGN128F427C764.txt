This evening at sundown
We meet in our small town
Everyone's going without ever knowing
To meet for the countdown

Our friends and our families
All hangout at Riley's
We stay for a while and jam out Guiel
Then walk on down George Street

And this road we choose
Nothing to lose at all
That's the way it was
And the way it is

Gone are the old days
Now we're onto something new
Our lives in the fast lane
...
