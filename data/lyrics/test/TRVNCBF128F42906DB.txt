Spoken:
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
We're gonna try it one mo' time
The new, Cross Cut Saw
Comin' at you, hot an' heavy
Watch this!
Got a hell-uva groove to it, too!

Hey brother, aah!

I'm a cross cut saw
Just drag me across your log
I'm a cross cut saw
Just drag me across your log
I'll cut your wood so easy for you
You can't help but say 'Hot dog!'

Some call me 'Wood-Choppin Sam'
Some call me 'Wood-Cuttin Bill'
Last girl I cut the wood for
Want me back again

I'm a cross-cut saw
Just drag me across your log
I'll cut your wood so easy for you
You can't help me say, 'Hot dog')

Now dig this!
