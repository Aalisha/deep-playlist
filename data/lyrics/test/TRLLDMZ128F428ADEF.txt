I will love you anyway
Even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me
Here is where you ought to be

I just want to satisfy
Though you're not mine, I can't deny
Don't you hear me talking, baby?
Love me now or I'll go crazy

Oh, sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything?
Oh, sweet thing
Don't you know you're my everything?
Yes, you are

I wish you were my lover
But ya act so undercover
To love you child my who life long
Be it right or be it wrong
