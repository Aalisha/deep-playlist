And I know that you just dont wanna wait
But baby you gotta understand
All the things that I want from my man
Cause you know what they say about the kiss and my baby
You just show me what I want
Or youll be missing us baby
Only worth a good kiss
Can you give me like this
Only through resist
Can I move my hips
Only worth a good kiss
Can you give me like this
Only through resist
Can I move my hips
You gotta know how to please me baby
Dont hesitate cause Im still waiting
Every woman needs a damn good kiss
If you really wanna be with me then do it like this
If you just wanna be with me then try to listen baby
You show me just what I want
Or I might be dissing you baby
