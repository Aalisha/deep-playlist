Operator, operator
I'm so glad that you rang my phone
Operator, operator
I'm so glad that you found me home

I can hear my long gone lover
I've waited such a long, long time
So, please, operator
Put him on the line

I want him on the line
I wanna talk to that
Long gone lover of mine

Operator, operator
There is static in my line
Did he say that love was true
Did he say that his love was mine
