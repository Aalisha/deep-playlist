I entered the room
Sat by your bed all through the night
I watched your daily fight
I hardly knew

The pain was almost more than I could bear
And still I hear
Your last words to me.
Heaven is A Place Nearby

So I wont be so far away.
And if you try and look for me
Maybe youll find me someday.
Heaven is A Place Nearby

So theres no need to say goodbye
I wanna ask you not to cry
...
