Hey, hey turn up that song
I think about you when it comes on
And I get lifted off the ground
And when you're in my arms
I feel the beat down in my heart
It makes my world spin around

So come on, baby, you know the moment's right
Yeah, take me by the hand
And we can rock away the night

I wanna dance till the break of day
To the music that we make
There's never been a sweeter sound
I wanna wake the neighbors
Make the headlines in the mornin' paper
...
