This big-time ride is all I know
A picture-perfect life on show
Stellar nights that never end
And people claim to be your friend

But you are the one I need
No place I'd rather be
Here only I can breathe
Love is a simple thing for free
Please don't take that away from me
Forgive me if it sounds mundane

What matters now is our ordinary day
ordinary day
What matters now is our ordinary day
ordinary day, ordinary day
...
