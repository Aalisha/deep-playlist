Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

Too close, too close for comfort, please, not again
Too close, too close to know just when to say "When"

Be wise, be smart, behave, my heart
Don't upset your cart when she's so close
Be soft, be sweet, but be discreet
Don't go off your feet, she's so close for comfort
