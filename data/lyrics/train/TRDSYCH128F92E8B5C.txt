Under the TV lights you fell asleep again
Don't know I'm writing this song about you
There's a picture of a Hollywood sign reflecting off your skin
I don't wanna live another day without you

You woke up and said baby I had one of those dreams again
The rain came down and I lost you in the wind
You said something about don't leave before you fell back sleep
Before I could sing my song back to you

But you could find yourself lost out in this world
And I'd find a way to get back to your side
No mountain's too high, no stone is too small
I'll build a bridge through the fire
For you I would crawl from New York to California
