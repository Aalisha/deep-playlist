Blame it on the street
I gotta get some lovin' tonight
Lay it down on me honey
This girl is outta sight

One night stand, travellin' with the band
Passion in a motel room
A magic touch, never too much
Then she blows me right over the moon

I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street
I'm goin' down
Down on dirty street

Hangin' at the bar
