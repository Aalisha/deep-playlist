I've cried an ocean of salty tears, so torn apart by love
Struggled through so many lonely years, dying for a lover's touch
Now that I'm lying here safe in your arms
Baby, I would go through it all again

I'd fall back down on my knees, spend desperate years lost at sea
Baby, to get to you
I'd go through every heartbreak, lose every last bit of faith
Baby, to get to you

Recry every hard tear, face every dark fear
Just to feel the sun break through
Baby, to get to you
...
