Eyes of silver, hungry and aware
Eyes of silver, your mystic love I share
'Cause I'm hungry baby for the love you give away
Kick out all that stupid pride that's standin' in my way

Inside my loving eyes are open wide
Eyes of silver, on which I shall rely
Diamonds are forever, and gold can make you lie
But your eyes of silver shine on, shine on

Blades of steel have helped a man to conquer all
