Come on down come on down
You'll never get to heaven if you wear a frown
There's more to life then a TV gameshow
Where money wraps your halo
Yeah
I'm gonna write your name in he book of angels
Laughing moments, curse the rising moon
When the whole world shatters
It's what you got inside that matters (angel)
So spread your wings and fly away 
From terror, fear and dismay (angel)
It's much to late to sit and cry
Forget the past just walk on by (angel)
There's a party going on in atomic city
Some are dancing but none are sitting pretty
There's a party going on in atomic city
Some are slaves but none are sitting pretty
* We've got no ozone
We got radiation
