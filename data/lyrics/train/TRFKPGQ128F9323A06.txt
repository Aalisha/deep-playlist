? Hey there? she said? Looking good
What you doing tonight?
One look and I know I can't control
This feeling stirring inside

'Cause it's not love, it's something more
It will brake love, throw to the floor, yeah

Darling I'd love to feel that way
And stand right by your side
Oh, Lucille come to take me away
Cause tonight love ain't on my mind, alright
