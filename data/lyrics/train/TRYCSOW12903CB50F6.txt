is that the fear i feel or suicidal nervousness
i'm tearing through the night with a distorted consciousness
when depressions are nominating with lots of chemicals (inside)
displacing everything, everything in my mind
while i see myself on slides completely blurred and grey
when the world has shown me is such a disgusting way

look out - i am in spiritual confusion!
