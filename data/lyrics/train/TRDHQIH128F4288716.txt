So you tell me she's a little cheater
She's a man eater, yeah that's all right
'Cause I think I know her better, you can keep your chatter
And I know it's gonna be alright

(Bite your tongue)
You know I don't want to hear this
(Bite your tongue)
You know I've been told before
And I don't wanna hear it anymore

'Cause you're not talking 'bout my girl
(No no)
She is her Daddy's pearl
(Oh oh)
She wouldn't hurt me for the world
(No no)
Oh oh oh
