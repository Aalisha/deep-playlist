You've got it all
Six seven times
You've got it all
Makes me feel so fine
And it's all there is

It's typical of you
Standing out in the pouring rain
It's typical of you
Looking like you do

And the day I'll catch your eye
Could another chance come by
I should really know by now
Would I ask you anyhow?

It's typical of you
Looking like you do
It's typical of you
Love me like you do
