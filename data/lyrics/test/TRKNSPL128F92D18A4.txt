Come on

You, you got, you got
You got what I want
You got, you got, you got what I need
Only you, baby, only you
Only you, you, you, you, you

I ain't never had nobody
Love me like you do
I ain't never had nobody
Please me through and through
I ain't never had nobody
Talk to me this way

Nobody even comes close
When it comes to loving me

You, come on, you got, you got
You got what I want
You got, you got, you got what I need
Only you, baby, only you
