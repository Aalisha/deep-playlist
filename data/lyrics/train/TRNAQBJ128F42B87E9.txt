Please excuse me but I've got to ask
Are you only being nice
Because you want something
My fairytale arab princess
Be careful how you respond
Cause you might end up in this song
I never gave you an encouragement
And it's doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in
Doing me in

The more you try to erase me
The more, the more
The more that I appear
...
