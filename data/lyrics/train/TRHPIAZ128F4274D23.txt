Aww... show your right
To all of my brothers
Show your right
To all of my sisters
Show your right
To my mothers and my fathers
Show your right, you know you're right
Show your right

Yeah, what up people livin' in this world
Who know that the time is now
Peace to the sun child, Gods and earths alike
Truly we got that know-how, we got that know-how
That what, where, why and when
Oh, wow, is that fool at it again?
Oh yes, we goin' to the promised land, jack
Where you won't get spooked by a casper
Last of the second half who spoke and spat it
Kick the science and then math to add it
Life is a habit
Don't combat it, dog
I gots to breathe and smoke before I breathe in smog
I step outside and I hug the street
I spit life through the mic, flow and love the beats
So let me count the ways while I count my scars
I count for paydays but I still count stars
Can't count counterclockwise
I gotta count yards
So don't count me out on account I ain't actin' hard
So don't tell me how it could be
'cause positivity has been good to me
And negativity is no good to me
It's not good for me
It's understood to me
