Watch you, on the one's and two's
Through a window in a well lit room
Become a recluse
And I blame myself cause I make things hard and you're just trying to help
And when I wake up, you're the first to call
This is one more late night basement song
And I'm so sore, my voice has gone to hell
and this is one more sleepless night
Because we don't believe in filler baby
If I could I'd sit this out

This is a lesson in procrastination
I kill myself because I'm so frustrated
And every single second that I put it off
Means another lonely night I got to race the clock
What say we go and crash your car?
And every time I leave you go and lock the door
So I walk myself picking at a chip on my shoulder
I'm another day late and one year older
