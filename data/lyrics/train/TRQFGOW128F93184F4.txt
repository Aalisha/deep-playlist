(feat. Eric Clapton)

I tell ya brother, man shit happens
by the way, howzit with you?
Check out the kid, finger on the button
oh yeah, it’s a wonderful world, huh

When every night, things are getting grimmer
And all your dreams seem dumb and absurd
You need a light, shinin how to tell you
Oh yeah, it’s a wonderful world

I’ll be leaving in the morning
Far away from you, yeah

Somedays you have to take a jump in the blue

Nothing Endin’ my depression
Nothing

It’s commin’ Oh my obsession
It’s commin’

Don’t make it bad if you have a vision
You’ll never need to follow the herd
