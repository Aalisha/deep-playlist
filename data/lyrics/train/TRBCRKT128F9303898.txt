I, I, I can't get full
Please could you take my shakes
And would you hold them still
My words fell into the road
I saw it starting to happen
And I could not collect them
Before they were rolled
I could not collect them
Before they were rolled

You love, you love, you love
I hate the way you love
I hate the way you love
