[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]

I never seen a ho that could make a cheese flowuntil I moved to texas where the shake junts ain't brokewhen I feel up off da plane the only thing stuck in my mind
I know I'm fucked up but shit I gotta get on mineso now I gotta sell a little pussy hoe to stainnation wide cds and hoes on the mainmost of my niggaz they ridin clean cheefa a qaurter pound of skunkbroke rappers on the shelf while I be slangin out the trunk
