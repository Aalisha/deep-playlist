[** feat. MURS:]
[Intro: ~MURS~ {*Talking*}]
That was, that was the end*
And it squashed the whole beef
Uh, uh, ah, uh, uh
[Verse 1: ~Brother Ali~]
I'm so incredibly nasty, yes, my mama slapped me when she had me
Told me get your ass out with your daddy
Talked hella trash and my teachers couldn't stand me
Used to call me bastard and told me I was trashy
Unsupervised child, they call me a latch key
At risk youth from a single parent family
Nuts got hairy and my voice got raspy
Crews were gettin acne, I was gettin savvy
Yes I'm a bad motherfucker, understand me?
Grew up beaten, broken glass, rappin in the alley
Got my hands dirty, I was hidin in a trash heap
Hoppin out, knockin out cats, grabbin they ten speed
