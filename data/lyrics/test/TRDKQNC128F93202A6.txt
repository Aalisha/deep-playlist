Little children, you better not tell on me I'm tellin' you
Little children, you better not tell what you see And if you're good
I'll give you candy and a quarter
If you're quiet like you oughta be
And keep a secret with me

I wish they would go away
Little children, now why aren't you playin' outside I'm askin' you
...
