You ain't never had to cry, baby
Don't start cryin', now
You ain't never had to cry, baby
Don't start cryin', now
You ain't never loved me, baby
Didn't mean me no good, no how

Well, the man you got, baby
He don't mean you no good
Well, the man you got, baby
He don't mean you no good
He's just breakin' you down
