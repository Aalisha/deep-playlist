(Raise your can of beer on high)
(And seal your fate forever)
(Our best years have past us by)

Poised on the brink of eternity
Four and ninety studded horsemen closed the knot of honor
As only drunken soldiers can

And passed from man to man
A wanton child, too dead to care
That each would find his pleasure as he might
For this fantastic night was billed
As nothing less than the end of an age
A last crusade, a final outrage
