Lot of people talking 'bout
Giving up and walking out these days
Made up their minds they don't want the hurt
Designed not to take the work it takes
Whatever happened
To hanging on and going the extra mile
Whatever happened
To believing
Let's bring it back

A true love that lasts
Let's take a chance
Spending a lifetime together
In a slow dance
In a deep trance
In a romance
Let's bring it back
...
