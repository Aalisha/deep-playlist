Shorty, trust me when I say
You're looking John Blaze in your lingerie
And Shorty, I like the way you play and move about on stage
I won't be mad at you for swingin' it my way

I've got my money on you
Big faces spankin' brand new
While I'm here this is what you need to do
Come and get this money

If you don't want everyone to see
Just how naughty you can really be
We can ease off to the V.I.P.
Come and get this money

Not too many wear it quite as well
You take care of yourself, it ain't hard to tell, no
Not too many can go into a split
From standin' to a sit, I ain't mad at you, not one bit

I've got my money on you
Big faces spankin' brand new
...
