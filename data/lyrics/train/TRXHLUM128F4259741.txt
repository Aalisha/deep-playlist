I watch it trickle from your lips
Pearls of ruby red soaking up your head until you want to push through
And then the world turns red
And the wine tastes sour
Pushing back the hand until the midnight hour

Every door is closing behind you
There's no one left to come and find you
You're soaking wet but the file won't dry you
I'd like to help but I cant stand by

And watch you twisting the knife
They've got you wasting your life
Can't stop you twisting the knife
...
