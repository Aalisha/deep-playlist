Tonight you're going to
Overload your mind
Move into another world
There for you online
A high speed chase that
Leads to the unknown
Time will disappear so fast
For you and you alone

A universe in isolation
Feeding you imagination

No-one cares about
The role you play
Generations lost in space
A million miles away
