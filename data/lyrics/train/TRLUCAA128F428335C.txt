Let's not fight it anymore
Unpack the bags and close the door
I'll never leave you, no no
Though you lied right from the start
I can't convince my stupid heart
Not to believe you, no no
You've got two good men strung out
And there's not the slightest doubt
That other men have loved you before
But you work your thing so well
I dream of Heaven and I live in Hell
Till I can't take it anymore
Take it anymore

If I had one ounce of pride
I'd stand up or step aside
...
