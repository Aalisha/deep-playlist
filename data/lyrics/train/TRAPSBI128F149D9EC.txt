Up among the heather at the hill a' Benachee
Rolling with a wee girl underneath the tree
A bungbee stung me well above the knee
Up among the heather at the hill a' Benachee

As i begon to roem on a summers day
I spyed a banny lassy stoor all among the bray
She was picking wiled berrys, and i offer her a hand
Saying meyby i can help you fill your wee tin can
Up among the heather at the hill a' Benachee
Rolling with a wee girl underneath the tree
A bungbee stung me well above the knee
Up among the heather at the hill a' Benachee

Says I'm a bonny lassie, are ya going to spend the day
Up amongst the heather, where all the lads and lassies play
...
