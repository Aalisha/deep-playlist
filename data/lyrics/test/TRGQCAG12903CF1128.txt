You hide in your room
You won't share your love with nobody else, well, well
You feel safe and warm
Locked in a world that you made for yourself

Don't you think it's time

Let me put love on your mind
Let me be the one to put a smile in your life
Let me put love on your mind
Let me put love on your mind
