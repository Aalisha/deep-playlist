Forever your eyes will hold the memory
I saw your heart as it overtook me
we tried so hard to understand and reason
but in that one moment i gave my heart away

I gave my heart away
in that moment I gave my heart away
in that moment I gave my heart away

With that perfect breath where my mind lay beside me
and all i knew is what had overtaken me
...
