I'm a realist
I'm a romantic
I'm an indecisive piece of shit

I'm a realist
I'm a romantic
I am indecisive and that's about it

And you dream that's the same thing
That's the same life you lead
I don't agree and so you drink
Don't wanna think
That's 'cause your mind is already made up

I'm a realist
I'm a romantic
