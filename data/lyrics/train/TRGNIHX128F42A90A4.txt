1.
got a skin of sun
i'm breathing ceeophane
got a fadin' tan
to offer to the rain
who's the refere
when winter plays the ball?
runnin out of time
to celebrate the fall
out of the roundabout
out of the roundabout

got a cotton hat
to wear all year round
got a time disease
that keeps me upsidedown
and the willow trees
are spittin' out some green
i would give a look
but springtime looks a scream
out of the roundabout
