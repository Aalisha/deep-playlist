(Verse 1)
Some people are born to live alone
And go about life that way,
Their home is a long stretch
Of blacktop and everyday,
Is just another day,
They like movin' and stayin on the run
And tryin' to make the world stand still
White lines and city limit signs
And life is like an automobile's
Rollin' down the highway what a fine time
That's the only way to feel

(Chorus)
Wheels,
Stay under me,
Stay under me
Wheels,
Stay under me,
Stay under me

(Verse 2)
It's a freedom that we all wanna know
...
