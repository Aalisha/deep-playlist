Yeah, if you want it I got it ya need it baby
yeah, its Warren G beeyatch

Jah Skills-
(Jah Skills will just speak)
As I enter the G-Funk Era
(tell me why you tweak)
well I dont know why however
my mind is throbbing
I went bobbing for snapple
mixed with E&J so my insides just crackle pop
snap long time ago ya lost ya flow
now you realize wack MCs I must chastize (what)
the gun totin bumpin indosmokin
bad ass english cuz its broken
couldn't turn my styles even if ya had a token
you was hopin that I would quit but (aww shit)
I'm hangin around like nut sacs with a dick
I'm sick, I know that styles abstract up your ass crack
lovin this shit called rap ass burnin through your back (Jah Skills
muthafucka)
I'm stoppin fools like blood clots
my lyrics rang out to stop parties like there was gun shots
why oh why oh why well why not
shouldn't I represent this shit called hip hop and it wont stop

Warren G-
Well are you high yet
Can you recollect ya talk shit you get checked
Mr. Smutly I'm not a punk thief
let me break thee, smoke thee, choke thee and locc thee
