Love is a hunger that burns in my soul
But you never noticed the pain.
Love in an anchor that wont let me go
I reached out to hold you
But you push me away and you always convinced me to stay.
And I wonder why we hold on with tears in our eyes
And I wonder why we have to break down to make things alright
And I wonder why I can't seem to tell you good bye Yeah, I wonder why

I'm no angel my selfish pride but I love you more everyday.
