It's been so long for us
We've learned to love and trust
Through thick and thin
This love will never end
My heart belongs to you

Seems like, just yesterday
We fell in love this way
They say in life
That everything must change
But your love still remains

You love me just like the first time
And you hold me just like the first time
...
