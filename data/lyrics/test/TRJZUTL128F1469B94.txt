Anyway, it doesn't matter, I don't feel so awfully sad
without you putting everything and nothing upside
down: I'm managing this wreck quite well alone.
Maybe, if I must be sincere, I hear a little too much
silence when I hang around just looking at the mirror in
the bathroom talking to myself alone.
But I'm sure these empty nights will end as soon as I
begin to realize that freedom is a bird that flies
alone, alone...

All alone in my loneliness,
