(Verse 1)
To whom this may be concerned
To those who may want to learn
I'm writing this to you
The reason I won't be here no more (no more)
Reason I won't live I yearn (I yearn)
The reason I won't be on this earth
Cause I will die if you were to leave

(Chorus)
Oh, look what you've done
It's like a disease
I'm dying from a broken heart
Oh, look what you've done
Your the remedy
I'm dying from a broken heart

(Verse 2)
Some may not understand the words I sing
They have no idea how that feels me
