Oh signorita
When the evening sun go down
I come to serenade you
From another part of town.

Rafaella is my mother's name.
She loves her Juan Jose
My mother is a matriarch
Oh what more can I say
Together they raised three children
Mario Carmen and Ray
They live near de Janeiro
on Mona da Vinci Bay

I'm gonna eat my rice and beans
I'm gonna suck on a chili dog
Way down in Spanish Town
In the Spanish fog

Oh I love you to meet my friend Don Juan
He loves to play the mandolin
Signoritas they gather 'round'
...
