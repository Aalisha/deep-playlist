There never really is a good time
There's always nothing much to say
Pretty good, not doing that fine
Getting up most every day
Steppin' out, I tried to fix it
Pulled a thumb out of that hole
Give me ingredients, I'll mix it
How can you move without a goal
There never really is a good time
There's always nothing much to say
