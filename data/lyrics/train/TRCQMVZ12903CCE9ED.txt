The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones
And young ones
Shouldn't be afraid

To live, love
While the flame is strong
'Cause we may not be the young ones
Very long

Tomorrow
Why wait until tomorrow?
'Cause tomorrow
Sometimes never comes

So love me
There's a song to be sung
And the best time is to sing
...
