Well it's so hard to face
That in this day and age
Somebody's race can trigger somebody's rage

And somebody's preference
Can drive some total stranger
To make somebody somehow feel the wrath of their anger

Why were we put here?
What for? We're unsure
We sure weren't put here to hate
Be racist, be sexist
Be bigots, be sure;
We won't stand for your hate

Now why so cut and dry
A simple concept missed
Give tolerance a try
