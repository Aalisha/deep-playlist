Your kisses are wasted on me.
Your kisses are wasted on me.
Your kisses are wasted on me.
Your kisses are wasted on me.

Boy, can't you see we're through?
Boy, I don't love you,
Don't make me smile,
For a while.

Boy, get out of my face.
Boy, I'm going back out to chase,
Some other guy;
Who I might like.
