They call me Mr. Pitiful
Baby that's my name now
They call me Mr. Pitiful
That's how I got my fame
But people just don`t seem to understand

How someone can feel so blue
They call me Mr Pitiful 'cause I lost someone just like you.
The call me Mr. Pitiful
This everybody know now

They call me Mr. Pitiful most every place I go.
But nobody seems to understand now,
How can a man sing such a sad song
When he lost everything that he had.
