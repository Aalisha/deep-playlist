There's a fire in my heart
And it's burning all the time
And I wonder, and I wonder
How you ever sleep at night
I've been calling in the dark
I've been counting on your time
And I wonder, and I wonder
Why it hurts to be alive

Got a message on my phone
I wasn't keeping count
I know you like to talk in code
I've got you figured out
Nobody said it was easy
Yeah, but you gotta believe me
Because I'm losing out
Yeah, I gotta tell ya

There's a fire in my heart
And it's burning all the time
And I wonder, and I wonder
How you ever sleep at night
I've been calling in the dark
I've been counting on your time
And I wonder, and I wonder
Why it hurts to be alive
