Ooh I love you baby, heyyy
But I'm just a man, check this out!

What you want me to do woman,
sit and worry over you, no can do (no can do)
What you want me to say baby
that I'm going crazy, no way! no ifs, no buts, no maybe

(I love you) you know I do
(I love you) you know it's true
(I love you) don't you understand
(I love you) ooh, oh, oh
