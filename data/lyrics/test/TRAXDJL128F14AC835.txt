Waiting here tonight
For the guy who's deceiving you
Like the other night
When he could not come home
But tomorrow night
When the phone rings he's telling you
Everything's alright
And you know it's not true
What am I to do
What am I to do
I've no clue

Like a shot in the dark
That is hitting a Lark
At the heiont of a heavenly song
Like a shot in the dark
Took a walk in the park
And I saw what I knew all along
I saw the kiss
That so long I'd missed
I saw the charm
Of the girl in your arm
Like a shot in the dark

When he's coming home
You will kiss him when he comes in
