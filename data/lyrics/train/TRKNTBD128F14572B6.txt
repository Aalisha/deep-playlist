Watch out

Have you heard the word on the streets today?
We're packin' out, it ain't your way, your way
Roll out the carpet and kneel onto the ground
Shut off the party 'cause we're coming 'round

Step into the fire
We're here to stray for you
We're taking you higher
That's what we're paid to do

Hell raisers from town to town
...
