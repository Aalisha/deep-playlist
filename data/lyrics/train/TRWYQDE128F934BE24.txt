The truly weak spread venom
The truly strong digest it

Rotting from the inside
This agonized form resembles a man
Scorn burst from the heart
Rancor cracking ribs
Coating it's recesses in toxins

Base loathing within the loins seeps malice through it's pores
Ashing tissues
Blackened with contempt
Pestilent
Corrosive to the touch
A blight on humanity
