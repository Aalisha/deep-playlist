(Ignore reality there's nothing you can do about it)

Some people
Don't worry
'Bout nothing
Don't know what's going on
I'm not one
Who can't say they're sorry
I just care what's going on
There's more important
Than making sure your watch look just right
And second hand opinions
Don't make you look any smarter

Don't you think that maybe it's time, yes it's time
Time you started thinking
Time you started thinking
Time you started thinking
Time you started thinking
