We had each other
And we never knew how much we had
Hurt one another
'till we took the good and turned it bad
But now we're so much wiser
And we both know the score
Can we try just once more

Oh baby give me one reason
Why we shouldn't fall in love again
Oh baby give me one reason
Why we couldn't give our all again
If you miss me like I miss you
Oh baby give me one reason
Why we shouldn't fall in love again
