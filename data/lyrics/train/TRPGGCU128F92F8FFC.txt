Here she comes now sayinâ€™ Mony Mony
Shoot 'em down, turn around, come on Mony
Hey! She give me love and I feel all right now

Turn it in
You gotta toss and turn and feel all right
Yeah, I feel all right
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

'Cause you make me feel, like a pony
So good, like a pony
So good, like a pony
So good, Mony Mony

So fine, Mony Mony
So fine, Mony Mony
It's all mine, Mony Mony
Well I feel all right
(Mony Mony)
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Well you could shake it Mony Mony
Shotgun dead and I'll come on Mony
Don't stop cookin' 'cause I feel all right now, hey!

But don't stop now, come on Mony, come on yeah
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

'Cause you make me feel, like a pony
So good, like a pony
So good, like a pony
Well I feel all right
(Mony Mony)

You so fine, Mony Mony
