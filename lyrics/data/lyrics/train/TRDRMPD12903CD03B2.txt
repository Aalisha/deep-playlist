So question; why did you cut me out?
Your life is in nothing but shambles now.
Through thick and thin, I was there holding your hand
And one things for certain; nothing's according to plan.
And now I must ask:
How could you?

All of the way, all of the way
You kept feeling,
I kept fighting.
All you ever knew, all you ever knew
Is breaking like a wave as the sunlight fades.

Give way, the forsaken survive by your daylight,
And before my time you'll find yourself mistaken
For someone who had a shred of heart.

I am the one, I am the one
You'll never know until the day I'm gone.
