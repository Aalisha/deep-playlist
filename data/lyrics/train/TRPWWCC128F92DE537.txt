Michelle Williams
Private Party

Tell me if it's a crime
Maybe I'm wrong
But out of my mind
When I see what I want
(Come and get it)
I'm grown
(Don't forget it)
I don't mind showing him
I'm so wide open tonight

Baby, tonight
We can spend some quality time
You'll tell me secrets, baby I'll tell you mine
You can rest your feet and unwind (for a minute)
Be mine (for a minute)

You're so invited
To the party
I will cater to you
Make you feel like a man
I can
So come on
...
