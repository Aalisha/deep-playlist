Ooh ahh baby aww she gaw yeah
Tell me how you like it so far baby pa
I thought I thought I saw some good putty tat by the bar
But when the light hit him yo I was like nah
Put the needle to the record when I'm gettin butt naked
I like your microphone do you mind if I check it
One two yeah I like the way it sounds 
No feedback I need that turn your ass around
Ding dong is anybody home I'm like
King Kong on a throne in Rome
I don't have a car yet no rims of chrome
No diamonds no pretty stones
Just a dresser drawer filled with broken cell phones
But I didn't pay my bill so no dial tones
But I don't care hey people get loud
Jump on the stage can you hear me now?

Step step uhh
Like that
