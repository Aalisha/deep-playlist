Look in the mirror
Does it look familiar
Cannot put my finger
Why he kinda looks like me

Used to like hooking up with you
After waking first thing I'd do
One sided sensation
Watching me watching you

Now I'm stuck how I feel
I don't know if it's real
I'm trying to find someone
Who's invisible

Now I'm stuck in the middle
My life is the riddle
Trying to find someone
Who's invisible

No way
I cannot lie
I haven't felt right
And I don't know why
Drowning
No coming up for air
