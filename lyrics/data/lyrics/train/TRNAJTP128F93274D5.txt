I was born in a dump
my mother died
my daddy got drunk
they Left me here
to die or grow
in the middle of
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road

i Grew up in a rusty shack
all I ever owned babe
was hangin' on my back
Lord above know
how much I loathe
this mean ol' place called
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road

But it's home yes
the only life I've ever known
and the lord knows
how much I loathe
Tobacco Road (Road, Road, Road)

Tobacco Road, yeah (Road, Road, Road)
...
