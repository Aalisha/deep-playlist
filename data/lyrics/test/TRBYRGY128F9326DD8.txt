I said I'd hold, I said I'd hold,
I said I'd hold you in my heart till I can hold you in my arms
Like you've never been held before
Well I'll think of you each day and then I'll dream the night away
Oh, till you are in my arms once more

The stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why
I feel so blue cause I'm away from you
...
