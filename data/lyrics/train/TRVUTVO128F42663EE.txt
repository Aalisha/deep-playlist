My heart has found a new beat
Ever since you came into my life
No I don't lose no sleep
'Cause I know He's walking by my side
And if you're looking for me
Safe in His arms is where you'll find me
'Cause I've gotta be
Gotta be happy
Wanna be happy

I was searching for a long time
For the right one to give my heart to
Then suddenly I looked to the sky
And I realized that it should be you
'Cause sometimes I stray away
And I make mistakes
But you still love me
So now and forever
Your arms is where I will be

My heart has found a new beat
Ever since you came into my life
