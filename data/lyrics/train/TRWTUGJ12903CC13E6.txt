Evil, evil, evil or Divine?
Evil, evil, evil or Divine?
Evil, evil, evil or Divine?

Looking in the mirror,
Am I apart of something more?
I am reaching for the unknown
One tense is to my questions
Frustrations going stronger
I haven't found my way

Come in time, I'm in the middle
On the battlefield I am toss
Open up my eyes, let me see, ya!

Are we evil or divine?
That's the question of the time!
Are we evil or divine?
It's so hard to see you side
When the world is going blind!
