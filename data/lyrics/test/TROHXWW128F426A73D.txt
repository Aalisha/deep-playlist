nothing free
roachford

if i coud just have a wish
of my heart's desire
and i wish for happiness
would it satisfy would it satisfy
or would each day just feel the same
highs without the lows
would i long for the ups and downs
to satisfy my soul satisfy my soul
nothin' free
nothin' free
nothin' free
