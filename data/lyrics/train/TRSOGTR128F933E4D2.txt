Spin away the combination for the last time
Say goodbye to this year
I wish I could avoid the empty
Summer days that await me
They'll fake a smile goodbye
Celebrating their new freedom
I'll sit alone on the couch
Wondering why

I wonder what it's like to have it all
To never be afraid that I would fall
But I don't think I've ever known a time
That I was part of the in crowd

Here we go another day another disgrace
Fall flat on my face
I wish I had a bunch of money
Catch a plane, head out west
They'll run and play around
All full of their phantom freedom
I'll sit alone on the couch
...
