Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places feel the chill
Nightfall covers me but you know the plans i'm making
Still over sea could it be the whole earth opening wide
A sacred why a mystery gaping inside
The weekends why until we

Dance into the fire that fatal kiss is all we need
...
