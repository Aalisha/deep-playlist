Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard to sneakin' out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal records says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh God, I, I

Every memory of lookin' at the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye
Every memory of walkin' at the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
