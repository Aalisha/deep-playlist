I've been betrayed, and lied to and spat on
Kicked when I'm down
And then I hit the ground
I hope you're happy
Happy-slappy sweetness
It's not my business
It means nothing to me
It's a called a cup of tea

And oh you can have your fun
But when it's done
Don't come crying to me
Jack and Jill had babies
And now I'm the one who's craziest
Crazy
