Now what do you want from me?
When I've sacrificed my heart so you can be set free
And time will never cure this disease
I'm only left with tired arms to stop from drowning

This, this is loveless
Love, your love is hopeless, oh

What do you want from me?
When I've sacrificed my heart so you can be set free

This, this is loveless
Love, your love is hopeless

Do you remember on that night
I couldn't find the words to say I'm sorry
And If you recall that night you ripped
My heart right out before saying I loved you

Do you believe in this?
Do you believe in me?
