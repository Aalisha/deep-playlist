Why you look so sad when the sky is perfect blue

And you're getting everything you ever wanted to?
Let's no talk about the bad times
we've been thought that before

It's not right for making love anymore.

So stop your fussin'
boy
please
stop your fussin'
boy

Your time will come
yes
your time will come.

Can you lay me down in meadows soft and green?
And can you lay me down and talk to me of things
Like stars that burn into the night

And moons that turn with purple lines. That's what I want!

Just stop your fussin'
boy
please
...
