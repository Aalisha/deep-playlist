I was born son of Cameron brother of Brendon
Been through so much shit I don't know how I'm still standin
I come from a place that's cold and dark
Where brothers gotta dodge bullets just to make their mark
Yo I grew up in the eighties around domestic violence
But my family was proud so we kept it silent
The ladies in my fam held it all together
And I was introduced to rap despite the stormy weather
I remember listenin to Kool Moe Dee
I kicked his verses like that shit straight belonged to me
I used to loungin in my room bumpin Raising Hell
Wishing I could be like KRS-One or LL
All the honeys gassed me up and made my ego swell
Cause I was doin it, and doin it, and doin it well
I was only sixteen terrorising the stage
They used to call me Stud B cause I was big for my age
I was rhymin bout my skills and my sexual clout
When I barely even knew what I was talkin about
Straight tellin all my peoples when my album was droppin
Every time the day came there was nuttin to be coppin
But still I rock show after show and never stop
