Join with me in graceful dance
And summon the company of angels
The Heavens and earth bear witness to this
While all of creation will sing

Only to You, for all eternity
Our voices sing and praise
Only to You, all Heaven will celebrate
Our Savior, our King
Only to You, only to You, only to You

One that I love, my heart has seen
The day will come, the return of our King
