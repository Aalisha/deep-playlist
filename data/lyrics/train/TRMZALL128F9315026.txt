INTRO

"Good evening. This is the intergalactic operator. Can I help you?"
"Yes. I'm trying to reach flight commander P.R. Johnson, on Mars, flight 2-4-7"
"Very well, hold on please (beeping) you're through!"
"Thank you operator!"

VERSE 1:

Hi darlin'! How are you doing?
Hey baby, where're your sleeping?
Oh I'm sorry, but I've been really missing you!

Hi darlin'! How's the weather?
Say baby, is that cold better now?
Oh I'm sorry, is there someone there with you?

BRIDGE:

Ooooh... since you went away, there's nothing goin' right!
I just can't sleep alone at night... I'm not ashamed to say
I badly need a friend... or it's the end.
