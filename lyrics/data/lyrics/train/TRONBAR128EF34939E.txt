Nothin' and nobody
Baby, could ever take or stop
The love that I have for you
It's very simple, you see it's
Baby, it's real
It's so, so real
What I feel

I'll do for you anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it don't mean a thing
For you I'll do anything you want me to
You're my world, my hopes and dreams
Without you, girl, it don't mean a thing

I never thought that I would be knowin'
The kind of love that you have been showin'
The way you do the beautiful things you do
You really know how to make me love you

Uh, ah, can't you see I want it
