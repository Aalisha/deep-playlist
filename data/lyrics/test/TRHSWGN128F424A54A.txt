Take us, Take us to your planet
We've got enough we can't stand it
give us a sound and we'll can it,
Can it can it can it
We've taken all we can manage
Just say the word and we'll ban it
Make us a deal and we'll land it and we'll brand it

We are the Pipettes
And we've got no regrets
If you haven't noticed yet
We're the prettiest girls you've ever met
We are the Pipettes
We will drop you in our nets
When you're crying in your bed
You'll hope we haven't finished with you yet
