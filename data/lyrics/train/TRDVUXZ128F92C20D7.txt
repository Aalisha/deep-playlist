Girl,
You wanted,
To shut it all off and make a run for the door.

It's so hard,
To make it,
For every inch we get we need a mile more.

But there is always so much distance can't but feel it somehow,
But you have never ever felt it like you feel it right now.
I'm closing up inside and I was only just started,
And you can't be close enough unless I'm feeling your heart beat.

All of your love,
Was all that I needed.
All of your love,
Was all that I needed.

Girl,
