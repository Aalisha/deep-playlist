No better word than from Your lips
No perfect life than what You lived
No greater gift, no, not one

No brighter star has ever shined
No better hope for all man kind
No higher mind, no, not one

No one has ever known
This kind of love Youâ€™ve shown

There has never been a greater love
Than Your Son, no, not one
And there will never be a greater love
No, not one

With His life You have forgiven us
Hope has come, hope has come
And there will never be a greater love
...
