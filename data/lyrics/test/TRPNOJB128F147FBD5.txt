You got the world boy

This all you make it?
You had the choice lad
You wouldn't take it
The oldest charm

Only the best for you

And the years of my life,
Some they were so good,
But now and again I feel
I was a coward
Are the holes in my soul
In tatters for all these tears
Well you don't see it that way

A way, a way

We'lll have it today

The dancing ones they really mean it

But something boy,
something's gonna change

A way, a way
