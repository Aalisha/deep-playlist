How I wake in the morning, how I won't see the space, the gaping hole here in my bed
How I make my cup of coffee, how I walk to the subway and not miss you hold my hand
God only knows

I fall in, I freak out, too deep, I cannot climb out
You told me you loved me, I thought that meant you love me
My stupid heart breaks, when will I ever learn to let go?
God only knows, God only knows

How I wander the sidewalks, I won't make it to work on time now that you're gone
