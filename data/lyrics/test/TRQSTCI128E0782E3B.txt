You look worn out, more and more each day
With every step, and every page
You look worn out, more and more each day
With every step, and every page

Your croft, dated back to the beginning of the century
It's the beginning of the century
Inside your croft, dated back to the beginning of the century
It's the beginning of the century

What are you looking for? You'll never get close
You definitely don't know, you're not original
