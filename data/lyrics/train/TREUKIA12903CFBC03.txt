I've got a number on a napkin
A pounding in my head
It takes everything I've got
To crawl out of bed

I lost a hell of a woman
Freedom coked me on the chin
But I'm doing alright
For the shape I'm in

The sun came up again this morning
I got a call from a long lost friend
Planed this little road trip down in New Orleans
It ain't much but it beats where I've been

Yeah, I'm doing alright
