You got a thing about you
I just can't live without you
I really want you, Elenore, near me Your looks intoxicate me
Even though your folks hate me
There's no one like you, Elenore, really
Elenore, gee I think you're swell
And you really do me well
You're my pride and joy, et cetera
Elenore, can I take the time
