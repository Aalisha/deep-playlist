I can't have you blues
I got the I can't have you, I can't have you blues
I can't have you, I can't have you blues
I can't have you, I can't have you...
Nothings the same, need my fix of you
A crack in the mirror, pictures split in two
I can't believe you slipped away
I been drinking too much cause I'm trying to forget your face
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to
...
