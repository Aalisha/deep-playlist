Winter is approaching
There's snow upon the ground
It's good of you to visit me
I'm glad you came around
I don't know how you found me
I didn't let you know
I only moved to this address
About a week ago
I guess you think I ran out
But that's not true
Other people settle down
I never do
I always have to move on
Just have to go
I've often wondered why that is
I'd like to say but I just don't know
...
