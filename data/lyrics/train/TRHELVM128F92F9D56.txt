Lets go!

If this is perfect,
Well then lets end "this" before it starts
We are not pictures, no
This couldn't last forever
And over time
All the colors fade away
We cut and paste the words
We cannot dare to say

I've got this new game
Where I walk to your house
And when my legs give
Then I'll drag myself down
To these state lines
'Cause we're so far now
This isn't desperate
This isn't desperate for me

So tonight, yeah
I'm miles away from your town
But I'll grow wings and I'll fly down
'Cause it's me and my face versus this wind
...
