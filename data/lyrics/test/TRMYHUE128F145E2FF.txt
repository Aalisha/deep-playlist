Gather round the village square
Come good people both wretched
and fair
See the troubadour play on the drum
Hear my songs on the lute that I strum.
I will make you laugh,
Revel, Merry-dance
Throw your pennies, then you'll hear
more of
the story-telling half
There's no other chance,
Always move on
Raconteur, troubadour
...
