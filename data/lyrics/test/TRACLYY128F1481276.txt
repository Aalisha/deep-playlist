Look out! look out! your momma will shout
you might as well go home
she said my bed get's into your hair
so give me back my comb
but you
you make things that get along
turn out so wrong
doo ron, doo ron
you'd beter rock on
the band might play our song

See my baby jive
see my baby jive
she hangs onto me and she really goes
wo - oh (wo - oh) wo - oh
see my baby jive
such a lazy jive
well every one you meet coming down the street
just to see my baby jive
That tenor horn is turning me on
he's dropped down to his knees
