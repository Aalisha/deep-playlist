Don't want you to see me like this, don't want you to know how it really is,
I put on this smile 'til you go away, and hope that my eyes don't give me away,
And I can pretend that everything is alright; I've gotten really good, I've done it all of my life,
I keep you at a distance so you can't tell I'm not doing very well.

If you find out who I really am...
If I show you what I keep in the dark...
Stripped of my defences, can your love really clothe my naked heart?
...
