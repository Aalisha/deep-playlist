You got me runnin goin out of my mind,
You got me thinkin that Im wastin my time.
Don't bring me down, no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends.
Im tellin you it's go to be the end,
Don't bring me down, no no no no no no no no,
I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down.

Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down.
