I guess I'm just a little bit scared
I guess I'm not as strong as I thought
When I see you lying there I worry about losing you
I used to think of only me but that was long ago
Now I find it hard to conceive life without you

Baby I don't want to be the one to face this life
All alone at the end of the day
When the sun goes down I want you right here in my arms forever

Every little smile, every move you make
It's like a dagger to my heart, took my breath away
Now all I ask is that you be mine forever, forever
