Ooooh Baby

Got the sun in the morning
I got the moon at night
I got your arms around me, everything's alright
Holdin you tight is how I'd like to spend all
the rest of my life

Feel the warm breeze blowing
Down through the trees, I
I've got your love beside me child, that's all I need
My heart and soul is wide open to you
Nobody but you sweet baby
No one but you

Chorus

Got to know that I want you baby
Got to know that I need you darling
