Hit the road, Jack 
And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more 
Hit the road, Jack 
And don't you come back no more 
(What you say?) 
Hit the road, Jack 
And don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more 
Hit the road, Jack 
And don't you come back no more 
(What you say?) 

Woah, Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean 
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen 
...
