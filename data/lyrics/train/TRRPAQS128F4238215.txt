(Written by Rick Bowles, Terri Clark & Chris Waters)

I've been looking at you looking me
Bet you're thinking that what you get
Is what you see
But underneath this cool exterior
A raging river flows
So before you get any nearer
I better let you know.

Chorus:
I'm an emotional girl
I can't help myself
Sometimes I laugh
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I do both and I don't know why
I got a Passionate heart
And that's just the way things are
You and me could give it a whirl
But I'm warning you, boy
...
