It ain't no jive
I was burnin' alive
Whenever you walked in the room
It happened so quickly
I was feelin' so sickly
Like a lover who lost his muse

The sharks in the tank
The man in the bank
He wants my money to loan
I can't understand
What the hell is his plan
I ain't even got a home
Ain't got a home
...
