I'm a little boy blue I'm the man on the moon
I'm a bit freaked out and a hair out of tune
And they tell me that I might just lose it soon

I'm a guy with a little and ten's not enough
But after 19 you're hooked on a stuff
You float away just like a big balloon

And sometimes nothing's colder than the sun
On a bad day
Sometimes nothing warms you
Like the rain yeah

I'm a wheel, wheels turn
Rolling over anything in front of me
Like a wheel, wheels burn
Burning like the soul that's inside of me
I'm a wheel, wheels turn and take me away

I've been up I've been down, I've been in I've been out
A confident smile and a heart full of doubt
I'm working till I'm oh so tired out
...
