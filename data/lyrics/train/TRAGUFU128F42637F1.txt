Pack the truck under the moon
Jesus Christ, my lips are red
You ask a lot of the moon
When you ask me to forget
I never asked you to pay my rent
Jesus Christ, my lips are red
God, you turn me on my head
You're gonna haul me back again

I heard cowbirds call us home
I heard cowbirds call us home

Fry your ground, take it
Lie around naked
I think God dripped you out of a sunbeam
Only God dragged you out a tree with me
I pulled you out of a snow bank
