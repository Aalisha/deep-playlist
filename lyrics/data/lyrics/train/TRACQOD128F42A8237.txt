I'm sorry I can't bleed for you
The way you want me to
To throw myself against the rocks
The way I used to do

I'm sorry that I can't prolong
The pain I've been put through
I'm sorry, yes I'm sorry
So sorry
But not as sorry as you

You wear your misery like a crown
You're only happy when you're down
And the saddest part is you don't even know why
What are you lacking deep inside?
Depression as a point of pride
If you're not careful the world is going to pass you by
