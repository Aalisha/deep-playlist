My shine is white I ride the light
I let my wings decide where I go
I fly around and see the town and
watch the people go with the flow

I single out just one by one
And follow them an hour or so
But when I saw you baby
I just knew I couldn't let you go

Cos this is the time
This is the place
I'm just an angel
But you'll never stay
So I lie alone
Scared to the bone
So cold and I'm far away from home
Cos this is the time
This is the place
