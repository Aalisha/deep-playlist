From monsters to melancholy
From death to dying
From days mixed with error
From a mind that is sliding
Eskimos and butterflies
With all that's berating
The lesson must be learned
The trap's already baited

Move from stage to stage
Trying not to think about the change
Because it hurts
Scared of unknown roads,
I see that you're not interested yet
...
