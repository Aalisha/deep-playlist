Whoahhh yeah.
Oh.yeah.

Money in my pocket, but I just can't get no love.
Money in my pocket, but I just can't get no love.
I'm praying for,
A girl to be my own.

Soon you said she coming but I don't believe a word she say,
'Cause she run away and left me, one rainy day,
She made me had in mind,
That her love would never die,
And now I'm alone, yeah, so alone,
So alone, yeah, yeah.
Oh yeah!
