Well, if you ever go back into Wooley Swamp
Well, you better not go at night
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That make a strong man die from fright
Things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay
Gets up and he walks around

But I couldn't believe it
I just had to find out for myself
And I couldn't conceive it
'Cause I never would have listened to nobody else
And I couldn't believe it
I just had to find out for myself
There's some things in this world
You just can't explain

The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp
Way back in Booger Woods
He never did do a lot of harm in the world
But he never did do no good
People didn't think too much of him
They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway
All he cared about was his money

He'd stuff it all down in mason jars
And he'd bury it all around
And on certain nights if the moon was right
He'd dig it up out of the ground
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack
And run his fingers through it
Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man
