Well she keeps her secrets locked inside her armour (armour)
Well she doesn't let anybody know who she really is, or wants to be
She cries at night when she's all alone
She sits there waiting by the phone

Cos she's fragile, she denies it
She doesn't know she's so beautiful inside
She's fragile, she hides it
Behind that smile and all that style you know that deep inside
She's fragile...

She acts as if she's got it figured out now (out now)
