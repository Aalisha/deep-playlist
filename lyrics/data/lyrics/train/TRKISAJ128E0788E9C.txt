So add some more juice to your fruit
Yeah baby it's no news you're so cute and I'm falling
I'm falling for you
I know your jaws are just like steel
A kind of Janet Jackson feel
You shouldn't swallow
But you do!
Oh, it's carzy - it's just like you

So what's that, what's that on your tongue?
Don't you know it's only, only bubblegum

You got a problem with multi-tasking
Are you dancing, coz I'm asking
No error in syntax
