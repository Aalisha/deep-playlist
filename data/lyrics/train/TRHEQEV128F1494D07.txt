She take my money when I'm in need
Yea she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digga way over town
That dig's on me.

(Chorus:)
She gives me money
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
When I'm Need
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggas
She gives me money
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
When I'm need
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggas
I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head get down
I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head get down
I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head get down
I gotta leave
Get down girl gone head

(Verse 1:)
Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
