I lost at love before
Got mad and closed the door
But you said child just once more

I chose you for the one
Now we're havin' so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you
Came into my life

The others were untrue
But when it came to lovin' you
I'd spend my whole life with you
