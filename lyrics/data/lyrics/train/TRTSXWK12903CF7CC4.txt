Caught in a mirror
Looking through sympathetic eyes
I'll come to the conclusion
That believers are sinners in disguise
And I was blind

And if you ask me
I'll keep saying that I am fine
So just don't ask
And when you see me I'll keep
Flashing that winning smile
Cause that's my mask

Now I don't know what to believe
This girl made of steel with
her heart on her sleeve
Looking for someone
to love and leave me
