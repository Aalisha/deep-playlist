Y'all coward niggaz make a nigga like me laugh,
what the fuck? yea, yea. chargin y'all niggaz
yea, yea. behold the only thing greater than yourself

(1)
I'll slash ya grill, don't start me
You'll be the only entertainer with less groupies than Biz Markie
I'm never dull, Chino the pretty thug, style centerfold,
I'll have every latin in the country aimin at ya skull
I'll aim it at the Pope if he claimin he sellin the most dope
My Jersey blocks is locked tighter than prisoners hold soap
And listeners where we vote out ya CD and vinyl, the final result
Yell, fuck tricks and smoke, till our vocals combine with a Colt
They playin this in every club, whip, party and bar you in
Give you more blood clots than two jamaicans arguin
Sweat till ya fake silver platinum chains is tarnishin
Women shakin they ovaries, look what we accomplishin, what.

We got better lyrics than you got "What You Got?"
We got better bitches than you got "What You Got?"
We run with more killas than you got "What You Got?"
We got better whips than you got "What You Got?"
We got better cribs than you got "What You Got?"
We got better bitches than you got "What You Got?"
We run with more killas than you got "What You Got?"
