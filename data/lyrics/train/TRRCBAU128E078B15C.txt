Yes! Irie man!

Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on yeah
Na na na na life goes on
Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on yeah

And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on yeah
Na na na na life goes on
Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on yeah
Na na na na life goes on

And buys a 20 carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly standing at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing, yes
