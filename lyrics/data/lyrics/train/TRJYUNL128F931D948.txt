All my love, I give you all my love
The skies may fall, my love
But I will still be true
All my sighs, will disappear at last
Now that you're here at last
My heart belongs to you

Ohhhhhhhhh ooh, never let me go
You thrill me so
I can see as I recall my life
I've waited all my life
To give you all my love

Ay, ay, ay
Ay, ay, ay
