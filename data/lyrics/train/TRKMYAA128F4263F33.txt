To watch the leaves grow on the trees with you
Is out of question
I walk into this summer all alone
The usual session
You feel your instinct then you act
But was it your intention
To leave me down and broken
Now you've ended our ascension

I still can feel the beach sand in my shoes
Remember when?
We talked along the ocean's song
'Til blue from black fade in
But that was then
I learned to live
Without you far within
I ask you why you're back to try
To let me lose again

You brought me here
You whet my taste
You disappear
Without a trace
It wasn't me who made the call

'Cause now I wanna be
Where you sleep
Where you laugh
Where you breathe
And I hate to say
