Strapped to a chair, forced to consume & mindlessly absorb
Wide-screen and digitized lies surround our every sense
Dislocating our desires and your beliefs
Tearing away the psyche
Is this what you really need?
The white noise is the only pearl in this bay of shit and swine
The white noise is the only pearl on this TV
The white noise is the only pearl in this bay of shit and swine
The white noise
Surrogacy for what you'll never achieve
Mission's objective
