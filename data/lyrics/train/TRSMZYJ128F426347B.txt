Tried to write you a love song
In the middle of the night
Everything rhymed, but it didn't feel quite right
Anyway, that's all we need
Is another modern day Shakespeare
All I know is I get chills
Whenever you're standing near

CHORUS 1:
You're so cool
Cool as ice cream in the summertime
Cool as James Dean with a twist of line
You're so fine and I dig you hard
Lovesick dreaming in the backyard
They wouldn't print it in a Hallmark card
It's so high school, yeah, you're so cool
