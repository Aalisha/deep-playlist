Every honeybee
Sighs with jealousy
When they see you out with me
I won't blame them, goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose

When we're passing by
Flowers droop and sigh
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter, goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose

I don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweet when you stir it up
