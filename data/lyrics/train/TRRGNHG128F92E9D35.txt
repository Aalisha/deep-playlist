There was a boy in Arkansas
who wouldn't listen to his ma
when she told hi-im he should go to school.
He'd sneak away in the afternoon,
take a little walk then pretty soon,
you'd find him at the local auction barn.

He'd stand and listen carefully.
Then pretty soon he began to see
how the auctioneer could talk so rapidly.
He said, "Oh my, it's do or die.
I've got to learn that auction cry.
Gotta make my mark and be an auctioneer."

25 dollar bid it now, 30 dollar 30
Will you gimmie 30 make it 30
Bid it on a 30 dollar will you gimmie 30.
Who'll bid a 30 dollar bid?
30 dollar bid it now, 35, will you gimmie 35
to make it 35 to bid at 35.
Who would a-bid it at a 35 dollar bid?
