(Hello)
If you're feeling sad and lonely
There's no service I can render
(How did you get my number?)
Tell the one who loves you only
I can be so warm and tender
Call me
Don't be afraid, you can call me
Maybe it's late, but just call me
(What's the best time?)
Tell me and I'll be around
When it seems your friends desert you
There's someone who's thinking of you
(You?)
I'm the one who'll never hurt you
Maybe that's because I love you
...
