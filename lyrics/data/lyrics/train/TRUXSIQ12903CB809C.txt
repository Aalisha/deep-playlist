I could talk until my face turns blue
Goin' on bout what I wanna do with you
I'm just so tired of being alone, yeah baby
So what you say we just get out of here?
Just hop into my car and disappear
I know, you know what's going on
What's going on?
Yeah

I can't help the way I feel about you now
When everything inside of me is singing out
Yeah yeah yeah
