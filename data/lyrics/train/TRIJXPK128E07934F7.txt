He was born in the belly of the country
Over east of Eden, yeah
Confused by the big city blues
He didn't know whose life he's leading, no
Put yourself behind the wheel
And see if you can get that feel
Move faster by night
Move faster by night
The windows were all shattered
And the body was all battered

American Roulette
Stake your life upon it
American Roulette
Same eyes, same eyes
American Roulette

Take that boy and put him in a mansion
Paint the windows black
Give him all the women that he wants
Put a monkey on his back
