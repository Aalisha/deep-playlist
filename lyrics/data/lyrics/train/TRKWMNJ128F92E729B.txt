Stop dreaming 'bout what thus should feel
We'll never reach it, girl, never say you're sorry
For all the things that never happened
But it will eat while you try to sleep
How clearly I can see
Something so close can be so hard to reach

Yeah I know that they're all just fantasties
Now she's in me
She always will be
I know it's a part of this stupid game that we play
Well I couldn't care less today
Not while we're dancing and you're kissing me this way

Oh Come on, Eileen
What else could we do now?
