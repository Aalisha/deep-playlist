All over the world high school girls
Take to the ropes and turn them slow
Starts a beat and the loop
They skip and jump through the hoop

They might break and they might fall
But the gals in New York City don't
They just start again, start again
Hey, ebo, ebonettes

Hey, ebo, ebo, ebonettes
Hey, ebo, ebo, ebonettes
Hey, ebo, ebo ebonettes
Hey, ebo, ebo ebonettes

The golden angels, the ford green angels
The five town diamond skippers, the pleasure of rope rippers
Those dark and lovely skippers, those five town diamond skippers
Skip they do's the double dutch, that's them dancing

Skip they do's the double dutch, that's them dancing
Skip they do's the double dutch, that's them dancing
Skip they do's the double dutch, that's them dancing
