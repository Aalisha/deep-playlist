Blame it on the Tetons yeah I need a scapegoat now
No my dog won't bite you though it had the right to
You oughta give her credit
Cause she knows I would've let it happen

Blame it on the weekends God I need a Cola now
Oh we mumble loudly, wear our shame so proudly
Wore our blank expressions tryin' to look interestin'
...
