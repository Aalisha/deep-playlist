Two men sit and talk their life stories they're
Grown men sitting under beds weeping like
Children one that can't even believe a word anybody tells them

That man
Turns to his friend in desperation
Explain what you see right from your window pane
Alright says his friend at fifteen years strong
Cause he knows that man will never walk again

I see blue birds you know what they are right
Well they flying outside
I see sunshine from afar
Hiding the rain that's in your heart
I see love in the mothers eyes
Children playing outside
Sister
It wont be long

It wont be long my friend, 
My friend, my friend 2x
