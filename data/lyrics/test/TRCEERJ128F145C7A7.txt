shes thinking about
the prince and cinderella
the outlaws the hustlers and the heroes
that never seem to fall
it doesnt matter, it doesnt matter what the outcome of the story is
cause in real life, i try to tell her, its not like that at all

o wont you please, just hold out now
cause theres some thing id like u to forget
when ur world is
sinkin like a sunset

tales of don juan, theyre very poetic babe
but out on the streets out there, the true verse of life is written
you know its really a shame when u got to let go of all the things u love
like a fighter, he really bleeds when he must
