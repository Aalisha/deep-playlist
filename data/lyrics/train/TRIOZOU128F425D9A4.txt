Now I know how Merle Haggard felt
When he sang the words mama tried
And I've lived those teenage Friday nights
The pyramid of cans in the pale moon light

And that summer Becky broke my heart
Alabama sang old flame burnin'
Well, I've measured George Strait, drank with George Jones
My life's been a country song

It's all about fallin' down and gettin' back up
Your good times and hard luck
True love and amazing grace
Workin' all week for a backache

Raisin' Caine, Friday nights
Sunday church to set it right
They can write it on my stone
