[Vinnie Vincent]

We go it alone on the edge of night
There's no reward, no ending the sight
Sweet destiny, she's waiting for me
I'll find her walking down my street of dreams

Her name is no mercy
She's the calm before the storm
Fighters have but only one tool
We live by one golden rule
We're gonna lay down our lives and survive
And hear our battle cry
...
