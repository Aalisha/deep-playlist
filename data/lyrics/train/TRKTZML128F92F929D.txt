You can call me Holiday 
Oh yeah 
You can call me Holiday 
Yeah yeah 

They will hear us through these walls (they will hear us through these walls) 
If we make any kind of noise (If we make any kind of noise) 
And I got plans to make you scream (I got plans to make you scream) 
Til you get close to loosin your voice (loosin your voice ) 
So don't you hide up in them sheets (so don't you hide up in them sheets) 
I'm already not supposed to be here (no nooooo) 
So don't you worry 'bout gettin in trouble (trouble) 
Cause girl I got an idea 

Turn up the radio (turnp the radioooo oooaaah) so you'll can yell as lound as you want 
Turn up the Tv (oooohh) I don't want nobody to hear me 
Hear me while I'm makin you moan 

When you Make That Sound girl (when you Make That Sound) 
When you Make That Sound girl Will you make that 
Yell as lound as you want (you can yell as lound as you want) 
When you Make That Sound girl (oooohh)
