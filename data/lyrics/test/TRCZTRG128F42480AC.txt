If I could take it all and change it
Take the past and rearrange it I would, baby, yes I would
If I could figure out the reason
Go back in time and change the season I would, baby, yes I would

And I'd be the man that you can't live with out
I'd rewrite the parts and turn you back around

Well, I would do anything to bring you back
But it's all over and you're gone and I just can't do that
I'd make you laugh, I'd learn to cry, learn to dance
Just for one more chance
