So many people, so many backgrounds
So many different experiences, managed to come together
With a common cause and think as if they were one person

When you get to look at what the young people of the earth are doing now

You're obsolete, you're already history, no more of you need come through

Guilty of violence, guilty of violence
Guilty of violence against the earth

All that is left, is left is a single question at which tree do we stop?
