I'm alive but dead, awake but asleep...
As friends gather round and mourners they weep...
My mind thinks of all the things I have done...
My body is cold but my heart beat goes on...
And on ... and on


As they lower me down into that hole in the ground
I scream out for help but they hear not a sound
I tear at the lid, my fingers they bleed
...
