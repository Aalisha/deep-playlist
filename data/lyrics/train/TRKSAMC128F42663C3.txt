Yeah, loving
Over and over again now
It ain't nothing girl
Till you've felt the pain

Up against the wall
Why does love always have to hurt?
Your scratches run across my back
And then a tear

Dear lover
I can't take the pain no more
Dear lover
I pick my heart up from the floor

Dear lover
I can't believe it's come to this
Dear lover
