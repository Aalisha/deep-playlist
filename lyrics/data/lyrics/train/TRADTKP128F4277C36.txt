My pain is as deep as my roots
The yearning, the hurting
What am I to do?
Indeed I plant seeds for the path I walk
And my voice helps them grow like water
When I talk but I'm hurting y'all
You didn't die in vain, your thought
With me remains and your soul gives me
Strength to face another day
Without you

In this tree of pain
(Ohhh)
In this tree of pain
In this tree of pain
(In this tree of pain)

In this tree of pain
In this tree of pain
In this tree of pain
Till the day I see you again

Again
Under this tree of pain
Where we carve our names
Forever to remain

This pain
No one can understand
You know we can't pretend
That everything's okay

Bleeding
Screaming
Bleeding
Screaming
