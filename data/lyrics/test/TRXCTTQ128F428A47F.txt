Try, still you got nowhere, try and stay in line
And live by all the rules they say to follow
Try to conform in my head
They'll feed you bullshit you should swallow
Try their style don't give up, you will blend in

It's not tough to give up
When you've tried to try for so long
Can't wait to assimilate
Just try to stop me, try to stop me
You will try but I don't know
Pick yourself up by those boot straps dude and try
