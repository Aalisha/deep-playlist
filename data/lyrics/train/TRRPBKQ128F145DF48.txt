I don't ever wanna wake up
I don't ever wanna shut my eyes again
She's like a fantasy I've made up
But she's real, she's the best I'll ever get
I just need to stay beside her
She just wants to save my soul, my soul

She's the leader of her own world order
She's a legend in my own mind
She's the goddess of her own religion
My Madonna
And I can't believe she's mine

When we talk it's like communion
When we walk it's like we're walking on air
