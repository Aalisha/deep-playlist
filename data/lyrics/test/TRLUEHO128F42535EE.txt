There are stories told nobody wants to believe it
There are reports with facts that it must be true
Something flew out from the clouds
And it smoked and smoked and sparked in silver blue
A few humans disappeared
Chaos reigns and there is fear

There is hate
In the eye of an eagle
There is lust
In the eye of an eagle
(Ohh)

Lightning struck on the wings of chrome
...
