Somewhere on the other side
There will be an answer to the hurting inside
Somewhere on the other side
Somehow I believe
That if we stand and pray and press on faithfully
On that day we will know
On the other side

We can never turn
Turn back the hands of time
God only knows I've tried
To hold back the tide
Of tears from my eyes
'Cause with these eyes
I've seen my world change
