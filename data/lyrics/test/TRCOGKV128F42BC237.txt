Come and get it
Did ya hear that cow bell?
Cock-a, cock-a, cock-a-doodle-doo
Come and get some grub

Baby, it's a hoedown, we can get low down round here
Take it to the floor now, we can get a throw down round here
Cowgirls, cowboys make noise round here
This is honky tonk baby, gonna get crazy round here

It's what us farm girls like to do
Sippin' on cold lemonade, eatin' up all our favorite food
Y'all grab a partner and just say, "Howdy do?"
Let me show you somethin' new

All these farm boys, ya wanna see somethin' slick
Girls, turn your hips like a joy stick
Gotta do the round house but don't move it too quick
You wanna impress a hick then make it go tick tick tick tick tick

Baby, it's a hoedown, we can get low down round here
Take it to the floor now, we can get a throw down round here
Cowgirls, cowboys make noise round here
This is honky tonk baby, gonna get crazy round here

All these farm boys ya wanna see somethin' slick
Girls, turn your hips like a joy stick
