Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why,
If you don't know by now
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why,
It don't matter, anyhow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
But don't think twice, it's all right

An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light,
A light I never knowed
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light,
I'm on the dark side of the road
