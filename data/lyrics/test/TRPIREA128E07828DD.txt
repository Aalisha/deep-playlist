I will walk in the garden
And feel religion within
I will learn how to run with the big boys
I will learn how to sink and to swim
And there's talk in the houses
And people dancing in rings
Ah, when you close my eyes, babe?
I can see most everything
I can see most everything
It's just like u said it would be
It's Just like u said it would be
It's just like u said it would be
It's Just like u said it would be
I can see too many mouths open
Too many eyes closed, ears closed
Not enough minds open
