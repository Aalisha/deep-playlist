Ooh... ooh... ooh...
Oh... oh...
In the game of love
Sometimes we get left behind
When pushin? comes to shove
And happiness is so hard to find
A fall from love can break your spirit
Paint a rosy outlook blue
Darlin', you don't have to fear it
'Cause baby, I'm here for you
I'm on your side when times are hard
And you need some understanding
I'm on your side when times gets tough
And no one else can care enough
I'm on your side to be for you
You can say you're free
