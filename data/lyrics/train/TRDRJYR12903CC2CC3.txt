Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring ting ting-a-ling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "yoo hoo",
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
Let's go! Let's look at the show,
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap,
It's grand! Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairy land

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we
