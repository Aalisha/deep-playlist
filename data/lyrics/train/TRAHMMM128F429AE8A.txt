I heard the bells
I heard them ring
The morning mist is always colder
From the sea breeze screaming in
And we'll appreciate this haven
The comfort is so kind
But the air rips when a voice calls out my name

Every hour, every stare is burning deep inside of me
Pry my eyes to stay awake
Yes I know it
Don't wanna show it
The closest thing that comes to mind
...
