lets dance
stop to fight
we do the paradigm shift tonite
yeah, it's a natural drift alright
and it's coming up out of the blur
out of your mind from deep below
the hidden harmonies discover
chaos which means order
evolution's not a model of yours

for quietness is stronger than motion and silence is stronger than sound
we're listening to the tone which is not played
