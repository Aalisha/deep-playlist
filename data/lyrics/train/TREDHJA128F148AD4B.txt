Civilian warring among each other
Only to achieve their coffin
So I and I stay away in the big apple
And trod it with care though its full of maggots
Cost of living reach the sky
And no ones knows why
It's just revolution time
So Cool off
Cool off the Carbine a yard
Cool off cool off the Carbine a yard

Be attentive to my call of Jah
I remember days of long ago
These thinge used to poison my people
I am willing
