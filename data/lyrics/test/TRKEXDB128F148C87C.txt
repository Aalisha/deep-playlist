nothing is real when you're talkin'
i don't believe what i'm watchin'
shelter me 'til it's over
of what you want to believe, hey yeah

i'm afraid of what i see and
what i see is everything, yeah
mmm, shelter me with my own hands
and with my hands i will depend, yeah

oh, god i don't know what to say
everything is in my way
get up and deal with the pain
drowning your mind in the way
...
