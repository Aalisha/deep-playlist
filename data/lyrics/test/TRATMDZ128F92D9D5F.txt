There's a hole in the light
and you know there's one way
Won't you go in before they keel away
Day would forget the night
Night would forget the day
See if on your journey
Hope you can stay

Well its rocky and its rough
Its old and its new
Its bitter and its sweet
Its rough and its smooth
Walking through space, life has its own pace
Flying high, sometimes low
Lightning speed or sometimes slow

For seasons are caught in the night
The colour wrapped in the light
Do not be distracted
That religion must happen inside

For seasons are caught in the night
The colour wrapped in the light
Do not be distracted
That religion must happen inside

There's a hole in the light
and you know there's one way
Won't you go in before they keel away
...
