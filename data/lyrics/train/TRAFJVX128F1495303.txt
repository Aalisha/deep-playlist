Making a noise in this world
Making a noise in this world
You can bet your ass
I won't go quietly
Making a noise in this world

Everyone has a song
God gave us each a song
That's how we know who we are
Everyone has a song

We have come, heat the drum
The land trembles with dancing
We have come, bang the drum
The land trembles with dancing

Making a noise in this world
Making a noise in this world
You can bet your ass
I won't go quietly
