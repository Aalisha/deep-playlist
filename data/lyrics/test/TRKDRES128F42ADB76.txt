KnowhatI'msayin', take you on this lyrical high real quick
Nineteen ninety three exoticness
KnowhatI'msayin', let's get technical
Where's your bone at, get up on that shit aight
Yo

Started off on the island, A K Shaolin
Niggaz whylin', gun shots thrown the phone dialin'
Back in the days of eight now, makin' a tape now
Rae gotta get a plate now

Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
Till I got
Thrown one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since sixteen
Shootin' that
(That's that shit)
In his blood stream

That's the life of a crimey, real live crimey
If niggas know the half is behind me
Day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend, jettin' the Palmetto

In Medina, yo no doubt the God got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down south
So if you're filthy stacked up
Betta watch ya back and duck
'Cause these fiends they got it cracked up

Now my man from up north, now he got the law
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin', get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put 'em in a yolk
...
