That's my baby in the white boots... That's my baby on the floor
That's my baby havin' some fun... And yellin' more, more, more

That's my baby in the short skirt... Woo, out of control
Ah she becomes another woman... When she rocks and rolls

She's having a good time... Goin' round and round
She's really rippin' it up... You know she can't sit down, oh no

That's my baby lookin' so good... You know I can't explain
How when she's dancing in the white boots... It makes her go insane
