Bhang, bhang
Bhang, bhang
Bhang, bhang
The excuse of death keeps us a mess
They like us to believe
But really it just opens doors
I did not know could be
In your head
Are you dead?
In your head
Are you dead?
The excuse of death keeps us a mess
They like us to believe
But really it just opens doors
I never knew could be
In your head
Are you dead?
In your head
Are you dead?
Bhang, bhang
