HELP!

The air turns black
The birds drop from the sky
This eagle has landed
I'm choking on your pride

And the walls are closing in
And you don't appreciate
That in my hands tonight
Is where your fate lies
Her face drains...

Stand up, take a bow you have
No reason to celebrate
You're lost in the labyrinth
...
