I gave up coffee and cigarettes
I hate to say, it hasn’t helped me yet
I thought my problems would just dissipate
And all my pain would be in yesterday

I poured my booze all down the kitchen drain
And watched my bad habits get flushed away
I thought that, that would keep my head on straight
And all my pain would be in yesterday

But it’s true, I’m still blue
