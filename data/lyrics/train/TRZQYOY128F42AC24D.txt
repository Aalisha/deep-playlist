I gotta talk to y'all for a minute
Because, see
There's a whole lot of men tryna get at a sista
But I tell them, I say you know what, I have a man
They say to me but where's your man now,
Your man not there with you,
You need a man to be there with you at all times but
You know
No matter where my baby is
I love him
Til my baby comes home Ill still be here
Waiting on him



There's a whole lot of guys meshing around
tryin to get me
they do thing cause they know
my man away they try to upset me
they can't believe i resist
How can I hold out
where is my man now
but the truth really is
i dont worry cause i love my baby so
