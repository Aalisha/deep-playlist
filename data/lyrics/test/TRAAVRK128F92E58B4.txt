Bring it on, don't care if it is true or fake
It's my turn, searching for another break
Set me free, I only see the setting sun
Let me feel, like my luck has just begun
Wherever I go, it's all the same
We're so much alike, well, with a different name
Days going by, I'm gonna catch 'em again
I'm gonna lose this half-life, I'm on my way

Come on, we never know before we try
Come on, theres nothing we can't leave behind
Come on, we're past the time for questions, why?
Come on, yeah come on, what are we waiting for
Come on
