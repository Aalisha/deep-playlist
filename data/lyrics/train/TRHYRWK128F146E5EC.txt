In a little while
People and place's will
Be so far behind
Out of my body

In a little while
I will play aces
And raise my glass
In a note of defiance

But untill then
I scream untill I'm hollow
I carve it in my skin
Save it for tomorrow

I'm gonna bang my drums
I'm gonna make it come, yeah
I'm gonna bring it on, now
It's a heart attack
A heart attack,
I'm bringing it,
Bring it back,
I'm bringing it back
To me
