I wish you could see me
I'm flying, still don't know how
I owe you so much
I guess you knew that

I know that you would be proud of me
I hope you are
I owe you so much
I hope you knew that

There's so much of you in everything I do
Just wish that you were still around
But I'm following through, just could do so much more
If you were still around, were still around
