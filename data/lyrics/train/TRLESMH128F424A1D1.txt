Train to Zion this could be the very very last train to Zion

Who have eyes to see, let them see now
Who have ears to hear, let them hear now
So long ago I keep a tellin' dem a say, tellin' dem a say
Should never let the foolish one try to fool you no way,
Fool you no way
Teeth and tongue, they got to meet some sweet day
I wanna be among the number to share the sweet I say
Won't you hear when Jah call
