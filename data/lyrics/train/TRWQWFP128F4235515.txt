At first I did not think it could be you,
But you're the only one who got off the train.
Yes, you must be my wife--Miss Annie Halsey.
I guess I am your husband,
Hello, I'm Harry Crane.

Mail Order Annie
Never mind your cryin'.
Your tears are sweet rain
In my empty life.
Mail Order Annie
Can't you see I'm tryin'
To tell you that I'm glad you're here--
You are the woman, who's come to be my wife.

You know you're not as pretty
As I dreamed you'd be.
But then I'm not no handsome Fancy Dan.
But out here looks are really not important--no, no.
