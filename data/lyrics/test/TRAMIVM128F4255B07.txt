When I'm on the loose
It is you who's shining through and through again
Whenever the rain comes down, the sun turns gray
When I needed you, you were always there
When it comes to you, really nothing can compare

You feel what I feel, know what I know
Even through the darkest night
You'll see what I see
There's a reason to believe in you and me'

I would die if you left me
Drowning in sorrow
Baby don't kill me tonight
Would you hold on to me, girl?
