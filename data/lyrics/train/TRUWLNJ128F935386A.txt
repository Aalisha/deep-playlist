Sing till the power of the lord come down.
Shout hallajuah
praise his holy name
sing till the power of the lord come down
shout hallajuah
praise his holy name

Amazin grace how sweet the sound
that saved that wrench like me
i once was lost but now im found
was blind but now i see

jesus jesus how i love thee
shout halleluah
