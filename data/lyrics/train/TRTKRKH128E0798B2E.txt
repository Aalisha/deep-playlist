I'm exhausted, trying to catch my breath the morning' after
I hold my coffee with shaking hands and my world in disarray
Lost by the softness and the strength that's in her hands
I see her face and I can barely stand
But oh the sweet redemption every time she mentions that she wants me
Oh, that she needs me

Chorus:
Oh Maria your kisses knock me over
Make me drunk then leave me sober
They let me know that I'm a man
Maria, your touch it almost kills me
Then it turns around and heals me
I get lost and found again
