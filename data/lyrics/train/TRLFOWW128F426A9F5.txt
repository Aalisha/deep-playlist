Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Disease, disease

Spreading the disease

With some help from Captain Trips
Bringing the world down to his knees
Power, yes, power

He'll show them all his power
It pulses through his ice cold blood
A whole world to devour

He's seeing, he's calling

His legacy, he's spawning

He's coming, corrupting
Among the living
Murder, murder

Commit cold blooded murder

Like Nazis during World War II
They only follow orders
Hatred, hatred
