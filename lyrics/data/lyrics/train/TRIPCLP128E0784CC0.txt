What are you gonna do when I'm gone
Whose shoulder are you gonna cry on
What are you gonna do on the day
When I turn my head and just walk away

What are you gonna say to your friends
When the talk around town begins
Will you tell them how you treated me bad
Will you tell them how you made me so sad

'Cause you make some people
Think that you love me a lot
But they just don't know you
...
