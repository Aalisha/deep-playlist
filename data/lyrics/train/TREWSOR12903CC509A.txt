Nothing was supposed to hurt like this
Missing you was always one more kiss
Now there's nothing that I can do
One more nail in the coffin, and it's all for you

Always were and always were a simple love story
You were everything I ever hoped and dreamed
Drown me in a pool of my blood
It's getting harder just to breathe
I'll suffocate you faster just so you can't see, so you can't see me sleep
It's getting harder just to say the right things

I've seen the angel's face, and I've heard her sing to me
From my reflection on this razor blade
I've heard ten thousand dying screams, and they're calling me

The day will break on this saddest day
