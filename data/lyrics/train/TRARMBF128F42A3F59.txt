Into this world
Little boy brave
Charity heart
Faithfully plays
Heal the scars
Unto his eyes
Salvage the goodness
Of dreams never lived
Dreams never died
Again and again
Again and again
Haunted by the trust of a child
With no place to go now
Little boy brave
Wanders the streets
Faithfully plays
But his broken arrows
Once filled with pride
Aimed and missed
At the dreams never lived
Dreams never died
Again and again
Again and again
Haunted by the trust of a child
Never give in
Never give up
Little boy brave
Never lived
Never died
