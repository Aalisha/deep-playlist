(Oh yeah, Martin Solveig is the man you listen to.
Because when you're not listening to Martin Solveig
Let me tell you something, you are listening to nothing! Ah ah ho ho)

I see you brother, what's going on?
Did I do you wrong? Tell me what's going on.

I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man.

You don't know the way I feel, I'm on the bad side.
I do my best, I don't wanna fight, I do it with all my might.

I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man, I'm a good man.
