She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight
She likes the theater, and never comes late
She never bothers, with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

Doesn't like crap games, with barons or earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

She loves the free, fresh wind in her hair
