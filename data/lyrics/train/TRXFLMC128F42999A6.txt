It's no misunderstanding
When pain goes hand in hand
You always play the bad guy
She the sacrificial lamb
Feel as vulnerable as a woman
And she takes it like a man
Listen what he said she said
He said she said

Push and pull up and down
Back and forth on the merry go round
And on and on it goes till someone throws it away

You'll pay for your admission
...
