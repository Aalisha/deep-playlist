Feel me
Come on

Catch me on a back road or cookin' in your momma's house
In your daughter's guts or just spazzin' out
Me and Bubba know what the hell we talkin' 'bout
Pickin' up Betty's like they was beans and brussel sprouts

We got the clout to make you bounce a little
We got the clout to make you down this pickle until you gettin' tickled
C'mon Bubba, let's surround this biddle
While you work the back bit, Timb' work the middle

Uh oh, uh oh! I see ya see ya smile
Uh oh, uh oh! Down comes your blouse
Timb' been around 'em all
From white to black, even magnolia

To hit 'em in project halls
In back of the streets, maybe, right in front of y'all
Timb' and Bubba is a problem, y'all
It's like hip hop meets Effin Tim McGraw

We two fools and don't take no mess
Bitch lumber logs just to work the chest
He's country finest, I'm country best
Puttin' lights out train, just get in that dress, now c'mon

Twerk a little, twerk a little, let me see you drop it
Work the middle, work the middle, let me see you pop it
Go on witcha bad self, c'mon witcha bad self

Twerk a little, twerk a little, let me see you drop it
Work the middle, work the middle, let me see you pop it
Go on witcha bad self, c'mon witcha bad self
