Put your shoe on the other foot
You can walk just like me
Put your shoe on another foot
You can walk just like me

Walkin' an' a talkin'
See an' feel a just like me

Put your hand in another glove
You can feel just like me
Put your hand in another glove
You can feel a just like me

Walkin' an' a talkin'
See an' feel a just like me
