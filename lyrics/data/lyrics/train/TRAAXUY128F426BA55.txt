The first thing that I heard you say
When you were standing there
Said in your way was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me
'Cause there was nothing there that you could see

Now who's standing at the door
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I've set you free this time
