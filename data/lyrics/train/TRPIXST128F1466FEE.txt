I'm so tired of all this crap
That falls from you like rain
Do you think that I'm that naive
Or have you gone insane
You can fly 6000 miles
And think its no big deal
And turn and come back in
Anytime you feel
If there's something more need
I cried for you, I would've died for you
Tell it to someone who wants to hear
When the silence starts to haunt you

Just scream
let the voices out, lord
Just scream
Let the voices out

Someone calls me up
And says that you want out
