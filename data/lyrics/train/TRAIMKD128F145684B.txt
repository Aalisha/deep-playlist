Round and round I go
Where I stop
You will never know
Round and round I go
Where I stop
You will never know

I just don't understand
What is your master plan
What did you have me do
Confusion in my mind
Been hurt a thousand times
Now I know you're not true
(That's why I can't be with you)

You don't know what it meant to me
Just to make you happy
All this time I've waited
Now our love has faded
Please tell me why it's gone
So my life can go on

Round and round I go
Where I stop
You will never know
 (You will never know that I'm going round)
