Dem dread seh
Dem dread seh
Dem dread seh
Dem dread seh
No matter how you bad I man badder than you
No matter how you dread I man dreader than you
No matter how you hard I man harder than you
No matter how you raw
I more-weak heart back way so

A bad man no want go back Into captivity
A bad man no want go back to slavery
Uprising from the claws of the wicked

Two bulls can't reign in one pen
Two lions can't roar in a small den
Two scorpions don't sting at the same spot
Two guns can't fire the same bullet shot so

Move right out now
Move right out now
