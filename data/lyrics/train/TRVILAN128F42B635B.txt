I must have been through 'bout a million girls
I'd love 'em then I'd leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried no sir
Their tears left me cold... as a stone

But then I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love
I fooled around and fell in love...

Fooled around and fell in love

It used to be when I'd see a girl that I liked
I'd get out my book and write down her name...
But when the grass got a little greener on the other side...
I'd just tear out that page...
But when I fooled around and fell in love...
...
