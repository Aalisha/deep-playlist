The sunlight's making me feel paranoid
i look outside and see the world at war
the people walk to work like they're alone
i sit in silence staring at the phone
Chorus
And it helps me breathe, and it helps me see
I cover up my eyes to block the light
i cover up my eyes and try to fight, the fall
Chorus
And it helps, when i come down, and it helps
The sunlight's making me feel paranoid
i look outside and see the world at war
the people laugh and play like they're alone
they're watching us while we sleep in our homes
i never, i never meant to shut you out
all i know and all i need is you
i never, i never meant to cause alarm
all i know and all i need and all i got is gonna bleed
Chorus
It helps, when i come down, it helps, when i come down
It helps me breathe, when i come down
annie
the smell of the ocean on her skin
the rags of her dress blowing in the wind
a chorus of angels on the boardwalk
they know what you did in the dark
Chorus
I never meant to hurt you annie
leave you standing with the gun
