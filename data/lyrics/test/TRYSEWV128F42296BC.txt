It's time to wake up
It's time to change
Let's get it started
I feel like there's so much to rearrange
Come on, I need your help with this
Why don't we get it started with a kiss?

If memory serves
Then why am I still waiting for it to return?
My head feels like it's just about to slip
This morning is just a blur
Today lingers on like a bad year

I can feel it
I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

I can feel it
I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

I can feel it
I conceal it...
Beginning of the twist

I can feel it
I conceal it
I can feel it coming, the beginning of the twist

We get along well
...
