I got whiskey to keep me warm
When the sun goes down
And this godforsaken honky tonk ain't likely to run out
So won't you come on home and save me
Stop me before I drown
'Cause I'm no good, pretty mama
When you're not around

And there's women in this town
Whisperin' in my ear
Sayin' things a man in my condition likes to hear
So won't you come on home and stop me
...
