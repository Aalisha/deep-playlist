They say guns kill people, stupid motherfuckers with guns kill people
And I hang, with stupid motherfuckers
It start to clip, click-clack blucker-bluck
It start to clip, click-clack blucker-bluck

Fo' niggas in a slab, dressed in black clothes
Filling up the clip, smoke blowing out they nose
Niggas trying to play Zilla, they owe the kid do'
The playa already emotionally fell, for a stripper ho
Oldest trick in the book, but fuck it it still works
Niggas think with they other head, when it come to them skirts
Waiting for Strawberry, to ring the burner celly
Tell us when she ready, and we storming the telly
...
