Confidence is a must
Happiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges I like them rough

A man with a midas touch
Intoxicate me
I'm a lush
Stop you're making me blush
People are looking at us

I don't think you know, know
I'm checking you
So hot, so hot
Wonder if he knows
He's on my radar
(On my radar)

On my radar
(On my radar)
And if I notice you
I know it's you
Choosing
Don't wanna losing you

On my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)

When you walk
(When you walk)
And when you talk
(When you talk)
I get the tingle
I wanna mingle
That's what I want

(That's what I want)
And listen baby
Turn up the fader

Try to make you understand
You're on my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
(On my radar)
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar

Got you on my radar
Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
