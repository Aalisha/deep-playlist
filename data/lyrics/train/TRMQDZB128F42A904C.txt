Darren hayes / robert conley

Cyndi lauper jackson simon le bon I put eurythmics on poppin' and lockin' in
The u.s.a day glo sweater tied around my neck studded denim big hair acid wash
Rubik's cube my boom box

You know it's alright I promise you tonight all you gotta do is choose life got
A little crush I just can't get enough of that stuff it's such a rush 1980 me
Got a little crush I just can't get enough of that stuff it's such a rush 1980
Me
