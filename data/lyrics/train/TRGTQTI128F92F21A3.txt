Let's just run with this for awhile, 
I've been missing everything we had 'cause it seems that life just got in the way
And sometimes all I
Wanna do is just waste the days with you, so don't you? don't you? 

I've been telling you that I, 
Wanted everything too fast
And that I've forgotten how to live
And everyday seems like nothing's happening
But maybe it's just me.
