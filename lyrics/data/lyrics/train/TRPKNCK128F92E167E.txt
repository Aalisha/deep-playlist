Strain, living with a name
They get the best of me
But I'm no walker away
I don't complain, I got much to gain
So they keep testing me
And I keep feeding their face
But they could go
Off and hit the road
And what would I care
I like going nowhere
I got the reigns
And courage I was made of
And they've got fake love
So I know I must show

It's my show
I must go
With my soul
Not my hand
...
