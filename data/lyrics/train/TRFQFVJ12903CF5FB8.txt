"Seattle" by PIL (Happy, The Greatest Hits... So far)
Released Sept. 7, 1987
Written by Dias, Edmonds, Lydon, McGeoch, Smith
Prod. by Gary Langan and PIL

Don't like the look of this old town
What goes up must come down
Character is lost and found
On unfamiliar playing ground

Get out of my world
(What in the world)

Shoeboxed around the rifle range
Have all your functions rearranged
Your mind and body gagged and bound
On a new familiar playing ground
...
