Sally go 'round the roses
(Sally go 'round the roses)
Sally go 'round the roses
(Sally go 'round the pretty roses)
Hope this place can't hurt you
(Hope this place can't hurt you)
Roses they can't hurt you
(Roses they can't hurt you)
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Sally don't you go, don't you go downtown
Saddest thing in the whole wide world
Is see your baby with another girl?
Sally go round, oh sally, don't you go
Sally, don't you go, don't you go downtown
Oh, don't you go downtown
