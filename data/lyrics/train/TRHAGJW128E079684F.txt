What's become of the world
The colors unfurl
Revealing a blackened haze
Conditioned to fear
The voice that we hear
Calling the end of days
Millions of souls under control
Like pawns to a king
Led by a string
To the final hour

Oh, Empire of the Sea,
Lords of technology that fell into the void
Oh shall it be (oh shall it be) as it was before
Tragedy on every shore

Is this the end of all we know
Innocence lost so long ago
Woven in dreams
The darkest of schemes now takes hold of our destiny
Decades of greed, plague, famine and war
...
