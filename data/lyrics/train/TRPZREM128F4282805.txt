She was always something special
Diamond shining bright in the rain
Everybody dreams of angels
No one would ever know

How much I loved ya so
Now it all seems funny, kinda like a dream
Things ain't always what they seem
What a shame, what happened to Jayne
You were always on my mind

Shine like a summer days in the sun
