Love Don't Love Me
Time
I still don't know the reason that for all this time
I'm all alone but see it comes as no surprise
it seems like I go left each time that love goes right
every time

By chance, something happens every time I get a chance
I feel the rhythm but I just don't know the dance
I want to move with you but something holds me back
I'm holding back, yeah

All I ever needed I could never find
all I ever wanted was to get it right
Somebody tell me what is wrong with me
I wasn't sure but I know now I believe
That it must be, love don't love me, love don't love me
