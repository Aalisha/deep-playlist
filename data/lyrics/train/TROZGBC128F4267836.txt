I want you between me and the feeling I get when I miss you
But everything here is telling me I should be fine
So why is it so above as below
That I'm missing you every time

We followed the sun and its colors and left this world
It seems to me that I'm definitely
Hearing the best that I've heard

So throw me a rope
To hold me in place
