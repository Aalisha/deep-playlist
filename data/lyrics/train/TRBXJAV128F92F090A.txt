Thank you my friend
I sincerely appreciate the words you say
About how she'll cry
And how she'll grieve and miss me
When she goes away

Say them again
I need to hear the words once more
I can't believe
How she'll miss me when she's gone
And how she'll want to come back home
And never leave

But she's leaving me
Because she really wants to
