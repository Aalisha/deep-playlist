Should we just be friends, should we draw a line
Should we siege the times, take this thing further?
Or should we just pretend that love ain't closing in
Like I don't recognize, like you don't realize?

We're drawn to one another
Friends or lovers, it's time we choose
So fuck what your girls say and what my boys say
Don't even matter, all that matters now

Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be your position,
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life
Now that we've come this far
I need to know what's going to be my position
Baby, listen, tell me where I need to stand in your life

To watch you fly away like doves do
And crush me, I need you
This air I breathe, like the tree's and leaves
...
