Ice Cream:
Destroy, destroy

There's an evil lady, and I can feel her power
Won't you be my baby
She walked up to me, and shouting, she says

The devil in me is so lonely
I wanna destroy everything that you love
The devil in me is so lonely
I wanna destroy everything that you love

Devil started humming and dancing near ya
Whistle and howl everything that he does
This baby's guna shimmy, shimmy dig dig
On the tv set, I think ill fall in love

Please, please, please, can we get an ice cream
Please, please, please, won't you let me be
Feel me please like a three minute wonder
If you wake me up, and I can go to sleep
...
