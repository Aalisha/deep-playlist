Verse
I remember Saturdays helping mama in the kitchen/ Conversations frying baking and passing down her wisdom/ She said baby girl you're a queen and this is how you should be treated/ Words she washed with tears and planted in my soul 

Chorus
Can we just go back to the simple kind of livin'/ Can we go back and maybe start from the beginnin'/ Back to better days when love was for the givin'/ Can we just go back to the way we were
