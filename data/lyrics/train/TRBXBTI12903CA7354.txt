(Verse 1: Richie Rich)
I learned first
A bitch gon' move like she wanna
Through the grass, to camaflauge the ass
Her main goal, the cats at the top of the pole
She's 17
Already on the 18th hole
That's how it goes
Niggas better check these hoes
Bust moves to improve
Try to stay on ya toes
Cuz this bitch, she guppyin' up with every balla,
Don't hate me cuz the bitch ate me
I seen it happen
What's poppin, is hoopin' and rappin'
She call me papi,
Never bought this bitch versace
Dawn and Karen, that thing's in the black LeBaron,
Got her transportin'
Now she feel important
Little girl gone bad, she dancin' at the club
Mad den a mothafucka lookin' for love
She fuckin' everything
And a nigga can't control her
Hoopas, rappas, thugs, and high rollas

(Chorus)
If I fucked yo' bitch
Would a nigga trip?
Knowin' that she go around blowin' niggas' dicks
If I fucked yo' bitch
Would a nigga trip?
Knowin' that she go around blowin' niggas' dicks

(Verse 2: Richie Rich)
You know, like I know
Paid niggas live
The M ticket, make the hoes wanna kick it
All groupies
Big, tall, and small groupies
Niggas get paid
Believe they all groupies
She got a nigga
