Attention, this is a interruption
Stay tuned for a message from the Godson
Jam, whoa, jam, jam, jam, jam for me, Teddy
(Teddy's jam yo)
Jam it, jam Teddy, hey, ew oh, yeah

I can make you dance if you want me to
Let me see you cruisin' on the dance floor, baby
(Sound so good to me, yeah)
I can make you dance if you want me to
(Make 'em dance Teddy)
Can I see you movin' on the dance floor, baby?

Oh, I wanna see you dance
I wanna see you dance, baby
Oh, it's the way you move
It's the way you move, hey yeah

Let me see you move
(Touchdown)
Tonight is the night
(Touchdown)

Don't ever, ever stop girl
(Touchdown)
You sexy sexy thing girl
Baby, won't you shake your booty

Oh, I wanna see you dance
I wanna see you dance, baby
Oh, it's the way you move
It's the way you move, hey yeah

With your sexy, sexy moves
Sounds so funky
I like the way you light up
