You've got your ball
you've got your chain
tied to me tight tie me up again
who's got their claws
in you my friend
Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul
Sweet you rock
and sweet you roll
Lost for you I'm so lost for you
You come crash into me
And I come into you
I come into you

In a boys dream

In a boys dream

Touch your lips just so I know
In your eyes, love, it glows so
I'm bare boned and crazy for you

When you come crash
