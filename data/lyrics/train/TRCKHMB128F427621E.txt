The water's choppy, but it doesn't cut me no
Cause I ain't sinkin, no I ain't going down below
I don't think that way, you know I never have
I can't slow down now, just because you lag
You're always pulling, keep on trying to bring me down
I'm going to show you that I don't like to fuck around
You show your face, and I'll look the other way
You blink your eyes, and you've got no friends to play

Go!
Pick up the slack
No!
I can't carry your monkey on my back
Woah
Save the world
No way!
Got no time, I've got to save myself today
