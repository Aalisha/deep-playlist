The words you say: they break me
Conversation takes me to a new low
Can't cope - hide me, false hope - remind me

Say no more, for your words:
They cut me like knives
If there's virtue in silence, say no more
For you melt my heart like ice
With your verbal violence

Spiteful words echo inside me
...
