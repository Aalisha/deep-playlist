Heaven"

We can sing a song together
Just you and me
And we can dance all night long forever,
Like it's a fantasy oh baby,
Look, I don't know you r name
Don't know where you're from
But I wanna know
Are you willing to come with me
Cause I can get to know you
On the way to heaven
Girl if you decide to come with me
That's where we're goin
So all aboard, ready or not
Make up your mind
Tell me what you got
To lose baby choose
Cause wanna take you to heaven

When we get there you will be treated
Just like a queen
And I'll fulfill all of you desires
And your wildest dreams, ooh baby

Look, I don't know you r name
Don't know where you're from
But I wanna know
Are you willing to come with me
