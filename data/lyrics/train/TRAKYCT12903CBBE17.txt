It was the usual crowd growing up
All good, all bad, all ugly
They were like brothers â€˜cause we all felt the same
The future tore them away

The world will numb everything, hope and fear
A negative discipline, a vacuum

What evil force dragged them down?
What demon singled them out?
What evil took them away?
