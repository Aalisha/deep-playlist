A hot a windy August afternoon
Has the trees in constant motion
With a flash of silver leaves
As they're rockin' in the breeze.

The boy lies in the grass with
One blade stuck between his teeth
A vague sensation quickens in
His young and restless heart
And a bright and nameless vision
Has him longing to depart.

You move me, you move me
With your buildings and your eyes
Autumn woods and winter skies
You move me, you move me
Open sea and city lights
Busy streets and dizzy heights
...
