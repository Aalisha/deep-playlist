I know I could not last very long at all
Without you here to break my fall
I know I could not stand alone for very long
Without you there to take my coat
'Cause you were better than whatever came before
Before you ran out and left me on the 100th floor

Get out and go and find everyone who cared for you
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get out, don't forget everything you cared for
