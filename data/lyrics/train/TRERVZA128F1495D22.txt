Vanishing the frozen things that haunt you in your heart
memories eventually will tear themselves apart
Beasts and babies drain away the colors of your face
down below the waters grow to carry you away

Far below we see them
the strangers in the road
pull me from the haze
we'll fly away
leave me in the morning
when you go along your way

Monuments of angry men stand everywhere you go
...
