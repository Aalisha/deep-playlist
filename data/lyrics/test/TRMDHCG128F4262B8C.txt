Won't you talk to me?
This is so out of hand
Out of hand
Something's gone wrong
With the life that we planned

Won't you look at me?
You're avoiding my gaze
Yes, you are
And it seems like you've changed
In so many ways

It isn't fair, it isn't right
If it's really gone then tell me tonight
If it's over
(Over)
If it's over
Let me go
(Just let me go)
...
