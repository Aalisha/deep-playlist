Don`t want no one night stand
I don`t need no helping hand
You ain`t comin` round to drink my booze
You won`t get the money you lent
You know the stuff that pays my rent
Just stick around cos` you`re gonna lose

Just leave don`t look behind you
I don`t need your money honey
Just spend it on a loser
I don`t need your money honey
Get off my back
Get off my track
And I`ll tell you if you want facts
