Shake down, you make me break, for goodness sake
I think I'm on the edge of something new with you
Shout out, don't drown the sound
I'll drown you out, you'll never scream so loud
As I want to scream with you

Standing there with your smile blinding your eyes from seeing
my face as I'm dying to figure out a girl
But she drifts so far away, I'm on her coast
So maybe I should stay and map around your world

So Don't Say, These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
How the wind went and pulled me into your hurricane
Into your hurricane
