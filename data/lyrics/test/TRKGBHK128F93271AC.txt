Like all the boys before

You left a blood stain on the floor
You set your sights on him
You left a hand print on the door
Like all the boys before
Like all the boys before

This is our luck baby, running out
Our clothes were never off
We still have our roads to run about
To scale the map, scale the map
to get us back on track

I've seen you in a fight you lost
I've seen you in a fight

We're under the sheets and you're killing me
In our house made of paper
Your words all over me
...
