If I ever found the cause of this sadness, I know it would be
Impossible to keep the vision against all of me
When I took myself far and away from everyone that I knew
If you're looking for the moon, is it ever when it's new?

When the iron is cold and the binding holds fast on to you
When I listen for the footsteps that nearly knock me
Down in the room
"The tower is gone." you say, but how well can you really
see?

Oh you'll find it by and by
