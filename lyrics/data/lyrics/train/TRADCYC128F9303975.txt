Spirit of doubt you have no place here
I command you to leave in Jesus' name
Spirit of fear you have no place here
I command you to leave in Jesus' name
You're not welcome here so go, just go

Spirit of doubt you have no place here
I command you to leave in Jesus' name
Envy and jealousy you have no place here
I command you to leave in Jesus' name
Go back from whence you came

'Cause our God reigns here, our God reigns here
We claim this ground in Jesus' name
'Cause our God reigns

Our God reigns here, our God reigns here
