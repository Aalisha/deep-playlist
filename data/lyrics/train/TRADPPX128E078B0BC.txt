It seems no matter how far I may roam
Like some old tumbleweed, my thoughts go tumblin' back home
In memories I recall those simpler times
And a way of life I never left behind

Down at the old corral
Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down
Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now
Down at the old corral
