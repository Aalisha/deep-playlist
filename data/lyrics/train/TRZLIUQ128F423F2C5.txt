We see wave after wave of people in the street
Playing their songs, but missing the beat
People, oh people why can't you understand?
Fools with no disguises and love so close at hand
When will you begin to recieve the love of God?
Jesus wants to touch you, enfold you with his love
Look into your life and tell me what you see
