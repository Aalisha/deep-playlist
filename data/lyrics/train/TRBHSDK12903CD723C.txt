When my days are rolling stones
When my memories ring like telephones
And I'll have somewhere I can go
I'll have comfort, this one thing I know

You pull another blanket 'round me
Yeah, you pull another blanket 'round me

This is where I want to be
This is where I want to be
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me and it's okay
