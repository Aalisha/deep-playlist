Alright, yo, I'm bust
I'ma kill it, I'ma kill it
Here we go, here we go, yo

My flow is like a cock block for your whole label street team
My verse is like a hearse for your marketing scheme
My whole steez, nigga, please, put the mic down
Talk about your represent when you embarrassing your town

Walking around with the Gay Pride parade crown
Silicone raps underneath that pink gown
Posing as a killer when you living as a clown
Entertaining A&R's too deaf to hear the sound

You are a has been rapper, talking 'bout your style's nice
Saying,? I'm independent now, looking for a new life?
A weak DJ, living off of 80's fame
Guess starring in the basement, living off of Tigga's name

My name's Kardinal, the pearl mic dark figure
Diploma type thoughts mixed up with street niggas
Living underground trying to earn the pop loot
'Cause I won't sell crack and got no aim to shoot

No patience for the weed, not quick enough to thief
Can't pimp, don't like fur coats or gold teeth
But I can rock the hell out of a fat ass beat
I might smile up in your face and then jack your SP

Yo, I'm ill to the 7th degree
T-dot represent, ya hearing me?
(Go ahead den)
Yo, I'm the nicest rapper dapper with flows
You don't know how a fire starter go
(Go ahead den)

Yo, lick two, chart off in the sky
A make way when I'm stepping in the room
(Go ahead den)
