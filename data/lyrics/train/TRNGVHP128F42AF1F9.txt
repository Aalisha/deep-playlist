You like a dozen wine red roses
Candlelight on porcelain set tables and that's fine
Well, I'll go out of my way for you anytime
That's right baby

The fire's warm
So you take off your sweater
Now it's my turn and I'll do you one better
That's the game, we both will like to play

You wink, I laugh
'Cause we know a little hug leads to a foot rub
Then a hot tub
Then a French kiss on a bear rug

Do you like it? Do you like it?
How about this? Wanna try it?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll take that as a yes

You like snuggling with your pillow
With my arms tight holding us together
