You will always be my King
And I will always be your Lady Tee...

Touch me in the morning,
Baby, I don't mind,
You can make it all better,
It's fine.

Everywhere I go,
In every face I see,
Honey it reminds me,
Of you and me,
And if you think,
I'm gonna love you baby,
Then come on and hear me when I say...

You blow me away,
Just like a summer breeze baby,
You blow me away,
Just like a warm wind,
You blow me away,
And I love you, sugar,
Baby you know I do, swear I do
Beautiful dreamer.
