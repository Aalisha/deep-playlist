J-Ro

(Whooo! Hah hah!) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah we kickin it
Uhh uhh uhh we kickin it
Yeah yeah we kickin it
(Whooo!) Yeah yeah we kickin it
Yeah, Cali in the house
Huh, uhh, Fred in the house
Check it out, BULLSHIT!

I'm J-Ro the man, I'm gettin down

I gets mo daps than H. Rap Brown
I drive the hoes wild cause they love the way I talk
You can't drive me crazy cause I'm close enough to walk
I bust threes like Terry Tegall, get higher than a eagle
You're just a dirty pigeon, BSn bout religion
I don't give a damn if you don't eat ham
You grab the microphone and reguse to slam
I make a nigga scared to grab the mic behind me
I kick shit so deep King Neptune couldn't fine me
Yo, can I get a go J-Ro?
(Go J-Ro!) To let me know if I can flow
I probably be doper if I smoked crack like you
But Swift and Tash'll beat my ass until I'm black and blue
Cause I ain't with, no way out shit
I'm tired of this one-hittin played out shit
Some niggaz rock like the Liks... BULLSHIT!

Uhh, I hate big tits... BULLSHIT!
