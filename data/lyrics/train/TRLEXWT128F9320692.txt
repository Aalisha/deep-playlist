Of all the times I've been disrespected,
You'd think it'd be no surprise.
Learning lessons, all the precious treasures
Take all that youâ€™ve got.
I'll take your ready hand with a ready blade.
I'm dead set to make you lie in the bed you've made.

Paid in full, I'll take it from your pride,
I don't know just what you thought
But you've gone past the line, and you've got me wrong.

The time has come, your song has long been sung.
Brought down, you won't have long to go.
