We're hung out to dry
We're hung out to dry and we notice the tide

We're out of control
We're out of control and we don't bare the toll

And now we can tell a friend from a foe in our war
But I don't know what you want from this world
I was but you want more from me

And I could love you more
More
But I won't
Won't
But I won't
Won't

We fought a good fight
