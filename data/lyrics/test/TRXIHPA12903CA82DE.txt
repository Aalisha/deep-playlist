There is life in the blood of the lamb who was slain
There is power, there is power in His name
There is love pouring out of the wounds that were made
Pouring out, pouring over our shame

So praise the God who saves
Praise the God who bled
Praise the God who was nailed to a tree
And wore our sins upon His head

There is truth in His body, raised that third day
There is joy in a stone rolled away
...
