Play with lives tonite
Shallow men waiting in the line
They could break my neck
To bury that sweet ass of mine

I'm telling the truth
So listen to me
Messin with me is to piss in the wind
I don't give a shit
Cause you ain't got a clue
I've been sitting on a bomb, but it isnt for you

Some people like me
Some love to hate me
That's built inside me
Too hot's enough

You can try to put me down
And I won't care
Anyplace, anyhow
...
