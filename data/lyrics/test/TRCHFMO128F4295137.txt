Rothai an t'saoil ag casadh leo
Nil imeacht uaidh go deo
Daoine corr an t'saoil ag goid leo
Ni cuma leo go foill
(the wheels of the world keep on turning
It's inevitable
The corrupt people of this world keep on stealing
Yet, they don't care)

White fool come to a new land
There's a dark moon on the sand
Then nothing was ever the same again
This land is in their hands
A thousand years of tribeland
Strong winds carry the pulse
Greed and lust it stripped the earth bare
...
