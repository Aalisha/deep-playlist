'Cause I never did workin'
From mornin' till night
And my money didn't seem
To ever come out right, no no

Papa was a tramp
But he was a lover too
So why can't I do like papa do
Alright, like papa do
Like papa do now, 'cause I'm his son
Why can't I be like my Daddy

Low down, you're nasty
Alright, if you wanna call me that
Go ahead, I guess papa was too
