I had love all around me 
Now i'm all alone 
I was lost and someone found me 
Now i'm all alone 
That I could make you want me again 
I would really change 

You gave me all that I needed 
Still I wanted more 
So many wrongs I repeated 
Now you closed the door 
That I could make you want me again 
I would really change 
...
