*Prevail*

Ever heard of Vertigo? Well ain't no way else to go
Prevail knows the faculties, our poison lay you vertical
It's only murder for every small animal committed
The only difference is I won't admit I did it
There's a limit as to how far my posse's willing to bend
The Don of a burgendy autumn blinds the minds of most men
Vomiting from the quarantine, praying for the end
You can tell by the stench that the venom's setting in
On the plane in which you reign, it's classified as do or die
But in the realm in which we dwell, it's puncture necks and multiply
Imagine the madness, the return of the Jew from Nazareth
The hunter and the hunted, the colonizing and savages
The only challenge is, did they bring enough to dirt to bury us
Be aware, I hunt with the god as a Cerabus
Where we're going, don't stress, there'll be plenty of time to rest
Close the curtains, brace your sternum, this is just a contest

Chorus: Arabic singing

~Madchild~
