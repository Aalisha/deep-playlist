Beam me up Scottie not as to where I have no control of my
body tweaking diodes I walk the roads like karate masters
most the time my mind be ghost like Casper sinkin faster
But coming up in this shit sometimes I'm alienated under
rated suckas hate it that I made it as a misfit
But you know if the shoe fit's Im'a wear it like a glass slipper
Hike to the big dipper dip like a skipper not top could be
tipper (say what?) but fools be tryin to rape friends to make friends
And that's one big twisted ass picture like Jack the ripper
Caught up in the net like Flipper on a tuna protest yeah
Where's the focus got me fuckin with these friends and
they're crackin my lens and now shit be'z foul as a mutha
Word to my sistas and my brothas and my color

Hey you...
