Meet me tonight by the bombed out carnival.
We'll hide out where the house of mirrors is smashed up like an icicle field.
We'll hide in the ferris wheel car
And we'll watch from the top as the cop sirens squeal, squeal!
Click! Click! Click! Click!
Bang! Bang!
Went my gun in the convenience store clerk's face.
"Give me all your fucking money," 
My voice quivered,
My hands wavered.
A little kid got it in the face-
He didn't stand a chance!
Love hounds is all we are.
We want it all right now.
Handsome young gentlemen,
Robbing and murdering
In the afternoon.
In the afternoon.
Love hounds is all we are.
