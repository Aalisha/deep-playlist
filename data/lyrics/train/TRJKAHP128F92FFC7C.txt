(Give it up, to give it up)
You know what's on my mind
(Give it up, to give it up, girl)
You've been wastin' too much time

You know you got what I want
You come on, you're 'bout to blow my mind
(Can you dig it? Give it up, to give it up, girl)
You've been wastin' too much time

(Give it up, to give it up, girl)
You know what's on my mind
Ah, don't wait another longer

Patiently I've waited, baby, waited just for you
