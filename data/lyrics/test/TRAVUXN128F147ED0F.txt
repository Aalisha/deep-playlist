(Instrumental verse x 2)

Yeah, I'm gonna tell you a story, that you don't want to hear
Baby, I'm wanna tell you a story, one that you don't want to hear
Because it's about you, and you're losin', baby
And the end is drawing near.

Well, if you don't understand, there's no reason for me to stay on
Yes, if you don't understand, baby, there's no reason for me to stay on.
