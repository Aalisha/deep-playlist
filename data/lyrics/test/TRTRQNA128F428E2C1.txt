We've been datin' since high school
We never once left this town
We used to go out on the weekends
And we'd drink till we drowned
But now she's actin' funny
And I don't understand
I think that she's found her
Some other man

Chorus:
She left me for Jesus
And that just ain't fair
She says, "That he's perfect."
How could I compare
She says, "I should find him."
And I'll know peace at last
...
