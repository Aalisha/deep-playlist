By the harbor
I harbor the strangest memories
Older than I could ever be
Stranded in nostalgia

So, tonight I? ll try harder
But it's hard to fix
This spotlight on me
In a cast that's taken places
I? m unsure of where I want to be

Stand up, stand up
And stand down
Applaud El Capitan
And jump off to cheers
From the crowd

Stand up, stand up
And stand down
And I hope you take your camera
To photograph my tears
As they hit the ground

No one even listens
...
