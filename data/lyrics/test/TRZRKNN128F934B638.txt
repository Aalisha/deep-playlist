We're all off to meet our maker
And I know we won't go far
If there's a chance at life, it's not in sight
When you watch the world go dark
When you take a chance and you throw it up
If you watch to see where it falls
Even in the end it'll always end up small

So dont waste your time, just free your mind
Beyond this you can't look behind
Move on forth to a place above it all
Head up high into the sky
Just take a chance and try to fly
Leave it all and we will never fall

So ride on together til sunrise again
We ride on forever til the very end
We ride on together no matter the cost
No journey's too great and no chances are lost
Never hold back against a dream you wanted long
...
