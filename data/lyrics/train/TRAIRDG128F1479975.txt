I'm walking on air
With the sky beneath my feet 
I'm almost there
Know My feeling incomplete

When you touch me 
You tell me, that you want me 
Cause it feels like, It's the first time 
My heart is breaking free

I come alive, like awakened from within 
I come alive, with your fingers on my skin 
And I'm falling, deeper 
Losing all controll
And I'm raising higher
Giving up my soul
I come alive
