What's going on all over this whole wide world?
What's going on all over this whole wide world?

Calling there's an emergency and I'm only dialling cause it's necessary
Calling there's an emergency and I'm only calling cause it's necessary

What is going on in addy planet Earth? Dat ah where we live it addy place of our birth
Madness and mayhem man the world is corrupt, like a volcano it soon will erupt

Calling there's an emergency and I'm only dialling cause it's necessary
Calling there's an emergency and I'm only calling cause it's necessary

Look at the people in the streets, everywhere they don't seem like they care
And everyone is getting mad, it just seems like we've all lost the plot

Calling there's an emergency and I'm only dialling cause it's necessary
999 there's an emergency and I'm only calling cause it's necessary
