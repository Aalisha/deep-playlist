noon glistens and shadows wave
who know whether we're stupid or brave
and they way we are
oh we are
running scared

no use fighting in the name of pride
when there probably isn't any place to hide
and the two of us
running scared

they're fakin' their peace and makin' their tracks
they
re watching you, watching them, watching your backs
and they know we are
oh we are
running scared
...
