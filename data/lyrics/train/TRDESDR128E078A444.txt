I get this feeling that you're taking me under
I get this feeling that you're taking it down
'Cause it's you, you, you, all you
Come and get it

I start to see the way you're taking me over
My eyes are open to you fooling around
'Cause it's you, you, you, all you
Come and get it
Gonna show ya

I made it on my own again
I'll get back on my feet again
I know I'm gonna feel
So good, and so good, and so good
I'm gonna stand the test of time
I'm gonna take back what is mine
I know I'm gonna feel
