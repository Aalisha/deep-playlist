There's a spell on my mind
And you're to blame
Nothing else in my life
Will ever be the same

It must be love
For this is nothing that I won't do
For the love of you
From now on
Every thing that I have is yours forever

This is straight from the heart
No one could ever doubt
My love will last till the end of time
Of time
...
