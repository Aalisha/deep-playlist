Another boring night and I'm feeling pissed,
My heads fucked up and I'm in a mess
Too many drugs have made me high
I want to 'cause havoc, I want to die.

We are the League, with the extra man
We are the League, we are the anti band
So don't you say you're feeling bored
The League are here and we have scored

We are the League
We are the League
We are the League
The Anti Nowhere League
