Strong and mighty, strong to save us
Like a fortress never failing
Strong in battle, strong in kindness
When we stray, Lord, You're strong to find us

When the winds come hard against us
You are steadfast, You are true
When the ground beneath us trembles
Your foundation never moves

Strong tower, high and glorious
Strong tower, mighty in love
Our refuge, our defender
Strong tower, Lord, above
