Oh, it's Saturday
Yes, it's Saturday

Gonna shine, shave, shower and brush my teeth
Go out and dance and forget my grief
Make all the nightclubs in this town
'Cause my sweet baby's gonna show me around

Well, we'll go here and there and everywhere
Where we go, I just don't care
We'll do the town up and we'll do it right
Beause tonight is Saturday night

Who cares if talk gets around
Just 'cause I'm sly and not so meek
...
