You said that I would stumble
You said I wouldn't last
But you was wrong
You said that I would crumble
From all that's in my past
But you was wrong

You tried to break, tried to shake me
Tried to take me with your lies
You tried to drop me, tried to stop me
Tried to chop me down to size
You tried to crush me, tried to hush me
Tried to rush me and attack
But Jesus Christ is in my life
And now I'm comin' back 'cause I can
