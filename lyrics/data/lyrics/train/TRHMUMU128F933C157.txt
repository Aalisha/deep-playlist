o love i was torn, i was torn
but i put those thorns away
and im just a thorn where the gods look kind
and thoughts a behind me

o why would you be late by a year long?

why would you kill it, kill it, kill it, before it dies
why would you kill it, kill it, kill it, before it dies
those puppy eyes are no suprise
