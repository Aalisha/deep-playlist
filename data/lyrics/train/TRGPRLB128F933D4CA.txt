From the time that I wake to the time that I rise, she's a lover and so am I
But the lady loves her passion more than me
When I'm under her spell, then I know very well, how her magic can mystify
And the lady leaves her lovers in ecstasy
She's young, but she's wise, and the heaven in her eyes at half a glance
Is as much as a man can see
But she'll never really love any more than any other lover in her life
