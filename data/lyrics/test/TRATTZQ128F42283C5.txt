Girl I see you crying
Tears rolling down your face
You're sick of him lying
Need someone to take his place

I can give you whatcha ask for
I can give you whatcha need
I'm down with anything you're down for
Baby you can count on me

Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad
You'll never have to be sad
Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad
