Everywhere are hearts and empty hands,
With no one there, to understand,
Future dreams, you're searching for a clue,
That sun don't shine, you never mind.

Don't get too discouraged in this life,
It's just a game, for now we play.
And soon or later things can work out right
This you must know, just wait and see
And after everything is said and done,
This can be another battle we have won.
