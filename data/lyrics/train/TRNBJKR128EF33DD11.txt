Six foot legs with the moves of a shark
Leave the room she forgets you
Lips like fire even glow in the dark
A blood red rosy tattoo

This bad girls been on my mind
But I won't waste my Valentine
I know her story all too well
Too little heaven for so much hell

And when I see you coming
I gotta get to running
You know you're really much too hard on me
And though I'll always need you
I know I'll never please you
You know you're really much too hard on me
You know you're really much too hard on me
