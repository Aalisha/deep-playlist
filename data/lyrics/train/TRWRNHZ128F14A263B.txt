[CHORUS]
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

I have opened up my eyes
Now I can see clearly
You told there's no other guy
Who would be as good to me

I fell in love and didn't stop
To think what you were doing
But now I know
I don't need you at all
You're no good for me

I've changed my mind
I'm taking back my love
