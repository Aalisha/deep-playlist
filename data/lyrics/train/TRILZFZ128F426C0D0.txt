Didn't it seem right
To walk along the sand last night
And to gaze out at the night
Through your window

Just the way things are
Can be reflected in a star
And you don't stop to think
It could be that we're in love
It could be we're in love

To walk along the sand
You don't have to understand
What the world is really like
...
