I love you 'cause you're sympathetic,
you listen once and soon forget what I said,
'cause it's all in your head.

I love you like a new adiction,
you kiss me once and then go missing,
so long, you've been gone all along,

With your happiness and satisfaction,
distorted by the big attraction,
I cut you down and set you free,
I pull the darkness over me.

I can't help it, I can't help myself
...
