You drive me up the fucking wall,
I can't stand you anymore.
I don't want to talk to you,
I'd rather be ignored.
Your mom's a bitch. Your dad's a jerk.
And you're a nasty whore.

I'm sick of all the things you do,
I can't stand you anymore.
Your breath is fucking stinky, and your body smelly.
Smoking all your cigarettes, you're gonna burn in hell.
