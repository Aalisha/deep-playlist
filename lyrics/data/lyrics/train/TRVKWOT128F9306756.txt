Restore me, restore to me the joy
Restore me, restore to me the joy
This is my prayer today, yeah

It reminds me of the prodigal son
After his righteous livin' all the evil he had done
Yet when he returned his father received him home
Gave him a ring of gold, put him on a robe

Killed the fatted calf
Gave him somethin' he never ever had
Restoration

Restoration has finally come
Been restored back to my place in God
Restoration has finally come
Been restored back to my place in God

What would I know about being restored
