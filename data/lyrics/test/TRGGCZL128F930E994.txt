(Intro)
Yeah, you got Celly Cel back in this muthaf**ka
Once again, you know
'Bout to drop this soul playa shit on y'all
You know, nothin' but that realness
Can ya feel this though
Yeah. Gonna ride wit ya nigga 'cause it's goin' down

They say break yo'self or make yo'self
So I said f**k it, bought a glock so I could take myself
Through all this soft shit a nigga face as a youngsta
Loc'ed ass niggas made that hillside a monster
OG's hoopin' at the school house & shootin' dice
In & out the pen, real niggas might? nice
Made this hog get the brew
Made me hit the weed
Eatin' at the ho house
Moms know a nigga kill
Go to my room, sleep off my high, and hit the door
Tellin' myself "I ain't smokin' weed no more"
But you know
Them lies as the days go by
Me, Choo-Choo & Clyde smokin' dank 'til the sun rise
Walk into the school house
Franklin Junior
Back when it was cool to kiss & tell and spread rumors
Boxin' toe to toe & everybody in a circle
Sockin' mutha-f**kas 'til they eyes turn purple
Ain't no set trippin', no jumpin', it's just 1 on 1
Fools throwin' thangs to the end
Back then, it was fun
No gunshots
No need to hit the floor
But after shool
The whole city woken up
Let's hit the park fool
To see a little league, a Babe Ruth baseball game
Niggas was down there cuttin' up or throwin' thangs
Chasin' 5 off for hot dogs & fries bitch
But back then, you still couldn't tell a nigga shit
