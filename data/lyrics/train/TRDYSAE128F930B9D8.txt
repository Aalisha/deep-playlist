Surrounded by family and friends
A picture what life's like at your end
In my dreams i cannot imagine
The horror you must have seen
If I could tell these words to you
I know that probably it won't do
I try to give some conforting but
I don't know what do
One thing is for sure
I will be there for you

Hope is the last thing you cannot give up
Faith keeps us strong through it all
