From here to there to everywhere
And back to Union Square
Where do I get some sleep?
Anywhere the sleep dust lies
It decorates your eyes
Where do I get some sleep?

Stranded in June
Whistling the same old tune
But I do believe I might be having fun
I believe I might be having fun
Impeccably dressed in your second hand vest
We were waiting for the taxi to come

Putting on my daytime eyes
A good enough disguise
Until I get some sleep
Reading out the horoscopes
