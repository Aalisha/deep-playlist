You want a piece of me? I'm like a razorblade
I'm like a pound of blubber smothering a live grenade
These are the days when the TV always stays on
The show keeps running after the audience has all gone home

I'm like a vampire with this taste for blood
Without the makeup and the cape I'm just a fucking hood
These are the nights that none of us will live to regret
Laying face down as the monkeys rain down

She's one of the guys
Pounding that beat all night
When the blood and all the makeup dries
You were first in line
