Wake up mama, turn your lamp down low
Wake up mama, turn your lamp down low
Have you got the nerve to drive Papa McTell from your door

My daddy died and left me wild, wild, wild
Mother died and left me reckless
Daddy died and left me wild, wild, wild

No, I'm not good lookin'
I'm some sweet woman's Angel child
