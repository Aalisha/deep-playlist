Rubber headed motor junky
Run me down and try to stomp me
Throw my life away and I'll be worthless just like you
Somewhere now a baby's crying
Down the road his mother's dying
Shot a line and blew her mind and now she's turnin' blue

Don't you throw your life away
Just wait until another day
Don't you throw your life away
Cause baby I can feel it
