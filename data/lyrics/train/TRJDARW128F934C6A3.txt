What is this hell?
What have you done?

Of all the things we've learned from ripping off this earth
the quantities were met and indirectly led to death

In the factories
Teeming with ripe disease
and on your bended knees you took it like a man! Regret rears its despicable head
All those years of ingesting the dead
Living your life with your hands painted red

Gross remorse

In this the final hour
Now that you see what you've done
The cancelled check of life and its bitter taste of dung
The stress of consciousness
In distress and blessing yourself with death

Wolves use their cunning and stalk in the night
We use machinery to exhibit destructive might
They've only the skills adapt for taking their kill
