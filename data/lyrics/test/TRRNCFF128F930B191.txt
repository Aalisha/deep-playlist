Not Today

Fuck no
Not today
No chance
No way
It's my life
My say
Fuck no
No way

True love
It's the pills and the gun
Can't stop won't stop till it's over and done
What it looks like I ain't the one
Hard times getting worse and it's only begun
I push a Cadillac gold Biarittz
I got everything you want don't ask me for shit
I fucked you girl you should ask about me
Thought it couldn't get worse it's as bad as can be
Hypocrite
You do it the same
I don't give a fuck though it's part of game
I go for mine
I go for broke
Pack a nine
Let's smoke
You want to do it? We can do it let's go
You's a punk motherfucker get done like a ho
We roll dice
Life is a gamble
Make me a million dollars make you an example

Fuck no
