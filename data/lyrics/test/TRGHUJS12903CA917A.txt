I got the way, the way has got me
Holding my hand peculiarly
Singing on the train and suddenly
When I look up they're staring at me

Swapping looks like 'What a freak'
And 'All this excitement in the middle of the week!'
Well I like to play the fool a little bit
Don't even know that I'm doing it

Since you left things've been changing
Chugging, chugging, chugging along
