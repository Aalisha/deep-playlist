(Written by: L. Rutledge & W. Dane)

Staring into the sky, the red glare will blind your eyes
Afraid to see the light
Your fears have spread this plight
No way to kill the power
Behold your race will die

Deathrider comes from above
No place to hide nowhere to run
Deathrider's rage is on the loose
Your neck in it's eternal noose
