Wasn't wearing a wedding dress in a Vegas wedding chapel
They were herding us in and out of there like we were cattle
Not exactly the fairy tale that I had planned
But mama said aren't you supposed to get married girl
Before you bring a baby in this world
And what could I say but yes ma'am

And I called her from that chapel in Love Land
I said I really love this man
Love Land

Seemed like a lifetime driving from Vegas to Oklahoma
If you're allowed a number of mistakes in life maybe I've filled my quota
They called it a reception saying we did the right thing
