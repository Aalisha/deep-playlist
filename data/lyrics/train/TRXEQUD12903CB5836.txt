Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh

Come Dasher, Come Dancer, Come Prancer, Come Vixen
On Comet, On Cupid, On Donner, On Blitzen
Put on your bells, your Christmas bells
Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride
Christmas time is here again
Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride
To bring good cheer again
