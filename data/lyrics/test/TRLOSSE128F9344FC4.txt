Piles of bodies on the nightclub floor
The drugs that arrive from a distant shore
Poppies in fields get torched in a war
On everything we ever knew before

Didn't you used to buy this stuff
To feed your youth to keep them dazed?
Even as you talk of a war on drugs
The name on the cheque says cia

Burn the supply and raise the price
