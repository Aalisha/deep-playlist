She said lets change our luck
This night is all we've got
Drive fast until we crash
This Dead End life

Sweet dreams that won't come true
I'd leave it all for you
Brick walls are closing in
Let's make a run tonight

Blinded by the lights...
Hold you through forever
Won't let you go

'Cause if you jump, I will jump too
We will fall together
From the building's ledge
Never looking back at what we've done
We'll just say it was love
...
