Mucus shifters throat menders, suck up social members
Have you realized the patience given not given back?
Working, ready made fix it quick, years of little gain
Push me too far blind bats it will never end

No money, life is plenty funny
For all you hard working people, I'll sing it again
No money, life is plenty funny
For all you hard working people, the day never ends

Multivitamins tea bags vitamin see in me
Anxious peons rule bylaw, laced with e, lazeery
Hold on my foot in your mouth, taste the asphalt
Slobbery wet smokers breathe for you
And now I'm breathing you

No money, life is plenty funny
