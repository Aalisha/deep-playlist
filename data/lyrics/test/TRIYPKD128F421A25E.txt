Never thought of leaving you today,
Never thought I'd ever feel this way,
But now I'm gone and you are alone.
I hope you're not waiting by the phone.
I am never coming back,
Not because of anything you lack.
Belive me there's nothing that you can do,
The problem is with me and not with you.
You've been there for me,
Each and every time.
Trust me it's not your problem,
It is mine.
I'm sorry I don't know,
...
