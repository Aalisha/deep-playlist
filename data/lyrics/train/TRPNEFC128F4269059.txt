I'm in a frenzied state of mind
Smashing things all around
Why do things have to be this way?
Why do things have to be this way?
Why do things have to be this way?
Why do things have to be this way?
I can't take it anymore
I'm going to go insane
I'm so angry, I'm so angry, I'm so angry,
I'm so angry, angry, angry, angry!
I don't know why I care anymore
