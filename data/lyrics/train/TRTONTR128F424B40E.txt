Every night you can hear a sound 
 Every night you can hear a sound 
 A sound that won't go down 
 Pulsating all around 
 Arrising from her tomb 
 Late at night, she walks the streets 
 Late at night, she awakes 
 Black flowers, black dress 
 She comes in, in search of you 
 White faces are for her 
 When the procession of love goes by 
 They search for you 
...
