If the sun comes up tomorrow
It would see a sight so sad
The moon is still smiling on me
Right up until dawn

I'm drowning in hate and sorrow
But nothing is quite that bad
There still might be something for me
Before I am gone

And I'm not fooling no one
I know you think you'd win
But I won't pay for your sins

My monsters keep me company
And I'll never be lonely
They will keep me safe
Protected from harm
Monsters keep me company
...
