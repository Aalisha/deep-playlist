Oooh baby

Honestly truely give it baby
Told me (ooo) how you amaze me
I know that we'll always be

Sincerely in love with you ooo
With you I've found what I've been missing
Turn my world around
And I'm sincerely in love with you ooo
My true emotions when your near me
Honestly I'm yours sincerely

I just wanna love you (love you) more than anybody ever loved anyone before
I just wanna tell you with all of me
With all my heart I'm yours
I just really wanna be around you since I've found you
I'm alive, you revive my soul
I'm awake to life and it feels so right
And with you I found my home baby

I'm sincerely in love with you ooo
With you I've found what I've been missing
