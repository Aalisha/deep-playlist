Elegantly wasted and I can taste it
here I sit, trying not to fake this gift of beauty myth
I can't help but feel like this
bored... of the beauty whore
coz my body just wants more scars...
and I can feel them wounds...
I can't heal them
red bring my mouth to life
black revive my hair thats dyed
make-up always helps me hide
what I don't like on the outside

Starlight, starbright first star I see tonight
I wish I may, I wish I might have the wish
...
