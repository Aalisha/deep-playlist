I've been living with a heart on the mend,
wondering how will I ever be strong.
I know I'll live to love again.
I just leaned on you too long.
It's been an uphill fight,
but I'm going to be alright.

Chorus
I didn't know my own strength
till I had to pick myself up
and carry on without your love.
I'm getting back on my feet.
Its been a long hard fall,
but I'll make it after all
...
