Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six long years
On your trail

Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six full years of my life on your trail

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life:

I booked myself in at the Y ... W.C.A.
I said: "I like it here - can I stay?
I like it here - can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy
For a Back-scrubber?"
