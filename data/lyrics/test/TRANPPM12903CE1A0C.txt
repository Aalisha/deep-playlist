I've gambled down in Washington
And I've gambled up in Maine
I'm going down into Georgia
To knock down my last game
I'm a gambling man, man, man
I'm a gambling man
Well I had not been in Washington many more weeks than three
When I fell on love with a pretty little girl
And she fell in love with me
I'm a gambling man
I'm a gambling man
I'm a gambling man, man, man
I'm a gambling man, man, man
I'm a gambling man, man, man
I'm a gambling man
I'm a gambling man, man, man
I'm a gambling man, man, man
I'm a gambling man, man, man
I'm a gambling man
She took me in her parlour
Cooled me with her fan
She said, "Oh mother mother
I'm in love with a gambling man
He's a gambling man, man, man
He's a gambling man"
