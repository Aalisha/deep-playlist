[Lead: Schalin/Allenmark]

Torment, hatred, calamity
I've strived to overcome, for years
A recollection, I would like to believe
As a faded water-mark
Is The only thing that remains
Instead of deep imprints of pain

Human brain, what a powerful device
Capacity we can't believe, can't conceieve
What's erased can always be retrieved

All the pain drained from my mind
In violent streams ran underground
Where it arrived it putrefied
Sewerages
