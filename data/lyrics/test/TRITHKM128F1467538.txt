I've got something that you ought to know
Don't even know whether to come or go
Up, down, head's spinning around
Wind up in the lost and found

Wind me up, Wind me up
Wind me up, Wind me up
Wind me up, Wind me up

Tell me why you make it so hard
All I ask is finish what you start

Wind me up, Wind me up
Wind me up, Wind me up
Wind me up, Wind me up

Wind me up, that's all you do
...
