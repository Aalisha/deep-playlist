A terrible thought has moved into my mind
Like an unwanted room-mate drunk on wine
It feeds on my unhappiness, won't pay the rent
I must take proper measures to evict it

A terrible thought has moved into my mind
A giant rat that's nibbling on my pride
It's tearing away my patience and my wits
I must take proper measures to set a trap for it

What a terrible thought

I don't care what you've done
I don't care who you've won
I know in the end, you have your fun
