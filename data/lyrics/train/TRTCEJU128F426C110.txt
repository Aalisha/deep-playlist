Suffer me

This is the last time I hold myself from anger
There is no such thing as a one true love
I'm constantly looking towards something better
It makes no sense for me to look above

Baby Rosemary, what have you brought today for me
This life has nothing for me
Tell me if your up to trade
I'll take anything you offer today I'm feeling brave

Tell me are you willing
'Cause I want the finer things
I'll take this gift your giving
And take all the hell it brings

I wanna be the star in the middle of your everything
I wanna be the one who owns you I want to be your king
