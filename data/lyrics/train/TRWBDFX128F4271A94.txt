We're talking into corners
Finding ways to fill the vacuum
And though our mouths are dry
We talk in hope to hit on something new

Tied to the railway track
It's one way to revive but no way to relax

We're just bored teenagers
Looking for love or should I say emotional rages
Bored teenagers
Seeing ourselves as strangers
