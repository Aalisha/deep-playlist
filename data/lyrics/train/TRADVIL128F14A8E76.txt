All at once we turned our heads
To find each other looking in a different way
Laughter rang and people sang
But up above as night time fell
You ran away
So what do I do now
Secret mission seemed so strange somehow

It happened once it happened twice
I understood and took your love in anyway
Leaving in a new direction
Casual glances, take in every word you say
So special can't be told
