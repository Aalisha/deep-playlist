It's been going on for so long
All the words we said wrong way back then
And I still hear them all in my head
It keeps playing over and over again
I can't run, I can't hide, it don't matter how hard I try
To move on, but...

I don't want to leave it, bury it and forget it
I've already wasted so much time
...
