when I was a young boy I drove my mother crazy
when I was a young man I drove my teachers wild
oh whoa oh whoa nobody to con-trol me
oh whoa modern lover I need you near me

CHORUS
never want to leave ya
never want to leave ya
never want to leave ya
no no no no no

reality anonymous is comin' after me
they want me shakin' they want me screamin'
outside 12 year olds are carryin' machine guns
they give the orders I must be dreamin'
