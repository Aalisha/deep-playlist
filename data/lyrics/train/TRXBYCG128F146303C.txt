[DJ:] This is radio K-EAZY-E. Hi, this is Greg Mac. Mac Attack
And we're gonna go to the phones right now and find out what's
goin' on. Hello, who is this?
[Guy1:] Yo, what's up? This is Lorenzo Patterson
[DJ:] Yo man, where you callin' from?
[Guy1:] I'm callin' from Compton and I wanna hear Eazy E's new record
[DJ:] What's it called man?
[Guy1:] Yo, it's called "Radio"
[DJ:] We got it, you called the right station. And here it is...

Eazy E rockin' non stop on the radio
with the funky fresh hip hop in stereo
Release some rhymes that you will find demandin'
with Dre's beats that are so outstandin'
I'm gettin' busy if you know what I mean
Always settin' me a mark in the hip hop scene
On the radio the greatest of all times
like Mohammed Ali cause I punch rhymes
So tune your station, and clear all the static
and tell the truth: you didn't know that I had it
in me, to be easy about the situation
So just kick it and listen to the station
playin' my music, it's hard to lose it
It's constantly on request cause you choose it
I'm Eazy E, my rap is strong
(and your radio's def when my record's on _ LL Cool J)

[chorus:]

(You wanna know why... because...)
I'm on the...
[Chuck D] Radio [echo]

[Dr.Dre:] Yeah, ruthless radio is in effect, Dr.Dre and Yella boy is in
ya
system. And right about now we got Eazy E and MC Ren in the studio
takin'
calls. So give'em a call and ask'em how they're doin'
(ring)
Hello, this is Eazy E. What's your name?
