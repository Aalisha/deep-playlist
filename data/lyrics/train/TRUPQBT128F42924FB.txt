Big dreams in a small town
Eighteen and glory bound
Nothing here to tie us down
Big dreams in a small town

Rollin' down a dusty road in my daddy's Ford
I wish that I could feel that way again
I remember those summer nights on the brink of love
You and I made more then plans back then

Big dreams in a small town
Eighteen and glory bound
