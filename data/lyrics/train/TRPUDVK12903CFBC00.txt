Outside the courthouse on 5th and vine
There's a hundred people holdin' up their homemade signs
They say they'll be there sunshine or rain
'Til somebody listens, 'til somethin's changed

Believers, believers
They gotta little more faith than the world has doubt
The earth might shake but they stand their ground
And God only knows where we'd be without believers
