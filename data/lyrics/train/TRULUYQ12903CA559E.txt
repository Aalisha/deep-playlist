I had a good job
And a good lovin' woman
But the world fell apart
And then I lost her
I canâ€™t bear to lose
I'll be over to fight
Can't drink enough whiskey
To make it all right

But the tide will turn
Cause I have learned

There ain't no way but the hard way
Get used to it
I said there ain't no way but the hard way
So get used to it

You say I drink too much
And that is a problem
...
