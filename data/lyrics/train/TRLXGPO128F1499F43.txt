Lately Ive been so lonely
Holding everything
Without love
Now Im holding you
And it feels so good
Dont let go now
Come home with me
(Lets spend the night)
Together
(Lets spend the night)
It feels so good
To know your love will be there
For me
And only me
Scratch my friends opinions
Im not blind I see
