When all the star gazes bloom
And throw their stars around the room
I was waiting for the day
For you to love me

When all the elements conspire
With shiny things that catch the eye
I was waiting for the day
For you to love me

Precious precious thing
You are the thought that makes me sing
Wanna leave all my possessions
