I've got a message, 
I think the moon is falling, 
But thank God we're on the sun.

So put the knife in, 
As the night just keeps on turning, 
It's 6: AM but we've just begun.

You don't need a reason, 
To get out on the dance floor.
We can get it on, and on, 
All night long.

You don't need a reason, 
To get out on the dance floor.
We can get it on, and on, 
All night.

I am blood on the bottom of your shoes.
You feel it baby maybe, hook line and sinker.
