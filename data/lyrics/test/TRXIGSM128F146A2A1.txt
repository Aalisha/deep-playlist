I've never been closer
I've tried to understand
That certain feeling
Carved by another's hand

But it's too late to hesitate
We can't keep on livin' like this
Leave no track
Don't look back

All I desire
Temptation
Keep climbin' higher and higher
Temptation

Adorable creatures
Temptation
With unacceptable features
Temptation

Trouble is coming
Temptation
It's just the high cost of loving
Temptation

You can take it or leave it
Temptation
But you'd better believe it
