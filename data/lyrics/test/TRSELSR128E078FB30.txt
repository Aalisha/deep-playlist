Summer, summer, summer time
Summer, summer, summer time
Summer, summer, summer time

Well listen Summer time in the city
Now niggas ride around town, for another sounds, look before the smithy
And even on ball courts, you got the shorties watchin fellas
Doin anythings on they baggy shorts
And kids is having fun in the park
But there's a limit, moms says you best to be home before dark
Now we all know the flavor, were back on the black moms
Chattin with the next door neighbour sayin 'Hi'
The folks that don't ride
Her hands on the floor head 'cause the sun keeps gettin in the rock
Little kids in sweaty suits, with niggas like Lost Boyz
Strictly t-shirts or the boots
Standin on the van with, I'm wavin at chicks
Takin food from the vooda, and sips from the Mystics
Lex, coups, beemers and benz
Niggas hangin with they man makin hits
We bouncin in the city

Summer, summer, summer time (summer time in the city)

Summer, summer, summer time (summer time in the city)

Summer, summer, summer time (summer time in the city)
