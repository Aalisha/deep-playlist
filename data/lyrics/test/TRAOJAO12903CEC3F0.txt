No one ever lived a thousand years
No like things we do or say
Some of those who really changed this world
We would welcome back today
They could really light the way

So call up Otis
Call up Marvin
Call for Buddy, bring them on
Call for Ludwig
And for Johann
We need Lennon--We mean John.

Words live longer than a thousand years
Listen hard to what they say
Single voices that would change this world
We would welcome back today
They would really light the way

So call up Jimi
Let's have Stevie
Look for Miles to take the floor
