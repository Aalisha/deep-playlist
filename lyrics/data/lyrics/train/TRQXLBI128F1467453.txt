(Ronnie VanZant -- Jeff Carlisi)

Well them four walls of Raiford, closing in on me
Doin' three to five hard labor, for armed robbery
I had two years behind me, but I could not wait the time
Everytime I thought about it, well I died some more inside

And I had stripes on my back, memories that hurt
For the only time I seen sunshine is when I went to work
Diggin' ditches for the chain gang, sleepin' in the "hole"
Oh Lord please forgive me for I could not wait parole

And I comin' home to see you Jesus
Well it feels so close this time
