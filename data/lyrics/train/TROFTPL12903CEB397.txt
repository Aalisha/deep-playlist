You're at prom I'm home playin nintendo
Lookin' out of my window wonderin' what I could be
You're the queen I'm home dreamin' on Tatooine
I can't help from what it seems I'll never be you 

I see your face as I walk down the hallway
Wonderin' will you look my way or just hold your blank stare
I kind of chuckle and I'm laughing at what I see
I know you won't look at me as if I'd even care 

You never close your eyes, you never stop and wonder why
Why you wear this disguise
I'm better I'm better than you
...
