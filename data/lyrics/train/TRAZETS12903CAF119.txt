All sailors all come lend an ear, come listen to me song
A trick of late was played on me and it won't detain you long
I come from sea the other day and a girl I chanced to meet
Oh me friends will be expecting me to a dance in Barrack Street

I said "My young fair maid, I cannot dance so well"
"Besides I am to Windsor bound where are me friends do dwell"
"In to see the party, as I've saved up thirty pounds"
"Me friends will be expecting me this night in Widsor town"

"Well if you cannot dance me love then you will stand a treat"
"Have a glass or two of brandy and a something for to eat"
"At six o'clock this evening I'll meet you off the train"
"So don't forget to give a call when you come to town again"
