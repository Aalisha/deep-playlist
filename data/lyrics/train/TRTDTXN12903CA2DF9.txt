Dying men keep rifles in cello cases,
known with a beer as the deer eraser.
They dress their boys in bright orange
and leave their daughters at home,
stripping meat, stretching skin for their musical men.

The makers of guns will never go hungry.
The makers of guns will never fill up.
May their children always play murder weapon since stick.
