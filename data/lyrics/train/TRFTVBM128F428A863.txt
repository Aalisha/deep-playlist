Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lookin for a man
Blues ain't nuthin but a woman lookin for a man
Honey She can't love him when she wanna,
She go to love him when he can

Blues ain't nuthin but a lowdown shakin chill
Blues ain't nuthin but a lowdown shakin chill
You got to grab man when you can baby
And Love him when you will

She might be down in the church house Kneelin' down to pray
...
