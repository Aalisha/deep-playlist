(Mac McAnally)

Well the daylight drags me out of bed
And the nightlife drags me home
In the meantime I drag round half dead
Restin up for later on

Well I wrack my brain to easy my mind
But I always edge my bet
On the tail of every trend I find
But I don't feel nothin' yet

Lookin' for the good life
