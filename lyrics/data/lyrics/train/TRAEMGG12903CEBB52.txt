Sittin' in my cell, this breakin' bar hell.
Dreamin' of the days of murder enlocked in Cartel.
Drive by's, date rapes, and weight like barbells.
I stuck my girls throat, stuffed it in the cart well,
Oh well, it's what I thought at the time,

But now my sanity is somethin' I ain't seen in a while.
Sittin' on death row, this is my Green Mile

Confined to my mind is like a prison to me.
Since birth had nothin' to choose
I'm on the run with a gun with nothin' to lose.

Childhood is to blame, poverty stricken.
Add some defects to the mix and watch the plot thicken.
I was sick of bein' poor, sick of just livin'
Sick of depression and this trailor park livin'
That my mamma had me stuck in and where was my dad?
I think that he forgot about the son that he had.
So the chances of survival were none to slim
And my mamma keeps sayin' I remind her of him.
So went from just like my dad, then I'm goin' for broke.
Pulled the kick door, stabbed my neighbor in the throat.
I set off on my journey just to see what I could find,
