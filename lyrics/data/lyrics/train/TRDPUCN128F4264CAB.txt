She doesn't have a prayer
And I'm no worse for wear
I close my eyes, gentle, slow
There's no way out, there's no place to go

Spinnin in circles, waitin for the chance to come
In and out of love that's already just begun

Could this be the end callin
Over the edge I'm fallin,
Could be the end callin,
...
