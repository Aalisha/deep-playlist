There is no trial that He can't bring me through,
there is no tunnel that He can't bring light to.

Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain.
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain.
Trials worketh patience, and patience worketh hope;
in spite of my situation, I won't let go.

There is no problem I know that God can't solve,
When I get into it, He was already involved.

Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain.
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain.
Trials worketh patience, and patience worketh hope;
in spite of my situation, I won't let go.

You may be weary and feel you can't go on,
my friend take courage, in Christ you must be strong.

Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain.
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain.
Trials worketh patience, and patience worketh hope;
in spite of my situation, I won't let go.

There is no trial that He can't bring me through,
there is no tunnel that He can't bring light to.

Though I feel like giving up, in Christ I shall maintain.
Because of my faith in God, my joy shall remain.
Trials worketh patience, and patience worketh hope;
in spite of my situation, I won't let go.

No, I won't let go;
oh no, I won't let go
No, I won't let go;
...
