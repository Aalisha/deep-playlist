I know things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off the bottom of the barrel
The Wide open road to my future now
Is looking fuckin narrow

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothing

We get told to decide
