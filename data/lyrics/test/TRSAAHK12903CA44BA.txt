Why would you rather be
Anywhere else with me?
I tell you man, it's all right here
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
Check out the scenery, we won the lottery
I tell you man, it's all right here

And I can't believe you'd even think
Of being anyplace, anyplace but right here
The grass may be greener in the end I swear
But you'll be wishing you were here if you were there

So wherever we go
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(Wherever we are, wherever we are)
(It's all right here)
Excuse me officer

If you're smart you'll know you want to be
In the mix of white hot energies
It's all to welcome you

Talk so good it's moving way too fast
If we could I know we'd make it last
It's all here for you
