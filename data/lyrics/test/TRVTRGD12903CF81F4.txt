Tailored sheets, to fix this dirty bed,
For once this dirt won't come all off
I can't be pushed aside.

Wind is blowing thru closed doors
With shadows dancing in the hall
Now hit the floor, crawl to the side,
We've all made better moves despite the slowing of our feet

For once
Lets leave the dreaming to someone else,
Our time has slipped away,
We're sinking faster, faster no more play
Get ready for the catch,
I'm at the next step, waiting for our year

And all at once it leaves you breathless,
With next to nothing, but open hands.

Reach out, hold on tight,
...
