When your body's had enough of me
And I'm laying flat out on the floor
When you think I've loved you all I can
I'm gonna love you a little bit more
Come on over and lay by my side
I've got to be touching you.
Let me rub your tired shoulders
The way I used to do.
Look into my eyes and give me that smile

The one that always turns me on
And let me take your hair down
Cause we're staying up to greet the sun.
And when your body's had enough of me
And I'm laying flat out on the floor
...
