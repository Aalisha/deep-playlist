Supa Luv (Watcha say, watcha say now?)
Supa Luv (Supa Luv baby, Supa Luv baby)
Supa Luv (Supa Luv baby)
(Come on, 9th Wonder)
I was a sceptic, hesitant, even when he said
(She's the closest thing to an angel I've ever seen)
I've heard that line before
It always carried some ill intent for sure
But then he said it some more
Pretend I've never been in love, I'm not getting sprung
But I could miss it, he could be the one
Go one better and he could make me believe that
(She's a lady to the extreme)
About Jean, I'm 'bout to
Call my family, be like "I met him mom! Wedding's on!"
Ready to party but instead I'm calm
Surface though, all fireworks, wired up espresso
Chill in the tropics drinking rum punch, One Love
Singing it over lunch he got me ...
My luck's been out, feel me?
It done run south, left me a ton of doubt
It's never fun getting the run-around (uh-uh)
Was never one to be wooed easy, I bruise easy
When dudes leave me I get boozed up, they don't trust me
...
