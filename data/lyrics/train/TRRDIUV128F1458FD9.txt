FEMALE: Hypnotize
Call me up when you thought of somethin' new for me to do girl
Hypnotize
Call me up when you thought of somethin' new for me to do girl

GREEN: How could your nothings be so sweet?
You left your love letters incomplete

Ooh, what the girl got nothing to do
Mmm, but she got that much for you
Ooh, what the girl been puttin' you through
Mmm, but she she got that much for you
Down on the beach and out in the bay
Ooh, but I heard the sirens say
You better believe her
Or you better leave her now or never

FEMALE: Hypnotize
How'd you come to be having fun with everyone but me girl?
GREEN: Forgot to tell me
FEMALE: Something good
GREEN: You, a word, knew you would
