You got your hand on the door
And you're ready just to walk out
Well, the fight that you had
Filled your mind up with all this doubt

And you're losing your mind
And you're losing your faith
And you can't remember why you fell in love
In the first place

Go back, go back
To the moment of truth
When she walked down the aisle
And you first said 'I do'

And when this life makes you wonder
What have you got to lose
Go back, go back
To the moment of truth

You got your hand on a habit
And you can't seem to let it go
...
