I'm a cloud drifting by
Dripping tears from the sky
I'm a snail without a shell
Leper with a golden bell

I got nowhere to go
I'm a stray cat on the roam
Choking on a chicken bone
For a home-sweet, no sweet home

For a root
For a leaf
For a branch
For a tree
For something, somebody
That reminded them of me

Running with my roots pulled up
Caught me cold so they could cut
What there was left of love
...
