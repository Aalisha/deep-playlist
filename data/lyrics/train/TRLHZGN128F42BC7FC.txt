We're passengers aboard the train
Silent little lambs amidst the pain
That's no longer good enough

And when it's time to speak our faith
We use a language no one can explain
That's no longer good enough

And God knows it's a shame
'Cause if we look to pass the blame
We are not the worthy bearers of His name

For the world to know the truth
There can be no greater proof
Than to live the life, live the life

There's no love as quite as pure
There's no pain we can't endure
If we live the life, live the life
