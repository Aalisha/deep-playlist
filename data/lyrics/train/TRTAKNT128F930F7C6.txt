Only mess with those hustlers
Never mess with those bustas
Only role with those hustlers
Never mess with no bustas

B-Legit:
Addyup(?) cuz' they done fucked
Wit a nigga tryin' to get a buck
I leave 'em stuck posted up at a stand still
Beat the case off of Dan Vill (?)
Now I'm back for the overkill, hundred dollar bills
Stuffed in the duffel bag (duffel bag)
5 pounds in the back of the deuce rag
So Harm could ya, would ya help the big fella'
Tell 'em how you about that scrilla

Harm:
It goes down like Brandy
Peruvian, mother of pearl, caucasion white bitch
Dirty white girl, uncut raw like Eddy
Sharp like a 'chete
Steady on the program
With missions to get fetti
And I'm ready
On the pedal heavy when I smash
The same muthafucka that hit the gas and dash
To the other side on the down low
'Cuz I only deal with hustlers not bustas you know

Only mess with those hustlers
Never mess with those bustas
Only role with those hustlers
Never mess with no bustas

B-Legit:
And not too many get to ride with me
And you know how a punk ass bitch can be
A snitch to me
