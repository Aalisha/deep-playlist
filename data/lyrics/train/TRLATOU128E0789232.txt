"Emerald figures shining in darkness
Forty souls are locked in stone
A thousand eyes open to see
The wolves of ruin devouring me
Dying hearts of unkown voices
Leave my hope under fallen stars
Their beating echoes only pain
Their blood red lips call out my name

Specters of somber sullen face
Piercing pale dry light of fire
Mirror's like silver maryrs
