I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
And the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky
What is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life
...
