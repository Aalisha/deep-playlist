[Lee]
Stretch me to the point where I stop
Run ten thousand miles and then think of me
I think you know the place we should meet
Don't worry if it's dark and I'm late

Run me out a thin wire
Help me to kill this, love
I'll join you tonight at the bottom of the well
Just feel around in the dark until you get the idea

I'm not moving doesn't mean I can't
Flame on in my head
My best friend sucked his wife's blood an shriveled up
He was mistaken for sane
