(Written by Sting, Originally performed by The Police)

I can't stand it for another day
When you live so many miles away
Nothing here is gonna make me stay
(You) took me over, let me find a way

I sold my house
I sold my motor, too
All I want is to be next to you
I'd rob a bank
Maybe steal a plane
You took me over
Think I'm goin' insane

What can I do
...
