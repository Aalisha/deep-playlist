A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A

Ever since you went away
Been missing you everyday
What I'd do just to see your face
Should of held you and made you stay
Now I really need somebody
Just to call somebody
But I know I cant go back in time and just make things change
Been waitin on your call but ain't heard a word
Wish I can go back to the way things were
Bet you dont even know how much I miss you baby
You can take this as a lesson learned
Kinda like Usher gotta let that shit burn
Breathe in, Breathe out.

I gotta let it go
Even though I cant live without you
Dont wanna lose control
Even though I'm missin everything about ya
And I'm trynna keep my composure
But on the inside it's really killing me
All I can do is just breathe in, breathe out.

I gotta let it go
Even though I cant live without you
Don't wanna lose control
Even though I'm missin everything about ya
And I'm trynna keep my composure
But on the inside its really killing me
All I can do is just breathe in.

Listen up girls I'ma let y'all know
If you got a good man never let him go
If you really love him betta let him know
Never wait 'til he 'bout to walk out the door
