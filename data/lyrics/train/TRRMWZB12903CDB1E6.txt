She's up in the sky
She's up in the domes
She's up in the sky
Up in the dome

I knew a girl who came from Villa Luz
Had a house filled with
Religious regret and infinite debt
Heaven's pressure

She's a light in the dark
She's out of the fire
She's up in the sky
Up in the domes

Alabaster lover
You won't get more
...
