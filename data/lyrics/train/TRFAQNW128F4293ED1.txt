I should have treated you a bit warmer
Kept you over here in my corner
After all is said and done
You still got me on the run a bit longer
Every day and night I wish I had tried
A bit harder

I should have tried a little bit harder
I should have tried a little bit harder

Looking back I could have been smarter
