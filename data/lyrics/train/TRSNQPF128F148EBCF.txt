Please don't be technology
So I can turn up your love like some cold machine
Don't feed me scraps from your bed
I won't be the stray coming back just to be fed

I'll be wait
Come and seal my fate, marine
Just pretend that you want me

And be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my babe, would you be my babe?
Would you be my

Well don't be that note I can't hold
...
