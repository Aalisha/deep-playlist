You know... if you make moves some people will envy
Say what's (what‘s) up with this jealousy

You know people say shit, bout you, and me
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy (one more time ya‘ll)
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy (yes... yes... yes)
Uh-Huh what's up with this jealousy

(T3)
Yes ya'll (ya‘ll)
I love it when you hate
Now lets calculate, take it straight to straight
Take it, to your face or wherever you lay
Oh you say “You fake'? And won't take shit to your face
See in the first place, you made a crucial mistake
My crew congregates just to aggravate
With plots to infiltrate and abbreviate
And if you think we out, shit we got rhythm for days
Take it to another phase with an extra stage
Havin' you feelin' the blaze of NWA
And if they ask you “Who you doin'? tell ‘em “that nigga Tres'?
Yeah damn right I'm great, like the porno tapes
An? For ladies and collecting papes
To these jealous niggas let the? Made? Your man ain't got time for the fake
To those “J"? niggas need to put ‘em away
