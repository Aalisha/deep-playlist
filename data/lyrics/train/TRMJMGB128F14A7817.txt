I would love to be better
I would love to be free
I would love to be perfect
When you look at me
But instead I'm still crying
Yes instead I'm still lying
Sad to say I'm still trying
Not to be me
When I see all the weakness
That I turned into sickness
I still think I can slide
Just fine on the ice
It's not easy to be honest
Sometimes I'm just astonished
How hard it can be to be true
