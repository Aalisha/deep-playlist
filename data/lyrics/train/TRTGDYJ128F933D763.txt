Nobody but a fool would love you after the way you've done me
Broke every vow you made me, broke every rule
Who'd lie awake all night cryin' till you were out of sight
Loving you with all of her might, nobody but a fool

I don't know what it was that made me trust you like I did
Stars got in my eyes or either rocks got in my head
All I knew was your two lips kissed me heavenly
