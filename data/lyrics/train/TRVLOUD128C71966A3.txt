He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin'
Blow rockin' robin
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
