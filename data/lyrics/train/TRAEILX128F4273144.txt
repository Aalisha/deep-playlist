Chorus x2

She's a Superlady,
She is, too much,
Wish I could make her mine,

What a superlady,
a-ha, alright,
She's so fine,


Verse 1

Not long ago I was,
A sad and lonely boy,
Did not know how to get better,

Then heaven up above,
Sent me a super love,
And now I'm happy forever.

No one wants to believe,
I've got a perfect love,
They say I'm just talking crazy,

But I can prove it's true,
...
