I'm trying not to hold it back
I'm trying not to think, I am falling
Friday no one's ever lost
It kills a mind that gives you trust, I know

Ooh, she finally made it
And every time you tell her
Something breaking
Every time you say goodbye
And not knowing how
Ooh, and every time you say goodbye
I can take a lot but not now

Gave you everything
