(Intro: Kanye West)
Aww
Yeah, 9th Wonder on the beat (Aww)
I can't front man, you got some hot beats
It's your boy Kanye Tutta
Got Consequence in here, (I see now) Little Brotha (I see now)
Yeah, I want y'all to listen
Question. (Aww)

(Verse 1: Kanye West)
Now how the hell I end up arguin' wit this bitch? (Aww)
Know everything, but don't know shit (Aww)
Kinda reminiscant of Anna Nicole Smith (Aww)
I just turn my music up like damn that's some cold shit (Aww)
I mighta known about a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from bein' a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady yellow ease I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a mothafuckin' diet Coke?
He said you lyin' yo, why is you lyin' yo
Cut it out quit it G, you hurtin' my kid-i-neys
Naw, she talkin' bout a couple of kids for me (Aww)
She hit and had a ring from Tiffany's
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day I've been treatin' fat hoes differently

(Chorus)
Aww, I see now!
