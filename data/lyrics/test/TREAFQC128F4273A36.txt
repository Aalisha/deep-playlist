I got no tears to cry
There's nothing to hide
No tears to cry
No empty
No, no emptiness

Na na na hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey
Na na na hey-a hey-a hey-a hey-a hey

You and me
Oh, well you know you can't forget it
My congratulations
And now that you're free
And that's exactly what you wanted
Now the story's over
...
