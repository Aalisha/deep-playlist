So maybe things did not work out this time
 Baby don't blame it on yourself
 Maybe the guy you choose is not quite right
 And that's not an easy thing to tell
 SO don't cry don't take it quite so hard
 It's truly not he end of your world
 It's not impossible, you'll find true love again
 You gotta open up your heart to know
 
 Don't you deserve someone, baby
 Don't you deserve true love
 Don't you deserve a chance at true romance
 Baby come take a chance with me
 
 Baby the love you lost was not your type
 So you got to get him out your head
