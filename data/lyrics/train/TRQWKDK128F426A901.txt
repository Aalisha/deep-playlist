Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's something I just have to say
I don't think I can hide
What I'm feelin' inside
Another day, knowin' I love you

And I
I'm getting too close again
I don't want to see it end
If I tell you tonight
Will you turn out the light

And walk away knowin'
I love you?
I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize
Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day

Amanda
