On a ship that's made of paper,
Oh yeah, I will sail the seven seas.
Fight a shark with a toothpick,
Crawled home to you on my knees.
There ain't nothin' baby I wouldn't do, sugar,
Oh yeah baby, just to bring you home with me.

I would rise up with the devil,
Oh yeah, I would breathe smoke and fire.
