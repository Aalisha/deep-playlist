Today seems like a good day, to burn a bridge or two
The one with old wood creaking that would burn away right on cue
I try to be not like that, but some people really suck
people need to get the axing, chalk it up to bad luck

I know a drugstore cowgirl; so afraid of getting bored
She's always running from something; so many things ignored
I might do that stuff if it didn't make me feel like shit
I'm on some old reality tip so many trips in it

Beautiful disaster
