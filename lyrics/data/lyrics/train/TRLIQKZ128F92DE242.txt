[Verse 1]
Three months since we said goodbye
We both know the reason why
It's all about what's right
That's what you said
Now you come back to fill this room
And you show that you thought this through
Before we lose this life
There's something I should tell you

[Chorus]
Even though I try to
I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop thinking about you
No matter how hard I try
Hard I try

[Verse 2]
Chills are creeping down my spine
Thoughts are playing on my mind
Don't care if I'm a fool for what I said
There's no expression on your face
The silence echoes in this place
...
