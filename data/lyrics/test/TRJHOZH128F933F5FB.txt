I've been to Alabama, people ain't a whole lot to see;
Skynyrd says it's a real sweet home but it ain't nothing to me.
Charlie Daniels will tell you the good Lord lives in Tennessee, ha!
But I'm going back to gator country where the wine and the women are free.

There's a gator in the bushes, he's calling my name,
And a saying come on boy, you better make it back home again.
There's many roads I've traveled but they all kind of look the same.
There's a gator in the bushes, Lord, he calling my name.

Old Richard Betts will tell ya Lord he was born a 'Ramblin' Man.
