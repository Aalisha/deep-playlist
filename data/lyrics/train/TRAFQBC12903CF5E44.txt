One little request changes life for your best interest
No need for self-control while doctors line their pockets

One for your pain and one for your mind
Reliant
You're not addicted
It's fine
One to lose weight and make you look right
One day there'll be one for these lies

Of course feeling numb
Of course feeling numb here
Is habit forming
No matter what's wrong will set you free
Better living through chemistry
Prescriptions for rent if you need relief
Better living through chemistry

Every place I turn my eye
New drug marketing line
The sure for everything is just around the corner
