I have an evil plan to save the world for every man,
And I think it's better than the way it's being run.
Oh the groundwork's laid,
No Don't be afraid,
I'm sure that I can fix it,
When I figure out the physics.

Chorus
My evil plan to save the world,
Just you wait 'till it's unfurled,
It'll go down in history.
