Behold this world that gave birth to you
Its secret nature out of sight
Imprisoned by what we think we know
In life-long dreams we hold for real

Known a drop, unknown an ocean

We, mankind, strangers in our own world
Riding the waves we are

Now it's time to turn the page, we've waited for so long
Waiting for the dawn to come when we control the sun
