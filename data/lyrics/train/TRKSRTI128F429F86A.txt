What i feel is real
what i do is the truth
when i drink i can't think
when i use i need more
when you're weak i can't speak
close your eyes and taste this wine
the cork removed less purified
I throw away everything that you say
erase everything that you think
What i feel it's a sin
tell the truth do not lie
make a wish won't come true
one way streets one track mind
open up and see the light
...
