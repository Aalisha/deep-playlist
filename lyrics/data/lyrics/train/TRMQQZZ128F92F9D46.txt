You move through my body like an ocean
Didn't take you long to get to my heart
I stood on your porch in the commotion
Of the bustling city and it's busy heart
Well i sat in your room and played my six string
Laid back and stared up at your ceiling
Well your hair looked so good over my shoulder
Now we're getting older, time has no hold on me
But she's got
She's got control over me

Tonight has lasted long enough
(The sun is coming)
From dusk 'till dawn we tear it up
(The sun is coming out)
I just want to hear your sounds
(We love like vampires)
