As the sun goes down on the arizona plain
and the wind whistles by like a runaway train
hey hey hey it's a beautiful thing
well it's me and you and a flatbed truck
my heart kicking over like a whitetail buck
hey hey hey in the middle of spring
You can cut me deep
you can cut me down
you can cut me loose
don't you know it's okay
you can kick and scream
you can slap my face
you can set my wheels on a high speed chase
