Moved outside of the circle,
And my mind is tired and my neck's half worn
Someone told me I'm different
As I hold on tight to the things I own
Look what's sewn in my lining
As I let go all of the things I own

Where no flowers die
Where no walls are needed
Where no hurt can grab ya

Immaculate
Grown inside our mind
Affirmations on where we're going
...
