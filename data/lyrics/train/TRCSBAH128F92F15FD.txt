You've seen the way I entertain a crowd.
I use to pack 'em in for miles around.
And I play the happy songs that made 'em smile.
Why'd she want to go and change my style?

Nobody like sad songs, ones about devise,
Songs about broken hearts with tears in your eyes.
Nobody like sad songs - since you went away.
Seems like sad songs are all I can play.

A crowd gets restless, they drift away.
Lately no one wants to hear me play.
I tried to do the songs I use to do
