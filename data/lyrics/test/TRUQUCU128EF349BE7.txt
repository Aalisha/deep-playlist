From Tennessee the shaky town; 
That little boy did good.
He's got his name up in lights; 
He's the top of Hollywood.

You take a boy out of the country; 
And he's a country boy still.
He looks down at the city lights; 
From his Hollywood hills.

He's a Hollywood hillbilly, 
Stearing along bearing willie, johnny cash and lefty; 
Down with a sunset in mind.
No he ain't one to try to hide it; 
He's a southern man with southern pride.
