All the way live from the beginning
Check this, one two
We got the E to the M
Style is called jazz
Try to understand
Teddy Rock
Watch the fire coming out the pen

I don't purport to be something I am not, if you supporting me
But if you taunting me, you're not even in the orbit we
Inhabit, parameters in order, we the static
In your quarters, either that or it's panic, disorderly
Emphatic mode of passion, I storm a beat and never cash in
Treat the microphone accordingly
Waiting is fine, I'm waiting in line delayed I get hot
We came to get live and stay to get high, no way to get stopped
Whip the chord and leave, lashes on your back, in fact, mortally
Wounded mc's will feel the power of authority
And just the thought of me will leave your paralysed with terror
Wear a helmet for protection, the falling beat
Is not an error, we drop it to endeavour
And there's more to me than clever word maneuvering
We do this for the need of those
Who understand but can't afford to read
I give a call to E, let's run it, 'cause we was born to be
