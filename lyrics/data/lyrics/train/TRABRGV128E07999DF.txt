How much hundred seats in parliament
Its so unfair but so clear
Don't none of them represent me
And aint one of them represent my peers
And it don't matter who we vote for, nor who gets in
The poor keep dying and the rich keep living
Mothers keep losing their children to the system
They stay strong while we remain victims
Telling us to hope for higher things
Educate yourself aint that how ya'll say it
But they keep increasing the fee
Knowing full well that we cant pay it
And did you stop and listen before you started dishing
Our tax for ammunition to kill innocent children
When right in front of you we cant cope
We hungry, homeless, unemployed and broke
Were dying, the health service is a joke
