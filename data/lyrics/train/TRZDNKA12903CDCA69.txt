i will never believe
this is all we are meant to be
too many unanswered questions
for a world with all the answers
how can we rely on us
when we don't know
who we are
or why we are here

when you look to the sky
what do you see
does your mind go on
forever or are you lost
in the limitations
of human frailty
the weakness of our eyes
you think you've seen all
...
