I remember that new pair of blue jeans
And man your boots sure did shine
You had on my favorite cologne
I knew what was on your mind

You picked me up in that mustang
You were right on time
Had the radio on it was playing our song
We were leaving the world behind

I wanna remember that lovin' feeling
