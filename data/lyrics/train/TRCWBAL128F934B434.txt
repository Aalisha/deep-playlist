You're too young, you're never gonna know what hit me
When I fell down in silence
No one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward
You'll see it's not just a dream now

You think you know, you don't know You're too young, you're never gonna know what hit me
When I fell down in silence
No one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward
You'll see it's not just a dream now

You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
