Jamaica funk, that's what it is
Let it get into you
C'mon, I've got a groove
You know where I'll be, funkin for jamaica
If ya feel it, let it get into you
Jamaica funk, that's what it is
Baby, let it get into you

Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
Hey man, guitar Brown
Hey man, he is an ordinary guy
Yeah, he is
What's up with that?
What's up with that?
He always says, "Wanna play, you wanna play, you wanna play?"
Hey, what's up? (Play, we could do it)
