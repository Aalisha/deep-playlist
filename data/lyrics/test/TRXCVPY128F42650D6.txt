All of my life
I've been waiting for you
Night after night
I've been praying for you
Now that you're here I believe
You're the one in this world meant for me
The one every dream was about
The one that I can't live without

All of my life I've been waiting for you
All of my love I've been saving for you
Wild and tender to you I surrender my heart
You touch me and time has no meaning at all
The longer I hold you the deeper I fall
I'll cherish the moment I knew
...
