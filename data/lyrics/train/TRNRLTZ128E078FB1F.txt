(Intro)
Ah man, I don't even know how to start this out
Shalstay Radio Station that play our thing from State to State
Coast to Coast, do your thing baby
This is to you
Now the world has been waitin for, (Lost Boyz) Love, Peace & Nappiness?
LB fam baby, see eye to eye
Brooklyn's alive New York C style
NYC, break it down

(Mr. Cheeks)
This one here I don't know where to begin
Dedicated to the ladies and ghetto men
I know we all gots to be side ten of men
Well in the game of life, it's very hard to win
We've been through a lot, I said a lot we've been through
A through versatile style, I'll begin to
Fingers on my peeps cause I feel that's only right
We supposed to beat life, so we don't fight
Jealous motherfuckers always wanna take off
Should be getting fixed but the cops breakin laws
Shy-sty bitch niggaz hits just to score
I'm not down for that, see I'm down to break doors (honey I'm?)
It's for real, express how you feel
