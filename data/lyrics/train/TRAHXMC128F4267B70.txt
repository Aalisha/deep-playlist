United we stand

United we stand

Get some, if you want some
Come and get some
If you want some

Yeah, welcome to "The Lounge"
For jump off
Yours truly, Guru
Shut up, my man!

BT on a track
Playin' like that
Comin' at you with the
New jump off, haha
Check this out

If you want some
This base is freakin' it

Aye yo! I'm ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go
Let my energy flow

Ready to go, ready to go
Ready to go, ready to go
Let my energy flow

Ready to go
Let my energy flow
Steadily bro
Scaring off the enemy, yo

Progression
While I'm releasing aggression
In this rap profession
I keep other cats guessing

International player
Pure poet
More devoted
But more soul than y'all know it

Voted as a spokesman
For people with dream
Feening my team
Out in front leading the scene
...
