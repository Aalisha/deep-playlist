Close your eyes little girl
You're a princess now
You own this world
Twirling in your twirly dress
You're the loveliest, far above the rest
You build your castles in the sky
Stars reflecting off your eyes
And angels sing on silver clouds
And no one cries, screams or shouts

Oh set apart this dream
Oh set apart this dream for me
Set apart this dream... for me
