In the valley tonight lays a coolin' city
Waiting on a setting sun
The midnight moon rising, the night grows cold
We are losing time

We gotta make this a night to remember
We're gonna turn this city inside out

We're gonna run, we're gonna burn the other side of midnight
Racing silver machines
Ladies in waiting, singin' with the radio
...
