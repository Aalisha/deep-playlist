If we don’t… lead them tonight, out of the shadows Jah
Want them to see them have got nothing but Dread
Want them to know that them have nothing at all
So free, so long…they call to me

From the seesaw dread
From the sight of the darkness
From the seesaw dread
From inside of me

New wave upon them. upon he that try
“No bridges for me!” upon he that try
