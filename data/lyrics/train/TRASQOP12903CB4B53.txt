Hey lady, let me kick it to you first
You know I've come to realize
There's more to life than just
A hit and run

And I'm hanging up all that
You know what I'm saying
'Cause you mean more to me
Than anything, anything in this world, check it out

Well, well, well, you know this man can tell
Exactly what you want, baby and how you want it, oh girl
Hey, hey, hey, your love takes me away
I'll be your provider, lady, your lover and fighter, oh girl

No need to conceal what you feel
'Cause I'm the real deal
So don't fight it, can't deny it
Girl, with you I want to chill

I just wanna chill always and forever
No time to kill
So now until always and forever
Ain't no time to kill forever and ever and ever
...
