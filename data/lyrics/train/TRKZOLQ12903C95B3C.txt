You can throw away your expectations now,
And all the things you wouldn't say out loud,
There's nothing left to pick apart now, the cards are all down
And now you know the sound of my heart, when it hits the paper,
There's no more mystery here... this is the last song

I remember when, we first became a band,
We'd drive all night and talk about the world,
I remember when, we used to, now and then,
Just sit and wonder where it all would go

This is the last song,...so everybody sing along,
This is the last song,... (X2)
