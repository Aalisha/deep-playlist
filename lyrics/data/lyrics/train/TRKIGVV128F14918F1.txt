Only child
lonely one
trying to act like his father's son
make him proud through he sometimes fails
locked up, living in a jail
Help me now
Help me now
God I feel misunderstood
Trust me now
Trust me now
Who I am is good.
Who I used to be ain't what I am
if you walked inside my shoes
then you would understand
Who I am - you wonder
Who I am - I wonder
Who I am
just who I am.
