Close to madness, so demanding
I can't breathe anymore
I'll never be the same again

Please forgive me, and forget me
'Cause it's calling my name, I'll never go back again
Back again, back again, back again

Can I find some more misery?
If it can't be you, then it must be me
And can I find some more for me?
I'll never know, I'll never go back again
Back again, back again, back again
