You've grown accustomed to your pain
You've got people that you know you can blame
Your broken heart, it still stings
They've got pills you take for that kind of thing
You like to know what's coming your way
You're lost inside, you're so afraid
yeah yeah yeah yeah
You sit in your room believe in your lies
Who's gonna save you from the world outside
You talk to yourself so you know your alive
