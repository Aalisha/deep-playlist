I stand accused, just like you
For being born without a silver spoon
Stood at the top of the hill over my town
I was found

I've been on the shelf too long
Sitting at home on my bed too long
Got my things and now I'm gone
How's the world gonna take me?

Finding myself used to be hard
But now I see the light
If love is a drug
Then I don't need it
I've been on the shelf too long
Sitting at home on my bed too long
