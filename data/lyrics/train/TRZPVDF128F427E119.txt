Now the end is in sight, I'm just tired
Lying awake at night so wired
And fired up with biological urge in my belly
And I hunt for the words on my telecaster
Spinning faster, goodnight you

You're beautiful, I love to watch your face in the morning light
You're really cool, I like the way we fight right through the night
And the way we used to kiss was way out of sight
But I can never hope to set you free
'Cause you're my bittersweet bundle of misery
...
