Two in a blackened room
my best friend my girl friend in one bedroom.
I found out cause I was bound to.
I can't believe what you did. I trusted you two.
Now I'm just standing here.
I can't help but hear the mess you're into.
My ears burn. My head can't stop.
I'm turning round, round, round ...

"Ut oh," she said "Is he home early?"
"Who what," he said. "Now what was that?"
"Oh no. You better run away.
My boyfriend's back. Your best friend's back."
"Ut oh," she said, "Is he home early?"
"Who what," he said. "Now what was that?"
"Oh no. You better run away.
My boyfriend's back. Your best friend's back."

It feels so good when we know that our love is wrong
or when we try to go where we don't belong.
Give me danger. Give me danger.
Danger ... Danger ... Give me danger.

It feels so good when we know that our love is wrong
...
