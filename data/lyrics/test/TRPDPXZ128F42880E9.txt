I was born on this mountain, a long time ago
Before they knocked down the timber and they strip-mined the coal
When you rose in the mornin', before it was light
To go down in that dark hole, come back up at night
I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
And she holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But I'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home
