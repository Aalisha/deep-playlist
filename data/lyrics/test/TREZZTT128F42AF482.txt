You come creepin in six in the mornin
Like ain't nobody supposed to know (know)
Say you been workin
But get in bed smellin just like a fresh bar of soap (soap)
Ask you about it just turn your back and get mad and then fall asleep (sleep)
Got a lot on your mind and an argument is the last thing you need

Baby you trippin, it don't go that way
This ain't no movie... or a tyler perry play
If you really wanted to mess around that's all you had to say
It ain't gonna be itty bitty silly me so don't waste your energy

Expect me to listen when all i keep hearin is you spittin nothin but game (game)
Expect me to stay when all you can say is one day everything will change
don't wanna leave wanna believe that you won't do me wrong
but you're startin to bore me bore me bore me Yawn
