(By Tracey Bryn, Peter Vettese & Melissa Belland) 

The night's so big I feel like a shadow waiting in the corner 
Nowhere to hide away safe 
Somehow light will always find me 
And tell me how to brave a darkened silence 
Anyday now the clouds will part there will be sun 

In the new day I'll find things aren't so bad at all 
The day will carry me like water in a fall 
The sky is endless and it's just for me to see 
...
