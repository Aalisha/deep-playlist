(Chorus)
Money don? t mean a thing
I? d rather have someone that makes me happy
Know the one, Me, her, love
Holdin each other, watchin the sun come up
And I would give up everything
Just to have a shorty that loves me

But it feels empty (yes it does)
And I can call two or three girls at the same time to make love to me
But I still feel lonely (so lonely)
Now I can go from 0 to 60 in my V-1-2 with the chromed out shoes
