I've been away
I don't get home much these days anymore
And when I do its to
A trace of what it was before

Feel utter emptiness
When there's nothing left inside
I try to tell myself
That I just need a little time
So I'll just close my eyes
And wait until a miracle arrives

Looked at the sun
Only I couldn't see the light at all
...
