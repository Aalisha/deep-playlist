We've been avoiding this for so long
Luxury is temporary than it's gone
I thought that we would happen
I guess I'm wrong
We'll say hi on the street
Then we'll move along
I know this will be awkward
But not for long
'Cause soon you'll have a new boy
To sing you songs

I will not forgive you
Nor will I accept the blame
I will see you on Good Friday
