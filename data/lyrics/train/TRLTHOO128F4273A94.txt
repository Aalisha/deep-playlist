Night people, hanging out
Looking at each other waiting for something to happen
Night people, hanging out
Looking at each other
Waiting for soemthing to happen

While the day world is sleeping
Night people are creeping, hanging out
Looking at each other
When the day world stops moving
Night people start grooving, hanging out
Looking at each other
When the day bees stop buzzing
Night people start coming, hanging out
Waiting for something to happen
Night people, hanging out
Looking at each other
Waiting for something to happen
