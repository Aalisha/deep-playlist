Spread your love and fly, fly...

All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long Ive loved you
Everywhere I go people stop and they see
Twenty-five years old, my mother, God rest her soul
(lord, have mercy)

I just wanna fly
(uh, where you, uh, where you want)
Put your arms around me, baby
Put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
(where you want, where you try, uh, where you want)
Put your arms around me, baby...
(i, i, I w... w...would tell her, here, well
Spread your love and fly, oh, me, oh, my
Spread your love and fly, oh, me for i
Spread your love and fly, fly)

Dance a little stranger
Show me where you've been (say what? )
Love can make you hostage
Wanna do it again (word)
...
