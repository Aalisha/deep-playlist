Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' 44 beneath my head

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
took the shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico

Late in the hot joints takin' the pills
in walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down

Said yes oh yes my name is Willy Lee
