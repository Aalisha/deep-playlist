Hold fast, motor off
Come strong, let it roll
Ice cold desert stone
She build a quick train
Seems to keep her motor clean
Saw the visions and a wet machine
She's always quick to fight
We're breaking through tonight

I could feel it when you push straight down
I could feel it when they stood their ground

Roll over, right
Keep it through the night, right, right
Keep it through the night
Right in my sight, keep it through the night
