I am the tempter
Ruler of hell
Bringer of evil
Beware

Watch for temptation for it is there
Takes his time but loves to dare
All the people they are losing their minds
He don't care, takes all kinds
Says love won't you take a bite
God appears says "this ain't right"
We are damned for what evil has done
