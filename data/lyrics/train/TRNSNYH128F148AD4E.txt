Boy, i tried to write a letter
i just need to make things better
and i'm praying that you'll let me work this out
i tried to call you on your phone
and it seems you're not at home
this is something that we have to talk about
here i am finally face to face
here's what i'm trying to say
What was i thinking baby?
i should've seen the writing on the wall
never thought you'd ever leave me
now i know
what were you trying to tell me?
i thought about everything you said
ever since you walked away boy
now i know
