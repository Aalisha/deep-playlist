I send this out to you
because I care about ya, baby
Nothing left to do
No reason to doubt ya
Cause your always on my mind

Sugar plum, honey dew
I love you
Baby you my
Sugar plum, honey dew
I love you
Girl I think I love you

Yes you are my daily bread
I'm giving you everything

Yes you are my daily bread
...
