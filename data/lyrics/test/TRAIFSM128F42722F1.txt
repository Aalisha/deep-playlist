Feels like I'm going through the motions in the dark
in a worls that leaves me with an uninspired heart

All I know, is I'm so tired
living life a barely feel
give me hope, give me fire
gimme something real

'Cause I don't wanna keep sleep-walking through
endless days, I've had enough of
going nowhere, God I want to
wake up! wake up!
wake up!

It's now or never come and pull me from this dream
where everything is colorless and nothing is what it seems
