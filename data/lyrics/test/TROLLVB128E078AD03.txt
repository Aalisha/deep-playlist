You like to buy, and buy the best
Its not been that long since you were penniless
So you flaunt your success
You spend on yourself and you spend on finesse
And the ones who felt your wrath, need constant reminders your not going back

You invest in the profane
Your license plate reads like a mundane campaign
and you collect and obtain, your porcelain figures are rare and hand-made
