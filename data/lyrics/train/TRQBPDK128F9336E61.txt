Ridin' high on an angel's wings
And the devil sings inside my head (ohh-oh ohh-oh)
All alone on a Friday night
With an empty bottle by my side (ohh-oh ohh-oh)

And now I'm lookin' for the reasons why I'm alive
And now I've finally come to realize

I can't erase this feelin'
I can't escape
And now I'm lying on the floor
And I really need to find the answers
Lying on the floor
'Cause I've given every piece of me
And I'm breathing

Now the lights are flashing
And I'm crashing to the other side (ohh-oh ohh-oh)
Need another time around
Get me off the ground
