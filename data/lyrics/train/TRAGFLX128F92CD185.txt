I'm leaving loves behind
While finding time to rhyme
Mistakes with what's at stake
No, that's just too contrived

Can I get a little taste of your lips so I feel alive?
Can you offer up the same uncertainty that I define?
Are you up for keeping in touch once a month or twice a year?
Can you handle regret and a lack of will to persevere?
This apathy will haunt me over and over and overâ€¦

So when will I wake up?
Please pinch me I don't feel a thing
I've got a hand of wish and one of chance
Don't bother, it's enough to get me through it
I close my eyes and roll a set of loaded dice, I'm sure
...
