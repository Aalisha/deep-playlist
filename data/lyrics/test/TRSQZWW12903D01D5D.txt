saying goodbye is saying 'die'
will you ever remember, awakening or slumber?
i won't ask you to fly so high
but help me to lift that weight i'm feeling deep inside

and this place that's so familiar
will stay our temple forever
we'll see the light brighter than ever

whether you choose to stay
or choose to run away
your life is ours and there is no other way
and if one day i chose to run away
we'll be together when we remember that day
...
