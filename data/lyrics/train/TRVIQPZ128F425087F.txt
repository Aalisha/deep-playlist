Cocaine and innocence
And Romeo's waiting
Candies and sugar daddies
They never stop wasting your time
Time to dance to the top
With champagne indifference
And I sit salivating
If I could touch you there
Would you be liberated?
Ah yeah

I don't wanna be
Another enemy
Even though you make be bleed
Like a Kennedy

Not when my body's so exciting
Sometimes you make me
So frustrated
How come it's me I end up hating?
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting
Romeo's waiting
And he don't wanna lose tonight

Blood on the dance floor
And Romeo's fainting
Showing pink and leather tonight
...
