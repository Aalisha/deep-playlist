As I read through the list.
It made it seem easier to make the choices.
Choices made to stay half-way sane. 
But when I walked through the room, I must have been lazier, 
Because I gave up looking and sat down again. 

Maybe I was caught up in the dance or in the drink. 
But get this through your skull - don't get caught up in me. 
And you'll get another chance or another breath, but get this through your 
Skull - you've never met me. 
Come on. Let's go. 
You don't want to know what I know.
If you make it home alright, your luck runs out the next night. 
Come on. Let's go. 
Here's hoping for a bright tomorrow.
