To be named, we've come to the flames, 
To seek a judgment, to tell a fortune
It's hard to change, you cannot get away, 
The further you run the quicker it finds you
Seeds in seeds to be, the past is now and the future's gone, 
Still trying to figure out what went wrong
A ritual to be burned by flames, 
A plea for peace and a prophecy to fulfill
We build our lives upon a legacy of lies, 
The past is now and the future's gone
...
