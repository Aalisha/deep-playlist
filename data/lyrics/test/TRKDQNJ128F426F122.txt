I'm not your stepping stone, no
I'm not your stepping stone

Here you're trying to make your mark on society
Using all the tricks that you used on me
You're reading all those high fashion magazines
The clothes you're wearin' lady causing public scenes

I said, "I'm not your stepping stone, no"
No, I'm not your stepping stone, no
Not your stepping stone, not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone, not your stepping stone, no
