Now we'll move on with our lives
And try to make this right
To learn from past mistakes we made before
If you want, I'll leave you be to figure out yourself
Before you figure out what's defeating me
There's no one left to turn to,
Another time we'll try to forget who tried
And now we'll move on with our lives
...
