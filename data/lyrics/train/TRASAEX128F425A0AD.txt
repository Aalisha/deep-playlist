Too much information
Well I said you can fall off it
Come on to the back
I said your needles count for something
Guess I'd better sell you now
Guess I'd be around

Singing for your questions
But you've stolen all of my answers
Too much entertainment drove
and thats not all the colour
Tell me that you've seen a ghost
