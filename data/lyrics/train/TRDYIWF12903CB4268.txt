He had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious

(So tough)
You can't take anymore now you're getting weak
(So tough)
Don't start playing hide and seek

(So hard)
Why do you think he got like that?
(So hard)
Don't think about it much 'cause it's just a rut

You had fun on experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious

(So strong)
They say you're acting like a star
(So strong)
