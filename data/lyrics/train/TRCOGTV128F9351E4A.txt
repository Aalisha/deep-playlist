Can you tell me how you feel
When you turn on your tv
When you see me singing through my tears
I've saved up all these years
Can you tell me what you see
When you read the magazines
Do you see yourself in me
When you read the magazines
When the DJ plays this song
Can you tell me what you hear

And I hope you feel the way we felt
When you put us all through hell
Can you tell me how you feel now
How do you feel, how do you feel
Tell me how you sleep at night
Do you take those pills like me
Or do you toss and turn
And lay your head on the pillow and fall asleep
Cause you just don't care,
How do you feel
...
