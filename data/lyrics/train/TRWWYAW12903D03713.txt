Hello
Hollow halo
Hello
(Can you hear them say?)
Hollow halo
(Can you hear them calling?)

You'll never
You'll never leave this world alone
You'll never
You'll never leave this world alone, if I
Become a martyr to the stars
Become a model to the same
Side that I've been fighting, I'm
Still afraid to crawl
(No more pointing fingers at mistakes and I'm)
And though I know I'm not the same
(Here in a reflection)
I'm still afraid to watch

How do you suppose?
We can lock the way to get us home
What you thought was lost, now found within
Feel this way there

No more pointing fingers at mistakes, and I'm
Here in a reflection

What a way to see this thing out
What a way to lay this burden down
What a way to see this sorrow
What a way to see this one out

Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo
Hello, hollow halo
