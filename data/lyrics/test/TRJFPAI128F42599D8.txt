When routine bites hard and ambitions are low

And resentment rides high
but emotions won't grow

And we're changing our ways taking different roads.
And love
love will tear us apart again.
And love
love will tear us apart again.
Why is the bedroom so cold
turn away on your side.
Is my timing at fault and respect run so dry
...
