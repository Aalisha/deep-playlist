When you said you'd be mine, girl
Did you mean it for all time
Or will my love be a memory
If you ever leave me lonely
Don't know just where I'd go
'Cause you got all I want
And I'll ever need

Don't wanna lose you (Don't wanna lose)
No, you can't say good-bye to our love
Don't wanna lose you (Don't wanna lose)
You got a fire burning my soul
Don't wanna lose your love

Now you showed me love can be, yes,
More than pain and misery
That I felt before you
