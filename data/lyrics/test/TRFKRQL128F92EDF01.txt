Tears for souvenirs
Tears are not enough
Tears for shields and spears
Tears are not enough

Searching for certainty
When it's such an unstable world
Searching for something good
And I'm looking for the real McCoy

Blueprint, that says that boy meets girl
Picture, girl meets boy
A blueprint that says that the boy meets the girl
Picture in a magazine

Yes you've shown your feelings
Yes you've shown you're tough
Said things worth believing
Tears are not enough
Tears are not enough
Tears are not enough

Yes you've shown your feelings
...
