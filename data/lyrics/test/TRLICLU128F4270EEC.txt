can someone tell me what i'm seeing it's something lost
but still I'm reaching there's nothing left that could
keep me hanging on
(the only thing I miss is myself, the only thing i miss is myself)
- as the pendulum is swinging, from side to side i often wonder
why that the things that mean the most to me, can never be,
i cut my losses and move forward
- can someone tell me what I'm
seeing it's something lost but still i'm
reaching, there's nothing left that could keep me hanging on
