It's got me going insane, I think it's happening again
I think there's gonna be some action
Cos it's got me going insane

You got me where you want me
Sit down and talk to me
Well I just hope you're happy
With your snake skin, dead bodies, evening all

Just go go back to your bright lights
You made promises you couldn't keep
Sicking up rag doll more than you know
Just keep your mouth shut you got no mind to blow
You celebrate things, you celebrate things
Forget about me and just desecrate everything
