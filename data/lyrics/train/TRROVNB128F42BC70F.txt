It felt so easy in the morning sun 
When love was in season I was on the run 
I was lookin' for trouble and the thrill of the chase 
Love was lookin' at me eye to eye, face to face

Love was always a long shot to a gambling man 
With a roll of the dice, girl I threw it away 
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you day and night, night and day 

Didn't Know It Was Love 
Didn't know it was fate 
Didn't know it was destiny callin' 
Tell me it's never too late 
Was I too blind to see 
When push came to shove
