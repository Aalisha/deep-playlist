Explain this false reality
This myth of non-conformity
'Cause you all look the same to me
Fuck your elitist mentality

Set the standards, make the rules
The rest of us are fucking fools
Judged by the way you look, that's so lame

Fuck your fashion statement game
Fuck your fashion statement game
Fuck your fashion statement game
