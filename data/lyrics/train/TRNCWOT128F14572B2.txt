One look and I saw what I wanted to see
You know that you wrapped my heart
Around your finger so easily, yeah

With your centerfold body going through the moves
Why did I keep wasting the truth for you tonight

'Cause I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin'
'Cause those days are gone, gone

Yeah, you gave it to me good
