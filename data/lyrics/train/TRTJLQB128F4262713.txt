I can't imagine living one day without you
I'd rather just lay down and just die
'Cause all I care about is what I mean to you
Sweet baby, knowing you is heaven
I'll always want you in my life

I can't explain, I can't explain the way I feel
You are the rhythm of my heart
And every beat you give is just how I make do
Swear girl, nothing else could matter
Just stay here in my heart

And I'll always love you deep in my heart
Always love you, always love you
And I'll always love you deep in my heart
Always love you, always love you

It's not a feeling in this world that can describe
All of the joy you bring to me
...
