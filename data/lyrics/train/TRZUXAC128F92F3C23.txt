It’s an uphill climb, but it’s all you know
So you spin your wheels and dig your heels and down you go
So predictable but it’s not your fault

‘Cause it’s okay now, hey now, you can let go
It’s when you find out, find out, everybody knows
There just ain’t no, ain’t no easy way out
I know it might not look that way
But you’re gonna live to fight another day

There’s a place I know, outside of town
