It's the nothing that I know that makes me feel more comfortable
To be different, rather than useful
And this nothing that I know it makes me feel more comfortable
when I'm distant rather than crucial

And every voice I've ever heard
Has never made much sense
They never make much sense to me (and what if...)

Years will make you see things in the distance
How'd you see things in the distance? (and what if...)
Years will make you see things in the distance
How will I see things in the distance?

The more nothing that I know, it makes me feel more important
Or maybe just more intelligent than I first thought
...
