Romeo, Romeo
Waiting all the day by the telephone
I don't know, I don't know
Should I hang around or should I go?

Romeo, Romeo
Remember all the things that you told me although
How did it go? How did it go?
Waiting all the day by the telephone

Waiting all the day just feel it let down, let down...
What goes around, comes around, comes around.
