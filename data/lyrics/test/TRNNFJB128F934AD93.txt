I heard it... in my sleep last night
I heard it... in your sleep last night
Now I can hear it again, outside the night is sad
I know it's not the wind, outside the night is black

Under our window is the Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune
Under our window is the Banshee
Wailing its haunted tune too soon

I know that, I must tell you a lie
I know that, it could be you and not I
Before the sun is rising, the Banshee cannot stay
...
