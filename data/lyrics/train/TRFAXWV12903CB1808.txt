One more astronaut in black skin of universe
One more travellin' man
With heavy tired eyes, feeling cold
Feeling cold

Thinking around the clock of drinking on the job
Of the powdered food and piss bags
Never having sex and growing old
Growing old

Head space, alive and painless
Weightless and almost sane
I close my eyes, I become the sky

Head space, alone and shameless
Can't wait to find the faces
I left behind in a troubled time

Back home
Back home
Back home
Back home
