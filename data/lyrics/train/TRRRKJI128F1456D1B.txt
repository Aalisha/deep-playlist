we ain't got no place to go
so let's go to the punk rock show
darling take me by the hand
we're gonna see a punk rawk band
there's no use in tv shows
radio or rodeos
I wanna get into the crowd
I wanna hear it played real loud

we ain't got no place to go
so let's go to the punk rock show
darling take me by the hand
we're gonna see a punk rawk band
there's no use in tv shows
radio or rodeos
I wanna get into the crowd
I wanna hear it played real loud
yeaah! yeaaah! yeaaah!


ain't go no money to pay
