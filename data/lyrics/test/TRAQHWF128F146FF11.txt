Ugly apparition, God's gift to oxygen
The puffed up immortal son
How they love him 'cause he'll become
The ghost at number one

How does it feel
To be the only one?
How does it feel
To be the only one that knows that you're right?

How does it feel
To be a loaded gun?
How does it feel
Inside a chamber packed with piss and spite?

Sure life's no cherry but a cupcake for the meek
So he shoots up his poison
Until the frosting tastes so sweet
(Like the Valentine)

Yeah, he's givin' it all he's got
...
