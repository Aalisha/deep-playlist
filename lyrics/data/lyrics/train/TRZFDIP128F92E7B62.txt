If you've never heard before
There was once a time when only god had fire
The moon and stars and nothing more
To lead you through the night

If there's a hell and Satan had a daughter
He must have sent her here to hide the flame
We're still afraid, must be he taught her so well
We've seen the light so why's it all the same

Superstition go away
We wear the mark
