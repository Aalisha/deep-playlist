I'm sick of working for a living
I'm just ticking off the days till I die
Oh, I miss you Louise, yeah
And the sickest little pleasures keep me going in between pulling teeth

Oh, periscope up
I've been looking for a ladder
I need to see the Commander In Chief, ooh
And remind him what was passed on to me, oh

Your mum don't sleep, oh
And the friends you keep
I didn't raise a thief
I didn't raise a thief

But the leaders of the free world
Are just little boys throwing stones
And it's easy to ignore
Till they're knocking on the door of your homes, yeah
