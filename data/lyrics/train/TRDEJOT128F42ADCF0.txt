Come and bow right now at the feet of Jesus.
Come, throw your crowns, at the feet of Jesus...

In strength and weakness, I trust in You.
In joy and suffering, I delight in You.

Nothing can separate me from Your love.
For your love is faithful throughout eternity!

You are the God of my life!
And my song, forever.
You are the God of my life!
And my song, forever.
You are the God of my life!
And my song, forever.
God of my life...

Come and be filled with life at the feet of Jesus.
Leave all cares behind at the feet of Jesus...
