You came into my life, you took me off the shelf
You told my name to me and taught me what to do.
But then you went away and left me by myself,
I feel completely lost and lonely without you.

Why'd you go, baby? I guess you know,
I've got to learn to live without you.
I've got to learn to live without you.
I've got to learn to live without you, without you.
