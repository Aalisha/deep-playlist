The sun is bleeding through the blinds
We murdered yet another night
I close my eyes and swallow pain
My body aches like Saturday
I’m one to watch and you're one to say
I never really cared

And I’m not coming home
Tonight so don’t wait up
'cause I bet it never gets this cold in California

My eyes are sensitive to sight,
And my skin burns under the light.
I shut my eyes and sound the end
...
