She said "I've been the stockyard's pony"
She said "I've been the mountain engine's roll
From Chicago to West Virginia,
I've been as lonesome as the world's first ghost
As lonesome as the world's first ghost

But out here even the prairie doubts the horizon
All I have to do is prove that I'm not pure
Oh, the right words come,
But I ain't talking
The devil's mean but he's honest just as sure
Oh, he is honest just as sure"
