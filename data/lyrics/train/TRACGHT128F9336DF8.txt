Sometimes I catch myself staring
When you don't know I'm looking.
Still can't believe how lucky I got.
Everywhere I look I see a lot
Of the same ole same thing
Baby you were different from the start.
I thank God each day that
I get to hold an original.

Baby you're like nothing else,
The closer I get
The more I can tell.
I can look on my life
And never find a woman like you.
Your smile, your eyes,
Your touch, your kiss,
...
