something is dying tonight.
there will be no more breath and no more light
I've burned every candle and extinguished every fear
and I've waited for your time to pass
to bring in my new year

something is dying tonight
there will be no more struggle
no more fight
and I've known that I'd have to live through suffering and
youth but I'm the landlord of my dreams now and
my tenets rent is due.

something is dying
something is dying inside of me
in spite of me
something is dying tonight
my old paddles off to Saturn
...
