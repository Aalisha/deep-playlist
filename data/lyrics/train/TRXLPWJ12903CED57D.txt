It's just before midnight
And a long line of clubbers waits patiently outside
Someone is yelling
Someting like
"Strike up the tune"

So you think you've seen and heard it all
But I'm a skitzo escaped from the hospital
I'm a club vandal, a renegade
"Who am I?" you ask but don't really care
I just came here to put my mind at ease
'Cause music is better than poppin' pills
Skitzo Dancer
Skitzo Dancer
Skitzo Dancer
Skitzo
