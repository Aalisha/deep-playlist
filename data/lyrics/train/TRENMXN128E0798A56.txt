I see the things you do
Do you think I wander through, half-blind?
I see the things you hide
The fear you have inside's nothing new

But I would never wanna find out
Everything about you
'Cause I would never wanna find out
What I thought wasn? t true

Your mind is a place I don? t need to embrace
What you? ve got in your heart is enough for me to start
Breaking through and closer to you, closer to you

I love you as you are
