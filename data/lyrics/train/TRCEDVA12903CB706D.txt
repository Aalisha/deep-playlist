I, I knew a boy, he came from the sea
He was the only boy who ever knew the truth about me
I'm overwhelmed and undersexed, baby, what did you expect?
I'm over wrought and so disgraced, I'm too ashamed to show my face

And they're coming to take me away now
And what I want I will never have
I'm on the Pacific Coast Highway
Go with your gun in my hands

Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands
Your whole world is in my hands
Your whole wide world is in my hands

I knew a boy, he left me so damaged
Do you even know the extent of what you ravaged?
