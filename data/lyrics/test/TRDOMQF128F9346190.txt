I'm so sacred
There's no need to live in fear
Cause we're never far from what we know
We're never far from what we know
There's no need to live in fear
Cause we're never far from what we know
We're never far from what we know

Tonight the trees are alive
But I'm just trying to survive
But I can feel them creeping up on me
