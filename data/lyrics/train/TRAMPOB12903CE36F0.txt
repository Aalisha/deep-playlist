One Saturday I took a walk to Zipperhead
I met a girl there and she almost knocked me dead
Punk rock girl, please look at me
Punk rock girl, what do you see?
Let's travel round the world
Just you and me punk rock girl

I tapped her on the shoulder
And said do you have a beau?
She looked at me and smiled and said she did not know
Punk rock girl, give me a chance
Punk rock girl, let's go slamdance
We'll dress like Minnie Pearl
Just you and me punk rock girl

We went to the Phillie Pizza Company
