Party time
Okay, party people in the house

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

I was at this club, this place called Roy's
I snuck in past my curfew trying hang with the big boys
There were hands swingin', people singin' and others on the wall
Disco lights blinkin' and people big and small

Security finally caught me, talkin' 'bout "Son you're kinda young"
I said, "Beat this Mr. Officer I'm just trying to have some fun"
Now on my way out, this girl said, "Whuddup shorty?"
I broke away from the officer and then said, "Girl, it's time to party"
You know

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

Next I went to a club to see what he said I was missin'
