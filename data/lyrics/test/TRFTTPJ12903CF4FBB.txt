And fare-thee-well, to Ireland, the land of my native home
It breaks my heart for to see friends part, for then the teardrops fall
I'm on my way to Amerikay, 
will I ever see home once more
For I'm leaving behind the one I love 
on Paddy's green shamrock shore.

The ship she lies in anchor, standing by the quay
May fortune bright shine down each night, as we sail out over the sea
...
