If i could
Only have my wish come true
Someday, somehow
Take me back to where we used to be
If i could
Only live the past just one more time
Somehow
Truly i will do it over, over again

* just a thought of u
Can take me back to dream
Dreams shared by two
Sweet sweet memories together
Just a thought of u
Can make my night dream
Precious time we spent long long time ago together

North wind comes blowing thru my empty heart
...
