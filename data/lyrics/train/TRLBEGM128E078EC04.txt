I can't begin to tell you
How bad I feel about it
So now that it is all out
How do you feel - did you profit

Why can't you keep a secret
Why'd you squeal
I thought that I could trust you
Why'd you squeal

I thought we had agreed
That we were in this together
But now that you have betrayed me
I got no other option

Why can't you keep a secret
Why'd you squeal
...
