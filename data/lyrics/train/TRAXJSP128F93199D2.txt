I said I'm sorry baby I'm leaving you tonight
I found someone new he's waitin' in the car outside
Ah honey how could you do it
We swore each other everlasting love
I said yeah I know but when
We did - there was one thing we weren't
Thinking of and that's money -

Money changes everything
I said money, money changes everything
We think we know what we're doing
That don't mean a thing
It's all in the past now
Money changes everything
