What have we done?
Never thought that life would come to this
Eternal sense of self hatred
Blame not who, but ask us why we did

This is an open book of failure
Deceive ourselves all the we can, so we can be

Cycle of life disrupted
Halted by a force too close to home
Guilt runs through our blood
Close your eyes and let yourself forget
...
