By Dave Fenton
I've seen it before
I know the score
You're trying to be wild and carefree
You really can't take it no more
I'm trying to think
I can't think clear
Everybody's talking to me
It's gone foggy in here
But as time goes marching home again
It leaves me to reflect
Or was this just a waste of time
Or was this time well spent
And if it marches back again
And orders me to smile
Then will I be prepared
Or will it take a little while
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now
I'll make it up to you somehow
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me now
