We should go to sleep now, You should stay the night
I'll be up to watch the world around us live and die
Lying on the grass now, dancing for the stars
Maybe one will look on down and tell us who we are
We might fall, we might fall, we might fall, Hallie we might fall
We might fall, we might fall, we might fall, Hallie we might fall
I could join the circus, and you could sell your hair
