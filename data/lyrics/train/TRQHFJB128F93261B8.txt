superman inside my brain
hit me like a rumblin' train
this crucifixion sets me free
mind-addiction pulling me
into a void so cold and real
hammers like a ton of steel
expansion lies beyond decay
push all the limits until they crumble

no one can find me here
i'm on fire blazin' fierce
yeah the end is oh so near
no you can touch me here
i'm a fire blazin' fierce
everything down in here is getting all so clear

birth of a man first flower shines
watch them breed and come alive
the unborn self so rarely seen
hallucination eating me
these thoughts my soul try to conceal
just hammer on 'til i reveal
all the secrets that pave the way
push all the limits until they crumble
...
