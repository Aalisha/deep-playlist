I fight for what is mine no control is what I fear
My beliefs I will not change this voice you will hear
This is my life wont change for anyone
No need for explanations your questions ignored
Talk all you want till your blue in the face
Your useless words mean nothing here
You think you got something to say
Well ignorance is bliss

Save your breathe you've crossed that line
Save your breathe you cant take what's mine
