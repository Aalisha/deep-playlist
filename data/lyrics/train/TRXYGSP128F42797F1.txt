Flame fame flame fame flame fame flame
Supermodel sandwich can I join your game?
Flame fame flame fame flame fame flame
Supermodel sandwich would you let me hang?

You're so fine what's your solar sign?
Yield the right of way she said without delay
She said stop your advance
'Cause you don't stand a chance boy
If you're not a girl I'll never let you touch my pearl

Flame fame flame fame flame fame flame
