Waking up without you
It doesn't feel right
To sleep with only memories
It's harder every night
Sometimes I think I can feel you breathing on my neck

Tonight I'm reaching out to the stars
I think that He owes me a favor
It doesn't matter where you are
I'll hold you again

I wish I could hear your voice
Don't leave me alone in this bed
I wish I could touch you once more
Don't leave me alone in this bed

Not tonight
