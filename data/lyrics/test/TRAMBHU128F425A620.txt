I go to work in my clean shirt
I push a pen until half past ten
I watch the clock there on the wall
Tic toc, why don't you call
The boss comes in and walks down the aisles
He turns around but he never smiles
He watches me just like a hawk
And then he says we must talk

You move me, from side to side
You move me and it feels so right
You move me up and down
You move me around and around
