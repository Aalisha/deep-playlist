I don't know where I'm goin', my horizon is prone
Got nothin' in my eyes and I got an achin' in my bones
Tryin' keep movin', don't know what else to do
Gotta keep walkin', gotta walk on through

I've been movin' in circles, been around many times
I never see the light, I'm a sleep walkin', baby, all the time

I got taken away when the sun went down
