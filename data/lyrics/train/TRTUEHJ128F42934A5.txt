Shut down, boom town, lowdown downtown
Streets go prepare for war
When the law come over, man they run for cover
Opportunity shut the door
When the guns are blazing in the streets of Mogadishu
Baghdad back to Bahru
And I wear my opinion on a dusted white suit
Every time I hear the firearms shoot

No control, street curfew now in play
Violence sustained
Civil liberty's now destroyed
Cursed intimidation brought on by force
...
