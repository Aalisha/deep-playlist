You thought you found the answer on that magic carpet ride last night,
But, when you wake up in the morning, the world still gets you uptight,
Well, there's nothing that you ain't tried
To fill the emptiness inside,
But, when you come back down, you still ain't feeling right.

It seems like kicks just keep getting harder to find,
All your kicks ain't bringing you peace of mind,
Before you find out it's too late,
You'd better get straight,
But, not with kicks, you just need help now.

You think you're gonna find yourself a little piece of paradise,
But, it ain't happened yet, so now you'd better think twice,
Don't you see, no matter what you do,
You'll never run away from you
If you keep on running, you'll have to pay the price.
