Sun's ultraviolet beacon
Leaves of chlorophyll so green
Stone stands its silent vigil
Seas of knowledge lay in waste

Nirvana landscapes seethe with anger
Sadistic poison fills the soil

The evil chariot, the swinging mace of hatred
Pounds the Earth to crush the weak of heart
The choking wind gags on the noxious gasses
...
