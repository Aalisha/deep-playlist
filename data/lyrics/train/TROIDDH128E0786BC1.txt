There was a time
Everybody was around
And I was dancing with you

We all went down
To the party Friday night
And had a drink there or two

Oh what a heap
Of a love and heartbeat
It's electricity

Majestic sound
Round and round and round
Glad you're next to me

Feel my heartbeat
Drumming to the beat
Love the symphony

Feel my heartbeat
Drumming to the beat
Love the melody
Come see

Feel my heartbeat
Drumming to the beat
Love the symphony

Feel my heartbeat
...
