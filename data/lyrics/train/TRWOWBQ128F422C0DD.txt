We'll keep on talking this out
But I've already made up your mind
I've been trying to gnaw through my tongue
To stop from confessing my crimes
And this conversation is wearing me down
What did my patience prove
If it's just another bed of nails
Always the silent treatment
Always the easy way of live

If there's no further questions
I'll be on my way back home.

And it's just another sharp pain
And it doesn't hurt like it used to
When I was a desperate man
When I still believed in the meaning of the word

You tried to warn me
You and your consequences
If I am outnumbered
