So should I try and repair the ruined?
Our makeshift ways now run too deep?
And with our tongues twist-tied
These false conclusions
Are hanging on every word that we say

Trust me to feed you lies like you want me to
Trust me to close my eyes and pretend you
Never looked at me straight
Trust me... 

Low am I?
To share this proven?
Makeshift way to let things be
Well, I'll offer up just one solution
Let your guard down
Become irate
