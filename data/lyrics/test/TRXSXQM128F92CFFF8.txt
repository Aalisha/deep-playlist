Better get another coal on the fake fire
Cover on the wet tiles, on the wet tiles

Better run it out of town
That thought will cost you more
Than just a sweet smile, to a sweet smile

And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better

And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better
