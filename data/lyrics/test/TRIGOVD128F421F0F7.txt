Will I die by the sun
and for ever lose my one
in this dark
all hope has gone
will you fly here by night
and set me alight
in this dark
where all hope has gone

In oldest of old
spire of stone
in aeons unknown
away from her home
highest of high
was price for the life
in endless imprisonment
forlorn and alive

A wish for salvation
now all that remains
but walls of her chamber
still echo the dreams

Will I die by the sun
...
