Take off your hat, kick off your shoes.
You know you ain't goin' anywhere.
Spend all your time singin' your blues.

And the only time that you're satisfied,
is with your feet in the wishing well.
In the wishing well.
Hah.

Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself.
Or is that what you're tryin' to do?
