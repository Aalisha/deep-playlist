Ho la da da da

There are no words,
To paint a picture of you, girl.
Your eyes and those curves,
It's like you're from some other world.
You walk my way,
Oh, God, it's so frustrating.

So why do I disappear
When you come near?

It makes me feel so small.
Why do I blow my lines
Most every time
Like I've got no chance at all?

If I could be your superman,
I'd fly you to the stars,

And back again.
