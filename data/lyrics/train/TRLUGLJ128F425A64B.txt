The beauty that you gave
Has turned upon itself
And all the things you said
Evaporated, evaporated

Was I blind
Deaf and dumb
To the words slipped
From your tongue?

Honestly
 (Alone in my bed)
Honestly
 (The things that you said)
Honestly
 (Go round in my head still)

Honestly
 (It seems to be true)
Honestly
 (That nothin' I do)
Honestly
 (Can influence you)

 (I tried and tried again)
Don't you know I tried and tried again
To make you listen to me
But everything I said it always seemed to go right through you
 (To make you notice me)
I turned myself into a person that I didn't like
But please believe me when I say, "I know it wasn't right"

 (But talking to myself)
I never thought that things would get to be so complicated
I never thought that you and me would end up so frustrated
 (Won't catch you attention I see)
You'd think that something had to come from all those good intentions
But in the end I needed something more than intervention
