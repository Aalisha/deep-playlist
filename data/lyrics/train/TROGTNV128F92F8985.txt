I've got a hard road to travel
And a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel And a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back,
My heart is fixed
My mind's made up,
I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through

Let me tell you
I'm all alone,
This lonesome road I roam
I've got no love to call my very own
Oh the river gets deeper,
The hills get steeper
And the pain gets deeper
Every day, yeah
...
