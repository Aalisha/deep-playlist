Come to me now
I wanna be your best friend for all of time
I wanna be the tissue for your tears
I never wanna be alone

I never, never, never, really thought that I could feel
A feeling that awakened me so
I was astray of knowing where I belong
Living out of time, living out of time

Oh, now that you've come and set me free
Now that I know what love can be
