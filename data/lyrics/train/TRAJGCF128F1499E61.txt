Drunk and . . .
Took a hit down by the train track
I hear the whistle's song
As . . .
We made a big dash
Really packed a killer

A change of time
Packed up and left
Goodbye the train track
You're lucky if I do
We'll go west
And get some big cash
We're lookin' back to see the way

Just keep a movin'
...
