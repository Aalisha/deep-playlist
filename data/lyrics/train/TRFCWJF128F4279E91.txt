SHE LOVES THE WAY THEY LOVE HER
Argent-White

She stands by the lights at the front of the audience
Smile on her face just taking in their every glance.

She loves the way they love her
She loves the way they love her
And she smiles
She loves every sweet talking lie.

A smooth talking baby, there's the man from the management
He trips on the wire as he's paying her a compliment.
