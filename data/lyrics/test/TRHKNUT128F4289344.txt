Yeah, what's up girl
Both of us tryin' to hit the spot
Shit, we both can do it
Where I come from
Uh huh, uh huh niggaz be hustles
Niggaz put it down
It's purse first ass last

Let's get this money baby
Girl tell me now is you with me
As long as you pay me
We split the profits fifty, fifty
I call you my lady
If you surrender then I'm your nigga
Become of member
Of what I call my money getters
Now, ain't no bullshitters ever made it far in life
Only the hard hitters get foriegn cars and all the ice
Turn off the light
Let me show you what this nigga 'bout
You lookin' right
But my money still I gotta count
It ain't no love lost
Baby girl my love cost
Let me get that out ya
You know this nigga love to floss
Both of us can ball bitch
Soon you'll have of this
I know you know the rules
I get paid that mean we all rich
Ten niggaz want pussy
That mean you let 'em all hit
Make my money, make it quick
Then you better call me bitch
look toward the future
Forget about the past
Better act like ya know
It's purse first and ass last

(Hook)
Bitch it's purse first and ass last
Now how you livin' ho
We both can get this damn cash
I know ya heard me bitch
It's purse first and ass last
