floating away within dreams
from a thousand worlds,
my sould has left the spheres of man
for all time...
the rest of me
the rotten limbs and my bones
dwelling within
the sacred gardens of greif
while my mind is adrift
upon the seas of starvation
a tombstone is raised to mark
I am not forgotten
I remember faintly,
...
