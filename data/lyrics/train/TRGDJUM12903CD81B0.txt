It's been a while since I've seen you smile
Been a minute since I've been up in it but who could say the sky's the limit?
I seen a pretty bad woman, made me stop and pivot
Body, hair, face, nails lookin' so exquisite

Now what is it that a pimp who never simp'd
Can keep tip to the game, know when to jump ship
Now you can find me in the wind, blazin'
Stayin' high, Soopafly is so amazin'
I'm yo' baby, dependin' on what the goal weighs in
Pimp 'em from black, white, Puerto Rican and Asian

Now welcome back, now wave your hands if you're feelin' that
Gettin' down, smokin' a pound with the million stack
Back up, I creep up on 'em 'til they crack up
Take my time, movin' it slow and never slack up

Baby was servin' me but couldn't keep the knack up
Upset 'cause she was drinkin' all my yac up
It's like splittin' a blunt, fill you with what you want
Lovin' don't have to front, up it from once a month

To three times, a fine nigga with genuine ability to keep it comin'
Now when the bus runnin' I'll be there to get ya
I'll play like Kodak and get the picture
I'm all down for stickin' but I can't kick it wit ya
So what's poppin'? You walkin', or the boots knockin'?
Yeah, I hear you talkin' girl, but I'm only down for one option baby

We can fuck around a little, and get down a little
Roll around the town a little
Or we can fuck around a lot
Let me hit the spot, tell me if you like it or not

We can fuck around a little, gettin' down a little
Roll around the town a little
Or we can fuck around a lot
Let me hit the spot, tell me if you like it or not
