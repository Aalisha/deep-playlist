Well I been sinking like a rock in this high society
'Cause all that means so much to them, don't mean shit to me
If I were in to money, fame and power, I'd be sold
But I know I tried, and I just can't find that solid country gold

But now I was born in Nashville but I left there long ago
'Cause they built music city by sacrificing soul
L.A. ain't much different, accept they got them fancy clothes
And there's nary a sight or a leaving light of solid country gold
