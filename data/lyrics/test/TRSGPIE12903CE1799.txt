City boy
and country girl
into very different worlds
get together for the cause
you scratch my back
I scratch yours

Everybody is on the mean
because some folks give
and some folks take
now we're lookin' for the perfect man
see it's in the song
it's in the sky

Well,
I believe it
in the stars
you
and I should go so far

Once
you had a
taste of love
then you know you
can't exist without it
love is like a drug that
you just can't do without
makes you so excited
makes you wanna shout

Was you by the simple
you'll never want to stop
follow my example
I'll take you to the top

A taste of love
oh-oh,
a taste of love
a taste of love
you need a taste of love

A taste of love
...
