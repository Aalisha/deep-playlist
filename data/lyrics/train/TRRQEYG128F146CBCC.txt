They say that you're drowning
You're losing your touch
Have you thrown yourself into the crunch?
They say you're a product with nothing to sell
You can fool your fans but you can't fool yourself

Oh, they're gonna love you when you're lost,
You've prayed and you've sinned
It's the last road taken
They're gonna love you when you've died
It's the last wave goodbye

Straight outta Kansas
To the city of fame
...
