Verse 1:
You think you're forgotten and that Life's a joke
When your love was stolen a child's lifetime ago
You make your way through another crowded place
To give up more just to forget the pain
But you don't know that you're not alone

Chorus:
Here's to the girls
Who carry the world but will never tell
Here's to the girls
Who deny any tear that ever fell
Everyday her shadows fight to choke her soul
...
