(DC:) Talk to em, talk to em
(Teaiira:) You know what? Just stay in ya lane

(Verse 1:)
Yes I, got a tight crew
So, yes I know what these jeans are doing to ya
Yes you, like how we move but
Just be careful, we don't start clowning you
Yes I, might give you a chance if your game is times four (four)
Might give you the sell if your backseat sits four (four)
Until I do
Respect my whole crew
And stay in your lane

(Chorus:)
I see you baby
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
Keep getting at me
But stay in your lane
I ain't easy
My frame is crazy
But stay in your lane
Take it easy
You want me, but be easy
So look upon me, just stay in ya lane

(Verse 2:)
Yes we, came in five coups
So, just be easy, its the first time I met you
