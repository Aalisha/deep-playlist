Don't listen coz they're full of shit
Don't need someone telling you that you don't fit
You don't meet the status quo
Don't got the right cloths you ain't in the know
Got my music and I got my escape
Your transparent world I just cant take
Acting like a stray but thats okay
Coz I didn't really wanna belong anyway

Coz I'm an Outsider
