Ahh ahh
Mmm ahh ahh
Mmm ahh ahh
Mmm ahh ahh
Ooo
Ohh
Ohh oh ohh

It is an age old story
Goes back to Adam and to Eve
Ooo, I know, you know, what I want for
And if it ain't clear to ya baby
Don't stop, lets rock
Give it to me baby

(Gimme, gimme)
Hey
 (Gimme some, gomme some)
Hey, hey
(Ain't like you don't want none)
Yea, yea, yea, yea
Ooh yeah yea
(What you gonna do?)
(Gimme, gimme)
(Gimme some, gimme some)
(Don't fight it what you can't solve)
(Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea)
(You gonna do)

You know you can't ignore it
 (Say my name, say my name)
I'm always there in your dreams
(You know you can't)
Ooo, you know and I know, what you, want for
(Yea baby)
And if it ain't clear to ya baby
(Don't stop, let's rock)
Don't stop
Ohh

(Gimme, gimme)
Gimme, gimme some
(Gimme some, gomme some)
(Ain't like)
You don't want none
Yea, yea, yea, yea, yea
Ooh baby
(What you gonna do?)
What you gonna do now?
 (Gimme, gimme)
(Gimme some, gimme some)
Gimme gimme some
(Don't fight it what you can't solve)
No no no no no no no baby
