Am I Supposed To Put My Life On Hold
Because You Don't How To Act
And You Don't Know Where Your Life Is Going
Am I Supposed To Be Torn Apart
Broken Hearted, In A Corner Crying
Pardon Me If I Don't Show It

I Don't Care If I Never See You Again
I'll Be Alright
Take This Final Piece Of Advice
And Get Yourself Together
But Either Way, Baby I'm Gone

I'm So Over It
I've Been There And Back
Changed All My Numbers
And Just In Case Your Wondering
I Got That New I'm A "Single Girl Swag"
Got Me With My Girls And We're Singing It
SING!

Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Hey Hey Hey (Hey)
Goodbye (Goodbye)

Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Na Na Na Na (Hey)
Hey Hey Hey (Hey)
Goodbye (Goodbye)
