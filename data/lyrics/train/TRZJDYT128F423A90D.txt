Thank you for your grace
Your amazing grace
Thank you for the way that you
Forgive me every day
Thank you for your grace
Your amazing grace
Great is your mercy
Thank you for your grace

How could breathe without it
How could I move without it
I couldn't live without it
Your grace, your grace
Not one single word without it
How could I speak without her
I wouldn't wanna sing with out it
Your grace, your grace

Thank you for your grace
Your amazing grace
Thank you for the way that you
Forgive me every day
Thank you for your grace
