Tramp
What you call me?
Tramp
You didn't
You don't wear continental clothes
Or Stetson hats

Well I tell you one doggone thing
It makes me feel good to know one thing
I know I'm a lover
Matter of opinion
That's all right, mama was, papa too
And I'm the only child, lovin' is all I know to do

You know what, Otis?
What?
You're country
That's all right
You straight from the Georgia Woods
That's good

You know what?
You wear overalls
And big old Brogan shoes
...
