I don't know much, but I know this for certain
And that is the sun poking its head 'round the curtain
Now please can we leave I'd like to go to bed now?
It's not just the sun that is hurting my head now
I'm not trying to say that I'm smelling of roses
But when will we tire of putting shit up our noses?
I don't like staying up, staying up past the sunlight
It's meant to be fun and this just doesn't feel right

Why can't we all, all just be honest?
Admit to ourselves that everyone's on it
From grown politicians to young adolescents
Prescribing themselves antidepressants
But how can we start to tackle the problem
If you don't put your hands up and admit that you're on them?
The kids are in danger, they're all getting habits
