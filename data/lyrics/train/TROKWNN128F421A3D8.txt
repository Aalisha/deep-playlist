Let's run for cover
We gotta escape
They're dropping bombs on the Empire State
And the streets are filled with children
Who will never grow old
All because their lives are all worth less than gold

This is our future going up in flames
Ashes to ashes, that is all that will remain
In this world filled with corruption
