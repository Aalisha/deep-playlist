You're listening to The Sound

I hold a memory of myself
Reflections of what I used to be
These broken roads that brought me here
They make it hard to face reality

But a new day is here
It's time that I embrace it
Can't wait another day
Right now I gotta face it

I never ever wanna press rewind, never wanna go back in time
Not much glory in that story but it's mine
So I'm loving who I am today, past has passed away
Finally I have forgiven me
