Jesus I am broken now
Before You I fall I lay me down
All I want is You, my all

I cry out from the ashes
Burned with sin and shame
I ask You Lord to make me whole again

For You say if I will come and will
Pray to You
There's forgiveness when I
Turn from me and pray
For You say if I will come and will
Pray to You
You hear me and heal me when I pray

Your ways are not my own
