You have led me into this grief
now it's your turn to get out of this lie
so many years i have been lost
in this circle of time

sometimes if feels like I'm trapped
in my own mind
I can feel my thoughts slipping away
am I going insane

I can see it there on the wall
the door that leads me out
who's head is this now
...
