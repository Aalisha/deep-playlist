Have you ever been inside a flame?
Did you ever play a burning game?
Would you do what I want you to do?
Do you like the way I'm burning you?

Close to the flame
Behind my eyes there is a beast
that longs for you
Calling my name
So if you're brave enough to risk it
follow me
Into the firestorm

There's no need to be afraid of this
