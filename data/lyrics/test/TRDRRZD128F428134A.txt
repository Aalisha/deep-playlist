Violently, falling for destiny
It should be you and me
Riding horizons, invisibly
Creating a harmony
A path for you and me
The world's at our feet

So come fly
Welcome to my paradise
Where the heaven ends
That's where love begins
Don't cry
Welcome to my paradise
Feel your loving grace
In your warm embrace

I believe, I was destined
To be with you, to fight for you
To die for you, reminding me
Will you set me free
...
