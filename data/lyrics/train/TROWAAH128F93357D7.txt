We all live
Somewhere near nowhere
On dusty roads there
All soft and free
You said i feel no pain
Where are you going
With number nothing
Unnaturally

It's the feeling that you can't be lost
It's another that you can't explain
It pulls on strings like falling in love
Instant love, instant love

Only you asked to go lower
And don't you just know it
...
