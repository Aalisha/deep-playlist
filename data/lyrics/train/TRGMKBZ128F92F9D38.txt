Goodbye darling, I'll turn off the lights on my way out
I just hoped it meant more, yeah that you missed to kiss this mouth

I'm always speeding up and slowing down
I've got vertigo, put me underground
I think I'm losing control

I'm gonna find my way back to the pine tree state
In the midnight of summer where the rain and thunder play

Hello darling, thanks for the call, yeah the weathers great
