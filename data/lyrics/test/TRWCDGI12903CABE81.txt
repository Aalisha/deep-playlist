Walk with me quiet, walk with me slow
With watered down coffee and words of gold
'Cause I can feel the edges of these things
When I hear you speak to me

So walk with me, walk with me
Walk with me empty, walk with me strong
The hush of our voices, when the day seems so long
It is like a balm, it is like a jewel
...
