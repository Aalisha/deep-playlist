I feel confused by the people around
When I see how they selfishly open their mouth
You are the one who can talk them all down
I might be to shy but I've still got the right

We pay attention to the man in the light
I'd rather take my way out of the crowd

Silence is my only friend
But noone seems to understand
How can I talk with a scared pair of eyes
I'm close to explain but I'm still paralyzed
