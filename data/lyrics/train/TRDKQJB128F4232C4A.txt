[VERSE 1]
Hands out to your big ass,
Here's 100 beans a minute where the back says.
Thug Pop. Thug Pop.
Checks in people with her pants in a bunch,
James Dean and Hermie Fox!

(DLR scream)

[CHORUS]
People try to blame me,
Poets try the same.
I'm tryin to hear from the mildew
to the barbeque on a hellbound train...
Longshot? That's bitchin'
Served hot right from the rhythm kitchen.
Perhaps you know my name...

I'm called: Thug Pop. Thug Pop.
