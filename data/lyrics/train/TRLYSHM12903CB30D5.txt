This golden ring is gonna buy me a place in my baby's heart
This golden ring is gonna make sure that we never part
It's so funny what a ring can do
Make a girl just like you
Take a ride downtown
Searching for a wedding girl
So I got a ring from my baby
And I think very soon that baby that girl will be mine
