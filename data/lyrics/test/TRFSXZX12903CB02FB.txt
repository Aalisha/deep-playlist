Every dream that I dream
Seems to float on by
Like a cloud in the wind
Way up in the sky
Every move that I make
Seems to be the wrong way
Like a cold black night

What can I do
What can I do
Nothing to say but it used to be
Nothing to say but it used to be
What can I do
You still play my guitar
With a smile on my face
