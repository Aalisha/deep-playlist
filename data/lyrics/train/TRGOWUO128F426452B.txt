Alpine Valley
In the middle of the night
Six strings down
On the heaven-bound flight
Got a pick, a strap, guitar on his back
Ain't gonna cut the angels no slack

Heaven done called
Another blues-stringer back home

See the voodoo chile
Holding out his hand
I've been waitin' on you brother
Welcome to the band
Good blues-stringin'
