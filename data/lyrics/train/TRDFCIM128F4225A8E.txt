I waited for you yesterday
I waited and missed the last train
I waited to say that I'd fallen in love with your way
I waited for you yesterday
Eventually walked home in the rain
I waited to see if you felt the same for me

But you don't,
And you won't
Go against your asshole father
Going broke,
Winning dope
For your folks
Why did I even bother?
Why did I?

I waited for minds to change
Pointing their fingers of blame
It's not my fault you're ashamed of how you feel
