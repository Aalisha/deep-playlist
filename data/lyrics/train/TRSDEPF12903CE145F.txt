Blowin' out spring break
With your not right friends
Wake up on the beach
With new ink on your skin

Do something crazy and dumb
While you're still young

Go on and tie the knot
Start a new life
Take turns gettin' up
When the baby cries

Living on nothin' but love
While you're still young

Life is too short
To put it off anymore
