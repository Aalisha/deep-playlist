Always get in the way, never fall in line
Many have tried
Our lives, they never felt right
We don't understand

Somewhere we can feel it
Somewhere over there
Somewhere we can find it
Anywhere

Don't wait
The moment will fade
And you're on your own
Do you think so?

All alone
'Cause you never leave your home
You were never fine
...
