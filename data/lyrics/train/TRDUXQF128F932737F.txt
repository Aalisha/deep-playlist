We are born to earn, they are waiting us to serve
We will be part of the machines raising the GDP
LEader ruling our world are unable to learn
Social health, eating wellbeing to death
Insane leaders, insane rules
Invented system in the government
Slavery is pushed down our throats
Approved lies
Lies!
