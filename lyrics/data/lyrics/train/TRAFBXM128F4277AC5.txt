I'm all washed out by the side of the road
Broken bones Matilda left a note and a rose
Sayin' "Baby honey child, I've loved you so long
But you deserve much better than me"

So I'm just burnin' all around all the miles in the road
And I'm never goin' back and I'm never goin' home
I've been gone too long, I've been less right than wrong
I lost so much blood in the fallin' out

And I lit a fire that wouldn't go out
Until it consumed the walls and roof of this house
Until all I remember was burnin' away
And all I remember, you burned it away

See, for ten long years I've been hustlin' around
Tryin' to wash the sins and the sweat from my brow
Tryin' to find a better life for me and my own
Just some rest for these tired workin' fingers
...
