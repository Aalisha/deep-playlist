You walk away with a golden smile
And now you wait for another time
And now you're asking me to answer to
Do you have to be a friend to me?

And so you go with a daze in your eyes
But you don't know where you're going tonight
You're always running away from your pain
It doesn't have to be this way

And these things happen all the time
You're always the same, you never have time for it
You're not alone, but you're not alive
This isn't your way, you'll have it someday again

You seem to be one to know it's a touch
