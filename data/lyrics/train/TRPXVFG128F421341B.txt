Wake up in the morning as the last sun rose, it rose
Everyone smiles at me as they pass me on the street, oh
Some are gone…chant so fallen fear, but
In the struggle Ethiopian wear the crown dem crying

Woy, Wo-ha, ha, ha, hoy, oh Lord yeah
Woy, Wo-ha-ha-ha-oy, oh yeah
I don’t like to be down inna discipline trouble
It all depends how dem a hustle for flow
When they chant so loud the man a gossip on the road
They all defend man in this time
Oh Lord I pray, crazy in this time, oh Lord I say now yeah
Woy, Wo-ah-ah-ah-oy, oh yeah
Woy, Wo-ah-ah-ah-oy
