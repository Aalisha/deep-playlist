Girl you got this need to know what I'm all about
There's something that you dig, you can't figure out
Well, now you wanna know what moves my soul
And what ticks inside of my brain

But I've got this need
I just can't control
And it's drivin' me insane
I can't take it

Because I'm hungry for those good things, baby
Hungry through and through
I'm hungry for that sweet life, baby
With a real fine girl like you

I can almost taste it, baby
And It's sweet as wine
...
