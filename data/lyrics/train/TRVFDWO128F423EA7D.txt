The bells are tolling for me and my love
discreet horizon's fading, but fading from my trust
all the walls are falling 'round my ears
I can see the writing's on the wall

can't you tell me what's the use?
I always place my trust in you
reaching out for what is mine
pulling down the miserable blinds

empty beds for an empty mind
something difficult to describe
...
