Look at you now just standing there
Like you think you're something
The lights are up
And the crowd is looking your way
Swaying through what you live to say

So go ahead boy,
Give a little taste of hypocrisy
Maybe you'll hear, the blasphemy
Whatever you preach, it isn't in me

You wanna walk with me
Well do ya?
You wanna walk with me
Well if you love me
Then just love me
Don't you give me pretty words
Lend your life down at the altar
Let me see how serious you are

These people talking to me
No more than how their idols
And various poems with lust in their eyes
...
