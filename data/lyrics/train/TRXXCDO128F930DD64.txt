Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
Watching the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again
I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
And it looks like nothing's gonna come my way
Yeah, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
...
