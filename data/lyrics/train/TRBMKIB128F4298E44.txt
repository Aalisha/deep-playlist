Paint a rumour
(What's it gonna spread?)
Paint a rumour
(See the place go red)

I could tell you something
(Promise not to tell)
I could tell you something
(Promise not to sell)

It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret

I have heard a whisper
I have heard a whisper
(What did it say?)
I heard a whisper
(Make it go away)

Don't believe a word of it
(Promise not to tell)
Don't repeat a word of it
(Promise not to sell)

It's a secret
It's a secret
It's a secret
...
