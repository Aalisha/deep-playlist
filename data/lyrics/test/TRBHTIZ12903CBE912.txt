Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love

Restart Your love
My heart, it's all been saved for You
Repair, not in part
In whole, through all that we've been through

And every dream that I'm feeling now
Every hope that remains somehow
If we part, I won't have the chance to say

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, crazy love

You are my love
So far we've made it through the storm
They say our love
No way it survives the circumstance
