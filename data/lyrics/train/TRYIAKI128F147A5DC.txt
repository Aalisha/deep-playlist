Softly we tremble tonight
Picture perfect fading smiles are all that's left in sight
I said I'd never leave, you'll never change
I'm not satisfied with where I'm at in life

Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
Am I supposed to be happy?
With all I ever wanted, it comes with a price
You said
You said that you would die for me
