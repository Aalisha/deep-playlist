Hey look it there, here she comes
Here comes that girl again
Wanted to date her since I don't know when
She don't notice me when I pass
She goes with other guys that are outta my class

That can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself
She's sure fine lookin' man
She's somethin' else

Hey look it there, across the street
There's a car made just for me
To own a car would be a luxury
Right now I can't afford the gas
A brand new convertible is outta my class
