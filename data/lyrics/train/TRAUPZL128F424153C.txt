I used to be a rolling stone you know
If the cause was right
I'd leave
To find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beat for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done

'Cause I live and breathe
This Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born
I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom
Took me knee high to a man
Yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia freedom
Shine on me
I love you
Shine a light
Through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine a light shine a light
Shine a light won't you shine a light
Philadelphia freedom
I lo o ove you
Yes I do

If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city
