I wanna have you 'cause you're all I've got
Don't wanna lose you 'cause it means a lot
All the joy this world can bring
Doesn't give me anything, when you're not here

Idiot me, stupid fool
How could you be, so uncool?
To fall in love with someone who
Doesn't really care for you, it's so obscure

But I feel, wonderful
Yes I feel
Don't you know I feel, wonderful?
