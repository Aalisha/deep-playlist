Livin' after midnight
Rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

I took the city 'bout one am
Loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again
Loaded, loaded
I come alive in a neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Livin' after midnight
Rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone
...
