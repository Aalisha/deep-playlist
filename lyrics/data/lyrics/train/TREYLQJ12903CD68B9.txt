My cancer came knocking
It was dressed to the nines
So I peeled back my skin
And I let it come inside

But it won't leave
Though the guests have gone
No, it pours a drink
And requests another song

Now it sleeps in between us
Splits and doubles in size
Apes my nuances of desertion
Lust and arrogant pride

And it drags me out of my head
...
