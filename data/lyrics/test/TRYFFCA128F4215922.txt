(Nod your head to this shit)
"Planet" (Rakim) "Asia" (Planet Asia)
"Was my place of birth" (Rakim)
"Dealin in my cypher, I revolve around science" (Ghostface)
"Planet" "Asia"
"Was my place of birth"
"Dealin in my cypher, I revolve around science"
"Planet" "Asia"
"Was my place of birth"
"Dealin in my cypher, I revolve around science"
"Planet" "Asia"
"Was my place of birth"
"Planet Asia got the key to expand" (Planet Asia)
"Set it off" (Prodigy)

(Planet Asia)
Two hundred sheets complete
I keeps it street just to eat
Crushin fools when I bust over beats
On some independent unsigned shit
Mind untwined shit
Fuck your head up wit just one rhyme witt
A little bit of the pre-scripted
Just been inflicted wit
Imperial hip hop shit that I was gifted wit
I don't want no ice cream lovin, it's too cold for me
All in order like it's supposed to be
