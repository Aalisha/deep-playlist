Oh oh, it's magic (x2)
Look at the sun way up there in the sky
Shining forever, the world is so bright
Oh oh, it's magic everywhere

A little bird chirping high in the tree
He flew right down and whispered these words to me
He said "look all around, life is just so beautiful I found", whoa-oh-oh
Oh oh, it's magic (x2)

Look at the sun way up there in the sky
Shining forever, the world is so bright
