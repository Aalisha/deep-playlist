I don't care if it takes some time
I'm gonna make it right
I'm gonna make it right

Turn the head 360 degrees
Bite the hand that feeds
I don't care if it tasted like poison
Rip the legs from the thighs
Feed the prison, open the eyes
I don't care if it tastes like poison
I'm gonna feed the prison, feed the prison
