I got that crank trippin’
Babe it’s you
I got that grape kool-aid filled swimming pool
I got those Roomba robots that clean the floor
I got that mother of pearl oyster fork for sure
I got that Tammy Faye milk money butterscotch
I got that Mama Cass you know I got that Peter Tosh

I got it all
Yes it’s true…
So why don’t I get you…

I got that Bob Fosse
I got that Joey Ramone
A bag of Bill Murray
Damien Hirst Telephone
Check got that gold-thronged studded alligator leather
