See my friends
Running in circles
Watching cars pass on the street

Missing daylight
Oh the nightline
Casting shadows of defeat

You got me looking out the shades
Waiting up for you
How much longer should I wait?

So...
Until you leave
My eyes will turn red for a minute
And I can't breathe when she goes

She kills me nightly
...
