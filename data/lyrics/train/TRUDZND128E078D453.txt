(Mike on lead)
I started out a little tightly wound
Like a rocket shot up out of frozen ground
Dirt in my nails, a forest in my head
Seems like every message I got said
Burn it, Break it

She took me in like a broken bird
In a moonlit house in a single word
We built a cave, or was it a nest?
She did all the driving and all the rest, but

(All)
I'm not there at all
Though I shall recall
What she said to me
On her doorstep

(Mike)
