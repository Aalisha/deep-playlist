Oh girl look at the time it takes
To see the whole thing fall
And girl look at the love we waste
Have nothing left at all
In time if I'm alone I'll learn to live a life
That don't begin with you

But if you change your mind
Change your point of view
Will you have a change of heart
And let me stay with you

Oh girl you said you've seen it all
As plain as it was day
And now all I have's a memory
Of life a better way
