Hallelujah! 
I and I a want to see King Rastafari 
To look upon Jah pretty pretty face 
We want to walk the streets of glory 
Shining around Jah throne 
So Natty Dread tell all the gentles them to come 
Run come to look upon Jah pretty pretty face 
For we are going home, going home 
To see King Rastafari 
Selassie a the roots of David 
...
