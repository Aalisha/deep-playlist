There is a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a Sunday morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born
All the chapel bells were ringing in the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing was for baby Jimmy Brown
Then the little congregation, prayed for guidance from above
(Hallelujah)
Lead us not into temptation, bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love
(Hallelujah)
