Hey, tore away the veil of weakness
The enemy now lies beneath us
I think we're safe

Hey, won't be held down any longer
No disgrace and no dishonor
Keep us chained

There's nothing we should have to fear
It's alright
We've come to life

We'll never shed another tear
I'ts alright
We've come to life
