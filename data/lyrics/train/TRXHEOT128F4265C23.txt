Jack still cries day and night
Jack's not happy with his life
He wants to do this he wants to that
You want to be kind but ends up flat for love
For love

He tries so hard to give a lot
He wants to be what he is not
But love's not harsh and love's not bad
So what's he doing for love is so sad

He wants to be so bad he wants to be so bad
All the time getting in
Things he can't get out
Something deep inside of him
Eatin' up the pride of him
That makes him buy things for the girls

That's what you get for being polite
