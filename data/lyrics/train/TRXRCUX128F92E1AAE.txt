Dear God, surround me as I speak
The bridges that I walk across are weak
Frustrations fill the void
That I can't solely bear

Dear God, don't let me fall apart
You've held me close to you
I have turned away and searched
For answers I can't understand

They say that I can move the mountains
And send them falling to the sea
They say that I can walk on water
If I would follow and believe
With faith like a child
