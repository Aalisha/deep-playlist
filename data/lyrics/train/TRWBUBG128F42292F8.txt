she's looking at a picture she painted of herself
she feels so very different now she's trying to forget
some things won't ever change unless you want them to
and other ones will change without you asking

answers without questions effects without a cause
she stumbles through life (...) she doesn't feel the most
but things will never change there's nothing we can do
and other ones will change without you asking

we're just the same
when i look at you i see myself
...
