On the first date I want to walk out
Oh, the cocaine kids and their mouths
Seemed to be a cure for shyness,
But we'd sworn to our friends never to try it

The mistakes you make in youth

Simply calling it trouble doesn't make sense,
When doctors and lawyers are clients
These are the things that we said
Made it fine for just something on weekends
...
