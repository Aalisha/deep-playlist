All the time,
I am searching for the definition
It is time,
To come out and leave the home with the ambition
This is life,
This is how I'll pretend to be in favour
To get time,
All I'm asking for...

[Chorus]
I want you to
Listen to me
Rocking Music
Set you free
I want you to
Get inside
Rocking Music
Ease your mind

I wanna to see your body grooving
(I want to see your body yeah)
Realy want to rock your body
(Heeeey)

(Whohowow)

All the time
Hesitation is what took you so long
It is time,
To see where the power burns no more
...
