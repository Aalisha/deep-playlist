Uh.
Yeah.
I like the way you do that shorty (shorty)
Now can you do somethin' for me (uh)
I like the way you movin' girl
Show me how you do that girl
I like the way you do that shorty (uh)
Now can you do somethin' for me

I can't, stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants
And i dont wanna miss my chance, to jump on her
If i could, get her outta here i would
I never seen a girl move that good
And there's something tellin' me I should
Get Low!

Yeah.
I'm in the 2006, brand new wagon
Lookin' for a diva to handle a dragon
And even if there's two of um, i'ma move in and bag um
Make sure i'm strapped, keep the Uz and the Magnum
Yeah the gun talk, but i'm talkin' 'bout the condom
They followin' me home with my dog right behind um
Have you ever seen a ass clap on a stallion
Another bad bitch half black and italian
I dont know if she likes me or my medallion
You think i give a fuck, i'm just tryna get a nut
I dont need no-one to build my self-esteem up
Im fresh out the hood, but fuck it its all good
Why you can use me, cuz i'ma use you
