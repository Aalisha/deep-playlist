Within these walls
Within these walls is pain and strife
Within these walls it's yours tonight
Within these walls you'll sacrifice
Within these walls

We're prowling to and fro
Prowling to and fro
Prowling to and fro
With nowhere else to go

We need a lamb to slaughter
On the center stage
Inside this house tonight
We'll please the gods of rage
...
