You've left my ring by the soap
Now is that love?
You cleaned me out you could say broke
Now is that love?

The better better better it gets
The more these girls forget
That that is love

You won't get dressed you walk about
Now is that, is that
A teasing glance has pushed me out
Now is that, is that
