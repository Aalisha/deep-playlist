Rockin' with the best
so I pass the test
rockin' with the best

rock rock - rockin' with the best
rockin' with the best
so I pass the test
in any old badass mc contest
rock rock - rockin' with the best
Gis is on the scratch
rockin' with the best
so I pass the test
in any old badass mc contest

E-boy the B-boy the one u can't avoid
on the 10 o'clock news and on the tabloids
still rockin' that good old crunchy funk
a with a hi-hat boogie and a bass thata bump
and with a beat like this to make it all crisp
we hit you with a style, u know u can't resist
so get on the floor come get some more
we catch u on the go and I know that u know
on the wheels of steel my man dj Gis
baptizing the beat on a top of the list
breakin' on the curves, slidin' with the ride
blazin' that tune - aimin' up high
now feel the flow surfin' thru ur bones
guarantee to give ur groove more bounce to the ounce
now could it be the bass that we got u all amazed
or is it just fresh cos' ur rockin' with the best

rock rock - rockin' with the best
rockin' with the best
so I pass the test
