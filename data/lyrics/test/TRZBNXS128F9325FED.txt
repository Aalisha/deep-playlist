Everyone's waiting
I stand at the station cos
I know, I know
Pick up your feet boy
It's time to compete because
I know, I know
What are dreams but
Fanatical reasons
You chop and change with the seasons
Stop it you're stressing me out
Answer the phone you can't be left alone because
I know, I know
You've had your fun now
