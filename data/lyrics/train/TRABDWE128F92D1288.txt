Just when you thought it was safe to go
back in the party on your own
It's like the night of the living dead
With beer in hand and lampshade on head
Fast forward two weeks
someone's coming up your street
Fast forward two weeks
what is that is that a rat a tat tat tat

Sooner or later there will be a knock at the door now you
Won't know what you're doin' or what you're doin' it for
And then you say to yourself
That guy is everywhere
That guy is everywhere
That guy is everywhere
...
