I keep taking
Taking you back
But I dont know why I do
You keep breaking

Breaking me down
So I'll find somebody new

Alright
I don't wanna feel I'm buried alive

And now your begging me to see you tonight
Its funny how easy you can mess me up
Now look how easy I get you
Outta My Head, Outta My Head
Say goodbye
Somebody's gonna get you
Outta My Head, Outta My Head
And tonight
I'm doing what I want to
You made the biggest mistake
And now I'm going to get you way
