Wish you were here
Me oh my country man
wish you were here

I wish you were here
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue

Wish you were here
Me oh my country man
wish you were here
(Wish you were here)

Wish you were here
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue

I've got feelings for you
