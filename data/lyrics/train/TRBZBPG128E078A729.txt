You speak to me
I know this will be temporary
You ask to leave
but I can tell you that I've had enough
I can't take it
This welcome is gone and
I've waited long enough to make it
and if you're so strong
you might as well just do it alone
And I'll watch you go
Step up to me

I know that you've got something buried
I'll set you free
You set conditions, but I've had enough
...
