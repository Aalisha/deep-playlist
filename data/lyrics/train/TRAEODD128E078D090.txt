Keep a knockin' but you can't come in
Keep a knockin' but you can't come in
Keep a knockin' but you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it again

You said, you love me and you can't come in
You said, you love me and you can't come in
You said, you love me and you can't come in
Come back tomorrow night and try it again
