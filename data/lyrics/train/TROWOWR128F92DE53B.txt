Did you really think you could call the shots
I wouldn't it figure out or connect the dots
In so many lies what's the meaning
Oh oh oh

Did you really think you could cause me pain
Stepped on the track right in front of the train
Now it's only shame that you're feeling
Oh oh oh

So unexpected, the tables have turned
I'm laughin' now because my joke is on you
And it's so unexpected that you're getting burned
Now I gets mine 'cause all my pain is removed

So unexpected (unexpected)
Unexpected (unexpected)
Oh oh

I was always a few steps ahead
