Oh, pretty woman
sure's the rising sun.
Says all your cheap paint and powder
ain't gonna help you none.

'Cause she's a pretty woman
right down to her bone.
So you might as well
leave your skin alone.

Pretty woman,
what's the matter with you?
Can't make you love me
no matter what I do.

Oh, pretty woman,
whatcha gonna do?
You kept on foolin' around
till I got stuck on you.
