Tell me what you mean, listen for the sun
I'll listen for the music, but it never comes

Tell me what you mean now
Tell me what you mean now
Tell me what you mean now
Tell me what you mean now

I'm alone and the curtain's drawn in my home
And when you talk like a fucker
It's not what you said
It's that you said it in a cynical tone

So tell me what you mean now
...
