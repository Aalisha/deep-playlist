I know a little bit about a lot o' things,
But I don't know enough about you.
Just when I think you're mine,
You try a different line,
And baby, what can I do?

I read the latest news,
No buttons on my shoes,
But baby, I'm confused about you.
You get me in a spin,
Oh what a stew I'm in,
'Cause I don't know enough about you.
