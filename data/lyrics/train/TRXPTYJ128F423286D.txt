I'm coming now, I'm comin' now

[Verse 1:]
Hurt me, like you've never done before
Make me, do whatever u want now
Desert me, leave me like u always do
Hate me, as long as this is the last time

I'm just letting u know (4Ã—)

[Verse 2:]
Watch me, as I begin to walk away
Miss me, and see if I care now
Catch me, try and see now if u can
Kiss me, and know it's the last time
