Lets do this!

Fake and fall, stop and stall
Take it all back cause I'm taking mine,
I'm taking mine
Time is up, out of luck
Should'a stood up when you had the time
Cause you're out of time
Let's do this!
Fight, fight, fight, fight
Lock and load, rock and roll
Bitch its all over, you're going down (you're going down)

Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
Cause its time to remember it:
This is war and it's on tonight
So get up and fight (get up and fight)
You've had all your life to run and hide
Now step up!
