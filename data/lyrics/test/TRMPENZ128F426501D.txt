Show me the way now
Moving step by step to love
Show me, yeah, the way now
Touching where I've never been touched

Everybody's looking for a reason
Making time and calling it love
But you give me all I've ever needed
Don't ever stop filling me up

(Show me)
Yeah the way now
Moving step by step to love
Oh baby, won't you

 (Show me)
Show me the way now
Touching where I've never been touched

I've been used and I've been good at using
Running from the pain deep inside
But you make me feel the joy of living
