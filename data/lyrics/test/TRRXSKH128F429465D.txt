I don't call it love
Come take me in your heart
Oh, I can't get enough
I know we will never part

We are night birds, my baby
Night birds will never stop
Oh, you're playing with fire
Lost in my desire
Baby, you're so hot

My bed is too big
Too big without you, baby
I wanna have your body
Come gimme what you've got
