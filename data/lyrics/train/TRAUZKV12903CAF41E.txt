She was a sinner like all other guardians
For of her daughter she was proud
Went to the market on the third Sunday again
And there she vanished in the crowd

Oh it wasn't long ago you suckled to her breast
And how your eyes exploded as you took your first
breath
Now the lading days return and the want beckons the yearn
To rise above the nest and to lay your head to rest
Forlorn but for the best
...
