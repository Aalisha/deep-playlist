Some people like to gamble
But you, you always lose
Some people like to rock 'n' roll
You're always singing the blues

You got a nasty disposition
No one really knows the reason why
You got a bad, bad reputation
Gonna hang down your head and cry

Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck
Y'got bad, bad luck
Bad, bad luck

Thirteen's my lucky number
