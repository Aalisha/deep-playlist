Our candle burns away
the ashes full of lies
i gave my soul to you
you cut me from behind

nowhere to run
nowhere to hide
your scared if the truth
im tired a lies
its who i am
and where you wanna be...

dont act like an angel
fallen again
your no superhero
i found in the end
so lie to me once again and tell me everything will be alright
lie to me once again and ask yourself before we say goodbye
well goodbye...

you said you were there for me
...
