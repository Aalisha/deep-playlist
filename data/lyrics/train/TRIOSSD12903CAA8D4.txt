"Till Death Do Us Part"

As we talk the golden mile
Down the pretty aisle
I know that you are mine
And there's nothing in this world

That I know that I won't do
To be near you everyday
Every hour every minute
Take my hand and let me lead the way

All through your life
I'll be by your side
Till death do us part

I'll be your friend
...
