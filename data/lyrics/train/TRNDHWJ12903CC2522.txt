Welcome to lonely
I'm taking what you owe me
No matter where you are
I swear I'm gonna find you

Broken wings can hold me
You'll never make it right
No matter where you are
I swear I'm gonna find you

So you wanna bring me down
If I beg to differ now
'Cause I'm never gonna be like you

So you wanna bring me down
If I beg to differ now
'Cause I'm never gonna be like you

Look on the bright side
