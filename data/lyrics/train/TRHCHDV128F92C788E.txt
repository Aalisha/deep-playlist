Wasn't in the mood for dancin', forget about romancin'
Cause I already got a lady
Wasn't tryin' to be flirty, wasn't feeling dirty
'Til this shorty started runnin' on me

With her itty-bitty waist and her pretty pretty face
And the leanest, meanest, badest, badest body
Didn't have no time to waste, she was looking for a taste
And she was wanting me to party

Ooo, It's so crazy, she's like Baby, I'm like Swayze
I said, Ooo, and I'm burning up
So, lets turn it up, I said turn it up now

She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me
She's dirty dirty dancing, dirty dancing on me

Now, I ain't looking for no drama,
...
