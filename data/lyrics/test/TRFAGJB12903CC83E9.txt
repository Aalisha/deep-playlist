I'm in transit
For the stranded on this boat
And I pledge myself allegiance
To a better night's sleep at home
And the sweet, sweet sun's coming down hard
The sun's coming down hard
It burns the bones
So hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover
Hold a hand for cover from harm
Talk don't change a thing
Ohh it's fading fader
The words don't sink their swims
...
