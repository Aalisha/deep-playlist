(White, Norum, Dokken)

Take me back, to a time I remeber well
It's a fact, when your near
You know we could stop the world
If I'm wrong, then alright
You know it doesn't matter now
In my heart, you are mine
You know we're gonna make it somehow
You know we're gonna make it somehow

I can be anything, just for you I can make it right
Fortunes told in love's hearts, it doesn't have
To keep us apart
I'm a soldier of fotune, fighting for a means to an end
If there's love in you eyes, it's only 
Gonna take one night
Yeahm, say it's not over and remember

IST CHORUS:
When some night you are lonely 
You just call out my name
...
