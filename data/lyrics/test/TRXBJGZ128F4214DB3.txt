When darkness be closin' in
I'm motivated, with the howlin' wind
With a list of chosen men, frozen in sin
Knowin' that your end is beginnin'

Swift silent and deadly, there's no defendin' my plots
I know your every movement, for six months I watch
Coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot

But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering the stuff
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here, puff this here, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig

Right now you as nervous, as a farmer John Pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the thirty-shot mag
Bullet stuck to his brain like a Mack
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet
