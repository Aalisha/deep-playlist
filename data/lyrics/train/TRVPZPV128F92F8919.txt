Vengeance provoked
Behold the mark of Cain
Uncreate the genesis
Devoured by the abyss

Cleave the covenant
And powers that grant
Bury the testament
Tumbled by torment

Nocturnal
Infernal
The suffering eternal
Soaking the rays of celestial
Light
Noctiluca

Profane
Arcane
Benediction of bane
Falling through cracks of
Darkness
Obumbration
...
