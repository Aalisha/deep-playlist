Yeah, yeah
Ooh it's a love thing
I been working all day long
And I'm ready to come on home to you
All the other guys roll their eyes
And don't realize it's what I want to do
It's what I want to do
They say I'm wrapped around your finger
But they don't understand
That what we got is more than just a diamond
On your hand
Baby it's a love thing, whoa
Baby it's a love thing, yeah
Sure I could hang around and complain about
The way things ought to be
