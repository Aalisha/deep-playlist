It Seemed So Easy
Raspberries
by David Smalley & Eric Carmen

Remember our love, babe
Remember the good days
The days when we both
Thought it would stay

Just thinkin' about you
So warm there beside me
I'd look in your eyes
And then you'd say

Words of love to me
Of how it would always be
And how the cloudy days
Had all gone by

But now I'm wonderin', babe
If it was all a lie
Because it seemed so easy
When you said goodbye
