Up 'til now my lucky stars shined brightest in the sky
I was living in the lap of the gods
But miss fortune turned the tables and turned out all the light
Now there's no chance in hell I'll beat the odds

I'm going down
Going down
Down down down
I'm going down

Up 'til now I never looked at what was in the cards
...
