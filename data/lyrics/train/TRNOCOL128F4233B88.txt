Mad dog in the hallway and my head is filled with fire
Panic rules the moment with no mercy or desire
Ran across the blackened sand to get a soft ice cream
And now my mouth is burning crimson in a long and bloody dream
Sometimes I wonder 'bout these physical disorders
My only contact is with TV news distorters

CHORUS
Glancing over quickly at the words from brain to pen
All that I can tell you - I'm insane, insane again

Relax - relax Relax - relax Relax - relax

Puppets with directions they whisper in my ears
Circled stairs around me drip with long forgotten tears
Nothing done without a motive, proving they were smart
Every path they traced for me another kind of chart
Corporate christie says it all - the meeting is atwist
