If you say my singing is off key, my love
You will hurt my feelings, don't you see, my love?
I wish I had an ear like yours, a voice that would behave
All I have is feeling and the voice God gave
You insist my music goes against the rules
Yes, but rules were never made for love sick fools
I wrote this little song for you, but you don't care
