Dan- no more wires. fuck the tv screens. fuck the monitors. fuck the drama fuck the bother. can you make me feel better? [enter] will you be my friend? [enter] get off the internet [enter] Get off the fucking computers, we live our lives through wires and screens, fuck it, atleast call. love through wires is not a motto for all. kill me with a keystroke baby, kill me with a click! 



Cory- communications down! cut the wires that entagle me! I'm so down. cut the cord that powers me. I'm so fucking down! kill me with a keystroke baby, kill me with a click!
