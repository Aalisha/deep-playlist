Pull the curtains on the day
(aaaaaaaaaaaaaah)
Sometimes it is the only way
(aaaaaaaaaaaaaah)

Pull the curtains on the day
Sometimes it is the only way

Pull the curtains on the night
Sometimes it isn't worth the fight

Sometimes you gotta turn it off
Man, you gotta walk away
And then sometimes you gotta say
"This is gonna be the day"
