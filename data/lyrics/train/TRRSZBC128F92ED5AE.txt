You're time is done, I'm moving in
I've come to fight or lose, so go ahead and try me
You know I've just begun, just begun

You've never seen a fight like this before
(Like this before)
I take you down and leave you there wanting more
(More)
You've crossed the line that I cannot ignore
(Cannot ignore)
You've never seen a fight like this before
(Yeah)
