Took me all around the world
Tell me I'm the only one
They believe you love me so
Certain how you let me down
Tricky how you said the words
Didn't even feel disturbed
"You're my one and only girl".
Those are only words I heard.
You didn't (yea)
Turned its back (yea) on me (yea yea)
(yea...)
my heart hurts (yea)
just enough to leave (yea, yea)

One mile to go
No more dirt road
Meanwhile
love don't
live here
no more
(no more)

Thank you for the wake up call
Even though I gave my all
Good to see it end this way
But I love myself so it's ok.
No need to explain.
It's simple and plain to see.
All the wrong you did to me.
