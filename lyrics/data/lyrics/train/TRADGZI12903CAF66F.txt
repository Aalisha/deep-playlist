Chorus
We is a beautiful thing you and me is a beautiful thing

Verse
Even struggle is beautiful thing to rise above
When your in love, inside love
His love, her love God loves self love
A child's love, a peoples love
Cause then the struggle isn't so empty
For with life not just strife

Chorus 2x
We is a beautiful thing you and me is a beautiful thing
