You don't know me
Like you knew me
You stopped listening
The moment that I needed you the most

You can't see me
Like you saw me
Truth comes easy
But it's hard for you to pull me from the ground

So I scream
Scream 'cause it hurts
Your every word
Cuts me inside and leaves me worse

There's no way back
And what if there was
You'd still be you
And I'd still need to say goodbye
...
