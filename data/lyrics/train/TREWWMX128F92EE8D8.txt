Roll out of bed, look in the mirror, and wonder who you are.
Another year has come and gone.
Today is your birthday, but it might be, the last day of your life.
What will you do if tomorrow it's all gone?

You wont be young forever, 
It's only a fraction to the sum.
You wont be young forever, 
Nor will anyone.

So look at your life, who do you want to be before you die?
Look at your life, and what do you want to do.
So look at your life, who do you want to be before you die?
Look at your life, you haven't got forever.
