I've been asking 'round if you were there
Asking, but I'm always scared
Asking 'cause I want to care again
Come on life
I'm almost ready
Not right
I'm almost ready

I've been wondering if the message sent
Wondering if I made a dent
Wondering what it is you meant again
Come on life
I'm almost ready
...
