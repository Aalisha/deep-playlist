Listen for the sound of your heart beneath your skin
You're standing tall, it's the end but that's where I begin
Should you decide to give your life away
Welcome to the other side it will blow your mind
And you will come around anyway

The rhythm of your love will make you bleed
The rhythm of your love is what I need
The rhythm of your love is a golden crown
The rhythm of your love comes a tumbling down

The rhythm of your love will make you bleed
The rhythm of your love is what I need
