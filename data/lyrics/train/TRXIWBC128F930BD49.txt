If my soul could revive from my carnal remains
What does it matter to me
If it all fades to black, if I'm born once again
Then no one really is free
How could I be condemned for the things that I've done
If my intentions were good

Can never be understood

How can we believe in heaven
Human reason counters all
Ideas of soul society
My life is just a fragment
