Can't see you when I want to
Can't see you when I want to
I know you are tied up and I'm free
You got so much to lose
Take your chances seeing me

Baby, you say you loved me
And I say that I'm gonna keep on loving you
Even though I can't see you when I want to

I remember that last night you said you'll meet me
At the same old usual time
And I was late and you had to leave early
Don't you know I almost lost my mind
