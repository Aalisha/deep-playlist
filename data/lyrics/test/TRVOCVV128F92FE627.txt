Oh, the night was clear and the stars were shinin'
and the moon came up,... so quiet in the sky
And all the people gathered round while the band was a-tunin'
I can hear them now ... playin' 'Comin' Through the Rye'

She was dressed in blue and she looked so lovely
just a gentle flower of a small town girl
Then he took her hand and they danced to the music
with a single smile ... she became his world
