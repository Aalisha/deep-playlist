I'll tell you a story, what happened a long time-a
And it won't happen any more, more, more, more, more, more
You tell that girl everything that you wanted to
And then she wanted a little bit more, more, more, more, more, more

Girls, girls are, they are so unpredictable
You can't believe what they tell you
Unpredictable, you gotta throw it away
Girls are so unpredictable, bull, bull, bull, bull, bull
