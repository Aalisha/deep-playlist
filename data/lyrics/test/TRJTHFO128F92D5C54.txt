Sometimes I get so tired,
Just trying to find a place to lay my head.
I look up to the sky,
I feel the warmest light comfort me.

I've seen the great heights,
Reminding me that I'm alive.
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna waste another day,
Or night,
I know there's something more
Than what we're living for,
I see it in the stars,
I feel it on the shore,
I know there's something,
I know there's something more.

I think we're all afraid,
That we might be alone,
