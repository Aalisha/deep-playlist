Here I go again
I hear those trumpets blow again
All aglow again
Taking a chance on love

Here I stand again
About to beat the band again
Feeling grand again
Taking a chance on love

I saw that cards were a frame up
I never would try
But now I'm taking the game up
And the ace of hearts is high

Things are mending now
I see a rainbow blending now
We'll have a happy ending now
...
