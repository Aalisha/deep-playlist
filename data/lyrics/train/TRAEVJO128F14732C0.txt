tonight.
fine night tonight
fine night tonight

it's going to be a fine night tonight
it's going to be a fine night tonight

it's a fine day,
people open windows.
they leave the houses,
just for a short while.

it's a fine day,
people open windows.
they leave the houses,
just for a short while.

it's going to be a fine night tonight
