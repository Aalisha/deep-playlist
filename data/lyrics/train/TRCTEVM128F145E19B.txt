You and me
A little different
Though we tried to stay the same
It never leaves
And when it changes it is still a waiting game

I wait for a lonely breath
I wait to surface from this death
Wait for the light to come
And take away these images I get
In my head

More than ever
I need to feel you
More than ever
I see the real you

You are me
A worst disaster would be waking up alone
...
