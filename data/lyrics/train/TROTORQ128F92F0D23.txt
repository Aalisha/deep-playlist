You missed the train, it jumped the track
You didn't move on 'cause you were caught looking back
And now the cheese comes with the whine
Your opportunity ran out this time
Going back, and again
You built a case no one could defend
But before you let it all out
I think there's a truth you should think about
While you're on your island somewhere
You'll be what you're wanting to be
...
