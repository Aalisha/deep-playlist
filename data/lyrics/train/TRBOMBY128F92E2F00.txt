How much of yourself do you give away
After someone's left your life in disarray?
It still hurts
But it won't show
Because I'm too proud
So you're never ever gonna know.

I'm on the dark side of the street,
Not the light side of the street.

It's packed at 2am.
I've got no coat,
Are you on your own?
I'm into you.
