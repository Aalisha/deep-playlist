You're a modern individual
With a mind that's strong and free
And it got you what you wanted
From the day you came to be

But when you got what you wanted
It could never quench your thirst
So you blamed the ones around you
For not warning you first

But now the ones around you
Are going and of no use
'Cuz as the last one vanishes
She takes the last excuse

There's no one left to blame
You're the cause of your pain

Love made you forget it
