Waiting for your call, I'm sick, call I'm angry

Call I'm desperate for your voice
Listening to the song we used to sing
In the car, do you remember
Butterfly, Early Summer
It's playing on repeat, Just like when we would meet
Like when we would meet
I was born to tell you I love you

And I am torn to do what I have to, to make you mine
Stay with me tonight
Stripped and pollished, I am new, I am fresh
