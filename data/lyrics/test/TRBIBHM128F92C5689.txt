we just got to take our time
its like nothing really matters,
so lets make this moment a crime
i know, i know you're left behind

i'll do my best to feel broke down(i'll do my best to feel broke down)
its been a minute, a second,
i'll wait for you to make a sound
but i know, i know you're taking time

maybe its just too late
(i've gotta get away)
everything feels the same
tell me it's not too late
(i've gotta away)
tell me its not to late

on and on and on you wait
and all the days, they fade away
and all the nights,
they've never felt the same
if i was wrong then i was wrong
and on and on and on and on
the things we do are never gonna change

well you haven't got a lot to say
but you never want to stop
you always want to feel this way
i know i know you're taking time

maybe its just too late
(i've gotta get away)
when everything feels the same
(i've gotta get away)
tell me its not to late

on and on and on you wait
and all the days, they fade away
and all the nights,
...
