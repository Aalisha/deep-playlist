By Desmond Child and David Landau

Take my hand
Show me that you're human
You've been to cool school
But it's only left you lonesome
Take my hand
Loosen up your act some
Don't put my love on trial

Chorus:
Let me be the
Let Me Be The One You Love
Let Me Be The One You Love
You got big old moons for eyes
Let me see the sun come up
Let Me Be The One You Love
