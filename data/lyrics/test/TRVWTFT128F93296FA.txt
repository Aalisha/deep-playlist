I operate a searchlight
From a tower through a window
Many hours I spend looking for you
Ever since you've been gone

So I've been looking for you, baby
Every morning and every evening
You never said the reasons
But you said we'd meet again

And when the storms that you once threw
Get thrown back at you
And you just can't stand to stand in your own skin
I'll let you in

Well, I control the weather
