The Concerto of the Desperado
R-double-O-T-S check the flow
If you know like I know then you know the motto
That's all the fake shit got to go

In the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro
My poetry is set like a U.F.O
The maestro, the lyricist concerto
My physical play the role of a vessel
The level of my lyrics law manifesto
My thoughts wrestle and attack with the killer instincts
Of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without vanilla my soliloquy profess my ability to just
Stimulate you like the best sensimilla

The half life the Philladellpophila proceed
Hither is my death flower blow your tower to smithe
Reens to fiends catch another rhyme gripper
Deeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper
Unorthodox, Hip-Hop, minister
Than a Serengeti cheetah my thoughts swifter
You lose your balance when the sound hits ya

So check for the, fifth militia
A poet's under pressure stressin' that you get the picture
Even if it means you gotta hang over the banister
