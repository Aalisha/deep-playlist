(I sit here watching the clock tick)
(Why am I waiting)
Sitting on my bed now, waiting for you to come home
Counting all the minutes, anticipating
It's about time now, you know our love is so real
Stronger than the feelings I've ever known
Why am I waiting for you
There's no time for dreaming, be true
Why am I waiting for you
Respect my love, just be there, be true
Tell me all my lonely nights, tell me
Don't wanna play your games
The way that I'm feeling
Is it just a childish time
Show me your heart, show me your mind
