I'll proclaim you to the father
If you proclaim me to the people
My father said, "Church, it's in your heart, son"
You don't always need a steeple
A preacher's truths aren't alway shown
If you follow a heart, make sure it's your own
One man's lifted up to Heaven
One man's cast into Hell
the first man's beliefs are the second man's prison
the second man's beliefs are the first man's jail
