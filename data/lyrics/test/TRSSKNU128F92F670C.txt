Don't talk to me about what you've done
Ain't nothing changed, it all goes on
And they'll keep laughing till the end

I've seen 'em drive around in cars
All look the same, get drunk in bars
And don't talk back, we got no social rights

Oh, perfect day
What more to say?
Don't need no-one to tell me what I don't already know
...
