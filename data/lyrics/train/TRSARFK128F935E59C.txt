- When your around I can see so clearly through the rain;
Theres something bout' the way that you hold me, keeps me into you that is why I know gotta be the one for me.
1-This must be divine intervention.
Heaven must know that I need you, see first I tried so hard to refrian from it somehow, love made its way, straight to my heart.

gotta be, gotta be, yeah gotta be the one.
