Say it again!
Say it again!
I know you love to
Hear yourself speak
words that you think.
I can't follow

And maybe that's the way
you and I will always relate.

You always had
The quickest wit,
The quickest quips,
And I can't keep up.
It's clear that you have
a rare gift of gab
And I'm just jealous.
