I was born on the border of a tundra
Under a star spangled sky
All my life I'd wonder
About the wide world outside
And then one day, like a saga
Along came my savior so handsome
And he asked my father for my hand
And he promised adventure

Across the bridges
Along the highways
Long lonely road
Over ridges
Through the valleys

On the new shore he kept my passport for safety
Told me I was legal
