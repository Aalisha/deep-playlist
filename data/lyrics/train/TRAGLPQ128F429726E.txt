You are not alone tonight
Imagine me there by your side
It's so hard to be here so far away from you
I'm counting the days till 
I'm finally done
I'm counting them down, yeah, one by one
It feels like forever till I return to you
But it helps me on those lonely nights
It's that one thing that keeps me alive

Knowing that you wait for me
Ever so patiently
