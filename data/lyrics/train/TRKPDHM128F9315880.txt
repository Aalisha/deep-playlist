Come they told me - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
A newborn king to see - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
Our finest gifts we bring - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
To lay before the King - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum
So, to honor Him - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
When we come

Little baby - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
I am a poor boy too - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
I have no gifts to bring - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
That's fit to give a King - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum, rum-pa-pum-pum
Shall i play for You - pa-rum-pa-pum-pum
