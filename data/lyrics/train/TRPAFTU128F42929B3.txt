Yes on me, it's poor me, you must take pity on poor me
I ain't got nobody, take pity on poor me
You may go, you may stay,
but she'll come back some sweet day
By and by, sweet mama, by and by
Don't the moon look pretty shinin' down through the tree?
Oh, I can see Bertha Lee,
Lord, but she can't see me
You may go, you may stay,
...
