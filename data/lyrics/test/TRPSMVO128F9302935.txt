Talking, kissing that eve
She was hot, she was sweet
I had a drink in the bar
Took a walk on the street
And later on that night, I went back home
When I was back home,
I heard her voice
She wasnâ€™t talking to me
But through the telephone
She left a message on my answering machine
It said
Well, love, love is on my mind
Love, love, love makes me feel alive
