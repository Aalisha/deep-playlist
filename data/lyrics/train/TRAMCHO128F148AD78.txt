I got the key, key to Gramercy Park

Every night
Looking for the fight
Thoughts on the left
The action's on the right
As you know, the id wasn't meant to be starved

Face white
Revenge of the Hittites
When you're inside
And you thought to take a walk in the park
Think someone's about to be carved

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
...
