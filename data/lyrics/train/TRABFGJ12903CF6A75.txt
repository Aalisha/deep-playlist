Just a little lovin' will go a long way
And you'll make me happy the rest of my days
Put your arms around me then I'll be your slave
'Cause just a little lovin' will go a long way

Ever since the time began love has ruled the world
Eve and Adam set the pace and started at a whirl
I met you and now I know that you're the one for me
