Even as the world began the stars they sang
And all the Angels shouted for joy, shouted for joy
And looking back through history Your people they have always had
A song they must sing, a song they must sing

We are the people of God
We'll sing Your song
Here on the earth

All over the world Your song will resound
All over the world Your praise ring out
We're living to see Your name and renown
All over the world

Young and old, near and far there's a place for every heart
To join in Your song, join in Your song
Every nation, tribe and tongue, come together join as one
Give glory to God, glory to God

We are the people of God
We'll sing Your song
Here on the earth
