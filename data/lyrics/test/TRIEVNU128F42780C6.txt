Love, love is a thousand times stronger than me, stronger than you
Well if you want to be a soldier go marching off to war
You think you're going to be a hero but we've heard it all before, boy

Love, love is a thousand times dearer than me, dearer than you'
Well if you want to be a leader, Then go and lead the way
You're never going to give us freedom no matter what you say, boy'
