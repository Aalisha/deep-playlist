Only a Woman sees
Only a Woman knows secrets she gotta keep
She's barely holding on
Only a Woman cries
With force that will shake the skies
Only a Woman bleeds
Only a Woman
(2x)

Up before the sun (like a man)
On top of my game
I stay strong (like a man)
On the grind for the ones that I love (like a so-called man)
Did I mention
It's that time of the month

Leaving work
Days just gettin' started
Between the bills and these men
There's no end to this drama
Sometimes I'm at the point feel like givin' up
But if I don't take care of me
Then tell me who will?

Don't you remember the pain
And the mood swings (Tell me)
I still go through the day with a smile on my face
(I don't think so)
Gotta headache, backache, on top of that I'm crampin'
When that energy comes it's that time of the month
That's whyâ¦â¦â¦.
