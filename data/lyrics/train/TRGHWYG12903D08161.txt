Stranded in the streets of San Francisco
A rusty car pulled along side of me
I looked behind the wheel and I started to squeal
An idol's face was staring at me.

Don't preach to me
Mr. integrity

Sittin' shotgun, out of my brain
Im up for draggin' through the art ghettos
Stepped on the gas, gums started to flap
Punk rock manifestoes

Spittin', fumin',
The streets are filled with so much glass that I wanted to break
Eyes spinnin' 'round
