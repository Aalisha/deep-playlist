Hello it's me
Your son again
I'll let myself in
Back to save your life
Back to ruin your day
I can't make you well
I can't make you love me
But I'm not leaving here without you

Steve's boy won't let you die
Alone in the desert with fear in your eyes
You can't break me
You can't make me go away
Stop trying to push me out
I'll never say when, you never showed me ow
