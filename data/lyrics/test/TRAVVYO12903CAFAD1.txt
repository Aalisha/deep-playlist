Bring it back or when it's over take me home, I'm healing
And when in doubt you'll live without all you have known, you've been feeling

So what if you said it's over and out for you my friend
When painting the view, I'm standing beside but I'm all over you

If I run tonight would you promise to be there
Would you say the words that comfort me, they're all around I swear
If I run tonight and take it overboard with a word or two I give to you
It's all I can afford
All I can afford

Now it's just another scene to drag me in for protection
