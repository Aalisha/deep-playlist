Every night and every day my heart feels the pain
i wake up to the thought of you and i call your name
no one ever made me feel the way you do
nothing in this world i wouldn't do for you
but now i've got to let go
We don't stand a chance
in this wild romance, my tender heart
maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again
with my tender heart.
we don't stand a chance
in this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad
knowing that i'm not the one you want
i can't hold on to my tender heart
I never thought i'd be the one who would play the fool
...
