And I say no (no), no more, I can't see you again
But I don't know if I mean it
I don't know if I just pretend
I make up my mind the feeling's dead
But who's fooling who inside my head
And I know that I had the feeling
That something's wrong
It's been out of my control for much too long
I always seem to want to fall in love
With the iron hand inside the velvet glove
But it feels too good

Oh Woman, I need you (do you want me to beg)
I lost my pride long ago (and you know it)
Oh Woman, I love you (when you take me to bed)
My private beatings never show
Woman when you make love you close your eyes
(And I get any closer to the mystery)
Oh Woman, I need you (you must be the one)
