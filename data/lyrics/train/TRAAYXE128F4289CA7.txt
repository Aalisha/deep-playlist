wesley willis starts to break down 
feels the beat and hits the dance floor 
i will listen to the radio 
still i can't hear you on the telephone 

it's a shakedown so count from one to three 
and shake your booty 'til the early dawn 
you gotta be laid back, rock to obscurity 
then you will surely find there's nothing wrong with me
