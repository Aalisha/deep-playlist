Well we jumped all night on the trampoline
and when you kissed the sky it made your sister scream
you ate our chips
and you drank our coke
then you showed me mars through your telescope
wooho Grace
save your money for the children
wooho Grace
save your money for the children
woo ho Grace
save your money for the children
woo ho grace
save your money for the children
oh grace
save your money for the children
