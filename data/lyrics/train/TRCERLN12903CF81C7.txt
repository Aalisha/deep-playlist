Stop! The first one to hit the cop wins.
His death was so obvious.
Make up the things that you did.
I hid in bushes, I was tripping on thizz.
Description, of no sir you can't ignore.
The lights they are blinding, and you man are such a bore.
Please smash the target, 
please smash the target, 
please smash the target, 
right where the heart sits.

Whoever said we had to stop this from happening?
My plans changed abruptly and you chose to flee this unstable setting.
And I'll only survive in this life...
I got that necklace, I got that watch,
I copped that blow torch, off your front porch.
I'll only survive if it's you by my side... 
and I'll only survive in this life...
I got that bottle of jack, I got five on that sack.
If this fails then I'll bail you out of jail.
It's so obvious you're constantly blocking me from rational thinking.

Maybe I look good in leather,
In my bed I pluck your feathers,
...
