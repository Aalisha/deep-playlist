Inner city sky rise over town at night
You pushed me to the top floor so we could see the sights
I could tell that you wanted to
Jump in the pool
Jump in the pool
I looked at you I knew you wanted to
Jump in the pool
Jump in the pool

I push out
I breathe in
A stillness turning away
Don't look back
Don't pretend
