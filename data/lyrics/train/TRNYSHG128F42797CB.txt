This isn't living now
A thing my father said to me
And get a haircut, boy
If you want a chance in respectable society
Why did you stop writing?
I knew you had some trouble, son
But you should know by now
That my number doesn't change
Because my dirty deed is done

All I need from you
And that's all
Regardless of whatever you do
And that is that you understand
That I'll never turn my back on you
...
