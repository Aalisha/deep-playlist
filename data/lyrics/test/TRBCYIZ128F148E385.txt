I'm riding high
I'm riding down the highway
I'm riding high
I can't feel my body
I'm riding high

There's a funk in the freezer
I'm riding high
I want to take you home to trip with me
Can't free my mind
Wanna take you on a love high
Can't free my mind
Wanna take you on a love high

I'm riding high
Everybody is a love junkie
I'm riding high
...
