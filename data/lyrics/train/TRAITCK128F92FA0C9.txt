This may seem all too confusing
How I could walk away
From something so weird
But you see it all got too demanding, yeah

And I just didn't care, I just didn't care
If I cared, if I cared
Lately I've been left wanting

But not wanting you
Attraction that once was no longer there
And it's sucks to be taken, for granted
When the veil is drawn and there's only air

I had to walk away
Give up something I loved
For what I loved even more
...
