Everything is said and done
When times are tough, no where to run
We try to play a ruthless game
It almost drove us both insane
So now we see that time is on our side
Come on, get in, lets go, I'll take you for a ride
This car is brand new and full of gas
No cops around so let's drive fast
The lights are green, no cars, no need to pass
The top is down, the engine's strong
The radio is playing your favorite song
I think this might be the best ride of our life
