A child was born in silence
And winter rose to clothe itself
With a voice of one who weeps
I curse this memory
You held the hand of hope
With glory's wreath
And deceiver's promise
The vows your lips have sworn
Tomorrow wear decay
Stifled sobs
Bow to cold laughter
The breeze is speechless
As the dust drinks the dew
A child-like hope
With fear betrothed 
Never ceases to kiss my feet
This is my final lamenting kiss
I have spun my last thread
