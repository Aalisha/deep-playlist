On a bed of nails
I try to rest my head
Every nail a curse
I should have faced but fled
I'd do it again
Takes much more to learn my lesson
Things come to an end
In this case that doesn't happen

Make me see
Why everything that's new to you
Is old to me
I breathe and bleed
Even if I wanted to change
It would all be for nothing

Always dumbing down
Pieces to make them fit
Top of the world now
No more, it's done, I quit
It's just like I said
Caught inside won't let it go
...
