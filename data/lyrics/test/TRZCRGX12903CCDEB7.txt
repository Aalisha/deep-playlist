Rain come down, rain come down
Rain come down, rain come down

I see unnecessary death, I see life just gone away
I see souls out of control, I see the earth's pain, I feel the earth's pain
I see the powers of manipulation and I pass away
I see the sleep walkers who walks asleep doing it again

I watch how they do the music, I watch how they do the children
I see wars, I see famine, I see pestilence
I see disease, break, incest, racism, I see these things
I seen what the lack of knowledge can do to a civilization
