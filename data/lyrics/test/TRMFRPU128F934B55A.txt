The smile in your face hits the dark light
Another day passes you by
Try to escape fro within to the outside
But something tells me to stay

I'll open my eyes and I'm losing it all
And again the pain slips away
There's nowhere to hide but it seems like
You ask yourself why do you fear the day?

You're in my dreams
I'll focus my attention
As I'm browning in cries
I'm close to the edge, there's so much fear deep inside
...
