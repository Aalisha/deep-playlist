You talk about money
You talk about soul
I guess you better get some before you get too old
Lay down on your side and say bye bye

You talk about money
You talk about soul
I guess you'd better get some before you get too too too old
Lay down on your side and say bye bye

I know they're sayin' that I never tried to stay by your side
