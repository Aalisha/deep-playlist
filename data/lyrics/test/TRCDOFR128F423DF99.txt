Lie to me
I wont lie
tape your mouth shut
lie to me
I wont lie
swallow your tongue

forget it all I have you buried in my walls
ill use your skin to cover up my scares

the place you lay in a bloody hall of fame
the ropes that tied your hands right by your side
the place you lay in a bloody hall of fame
the ropes that tied your hands right by your side

so now your screaming at the top of your lungs
hoping for someone to come
hoping they'll bring a gun
...
