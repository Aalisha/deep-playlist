The night I laid my eyes on you
felt everything around me move
Got nervous when you looked my way
But you knew all the words to say
Then your love slowly moved right in
All this time oh my love where you been
Mi amore don't you know
My love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet
