I'm gettin' hot
I've got to give a shot
She wants it all
And that's a lot

I'm gettin' ready
The love's lookin' steady
It's gettin' sticky
I thought she might miss me
She looked at me and said

I need a little
Push, push
Gonna give a little
Push, push
If ya take a little
Push, push
Then you'll get a little
Push, push

She's lookin' fine
Flashin' like a neon sign
...
