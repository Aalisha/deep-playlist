It's so hard lovin' you
But I don't wanna let you go

Little darlin' I need you
(Little darlin' I need you)
Little darlin' I love you
(Little darlin' I love you)
Little darlin' I want you
(Little darlin' I want you)
Little darlin' I've got to have you
(Little darlin' I've got to have you)

And if it means giving up my life
I'm going to give it up
(Give it up)
Give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
But I don't mind, I don't mind

I'm willing to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

Darlin' I need you
(Little darlin' I need you)
