Dear God,
I have a letter here from me to dad,
and I want you to know it might be a little sad.
(Here it Goes)
Dear dad, I really didnt get to know you
Sometimes I sit and wonder and it makes me blue
But there is one memory that stays on the back of my mind
And this memory got me thinking bout you all the time
Oh Pa, I swear we miss you so
