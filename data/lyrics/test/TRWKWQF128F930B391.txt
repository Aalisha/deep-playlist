late night salvation
your radio station
numbing the pain that you feel
it’s only in silence you hear someone calling
only in song can you heal
watching a record
skipping a line
painting your midnight sun
oh, the colors that abound
from unbelieveable sounds
yet only left glowing is one

and you’re burning blue lights
all the while you sit alone
but i’m waiting to be there
when i see your face i’m taking you home
...
