He had a Martin I had a Fender
We were thirteen years of age
Out back in the tool shed
We were searching for a sound
Every day all through the summer
We'd rock 'n roll 'n rage
All the neighbors kept complaining
But it never slowed us down

We sang three verses of Dixie
Can't Get No Satisfaction
Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35
Try A Little Tenderness
A Whiter Shade Of Pale
Turn! Turn! Turn!
For What It's Worth
And Long Black Veil

We moved out to California
Shooting for the stars
