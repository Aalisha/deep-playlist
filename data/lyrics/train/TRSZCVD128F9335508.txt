Now lay me down on market street
I'm lookin' for some spare change
A coastguard ship has been lookin' for me
And I might have to change my name
Here comes Uncle Sam again
With the same old bag of beans
The local chief's on the radio
He's got some hungry mouths to feed
Goin' back to Alcatraz.

Lay me back down here on the highway
One hundred and one ways to go
Solitary is so confinin'
To the legend of Geronimo
Oh, I know I could bring the rain
Used to dance for ABC
And all the braves down on death row
...
