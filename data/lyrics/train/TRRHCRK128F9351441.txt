Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Suck your lemonade
In the sun

Whens it's hot and tropical
You drip just like glue
That sunlight's burning into you
You're dripping all over

Whens it's hot and tropical
You drip just like glue
That sunlight's burning into you
You're dripping all over

Suck your lemonade
In the sun
Watch it run
Off your tongue
Suck your lemonade
Watch it run
Out of your pink tongue
