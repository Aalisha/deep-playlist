I don't care 'bout others say
I can't let them lead my way
I won't let them rule my world
I won't let them change my life
People, people, people talk...

people talking, talking, talking...
people talking, talking, talking...
people talking, talking, talking...

people talking all the time!

c'mon! c'mon!

bring it up now!

people talk, about this about that
but let's talk about other people
and people say how much you're liking this
cause you chit chat chat chit
i know it's a habit, but it send me into a mad fit
i'm on top with my own life
but you keep stabbin', stabbin' like an old knife
turn around and walk, yeah
is it true what I can say that people talk? a-ha

keep you head high, walk your way - people talk
and don't care about what they say - yeah, people talk
keep you head high, walk your way
I want to live my life my own way

c'mon! c'mon!

so let's talk about sex
