She came home, just won the game
Long time struggle she fulfilled her dream
All she wanted was to make you proud
You weren't there

He had his birthday a few days ago
He got some presents, a big party too
And there were congratulation calls
As the years before, not ever one from you

You weren't there, distant far away
It's like this everyday
They see you in their heads
Wonder if you'll come
Afraid to close their eyes
