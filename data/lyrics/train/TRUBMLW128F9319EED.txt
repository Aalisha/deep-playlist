I push my levels to zero with distortin
Boost two compression enhancers the message I'm recordin
Live from California, warnin night to mornin
The illest squad this side of Earth is now formin
itself into a whirlwind, spin pattern the outcome
be tragic, tell me what you want I still doubt them
I hit up the beat unique
For seven-eighths I levitate, hit save not delete
You could get in the game, but who's ahead in the race?
To a duststorm, when it clears there's no trace
of where I was, was not, or how I got there
The image you recall so clear has disappeared

Yo. yo I make moves and get my passport decorated
