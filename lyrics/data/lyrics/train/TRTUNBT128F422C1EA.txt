She walks alone and when she loves, her love's so wrong
She don't need a man
She won't stand by what she can't stand
Like why like in wars you all stand in line
Now watch her pass you by
She knows her sins with humility
And reaches for the light

With aching knees and back the way is hard to bear
but she carries it with a smile
She walks beautiful, she walks beautiful
she walks beautiful by herself
She walks beautiful, she walks beautiful
she walks beautiful by herself

She walks alone
...
