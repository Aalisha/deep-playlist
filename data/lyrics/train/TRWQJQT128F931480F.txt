Come on over here baby
My my, hey hey hey hey hey hey yeah
Whoa, oh yeah
I want you come now

Where do you go when you need good lovin'?
And how will you know if a love is very hard to find?
How do you say, that you need it everyday?
Well if you look my way, you won't be wastin' time

Just come on over here
And I will take care
Of your every need
'Cause I've got love to give to you
Just come on over here
And don't you worry dear
'Cause I've got more
I've got more than you know what to do with

What do you do when you're not satisfied?
And when you've done all that you can you know you tried, oh yeah?
