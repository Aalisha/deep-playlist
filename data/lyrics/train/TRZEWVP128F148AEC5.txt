Baby, you know you mean the world to me
That's why I can't keep you in this situation
Where I can hurt you
Can I talk to you? Okay

First of all, I wanna tell you that all I do is have love for you
No matter we go separate ways I still ride for you
'Cause you're the truth can't be replaced
You the type of girl that make a nigga go out and get the ring

But the problem is I'm not positive
That I can give tha commitment that you're asking for
'Cause right now I'm young and know you're the one
I can't guarantee that I could be the one you want

You want someone who is faithful
I'm not admittin' I can't do it just don't wanna put you through it
If I may happen to see one
She may holla, I may holla but I wouldn't wanna do that to you, no

Girl, I feel that I'll be cheating you if I continue to see you
'Cause you're ready to get serious I'm not 'cause I'm still curious
See I'd rather keep it real and tell you how I feel
'Cause I think you're beautiful and I don't wanna hurt you, no

Girl, I feel that I'll be cheating you if I continue to see you
