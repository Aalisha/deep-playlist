Life in prison! Is it enough
For what they do?
One day soon, so very close
It could be you
A life for a life, that's the way
The only way I say
The chair is best, oh so sweet
The power's all we pay

The power's all we pay
We'll end it all today
The power's all we'll pay

Thirty years is what they do
Less if they are good
All this time we pay their way
'Cos goodies say we should
Then they're out, they're on the loose
...
