The love between the two of us was dying
And it got so bad I knew I had to leave
But halfway down that highway when I turned around I
saw
My little daughter running after me
Crying

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
