There's blood in the sink and he's plunging his wrists in
A hangover halo is washing away
Mechanic-school dropout stares into the mirror
Stands up in his derelict daydreams

Always too tall, always walked around wearing
A smile that was never quite sure of itself
Planning a future of failures inflicted
In phone calls from strip clubs and bail bonds
...
