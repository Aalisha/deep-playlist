(50 Cent)

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Little Tyrone tired of gettin' his ass whipped so he holdin' that gat down
His momma think it's my fault cause he listen to "back down"
Bobby was a fucking bum he pumpin' now
He keeps her fresh chicks white T's and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock-a-whiner we wont put the yack down
Eric had a jump shop but he's smoking crack now
The Lunatics the Lost Boys cheap shit is wack now
Country boots shrowden crackers got him on his back now
And Sean runnin' round with his gat now
Up in niggaz cribs sayin' where that money at pound
And Saundra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch travel the world she runnin' round boostin'
And Toya got these bad ass kids they a nusince
Their baby daddy's never come around they useless
Everynow and then I come through on some new shit
