(Just a little) 
(Just a little bit) 
(Just a little) 
(Just a little bit) 

Babe, I don't want it all (Just a little) 
I just want a little bit 
I don't want it all (Just a little bit) 
I just want a little bit 

Just a little teeny bit, just an eeny-weeny bit of your love 

Turn your lamp down low (Just a little) 
Baby, I love you so 
Turn your lamp down low (Just a little bit) 
Baby, I love you so 
Just a little teeny bit, just an eeny-weeny bit of your love 

(Just a little)
