Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise?
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise?
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise?
Ain't love, ain't love, ain't love a surprise?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Another dollar, another day
Some old routine in my way
My eyes are achin', my body tired
I'm all strung up you know I feel so wired

And then you walk into the room
Time stops, everything drops, boom boom boom
Vision of love, Heaven's above
I feel your body like a velvet glove
Because

You're a sight for sore eyes
As a matter of fact at the drop of a hat
You're my love surprise
...
