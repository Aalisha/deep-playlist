Baby, I am truly sorry
I walked out on you tonight
Now I'm worried
I want everything to be alright
I'm writing you this letter
Watching the rain outside
Hoping for the better
But we always seem to collide
I'm under suspicion
A ghost in your vision
I get nightmares during day
It's the price that I pay
...
