There are memories deep in the heart of my soul
Feeding my dreams with a fire
We seek what is lost and together at last
We finally find what the pain is inside

Worlds all forgotten and buried in time
A love we can't deny
So let our legends guide us
Safely through the dark all

We see the light
A prophecy unknown
I see it in your eyes
We're reaching paradise
