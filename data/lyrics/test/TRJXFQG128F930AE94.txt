Corruption
This world is full of Corruption (na, na, na)
Corruption
This world is full of so much vice and crime
Prostitution, revolution
Another scandal every day
Sneaky deals on Wall Street
They got the whole wide world in a mess

Corruption
This world is full of corruption (na, na, na)
Corruption
This world is full of so much vice and crime
Vote for me, I'll set you free
That's what the politicians say
Makin' promises they can't keep
They got people living, dying in the streets
