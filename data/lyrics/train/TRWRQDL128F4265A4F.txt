She walks down the street a-knockin? 'em dead
Store window dummies even turn their heads
Sure enuff
Powerful stuff

When I saw her I burned my black book
Made a blind man take a, a second look
Sure enuff, I think I? m in love
And that? s powerful stuff

Naugahyde skirt, black stack heels
Red copper hair, dig the wig is unreal
