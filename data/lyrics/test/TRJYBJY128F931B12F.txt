Searching for a reason.
I'm livin in the wasteland.
Of loneliness and treason.
Like swimming down in quicksand.

But baby with you I would like to go...
Where no one's ever gone.
And baby with you I would like to do...
What no one's ever done.

Baby we can do it, take the time.
Do it right, we can do it baby.
Do it tonight.
Baby we can do it.
Take the time, do it right.
We can do it baby.
Do it tonight (we can do it baby, baby, baby. baby...)
Do it tonight (we can do it baby, baby, baby. baby...)

I have every reason.
