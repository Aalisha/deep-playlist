Still they dig for gold
Fooled on city streets
With no regard for mine
We watch the same repeats
Repeat the same mistakes
And swore we'd get it right next time

Riding high in Wonderland
Another runner in the UK
See the crossing from Wonderland
Shipping it back to the USA

We gave all hope and house
...
