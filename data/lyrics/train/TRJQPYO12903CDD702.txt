I am duality, a being so consumed with the darkness inside of me,
Through this pain I must endure, These beings that still haunt me

I am adversity, within the sunder of the essence of my very soul
In this rage I shall remain, these creatures that become me

Come forth and purge yourself for what you are,
Reveal thyself and become what you will
