Oh, my mother was just a girl, seventeen
Oh, my mother was just a girl, seventeen
And my dad was passing through
Doing things a man will do
And my mother was just a girl, seventeen

It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
And I have a life to claim
Though I really don't know my name
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all

Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
...
