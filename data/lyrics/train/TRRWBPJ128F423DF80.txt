Tramp
What you call me?
Tramp
Oh you didn't
You don't wear continental clothes or Stetson hats
Well I tell you one doggone thing
It makes me feel good to know one thing

I know I'm a lover
Matter of opinion, baby
That's all right, Mama was
So
Papa too
And I'm the only child
Lovin' is all I know to do

You know what, Otis?
What?
You're country
That's all right
You straight from the Georgia woods
That's good
You know what? You wear overalls
And big old brogan shoes
And you need a haircut, tramp
