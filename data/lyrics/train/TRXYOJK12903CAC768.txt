A few Good men

Strap up the boots, IÂ'm ready to shoot
Load the ammo, Bone Soprano wit glocks and green camo
I play rappers like they grand pianos, a general
Call shots like IÂ'm Joe Bonanno, what, The West is back
Sep this dude ainÂ't black, he Latino dogg and rock Gringos
Black, Indians, Palestinians, and Phillipinos, and cash money like Vegas casinos
IÂ'm armed and ready, palms is sweaty, kinda like em
Sep I got a sharp machete, and IÂ'm quick to toss wack rappers of a levy
Words is heavy, kinda like a 6-4 Chevy, uh
Hip-Hop will never be the same, itÂ's time for change
IÂ'm bout to rearrange the game, ready to fight back
So when they say whoÂ's that, tell em itÂ's just the king of the conscious rap
