Searching the Northern passage to the Indies
And yes we found the northern passage.
The northern passage to hell

This world it turned into ice
The sun has set for the months to come
A landscape in the twilight zone
The somberness of winter

I walk between pools of frozen blood
It's 1896 my voyage has stranded before the gates of hell
