Laying down with ghosts and owls
I change myself into ground and sky
While the moon paints my skin
While my soul is close to her life

Lullaby among the oaks
I remember ancient rites
Lost into my wonder night
Lullaby until I cry

You reborn from dust
To your ancient life
You reborn from past
You reborn from light
