She likes to read I like tv
She's checking out my good friend steve
She likes a beer I like a shot
Her parents think I'm selling pot

She likes the boys in the band
She goes and plays in the strand
When I take pictures in public she complains
The pictures of my life gone down the drain

I like to drive she likes to walk
She caught me jackin in my sock
I like a drink she likes a dance
I'm drunk again I cut my pants

She likes the boys in the band
I like the surf she likes the sand
