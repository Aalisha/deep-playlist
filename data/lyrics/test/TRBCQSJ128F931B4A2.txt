I lit my love and watched it burn
Asking nothing in return
Except the lessons I will learn
From holding crazy faith

I've been touched by that bright fire
Down to the root of my desire

I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen the love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy, I know but my faith says so
It tells me
