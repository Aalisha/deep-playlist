Congos - Can't Come In
(Cedric Myton)

*You keep on knocking but you can't come in
You've got to be clean
You keep on knocking but you can't come in
The door is locked on you, don't you know that it's true

**When the Bridegroom cometh
You've got to be ready
When the Bridegroom cometh
You've got to be clean

***There were ten Brethrens together
Five were wise, and five were foolish, foolish
So you keep on knocking but you can't come in...

The rolling stone gathers no moss

Too late, too late shall be your pride

You keep on knocking but you can't come in
You've got to be clean
To rally round the Red, Gold and Green
You keep on knocking but you can't come in
...
