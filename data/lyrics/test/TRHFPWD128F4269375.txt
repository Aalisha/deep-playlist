Here all alone again
You say you want your freedom
And now I fly to where the winds callin' me
Winds callin' me
Remember when we had the good times
The good times
Take me away - to another
Take me away - to another
Take me away - to another day

Every time I fly I got to please my mind
I have to know just what you're doing
You can never cry on the wings of life
No matter how or what they say

Need somebody gonna hold my hand
Now every time I've been down
Every time I've been down
You called but I could hear them pray
You don't want it but you can't find a way
