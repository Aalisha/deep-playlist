So I finally found the way
To lessen all your pain
What you'd give to feel again
For even just a day
And as you search to find the words
Of someone to relate
You realize all your faults,
Were never their mistakes

And everything starts to
Fall apart
Covered in ink to, hide these scars
And everything ends the way it starts
I just want to feel like, I belong

Could this be the one last time
