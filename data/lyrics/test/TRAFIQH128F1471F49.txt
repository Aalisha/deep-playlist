I don't know what I'm doing wrong
Maybe I've been here too long
The songs on the radio sound the same
Everybody just looks the same
But then last night was so much fun
And now your sheets are dirty
The streets are dirty too
But you never look back over what you've done

Remember when you were young
You'd lose yourself
In the morning, you know he won't remember a thing
In the morning, you know it's gonna be alright

Uh, wake him up, warm him up
Put him on the stage, well
The boy can't help it, it's not his fault
Just a dangerous dangerous age
But then every night's still so much fun
And you're still out there darling
