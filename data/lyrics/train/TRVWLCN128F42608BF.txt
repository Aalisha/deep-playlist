(Sky Saxon/Daryl Hooper/Jan Savage)
I'm now a man
But why did it take me oh so long
I'm now a man
My mind's floating out toward the sky
This old world always shows me something new
Everytime, girl, I'm with you
I'm now a man
I'm now a man
MY mind's running away wiwith the wind
And each new day I find more rainbows we can play
Don't you find it hard? To keep your feelings in your backyard
