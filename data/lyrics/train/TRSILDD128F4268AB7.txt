September '75 I was 47 inches high,
My mom said by Christmas I would have
A badass mother GI Joe, for your little minds to blow
I still got beat up after class

Yeah, now I'm big and important
One angry dwarf, and 200 solemn faces are you
If you really want to see me
Check the papers and the TV
Look who's tellin' who what to do
Kiss my ass
Goodbye

Don't give me that bullshit
You know who I am
I'm your nightmare little man
Vic you stole my lunch money, made me cry
Jane remember second grade?
Said you couldn't stand my face
Rather than kiss me
...
