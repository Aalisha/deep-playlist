I don't want you to hold me tight
Till you're mine to hold
And I don't even want you to stay all night
Just until the moon turns cold

All I need is black roses
White rhythm and blues
And somebody who cares when you lose
Black roses, white rhythm and blues

You say that somebody really loves you
You'd find her if you just knew how
...
