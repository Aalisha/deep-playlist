You need to fly, you need to flow
You need to let it all go
You need to fall but you say
"Criminal wicked, dirty, sticky don't touch"

Surf out the wave, we're at the age
Where we don't have to behave
And life is fast, oh don't you see
The clock's ticking for me and you

A time to live, a time to love
A time for fun you want to come here we go
Just dance with me, dance with me
Slide you up against the door, tell me

(This is good)
So what so bad
(This is good)
It drives me mad
(This is good)
So don't say no
(Dance with me tonight)
Baby it's so
(So good to be alive)

So what so bad
(This is good)
It drives me mad
(This is good)
So don't say no
(Dance with me tonight)
Baby it's so
(So good to be alive)

She'll take a crash, she'll take a dive
Let this all this will drift with the tide
And come to me, I got your salt skin
Dripping on the tip of my tongue

She'll close your eyes and kiss my lips
If you're as simple as this
We're here tonight and it's so criminal wicked
Dirty, sticky let's touch

A time to live, a time to love
...
