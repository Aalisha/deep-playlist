Get down
(hey-hey)

hey-hey
da-da-da-da-da-da-da
(repeat)
this how we get down
(repeat all)

(Meelah)
New in the neighborhood
Looking good to me
She's by your side, I can't deny
Got to know your name
You turn around, you see me now
I think its love I've found
My friends think I'm crazy
But I don't care cause baby I get down
