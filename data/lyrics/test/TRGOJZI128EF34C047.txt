I am talking but you can't quite hear what I say
I come closer
but you push me away
I should leave
but I don't have the strength
I can't think

Please can't you see that I am down on my knees
My heart's in you hand
and you squeeze
I want the whole thing
but you give me a part
it's time to start
so I push and you pull
and I don't know which way to go

Stop Me, Stop me from falling
cause I can see
See where this is going
If you love me
then why do you leave me
...
