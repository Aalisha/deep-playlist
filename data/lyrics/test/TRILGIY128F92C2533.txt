So I'll admit that it all started as a scam
'cos every girl wanted you and a year round tan
We know you're old but you're kind
You're rich and your heart is dicky

We'll meet at ten past now it's quarter to six
We'll spend the whole night making love on the sofa
It may sound funny but he wasn't supposed to

And then we both settled down to our favourite meal
