Oh, it's time to let it go

The world's got a funny way of turning 'round on you
When a friend tries to stab you right in the face
Losin' faith in everything I thought I hoped and knew
Don't sweat it, set off false pretense

Betray, you're not gonna be willin' to change
Yeah, and it doesn't seem likely to fade
Betray, you're not gonna be willin' to change
'Cause you know

In sacrifice
False pretense, you're letting go
Stop pretending, don't deny
