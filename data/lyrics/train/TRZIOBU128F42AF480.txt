You don't even know how much I love you
You don't even know that I adore you
I bet it would astound you if I told you now to
Just let all my love surround u

And every time you call me I start shaking
And me not telling you 'bout my heart aching
I bet it would astound you if I told you now that
I wanna let all my love surround u, ladies and gentlemen

If you knew what I thought about you, it's like the best thing I could find
Treat like honeydew, when I'm kissing you, I can't lie
And we're suppose to be just friends, benefits with no commitments
But I find myself missing you more than I should be

I got a picture of you, I keep it with me
You never knew that it was so deep
Sick over you, ain't that the truth
And it ain't hard to tell

You don't even know how much I love you
You don't even know that I adore you
I bet it would astound you if I told you now to
Just let all my love surround u
