Yeah, once again I start to wonder
Sailing thoughts on endless sea
Might be you I see reflected from afar
Could be just my fantasy

All my love and emotion
Life is nothing without you
Like a drop finds the ocean
I'm gonna find my way to you

Low thunder rollin'
Take me away, away
There's something callin'
Askin' me to play
...
