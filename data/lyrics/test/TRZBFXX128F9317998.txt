You always wanted
To be left alone
When they said to you
Those things won't matter anymore
Will it stay with you
And when the morning comes
Would you say that I lied
Or could you want to die
Over something that was equally
Measured in time
Not something that I wished for you
All those dreams you know that won't come true
They will all die alone for you
...
