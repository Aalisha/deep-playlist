Jah Jah is real! Jah Jah is real!

Dem gone. so far away
Dem gone. the hole a dem ago regret it one day
Every day you get up and wish to have a meal
now you get a cut and wish to have it heal

and still you can not accept that Jah Jah is real
Tell me Mr. Man whats the deal
You say you have everything sign and seel
Thought you won the case but nox you a appeal
You are the one who couldnt hear now you the one to feel
