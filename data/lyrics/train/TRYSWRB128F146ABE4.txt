She's got pizzazz
like a razzmatazz
I'd like to slide it in
but where do I begin

Wastes all my money
spends all my time
I ain't got no luck
can't change her mind

Chorus:
Blame it on you
I can't stand up
Blame it on you
I'm keepin' my mouth shut
Blame it on you
I can't see straight
Blame it on you
