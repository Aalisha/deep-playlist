She's crying a river, she helps everyone
There is so much sorrow, she has to be strong
She needs all her power, for helping the poor
Showing heaven to you
There's something to live for, oh what makes you glad
Oh she can't see it, if people are sad
A new star in heaven, she helps everyday
Hope she lives forever and a day

She has a heart, heart of an angel
She has a heart, heart of gold
It is more and more than a lonely heart can hold
She has a heart, heart of an angel
