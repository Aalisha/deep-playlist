Now this is who we are
I am no one's
I am no one's hero
I am no one
For we are not the giant men
That some may think
YOU are faithful when we are not
So I'd like to tell this story
The way it is meant to be

Without the burden that's in our hearts
None of us would have ever found YOU
For YOU are faithful when we are not
YOU began a work
