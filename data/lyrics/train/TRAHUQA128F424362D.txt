Ah, makin' the scene, I really mean
You could be there with me and make believe
I'll find a place for us to be alone
Here in the depths of our emotion
Don't you know, baby

Get set everybody
(Get set)
We're on our way
(We're on our way)
To meet you
Too late everybody
(Too late)

We're on our way
(We're on our way)
To nowhere
(To nowhere I will be)
And I will be there

Kick out your seat, let's elevate
Hold on to what you know is gonna break
