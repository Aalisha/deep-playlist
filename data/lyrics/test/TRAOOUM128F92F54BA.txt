these words I write to you my dear
are sparks to turn the dark to light
invariable presence
(so you know that I'm with you)
if the weight it seems too great
may this melody invigorate
and empower your persistence

prepared a splint in your soul
they got it

the world is yours to devour

these notes I pen to you my friend
are swords to slice through your distress
...
