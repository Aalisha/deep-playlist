Th-Th-This beat is hypnotic
I wanna ride like a chauffeur
The sound of zonic's
Controlling me just like a robot
I go bionic, so D-D-DJ put it on
I'm losing logic and cruising deeper in the zone

(David Jassy:)
It's so cinematic
Charismatic

(David Jassy Ashley Tisdale:)
G-Got me froze up

(David Jassy:)
This psychopathic
Beat is something

(David Jassy Ashley Tisdale:)
I need a dose of
I'm systematic
Mo-Moving every single bone
There's no mechanic
That can't understand what I'm on

(Ashley Tisdale:)
Let's crank it up {crank it up}
Until the walls cave in
Crank it up {Crank it up}
Put the record on spin
Cause I am ready to party
Gonna get my girls and get naughty
