Lost in darkness - like a shadow there I was
Always searching for tomorrow yet to come

Never thought I would see again
See the light shine upon me

Can't you see me coming?
Coming for You baby
Coming there to take you from the light
Can't you hear me calling?
Calling for you baby
So you better take on to the night
I'm the rising son!

I was haunted
but now I broke free from the spell
