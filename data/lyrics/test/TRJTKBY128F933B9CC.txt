Gasolone prices are higher than ever
They line up to buy 'cause they hate going slow
Someday I might learn to ride a bicycle
But I ain't got no place to go

I pick up Cigarette butts down at Kroger 
They pay ten dollars to get rid of me
Some folks spend all of their money on nothing
Hell I get my nothin' for free
