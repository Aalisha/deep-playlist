If you're evil and you're on the rise,
You can count on the four of us taking you down,
Cause we're good and evil never beats us,
we'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas,
We are the crystal gems.
We'll always save the day,
and if you think we can't,
We'll always find a way,
Thats why the people of this world believe in.
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven .

If you could only know what we really are
When we arrived on earth
