(Keith, Skeoch, Hannon, Wheat, Luccketta)

You had it right in the palm of your hand, right before your eyes
Now it's gone and you don't understand, you've got to realize

There comes a time when you've got to let things go as fast as they come
Wait and see what tomorrow may bring you, get it all while you can
