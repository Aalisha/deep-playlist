I wanna be clean but I gotta get high
It's good to be here so hard to come by
You bring pain 'cause you got game
And needles and pins a man can't take

Peaches living in niches
Digging the scene like beautiful cliches
From these shapes of a gangster lean
Ignoring wars on gasoline
Our god's on yearning and made to get high
...
