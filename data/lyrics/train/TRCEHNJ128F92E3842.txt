Ev'r day have been there
Long old lonesome day
Now don't ya a-hear me talkin', pretty mama?
Ev'r day have been
Long old lonesome day
Cry, it seem like you-ooo would
Be there ooo-ooo, same old way

Cryin', smokestack lightning
That bell that shine like gold
Now don't ya a-hear me talkin', pretty mama?
Ooh, smokestack lightning
Bells that shine like gold
...
