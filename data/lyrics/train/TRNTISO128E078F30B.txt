I must have left my house at eight because I always do
my train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
and having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned

I must have made my desk
around a quarter after nine
with letters to be read
and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
at half past twelve or so

the usual place, the usual bunch
and still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
the day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
