Life is hard, for some people it's even a hell
The smell of lack of hope every day I pass this way
Begging for a way to get its own addiction relieved
No minor roof over its head covered with some plastic bags
Constitutes its bed

The last chance
Look inside you
Analyze yourself
Review your life
Find out went wrong
What is causing you this sad song?
