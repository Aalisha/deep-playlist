(Fuck religion. Fuck gods. Our fathers and families are our true creators. Dedicated to everyone who has dealt with cancer or the death of a family member. It's not easy watching your architects fall. Truly, for those I love I will sacrifice)

You were supposed to be invincible
Invincible
What happens to you Happens to me
Solidarity Forever family
I'd give my own life Just to save yours
My true creator
When death darkens the door
Love is stronger than death
