"Voices of Victory
All Shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will our prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night

Ive nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late

Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right

To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
