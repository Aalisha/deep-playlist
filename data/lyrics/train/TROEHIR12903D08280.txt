The heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw
Put your hand on this stone, it's the stone of a home you know
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon

They say we can throw far, but they don't know how far we throw
With our legs on the edge and our feet on the horizon
The heart is a stone, and this is a stone that we throw
They say we will go far, but they don't know how far we'll go

It can't be gone
We're still right here
It took so long
Can't say we heard it all
