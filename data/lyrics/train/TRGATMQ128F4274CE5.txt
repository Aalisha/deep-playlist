Yeah, say what
Now, how the god damn pot go and call the kettle black?
That bull shit
Yo, but this ain't though
Chapter seven, verse one, attention

All balls don't bounce, some balls roll and some balls hang
And some people have a ball doin' they thang
Now what's the result? Your life is biased
All one-sided, surrounded by liars

Trials and tribs
It's all ad-libs and all breakin' you a coupla ribs
Now what if I breaks the tail on the lizard
Is it gonna grow back? It is and you know that

But that ain't the case, I picture the place
I capture a Kodak and show dat face
You're just a shit stain on the draws of life
And the trials of life and the styles of life

You won't be happy 'til you lost your life
Or lose your mind, or die of boredom
Or try to kill 'em all and let your God sort 'em
Better earn your keep and learn to leap or burn in your sleep

Tryin' to get a little somethin', yo, I peep
You bein' devoted
But you shoulda let it seep
Through the mask you sported

You ended up a swiggler caught in a swiggle
Just gimme the signal and I'll state the terms
As long as I can be there with fate to change
You smokin' sherm

Or whatever the name, you're a trivial part in a trivia game
Now what's your aim? A presidential campaign
Like Ross Perot, he lost it though
But he got a billion in da bank for show

Oh, me, I'm po' and you like me
