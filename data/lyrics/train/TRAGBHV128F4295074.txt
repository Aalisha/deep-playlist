What the hell do you know you say
As you turn your face right back to me
What the hell do you know you say
Like some righteous man better than me
Well, I'm down, and you're killing me
And I'm down, but still you mean nothing to me

What the hell do you know you say
As you try to shrink me to your size
What the hell do you know you say
Just because you're scared to try
