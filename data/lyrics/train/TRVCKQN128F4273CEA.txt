The stars that shine so brightly
They call to me
I dream of how it might be
Somewhere far away

On, take me on and on
(On and on and on)
On, until the world has gone
(On and on and on)
Take me on and on
On and on

The chains that hold you
Those chains will soon be gone
Sail upon the ocean
Sail back to me

On, take me on and on
...
