The time has come for you to sit this out
To fit inside your mold
Would be to sell myself short

This ground we tread upon
(We turn the pages left to right)
Is now filling up to our necks
 (We see everything)

This ground we tread upon
(We turn the pages left to right)
Is filling up to our necks
 (We see everything)

Oh, my story's growing and growing, it is
 (On my last request)
Don't make me feel so contradicting
There's no room for cheating and being yourself
Failure leaves such a bitter taste in their mouth

And on the last hour
We write so many new chapters again
And on the outside
Where there are no surprises
...
