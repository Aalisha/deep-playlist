[Whoa Oh Oh Oh]
Whoa Oh Oh oh

Verse
No I've never been ashamed
Or afraid to speak my mind
I'm the type of girl
That's gonna' say what I don't like
I know I can be a handful
Sometimes I run my mouth
I'm used to being in control
Decide on what goes down

Well I met my match
Plus your more of a man
Than I ever had (Ooh Ooh Ooh)
This table's turned and
I can't find the words
To describe how good it hurts

Chorus
You are
(You are)
My Mr. Right
(You got me weak, you got me weak, you got me weak)
I can't even fight
(Oh Oh Oh)
One touch and I'm paralyzed
(I can't think, I can't move, I can't speak)
And I'm convinced your love is mine
...
