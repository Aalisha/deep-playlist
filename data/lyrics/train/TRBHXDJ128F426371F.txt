When you hold me like this
So many memories fill my eyes
The first time we kissed
The times we nearly said good bye
But still here we are
Tested and tried and still true
And stronger than we ever knew
Love is all
The laughter and the tears that fall
The mundane and the magical
Love is all
All is love
...
