So many times I've played the game of love
But it always ends in vain
I'm back in the ring with my boxing gloves
So I'm gonna feel some pain
Now, how many times can I lose this game of love?

I had a love who played with my soul
And it hurt so bad
And I tried to live on my own
And it made me sad

And the game gets old
Just a memory untold
And the game gets old

I found out there are no rules to the game
And it don't make no sense at all
Like shooting an arrow with my old aim
Who knows where it'll fall
...
