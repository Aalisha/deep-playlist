The wind was hot and the sun was hard
I was beat and my mare was tired
And the fence line I was riding stretched forever
My mind drifted off and back
To Carmella and her heart of black
And the things that she? d said to me yesterday
So when the boss sent me out checking fences
I was glad cause I knew that it meant
That I could spend some time out all alone

I wiped the sweat that stung my eyes
Looked up and I realized
That I was coming up on the south windmill
The concrete tank stood there beside
The water trough that it supplied
When the trough was full the mill could keep on
pumping & pumping & pumping
So we drank deep from the shallow trough
And wetting my hair gave me the thought
