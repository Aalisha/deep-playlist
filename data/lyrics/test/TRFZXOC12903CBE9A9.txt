You walk tall, got your head in the clouds
You talk soft but you're thinkin' aloud
And you know exactly what you want

You talk shy, you're hard to get
You got the face that I can't forget
And I know, I know the heat goes on

I know that the heat goes on
I know that the heat goes on

You play tight, you're nobody's fool
You're not cold but I know that you're cool
...
