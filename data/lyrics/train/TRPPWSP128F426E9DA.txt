I said drive down, baby; you know you strike me kinda funny
You got a handful of gimme & a mouthful of "Thank you honey"

CHORUS:
& I say jump back, baby, jump back, baby
Check yourself, don't you wreck yourself
You know it may look like I'm crazy, baby, but I know better
Don't try to hand me no 2-ton feather
