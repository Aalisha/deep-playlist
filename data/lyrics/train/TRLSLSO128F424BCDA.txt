Never been told my Prayers would be answered

Wherever I go I see you around.
...
Never been told that something that beautiful
Will bring up to let me down.
Waiting up on the roof

Waiting up in the rain
Just to get a glimpse of your face
Even when you're around
Still I'm out of sight, I'm out of sound
In your world, I'm out of place.

Carry me over

Carry me over
Carry me over now!
...
Carry me over

Carry me over
...
