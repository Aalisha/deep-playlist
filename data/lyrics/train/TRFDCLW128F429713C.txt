Don't get me wrong
I'm feeling ok
But when I'm without you
It's just not the same
Don't misunderstand me
I'm feeling alright
But when I'm without you
The day turns into night... into night
You dream of a future... a possible place
Where we lie together face to face
And i'm looking forward
I will not deny
I dream of a future made for you and I
You and I
