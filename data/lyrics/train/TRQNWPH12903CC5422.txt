My words have no meaning to you
You interpret as you please
I know that you pretend to care
But there's nothing you will miss
And if you think this isn't about you
Well I'm sorry, 'cause it is
But all you wanna do tonight
Is get caught up in youth

And maybe you're impressed
With everything I do
But I don't give a shit
I don't give a shit
