I can see the promised land
Of my broken dream

There's a fire across the water
By the lake of the burning trees
And I called to you but you turn away
From your hands flies a small white dove

Take me to your promised land
Take the fire from my hand
Lead me to your rising sun
When my life is done

The sun will rise, the sun will fall
...
