Party at ground zero
Every movie starring you
And the world will turn to flowing
pink vapor stew

Please do not fear 'cause Fishbone is here to say (say what?)
Just have a good time the stop sign is far away
The toilet has flushed and green lights are a ghost
And drop drills will be extinct
Speedracer cloud has come
They know not what they've done
Sin has just won
The planet is a crumb

Johnny, go get your gun
