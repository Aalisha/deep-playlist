Suki says, "We're all downtown"
So, what's my problem I don't wanna socialize
Why don't they leave me alone?

Bad boys, jealous girls been there, done that
I just wanna fantasize
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Starin' at the ceiling thinking about you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It's a freaky feeling what can I do?

I don't like anyone the way I like you
I don't go anywhere if you're not there too
It's not as if I'm hard to please
You're the only one good enough for me
Those others just won't do
I don't like anyone but you, you
