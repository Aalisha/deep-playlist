This is not a test of the emergency broadcast system, this is a real thing!

Kick back watch it crumble,
See the drowning, watch the fall.
I feel just terrible about it,
That's sarcasm, let it burn!

I'm gonna make a toast when it falls apart.
I'm gonna raise my glass above my heart.
Then someone shouts, that's what they get.
For all the the years of hit and run,
For all the piss broke bands on VH-1.
Where did all their money go?
Don't we all know?
Parasitic music industry,
as it destroys itself.
