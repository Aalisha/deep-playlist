From standing to crouching
Silently falling
Falling from nowhere to nowhere
Nothing between
Nothing beyond
Nothing behind the stars

This is the last trick I'll do
Sound can be seen
This is the main title
Briefly shaking

This is the last trick I'll do
Sound can be seen
This is the main title
Briefly shaking

Remain for some time
Down here below
Allowing the doubt to feed upon me
And even the ones
Who've never been
Are climbing the wail up ahead

I get up start crawling
...
