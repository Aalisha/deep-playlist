Bonefields

Shawn Colvin/John Leventhal

All and all I guess that there's so many things that we don't say and
It's what makes us sad I think sometimes
That makes us close but I don't mind, I don't mind
In the alleys and the bonefields of Arkansa past the piles of tires and the
smell of hot tar you threw your papers
In the rain under your hat you had a world, ummmmâ€¦.a world
There ain't no father
There ain't no mother
There ain't no sister
