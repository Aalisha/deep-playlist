So I ran faster
But it caught me here
Yes, my loyalties turned
Like my ankle
In the seventh grade
Running after Billy
Running after the rain

These precious things

These precious things
Let them break their hold over me

He said, you're really an ugly girl
But I like the way you play
And I died
But I thanked him
Can you believe that?
