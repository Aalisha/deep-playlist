She sits alone in the hall
And soon she'll climb the stairs
To her room, she's so lonely
With sadness and despair
She can hear the static

Vast is the canvas, she painted
To justify the cause, of her life
In her childhood
She barely spoke a word
She was so dramatic

She's leavin' the world of the livin'
She's so frail
God only knows she's been given
She's so frail

And you know she's going back
...
