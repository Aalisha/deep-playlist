Well, there's a word for stress
It's called suck-sess
All this work and no play
Could make anybody a physical wreck
Well, i'll be checkin' out
Next time it comes around
You can call me anytime
But don't be surprised if i don't wanna hear it

On a sunday
'Cause that's the one day i can
Have a gin and tonic iv
Become one with my settee
Contemplate my navel or just breathe
