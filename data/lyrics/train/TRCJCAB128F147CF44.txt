When he comes bursting thru that door, mama leaps and hits the floor
Calling himself Louis Quatorze, he's so young and dangerous

Oh I love it when he says so seriously
With his gun in my back, "Honey, close your eyes and think of England"
Just one second
It's his genuine act, as a matter of fact, Louis was horrible to me
He tears down my defenses, he pretends that I'm against him

Chorus:
Come back again, don't tell me when, Louis Quatorze, always surprise me
