Baby I am here
Do you know I am right here,
baby?
I really want to spend quite
time together
I'll turn off the phone and pull
the shades
We won't be disturbed tonight
Waited all day long to spend
sometime
Just my man and I
If we just leave the world
outside
We can fall in love once again
tonight
Lovers need to share the quiet
time
I know we still need the quiet
time
We can celebrate this special
time
And we don't need company
вЂЁWe'll just set the mood
with conversation
...
