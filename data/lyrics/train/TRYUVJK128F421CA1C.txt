Well we set off for Stephenshelf, sailin' out to sea
My brand new wife, my lover, blowin' kisses out to me
I couldn't make no livin' on the mainland layin' tile
So I thought I'd try my hand at fishin' for a while.

Well we were pullin' full nets, the yeild it sure was high
Those silver skins were shinin', made everybody smile.
My heart was growin' heavy the first time out to sea.
She didn't move like the mainland, brought me to my knees,
to my knees.
