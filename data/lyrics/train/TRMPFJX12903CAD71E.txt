Give it to me
Shout it to me
You just pathetic piece of truth
Will never be the same
Who will be the one to blame
Will I ever be the same
You will be the one to blame
You will be the one to blame
Through years of sorrow
The humans that we are
Are crawling down below
We are slaves to ourselves
Slaves to ourselves
Will we ever be the same
Will we ever be the same
