Take away the thoughts i had today
I didn't think that they would stay
Now it's the price i have top pay
And in my mind there's nothing left to find
I've been shot down from behind
No time left to unwind
Don't leave me standing here with my wasted time that's all been spent now
Cause i swear that we had a little more now
Don't leave me standing here with my wasted time that's all been spent now
