She works 'cross the river from my house
I work at getting to know her
Over the bridge to the lonely town, to walk it's not that far

Some days I make it my mission
To drive right passed her salon
I prefer to worship her from a car

I am going to the Jeans West acid-wash sale
'Cause I know that she'll be there
She cuts hair
She cuts hair
And acid-wash is what she likes to wear
When she cuts hair

Dreaming 'bout the places we would go
It'd be like I won the lotto
I would have tickets on myself
...
