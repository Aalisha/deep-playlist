And we've all got sick with our cooler than thou,
Holier than shit attitudes,
Still the war goes on just drop the bomb,
There's nothing left to lose.
There's a bullet in this gun so you've got till,
the count of one before they shoot.

Let's get a disease there's nothing better to do,
So we'll give it to you and then do as we please,
We'll move to mars, buy big fast cars,
Then spread with ease.
'Cos this gun's pointing at you,
...
