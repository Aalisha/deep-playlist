Waiting on the edge of your prodigle heart
Wanting for someone to save you from yourself
Out there on the edge dangling somewhere in the darkness
Doubting if anybody really cares

But when love reached through the shadows
Whispering your name
Nothing will ever be the same again

For when love calls you home
Forgiveness embrasses a past you once owned
And all the mistakes that carried your name are gone
...
