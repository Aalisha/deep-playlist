Wake up, wake up My God
This is not a test, and it's not too late to come clean
Get it off your chest
So steady your hand before your face and concentrate
There's got to be some stable ground left to walk on

So tear another page from the book
Are you asleep or just alone
Clear this room from your lungs
And pull yourself together
Pull yourself together man
Pull yourself together
Pull yourself together
On your back
