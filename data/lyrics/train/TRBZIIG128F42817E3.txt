When I first saw you standing there
You know, it was a little hard not to stare
So nervous when I drove you home
I know being apart's a little hard to bear.

Sent some flowers to your work in hopes
That I will have you in my arms again
We kissed that night before I left
Still now that's something
I could never forget

You've got all that I need
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
With you I know that
I'm good for something
So let's go and give it a try
We've got our backs against the ocean
It's just us against the world
Looking at all or nothing
Babe it's you and I
Looking at all or nothing
