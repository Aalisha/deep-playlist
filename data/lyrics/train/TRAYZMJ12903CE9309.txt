Sometimes this world it really gets to me
All of the big heads my nerves get tested
Just when I think its gotten the best of me
I save my worst for last
My fuse it ends I reach the final draw A sudden impulse
It's time to break skulls
And you dont really want to be the straw that breaks the camels back
I see the edge and I just got to push it
I don't know what comes over me
I feel the trigger and I just got to push it
