(Tony Martin/Tom Shapiro/Mark Nesler)

T.J. and Charley had a little bar band
They played covers every Friday night
Bonnie was a waitress and a big fan
And every break the three of them would
Take a drink and talk about life
When it came to love, money or fame
Charley's philosophy was always the same.

It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it
It ain't how good you are
It's how bad you want it.
