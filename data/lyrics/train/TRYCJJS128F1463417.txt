She comes running, don't blame yourself
Don't hurt yourself don't say it's true
This city rains down on you rains down on you
I don't care about money, I'll just pray for time
There's no easy way

So if you feel like taking on the world
That's alright
We've got the night on our side
We can walk that line

I'm on my way to higher ground
Lies they build you up then bring you down

Some people just love and run
Your time has come
Can you hear what I'm saying for this time around
I've made up my mind
...
