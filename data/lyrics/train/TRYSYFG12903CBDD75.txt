Let the bass come in
Then I'm a start
Comin hard
Enough to bust
Im outa the flow so hard
And you know I'm one of the hard
Its gangsta art
Its been a record
And put suckas in check fast
As I blast
With a mask
You know and I know that I be the last one
Standin I in demandin
Im ready to bust my flow and
Im knowin
Im blowin up
These woman are steadily goin
Im rippin and flippin the track
Back on attack
Im like the mat
Checkin these suckas for money
And really you're funny
Cause you know that I got a stack
Cheese if you please
Let me do my thang
As I hang
Up off in the hood
It's all good
Cause you know I gotta slang in the game
Cause I'm the loud type
Gotta get the crowd hype
Im back on attack
So make quick fools
You know who it is man
Im back

Pat is back, Pat is back

Im droppin them deadlys
With no rehearses, huh
These bustas I wish my curses
...
