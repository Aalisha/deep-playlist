Hey, know you're looking good
Lookin' damn fine
Can't help but fully notice you from the corner of my eye
Yeah, I got a man at home
But the conversation's old
He think he's slick and doing right
But now he's got to go
[incomprehensible] at a quarter past twelve
Creeping in my [incomp]
But I told her to the [incomp]
Tell me, what'cha gonna do?
'Cause I'm 'bout to make the move
Say yes, without the pressures
'Cause boy I'm ready to

Gon' ride, ride, ride
Shake, shake, shake
You and me one on one
Without a break
We gonna ride, ride, ride
Shake, shake, shake
We can get together baby starting today

Gon' ride, ride, ride
Shake, shake, shake
You and me one on one
Without a break
We gonna ride, ride, ride
Shake, shake, shake
We can get together baby starting today

Now I know that you want me
Just as much as I want you
You ain't got to lie, you ain't got to front
So why don't ya tell the truth?
As it now we send the past
Not the time for being sad
I'm a sexy shaker, girl move on
And don't you move too fast
