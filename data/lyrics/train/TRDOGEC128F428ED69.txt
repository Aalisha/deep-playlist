Ode to joy, my lover boy's speaking in tongues
And the sky's bleeding gray
Now I pull my bag o' prayers out
I hope to find one to save the day

And he judged my love, my lust
My taste with the straightest face
As I crumple up inside
A papier-mache, a shell with no name

Sweet chariot
Come, come, take me away from my fear
Sweet chariot
Come, I have to get out of here
...
