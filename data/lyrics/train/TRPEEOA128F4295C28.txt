I Can't Help It
Looking In My Mirror
Took Me By Surprise
I Can't Help But See You
Running Often Through My Mind

Helpless Like A Baby
Sensual Disguise
I Can't Help But Love You
It's Getting Better All The Time

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No
