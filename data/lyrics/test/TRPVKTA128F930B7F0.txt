We are young
But we have heart
Born in this world as it all falls apart
We are strong
But we don't belong
Born in this world as it all falls apart

I see the children in the rain
Like the parade before the pain
I see the love, I see the hate
I see this world that we can make
I see the life, I see the sky
I'd give it all to see you fly
Yes, we wave this flag of hatred
But you're the ones who made it
Watch the beauty of all our lives
Passing right before my eyes
I hear the hate in all your words
All the words to make us hurt
We get so sick, we're so sick
We never wanted all this
Medication for the kids
With no reason to live
So we march to the drums
Of the damned as we come
Watch it burn in the sun
We are numb

We are young
