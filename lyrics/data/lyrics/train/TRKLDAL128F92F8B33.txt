When the world of colors turns different shades of grey
Send a message from the heart
When there is no justice anywhere to be found
Turn around and face the sun
If you look around you and everyone is blind
Send a Message from the heart

Sometimes we're blind and cannot see
How beautiful the world could be
If we just opened up the doors of freedom

Cause tenderness and time can heal
A battered heart, life revealed
Compassion leads your way in to the sun on you way to paradise

Walking the lane of solitude
The final Brake of day
A shadow cries for attention
In a corner of my eye

Looking out, letting in
Through the broken glass
I saw a trace, jaded face
Heaven in disguise

Beside the odd of prosperity
With eyes of love and peace
Watching the children passing by
