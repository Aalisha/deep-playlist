Wasting time, wasting time
My heartbeat
Beats like a tom tom

4 A.M.
You bang the drum
The clock beats
Beats along

It gets so hot in my head
But I'm fine
Could've stood by
You for days, I
Would forget the world for
You

All the boys say
Fallen girls make easy prey of their hearts
Rain falls
The clock beats on and on

It gets so hot in my head
But I'm fine
Could've stood by
...
