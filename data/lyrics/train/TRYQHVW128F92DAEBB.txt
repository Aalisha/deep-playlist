Some of them wanna break you down, steal your crown
Use and abuse you.
Some of them smile in your face, cause they heard it some place,
You got more then their used to
Some of them want to steal your love, ooh
Cuz they're jealous of …how you're living and giving.

I keep
Moving forward, pressing onward, striving further
I keep
Keep on laughing, keep on living, keep on loving yeah
I keep
Keep on dreaming keep on achieving, keep on believing
I keep
I keep smiling when I come thru …and I cry when I need too.

Some of them, oh they stab you in your back, cuz it's love they lack.
Some of them won't even try …to see the good inside.
But I ….

I keep
Moving forward, pressing onward, striving further
I keep
...
