I Got Wise

You know you don't love me,
I wanna know why you're trying to keep telling me lies.
I know you don't love me,
I don't understand why you keep telling me these lies.
Oh, but I'm gonna get wise, baby.
You know I'm gonna wake up to all your lies.
I've been a fool one day,
but I ain't gonna be a fool all the time.
