Baby, come inside
Sit down, relax a while
There's no work this time
So I'm all yours tonight

Baby, let's unplug the phone
So that no one will know that we're home
 (Unless we should, we'll let 'em believe it)
Got the music nice and low
I don't want nothing to break the flow

It's about the time that we get closer, come on
I'll pour my love like wine, sweet and slow

What you need I'll be tonight
We'll do everything by candlelight
...
