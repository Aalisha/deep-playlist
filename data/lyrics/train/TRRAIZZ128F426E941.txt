You give your hand to me
And then you say, "Hello."
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so.
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
But you don't know me.

No you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And wants to hold you tight.
To you I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
But you don't know me
...
