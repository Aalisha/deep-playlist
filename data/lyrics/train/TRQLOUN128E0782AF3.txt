out of my depth
lost in the air
fallin faster
like a broken elevator

out of my depth
lost in the dark
waitin for that other shoe
to come down hard

i can not communicate
like i wish i could
i do not deal with my problems
like i know i should

i am out of my depth
i am out of my league
watchin everythin
just slip away from me

something bad is gonna happen
i can feel it deep inside
there are shadows all around me
like a bad moon on the rise

i am in over my head
i am in too deep & over my head
...
