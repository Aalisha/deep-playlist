Oh, let me hear you hand clapping now

I like to be in America
OK by me in America
Everything's free in America for a small fee in America

Automobile in America
Chromium steel in America
Wire spoke wheel in America
Very big deal in America

I like the city of San Juan
I know a boat you can get on
Everyone there will get big cheers
