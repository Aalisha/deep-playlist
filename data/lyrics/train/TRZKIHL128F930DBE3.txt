Mighty God turn our ears to your truth
Turn our hearts back to you
Mighty God may we find our treasure in you
As we learn how to fear you
You are the giver of wisdom and understanding
You're the giver of all we need
Mighty god may we know your heart
To seek you to know you to trust you oh mighty God
Mighty God give us victory in our battles
Be our shield from wicked ways
