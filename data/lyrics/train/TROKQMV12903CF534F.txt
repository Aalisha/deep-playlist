Wait a minute, not so quick
You go from zero to ticked off and losing it
Could somebody please tell me what just happened then?

Manage to always ruin the mood somehow
Well, I'm over combing through the details now
Far too complicated to bother with it

All you people, gather 'round and listen up
His majesty the baby has got something up
His bottle's empty and his nappy's come unstuck
All the kingdom must shut up

Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn
...
