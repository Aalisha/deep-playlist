All around this country, trouble in the air
Oh, and I hear a voice that's calling me
saying do you know and do you care?
do you know and do you care?
So I'm gonna do what I have to do
and say what I have to say
and I'm gonna be what I have to be
saying "Won't you come along with me?"
"Won't you come along with me?"

Don't wanna cause no sorrow
...
