Long lost, long lost lover of mine
[Lover of mine]
I've been waiting, anticipating
The day you return
Long lost, long lost lover of mine
It's good to see you
I really need you here with me

I'm sorry for the things I did to you
I know now I acted like a fool (Like a fool)
How you feel? How's the world treat you?
Have you been lonely for me, too?
Why don't you come on home to me?
I need your loving
Baby, can't you see?
