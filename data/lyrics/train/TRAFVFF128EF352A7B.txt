There was blood on the tax report, fire in the hole
I could tell that you set it there just to see how much I could hold
To see if I dropped the ball, get thrown in the cold
Just to see if I'd never call and shut up and grow old
But even then I'd have to listen to all of these preachers in my path
I will be sifting through their sermons just to conquer the mass
Until I reach the top of the hill and look out on disbelieving eyes
Just to say I'd had my fill of all of the heavy breaths and sighs
But who am I to begin when there's never an end
Was it just for the sake of sin that you became my friend
And left me dangling there to blow in the wind
Well I'll be damned if this ever happens again

Chorus:
One day I'll be a dancer
One day I'll get in line
