It's late
Oh I'll tell you straight
you screw this up
and I'll make you pay

Tonight
fuck your stagefright
you do your job
and I'll do mine

Now the lights are as high as I can have them
'cause images are significant
the clothes have yards of flesh between them
so I'll be rich before youre on the stage

If this demon has it's way with me
he wants a hit in record time please
he'll kill me when I hit my peak
...
