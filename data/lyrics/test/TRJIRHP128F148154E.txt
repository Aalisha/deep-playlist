Monday has come around again
I'm in the same old place
With the same old faces always watching me

Who knows how long I'll have to stay
Could be a hundred years of sweat and tears
At the rate that I get paid

Sometimes I slowly drift away
From all the dull routine
That's with me every day
A fantasy will come to me

Diamonds are what I really need
Think I'll rob a store, escape the law
And live in Italy

Lately my luck has been so bad
You know the roulette wheel's
It's a crooked deal, I'm losing all I had
