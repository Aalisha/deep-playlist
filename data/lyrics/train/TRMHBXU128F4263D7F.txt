He's an N.B.L. and he T.C.B.
N.B.L. and he T.C.B.
N.B.L. and he T.C.B.
N.B.L.

A man like that man
Don't like no corrections
A man like that man
Won't take no directions
A man like that man
Make no kind of perfections
But he's a natural born lover
And he suits me fine
He's a natural born lover
And he's just my kind
He's a natural born lover
And he takes care of business

A man like that man
Won't do just what you say
A man like that man
Is gonna leave when he oughta stay
A man like that man
Gotta have his own way
But he's a natural born lover
And he suits me fine
...
