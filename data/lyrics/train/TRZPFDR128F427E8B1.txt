I Will Be Waiting

Yes, I can be such a humble man
And can I make you understand
You're a part of me that I must set free
When the moment comes

So what's the use of playing give and take
When neither one of us can win
It's going on too long
And I'm not that strong as I used to be

And every time that I leave you alone
There's a chance you will be gone
Oh, I feel so cold when I walk through that door
When you say what I've always known

I will be waiting, every single day
I can't believe I heard you say
I will be waiting, every single day to be in your arms
I will be waiting, waiting by the phone
How could I leave you on your own
...
