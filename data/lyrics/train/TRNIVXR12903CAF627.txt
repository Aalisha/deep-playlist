Caught in a cold sweat stuck splitting hairs
I'm drinking too much
I'm on my way to striking out

Go to sleep with the pressure of everyone
Watching, waiting, they're yours for the taking
But I still have my doubts

Before you ask which way to go
Remember where you've been

Stay awake, get a grip and get out
You're safe from the weight of the world
Just take a second to set things straight

I'll be fine even though I'm not always right
I can count on the sun to shine
Dedication takes a lifetime
But dreams only last for a night

Figure it out boy, you're tripping
...
