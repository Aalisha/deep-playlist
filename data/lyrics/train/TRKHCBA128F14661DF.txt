(Take this [unverified] for a ride)
Boom! Burn! Bip! Yeah! Pow! Hey, ha ha
Down with the DC Talk, d-d-down with the DC Talk
Are you down with the DC Talk, d-d-down with the DC Talk

Pullin' out my big black book
'Cause when I need a word defined that's where I look
So I move to the L's quick, fast, in a hurry
Threw on my specs, thought my vision was blurry

I looked again but to my dismay
It was black and white with no room for gray
Ya see, a big V stood beyond my word
And yo that's when it hit me, that luv is a verb

Words come easy but don't mean much
When the words they're sayin' we can't put trust in
We're talkin' 'bout love in a different light
And if we all learn to love it would be just right

Hey, tell me, haven't ya heard? Luv is a serious word
Hey, I think it's time ya learned
I don't care what they say, I don't care care what ya heard
The word luv, luv is a verb

Down with the DC Talk, d-d-down with the DC Talk
Are you down with the DC Talk, d-d-down with the DC Talk
