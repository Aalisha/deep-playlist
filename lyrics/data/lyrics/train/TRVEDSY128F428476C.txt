Predicting war
Predicting life
Predicting when disaster strikes

Living life
Living death
Living on borrowed time

End of time
End of days
End of all the things you save

See the future
See the past
What does it have in store?

Through the years
Through the eyes and the lies
What he sees has become no surprise

Through the years
And the tears and the lies
Condemned to hell
Condemned to fate
Condemned to time

Sacrament
Sacrilege
Altar to a sacrifice

Smell the blood
...
