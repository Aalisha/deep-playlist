Don't say a word
Just come over here
I got somethin' I gotta do tonight
Listen

Ain't never been a man wantin' anything much as I want you (you)
The sun don't come up til' mornin' so tonight theres no excuse... mmm (mmm)
Just like the rain outside I'll make your love come down so baby now it's time (time)
Just can't wait no more (just can't wait no more)
I'm gon' give you what your body's been cryin' for (cryin' for)

And if you tell me yes I'll lay you down
Girl we ain't gotta rush let's play around
We'll do it like we never done before so go and lock that door
Baby don't worry cus I'll be gentle

Come on baby turn the lights off let's get naked (ooh come on)
Come on babygirl you know I just can't take it (I can't take it no more)
Let your panties hit the floor (floor)
Let your body steal the show right now (right now)
It seems like you're ready
So come on girl I just can't wait to see us naked (us naked yea)
