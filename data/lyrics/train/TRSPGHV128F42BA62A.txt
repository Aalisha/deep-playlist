I am small but I can see
I am weak but I can feel
You do what you want to do
You say what you want to say
And then when the times are bad
You're down upon your knees
Is it too much to empathize
Just realize

And he will break through you
And he will break through you
To go to the other end
He will follow you

Who's telling me
Who's telling me
Why tell me
To look the other way

Who's telling me
Who's telling me
