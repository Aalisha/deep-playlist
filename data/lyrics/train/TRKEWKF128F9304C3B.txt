You can send me messages that say we're through,
but I'll keep crawling back to you.
Punch me in the head until I'm black and blue,
but I'll keep crawling back to you.
Yeah, I'll keep crawling back to you.

'Cause there's nothing that you can do
to make me not be in love with you,
And I'll spend my life to make you see
that you're the only girl for me.

I hope it's getting through,
...
