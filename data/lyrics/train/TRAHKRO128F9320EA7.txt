When the summer is young
and nobody has their prices
No one is no one
and nobody in a crisis
There's no swimming past the drop-off
or feeling sorry for yourself
Ya don't go swimming past the drop-off
or else

Yer a pistol, yer a gun
and suddenly I have no prices
I'm like a friend of Dylan's
our shovels meeting in some crisis
But there's no swimming past the drop-off
...
