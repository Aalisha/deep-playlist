It's my mother's lipstick print on the side of my face
It's my father's goodnight before I had my first taste

It'S like comfort
It is full
It's like love, baby are you in the mood?
It's on an island
Or maybe in an ear
It's that explosive thing that gets you

Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Do you know how to kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Something like this, this, this, this
Let me show you how to kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
...
