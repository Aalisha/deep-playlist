Samples: die! ah... zombies!
scratch: "bring all your zombies, i'll re-bury em"
(from high and mighty's "open mic night")
[promoe]
yo, on the rear, let me tell you how i feel
recordcompanies seems to misunderstand the word 'deal'
that means something in it, for both parties
not a big piece for the company, and a small one for the artist
i work the hardest, you sit on a chair
on ya fat ass, expecting me to share (what?!)
my name ain't cher, yours ain't sonny
that means; no love between us, only relation is money
that don't sound funny, but if that is how you want it
be consistent, and face the consecvenses
i'll give you yours, if you give me mines
but if you give me shit, then i'll step in no time
cause i got no time, to waste on bi
if the bi's bs i'll rather chill in the beehive, cuz
just because i'm an up and coming, hungry mc
don't mean i'll settle for a "happymeal-recorddeal"
i'd rather steal, take your whole shit
you never gave me nothing, so why should we split the profit? (why?)
why should i listen to your opinion if my shit is hot or not,
when you know nothing 'bout hip hop?
that's why i don't shop my demos
but instead i let them shop their record-deal, see if i'm interested
cause the time's dead, when we stood around
with the hands in our hands, asking for a helping hand
nowadays we cut off your hand, steal your rolex,
you still don't know the time, judging from the shit you signed
(chorus 2x):
yo kid, rewind (ah, ah)
listen to the shit again
next time you might comprehending the message i sent
independent is not a trend,
