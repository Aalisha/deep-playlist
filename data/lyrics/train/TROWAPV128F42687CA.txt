You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here, messin' with my mind

Spittin' in my eyes and I still see
Tried to keep me down, I'm breakin' free
I don't want no part in your next fix
Someone needs to tell you this is it
Hey
Listen, you'll be missin' out
All my love and my kissin'
Make your mistakes on your own time
When you come down, you're just no good to have around
Instead of makin' money you took mine

You had me
You lost me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here, messin' with my mind

I've realized
In time
That my eyes
Are not blind
I've seen it, before, I'm takin' back my life

You tried to trade on my naivety
