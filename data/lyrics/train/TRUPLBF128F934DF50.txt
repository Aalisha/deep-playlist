Stockin' away all the details you want to know
Day after day all your memories get to grow
Putting all that you've stolen
In a prison that you've locked forever
Taking the place of our imagination
But you won't erase my heart

There is no way you can understand what I feel
You never pray 'cause your soul isn't even real
You might know lots of things now
But you can never be a lover
Winning the race with your information
But you can't replace my soul
...
