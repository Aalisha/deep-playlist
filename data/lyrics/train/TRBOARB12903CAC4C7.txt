Oh the wind is gently blowing
As the light begins to fade
I'm sick and tired of playing it up
Sick of this parade
And your eyes are gently weeping
As the sun begins to shine
The end is coming far too soon
I wish I had more time

So soon your time will come
Get out while you're still young
May all your dreams come true
For someone like you
So soon your time will come
Get out while you're still young
...
