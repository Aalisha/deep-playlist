Saw my face this morning, woke up to late again
Mirror shows me more than i can stand so i turn away
All the second prizes, all the compramises
slowly realizin' somethings wrong and i dont know why

I cant keep up this hopeless fight
I know ill never get it right

This is the worst day of my life (wo oh)
This is the worst day of my life (yeah yeah)
