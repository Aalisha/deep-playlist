You are a bloody hypocrite
But you don't seem to realise it
You never exercise your freedom of choice
You just agree with the loudest voice and
Chorus:

You don't care, no, no, no, no
You don't care, that's right!
I can tell by your face you don't care

Anarchy in the study
But sanity prevails in the home
