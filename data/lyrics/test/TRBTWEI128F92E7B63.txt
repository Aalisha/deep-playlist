At last alone, his fire's dying
Burned another day
Now to pretend and make up an ending
Somewhere far away

He reached for a book all bound in leather
Something that he knows he's never read
And the first page says "Beware, you've found the answer"
The next one says "I wish that you were dead"

Don't go on, put it back
You're reading from the Bible Black

What's this world I see
Who are you and who are me
Maybe I just stumbled in the dark
I must have been out cold
...
