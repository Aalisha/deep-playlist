I wanna jump but I'm afraid I'll fall
I wanna holler but the joint's too small
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

Want some lovin' babe and that ain't all
I wanna kiss her but she's way too tall
Young man rhythm's got a hold of me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
