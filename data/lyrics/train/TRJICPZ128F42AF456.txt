Ohhh
gotta believe its betta to know

listen

Verse One:
I know you havin other friends,
am im wit chu,
ain't gotta keep it on the low 'cause im wit chu,
I told ya girl, I understand,
aint gon be trippin on no other man,(girl)
You be actin like we all up love,
and baby,
I be knowin we aint all up in love,
and thats cool,
and you can keep them otha niggaz,
and thats cool,
as long as i can hit it,

Chorus:
It's better to know,
Don't front like it's all about me,
'cause it's better to know,
Be straight up, if thats how you wanna be,
Yeah its better to know,
you got yours and I got mine,
But whenever we roll,
I'll still treat you like my wife,
Ain't no shame in the game, what we doin is the same
