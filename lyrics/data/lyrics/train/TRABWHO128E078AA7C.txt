The Noise Next Door
Miscellaneous
Calender Girl
I can see them everyday,
there on my wall now,
and when the girls come out to play,
i'm never alone now,
I can help myself to any month
on any day now
and i convinced myself that they'd pick me
if i met them some day

Since i met you
the months are changing
these girls wont do
(chorus)
Better than miss january
fitter than miss frbruary
