Tonight the rain is crying on my windowpane
The clock is slowly chiming its lonely refrain
Tonight the cold wind blows through the screen that you didn't close
Tonight I swear the devil is singing our song

As black as never seen, some darkness tonight
Seem that it would be better to leave than fight
All this time that we had been wrong, fate was against us all along
Tonight I swear the devil is singing our song
Tonight I swear the devil is singing our song
