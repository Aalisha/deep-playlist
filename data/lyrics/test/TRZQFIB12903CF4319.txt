The message
it takes and it gives it breathes
but can't move without you
so take this song, a way to pass on
we speak
so stand up and shout it out

take all of your passion
and all of the things that you've read
make dreams, break scenes
shake things up
instead of waiting on a means that's dead
apocalyptic and forever cryptic
i bow to no one who stands for bullshit
i am the one who stands up as you sit

the message
it takes and it gives it breathes
but can't move without you
so take this song, a way to pass on
we speak
so stand up and shout it out
...
