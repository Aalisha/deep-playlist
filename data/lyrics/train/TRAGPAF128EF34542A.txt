On your honor let me explain my behavior
On your honor I swear I was trying to savor
Who's the liar, Who's the killer?
You know I was doing a favor
When I fell upon her by way of a merciful murder

With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
And I'll still think for my owner
Yes I know what I've done, and what I'm going to do
