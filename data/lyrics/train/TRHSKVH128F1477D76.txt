(All my life I've loved Jimmy Durante, as I suppose you have too, and the next thing is kind of a Jimmy Durante type song that I wrote. And it goes like this:)

If I could play the piano
Like I'd like to play the piano,
I would sit down at the piano,
And I'd play.
That's how I'd play the piano night and day.

If I could play the banjo
Like I'd like to play the banjo,
I'd go out and buy a banjo
And a pick.
I mean I'd play the banjo really slick.
