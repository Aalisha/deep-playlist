She looked me in the eye and said it's over
I can't take this heartache anymore
She said don't tell me lies and try to please me
I've heard it all so many times before

And I took her by the arm and said don't leave me
There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do
Just give me time I'll be the man you've needed
She said I wish that I could take that for the truth
