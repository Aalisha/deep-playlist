Don't you ever make the mistake of thinking of the past as the good old days
It's a son of a bitch being young, and holding your youth like a loaded gun
Septembers come and they go. It seems the older I get, the less I know
And it seems the less I know, the easier it is to breathe

Older brother, oldest son
I was never any good at either one
My father, and the truth
Destroy you thing you love, son, before it destroys you
