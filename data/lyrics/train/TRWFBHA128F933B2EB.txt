It´s me against the world,
It's me against myself.
Where is the reason to stay sober?!
I look into your eyes.
Come on, give it a try.
We´ll work it out, so let´s start over.

This world is going down the drain,
Indifference drives me insane,
The two of us alone again – alone again.
There´s so much left to understand,
Keep your head up and take my hand.
We´re gonna get it right my friend.

Save me
From this cloud above me.
Take me
By your hand and you´ll see
That i will do the same to you.
Save me
From this cloud above me.
Take me
