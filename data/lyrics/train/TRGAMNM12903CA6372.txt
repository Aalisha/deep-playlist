Friend of mine, I've tried a revolution
Everyone screaming "It's not fair, it's not fair"
It's not fair, love's not fair

I'll play the Romeo, you play the Juliet.
The sun won't set, until you appear.
'Cause I know you're the one my love, my love.

What light through this window breaks?
So bright, so bright.
