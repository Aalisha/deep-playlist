Ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh
Ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh
He gets me in the dark and he says he's my man
But when we walk down the street he never holds my hand
He say one day that he will marry me
But he tells his friends that that will never be

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
I cant believe what you saying
'Cause I see what you do

Ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh
When we got to a dance I have to go in alone
But he always catches me before I get home
Then he wants to hug and kiss on me
