Swallow dead drink oblivion
The end resonate disastrous surrender
No one likes to be the bearer of bad news
But it's time to put this old girl down
Our frames are riddled with holes
No big loss by friendly fire
Sew your seeds in the coffin
Breed us foreign cuddle time dancers
Bottoms up to cruel examples
Here's to the times
