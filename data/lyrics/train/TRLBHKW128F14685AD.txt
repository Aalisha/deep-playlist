Heard it said it's a stupid thing
Everything that I follow through
Never got to our God, you see
Abandoned with the taste of the new, new, new

And every time that whistle blows
I'm stranded in my shoes

Get me back on board
Pull me up with grace
Get me back on board
Let me be embraced

'Cause even after all those words
I want you for my own
Touch me when the sun comes up
And tell me that we're home

Take a train to the graves again
We could learn the value of life
Kick the snow with our shoe heels
...
