Can't talk
Won't need
Tight eyes
Can't see
No rest
Can't sleep
My heart feels weak
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, they're right
I know I need to give it up
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, they're right
I know I need to give it up
Push up all my love
Push up all my love
I can't get enough
Push up all my love
