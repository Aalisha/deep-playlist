Two kind of people I just can't stand
That's an evil-hearted woman and a lyin' man
Don't you lie to me
No don't you lie to me
Because it make me mad
I get evil as a man can be

You told me that you loved me a long time ago
The fellow that you got you don't want him no more
Don't you lie to me, ha ha
