And the sky awaits us all,
Now I know today will be the day
Where my throat goes first,
But tonight there will be no slowing of my heart
Or calming my pulse.

I want you to feel,
I want you to feel your pulse in my words
And make your actions speak louder.

We're as children numbered in millions,
Made for a kingdom,
But all designed to fail.
We were designed to fail,
We were all designed to fail.
We were designed to fail,
