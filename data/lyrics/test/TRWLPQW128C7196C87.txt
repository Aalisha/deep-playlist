(stay now)Baby if you've got to go away
I don't think
I can take the pain
Won't you stay another day
Oh don't leave me alone like this
Don't say it's the final kiss
Won't you stay another day

Don't U know
We've come too far now
Just to go
And try to throw it all away
Thought I heard you say
You love me
