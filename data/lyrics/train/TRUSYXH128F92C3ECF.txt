I’m on my own in this room with an awful feeling
Nowhere to go, I’m a fool, I’ll just lay here needing
The only sound is the guillotine clock a-ticking
My only thoughts are the thoughts that aren’t worth thinking

Whoa oh oh oh (hey!)
I’m not a liar but I’d love to lie with you
Whoa oh oh oh (hey!)
I’d really like a little love to fall into

Provide the back to the bed, I’m going nowhere
