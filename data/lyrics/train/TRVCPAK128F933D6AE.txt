Always on my mind
Always in my heart

I've been waiting for you night after night
Like a shadow staying close to the light
Suddenly you stand beside me

And I see a million burning stars
You are always on my mind
Always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name
On a mountain high
Always on my mind
Always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close with me
...
