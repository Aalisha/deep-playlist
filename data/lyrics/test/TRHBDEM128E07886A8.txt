I remember you back in '83
Singing in the rain
In sweet harmony
I get so lonely
As the pages turn in my history
You fade away like a mystery
I get so lonely

Heaven is in your arms dear
Heaven is in your arms dear
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Heaven is in your arms dear
Heaven is where you are
I will never leave you
I will never let you go
