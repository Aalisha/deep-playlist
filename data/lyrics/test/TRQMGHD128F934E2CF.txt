I did do evil 
I did commit violence 
I tormented many hearts 
I did steal 
I caused someone to be treacherously killed 
I lessened the offerings 
I did harm 
I uttered lies 
I made people weep 
I commited acts of self-pollution 
I fornicated 
I tresspassed 
I did commit perfidy 
I damaged cultivated land
