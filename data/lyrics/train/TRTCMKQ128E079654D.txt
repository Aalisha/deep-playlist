Three months in here
Can't catch the tears
Time never lands
Our love is all that stands now
Streets feel strange
And longer lives can never change

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
I'm so mad to love you
And your evil curse

I feel out of place
Just look at my face
Stuck in the mud
Knee-deep in blood, girl
Eyes blindfold
You never said I'm growing old

I'm so glad to have you
And it's getting worse
...
