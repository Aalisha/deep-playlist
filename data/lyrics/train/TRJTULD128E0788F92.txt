You gotta hot date on arms, you got good looks and plenty charms
You gotta nice ride and everything, ain't nothing wrong with you
You gotta good job, respectable, you gotta nice crib
You got it all and so well dressed and well behaved
But you just don't turn me on

My girls say i'm crazy and that i should go with you
Coz' your so amazing, thats the only thing to do
They say you'll be sorry. you'll regret it if you don't
They don't need to worry, i know exactly what i want

I like a man with a hip hop style
I like a man with a drop top ride
I like a man who is independant
Uh, uh, say it again
I like a man with a hip hop style
I like a man who can drive me wild
I like a man who can take control
Uh, huh huh huh huh, thats all

Yo

I need a rude boy, with some edge
