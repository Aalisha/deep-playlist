Tomorrow night, will you remember what you said tonight?
Tomorrow night, will all the thrills be gone?
Tomorrow night, will it be just another memory?
Or just another lovely song thats in my heart to linger on?
Your lips are so tender, your heart is beating fast,
And you willingly surrender, tell me darling, will it last?
