It takes two to tango
And two lips to seal a kiss
But a flame and a candle
Won't burn on a night like this
If it don't take two

It takes two to go one way
And two winds to be strong enough
But you can't sail on a still day
Like two ships on a sea of love
If it don't take two

Noah knew what he had to do
Ooh oh yeah
He sent us out in the world walkin' two by two
Oh...

If it don't take two
If it don't take two
...
