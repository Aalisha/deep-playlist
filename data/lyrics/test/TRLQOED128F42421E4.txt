Born Into Great Prosperity
A Bastard Child With Lustful Enmity
Cast A Shadow Upon Its Feet
Deluded Into Everything It Doesn't Need
The Aging Process Takes Its Toll
Pale White Skin It Shall Adore
White Skin It Shall Adore

A Life Once Proficient
Torn Into Bewilderment
6 Feet Of Foreplay
Heavens Tricked Below
Thrust Life Into The Inanimate
Fables Of Coming Were Foretold

A Life Once Proficient
Torn Into Bewilderment
Harking Prophecies Untold And Cut
The Masque Of Man Falls Into Dust
Like A Furious F**k
The Threshold Is Reached
Undisputed - Heritage - Plundered - Raped
