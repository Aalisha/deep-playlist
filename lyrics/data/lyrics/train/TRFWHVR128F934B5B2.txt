Got me dead drunk

Shaking, sweating, smelling death
Ethanol venom on my breath
Wake up each day to feel this pain
Looks like I´ve done the bad thing again
God I loved that girl next door
But she got me spilling on the floor
Opened my face like rotting vines
A scent so sweet like blood divine
We only thought we´d had a few
And couldn´t think of nothing else to do
With dutch courage and devilish charm
I thought that I could twist her arm
