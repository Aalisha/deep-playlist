Each time you break my heart
Each time you break my heart
I know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around

Why can't you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door
Know that I, oh, know that I can't take no more
Chorus:
Each time you break my heart

Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries
