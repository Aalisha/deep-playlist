All hail the face of abomination
Deceive the minds of those
Who are sent to fight, who live their lives to die alone
We will succeed when you quit
The nation lost its patients
Lie us into war, trade blood for oil, we count the days

Emancipate from the sea of lies
Awaken and recognize the fate of mankind
Apocalyptic decay
Degeneration of all life as we know it, waste away
...
