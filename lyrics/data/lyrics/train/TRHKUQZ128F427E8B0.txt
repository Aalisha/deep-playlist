I've been here before, baby, knowing that I'm in love
And I admit I wanna say that you're the one
 (You're the one)
Sometimes I let my fears over rule my common sense
Instead of loving you, I was running away
 (Running away)

You're the only, the one that my walls won't hold
And I'm open even though I, I can be so cold
And it's really not, not at all about anything that you do
It's even hard for me to understand
It's something I just go through

I knew that there would be days like this
When I wanna let go
Feeling like a man over my head
But I won't let the days like this
Change my feelings for you
'Cuz I can't forget everything we had
