Quit making fun of me, I don't like it
I'm not some "wind-me-up" you can play
You've go the best of me, I can't fight it
There's nothing left that I can say

This run around you're giving me
It makes me long for better days
Don't ever take me for a fool
I'm smart enough to run away

You're standing over me, I don't mind it
