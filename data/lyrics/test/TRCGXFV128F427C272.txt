Is that you doing that to me
With your stare
I feel the temperature start to rise
And I
Really take it from there

I start to press my skin to you
I'm craving it
I'm feeling you
Will you relieve me fast
Feast your eyes on my display
Take control
Fall over me
Cover me in ecstasy

Let me ride to heaven
Let me feel the swelling
Oh let me concentrate

I can feel it
When I taste
Like the wind
I breathe
Crawling inside of me baby
Oh oh oh
...
