I know a girl who? s growing up too fast
She? s stuck between her future and her past
? Cause she? s just a baby but the doctors say
She? s got a baby on the way

And now the devastation makes her start to cry
How could this be happening, she wonders why
But they? re talking options like it? s just another day
And the choice is hers to make

But there's a life inside you
And there's a beating heart
And there's a child of wonder
Shining like a star
There? s a life inside you

I know a boy who's all caught up
In his addictions and they're tearing him up
And now he's, he's hearing voices, telling him it? s time to let go
