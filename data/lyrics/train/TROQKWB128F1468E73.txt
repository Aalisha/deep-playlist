Well I saw my silver? Mexico
Spend all my money in the? saloon
? my loose
I'm alone, alone, alone
I'm alone, alone, alone

Well your mama says? and cut like a knife
? you cut a little deeper found the devil inside
Now burn it?
I'm so mean, so mean, so mean
I'm so mean, so mean, so mean

I'm a motorcycle cowboy
A honky-tonk junkie
For a shooting star
Drove to Desperado
The wrong side of the barrel
