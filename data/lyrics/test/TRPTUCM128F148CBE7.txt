It's closing time and it's getting late
Can you fetch my coat cause I don't feel too great... anymore
But I want to stay
Don't you want to stay as well?
I don't think that you do
I've got this funny feeling that you don't feel like I do
This conversation's just passing you by
I know it, I can see it in your eyes

You've had one too many, low and behold
You're telling the secrets that can't be told
It feels so special, it feels so right
But then you knock me back and I fall
I fall to the floor

And all he wanted was a kiss
All he wanted was a chance tonight
