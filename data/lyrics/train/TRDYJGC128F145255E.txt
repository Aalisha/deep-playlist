Falling over backwards for you
Falling over everybody else
I put myself in that position
Every single time I have the chance

I know it's not my business
To be digging up these things
I should have known
Twenty years of bad decisions
Haven't taught me much at all

Separate events you're making
Everyone pretend it's not your fault
And all of this offense you're taking
Doesn't really bother me at all

Twist my arm, 'cause that's the way you think you're gonna work this whole thing out
You know you own my body, but don't think that you control my mouth

Having every question answered
