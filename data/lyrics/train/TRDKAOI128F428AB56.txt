This is reggae power
Prop-pop-pidle-llp-pap-praop-pol
We got to have, we got to have
A that the people need, justice
And everybody need some justice
And we got to have
Justice
A every people need some justice
Lord! Lord! Justice
Down in the ghetto we need some justice
And we got to have
Justice
See how the people cry for justice
Yeah!

Apartheid its got to go
We got to give justice
A chance to flow now
Racism well that can't last
Racial discrimination
Is a thing in the past, so!
We got to have justice
Hear we cry
Justice
Come on and give the people justice
Lord say we got to have
Justice
By any means there must be justice,
Lord!
