A don't stop stop your dreamin
Let yourself float apon the notion
We can work it out, we gon work it out baby
Go ahead lose yourself inside this opportunity
That we gonna make it right now, make it right now
We live and we learn, we crash and we burn
Right now my only rhyme is this lesson I learned
You talk about trust, I talk about lust
Its not appealin as you truly speak your feelings
I be lookin at the ceiling, so concealing
I shoulda put my heart on the table
Knowin I was good and able but instead I fed your fables
If I could have you back best believe it'd be forever
