To this day
I do not understand who we were
Just what made our encounters so sincere
An isle in time
Our love a shelter

And to this day
Those tears I shed burn into my face
You turned around and walked without a trace
You cut the lifeline

You held me down
I'm tied up on your sheets
You turned to liquid
Read my needs

You shared my passion
