(Nicci)
Now and then
I wonder where you are & where you've been
We were friends
But deep inside my heart, I always knew
I only needed one not two
I wish that I could say the same for you

Everyday
I kept you oh so dear & close to my heart
I was yours
I thought that you were mine
Right from the start
We made a vow to be as one
But you played your games
Put our love to shame
And now the magic's gone

(Chorus)
I never wanted half of you
Sharing you will just not do
Gotta be, one on one, or it won't be done
You said you wanted all of me
Why couldn't it be two not three
It's too late
I won't take half of you
