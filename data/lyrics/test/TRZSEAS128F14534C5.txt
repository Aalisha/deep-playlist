You offer your assistance
But you won't accept my help
You draw your own conclusions
And there's room for little else

Your own participation's
Based on how much you can lose
I cannot help but feel
That this won't be of any use

Don't offer me your credit
'Cause I do not want the blame
Don't do me any favours
I don't want to play that game

I do not want to see myself
As someone that you saved
...
