Hey there, it's good to see you again
It never felt right calling this just friends
I'm happy if you're happy with yourself

Take off your shirt, your shoes
Those skinny jeans I bought for you
We're diving in, there's nothing left to lose

I'm gonna break down these walls I built around myself
I wanna fall so in love with you and no one else
Could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
Together we'll move on, just don't turn around
Let the walls break down

I used to wear you like a ball and chain
I'd run and hide at the call of my name
...
