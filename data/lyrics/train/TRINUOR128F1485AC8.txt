Burn Atlanta tonight
Hey, for a buck we could stay here all night
Long live the Confederate plight

It's history, it drags on and on
It wasn't my fault it lasted 'til dawn
Your mammy's got to think like me
It's praised by the academy
And she'd rather Gable than your dad
So tell her please I'm an innocent lad
I'm telling her

Gone with the Wind - there's a lot to be said for it
But I can't think just what
We didn't watch a lot
Gone with the wind - there's a lot to be said for it
But I don't know just what
We didn't catch the plot
