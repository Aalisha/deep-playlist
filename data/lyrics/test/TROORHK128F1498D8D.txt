I was down to the bone I was lonely only yesterday
Didn't know I was throwin my chances away
Then you came along just long enough to see
Far beyond the fool that I have come to be

CHORUS Just to be loved by you
It's like having all my sweetest dreams coming true
You showed me something I've never seen
You made me something I have never been before
Never before
