Ahhhhhh! Show me a man that's got a good woman
Show me
Show me a man out there that's got a good woman
Show me (huh huh)
Show me a man that's got a good woman
Show me a man that's got a good woman
Show me a man that's got a good woman
Show me a man that's got a good woman
Show me a man that's got a good woman
I'll show you a man that goes to work hummin'
He knows he's got some sweet love coming
At the end of his working day.
*Yeah*
