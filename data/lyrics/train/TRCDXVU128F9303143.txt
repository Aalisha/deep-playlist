There are no unlockable doors, there are no unwindable wars
There are no unrightable wrongs or unsingable songs
There are no unbeatable odds, there are no believable Gods
There are no unnameable names, shall I say it again, yeah?

There are no impossible dreams, there are no invisible seams
Each night when the day is through

I don't ask much
I just want you
I just want you

There are no uncriminals crimes there are no unrhymable rhymes
There are no identical twins or forgivable sins
There are no incurable ills there are no unkillable thrills
One thing and you know it's true

I don't ask much
...
