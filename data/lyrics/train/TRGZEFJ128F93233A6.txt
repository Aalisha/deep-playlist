Tell me that you´re looking for a
handsome country man

That´s what I am *

Someone who can hold you
give you all the love you can stand

That´s what I am *

If you´re looking for the one thats got a heart of gold
The one thats gonna love you both heart and soul
Wake up in the morning
Kiss you and say thank you maam

That´s what I am *

Don´t tell I don´t fit in your plan
What you need is this hard loving man
Whats it take to make you see
That´s what I am

That´s what I am *

Oh that´s what I am

That´s what I am *

Say that´s what I am

If you want someone ready for love
at your command

That´s what I am *

If you´re down and your looking for a friend
just to hold your hand
