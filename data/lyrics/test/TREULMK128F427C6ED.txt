You just got out of school last year
And all your friends ask, hey what you doing here?
Somehow you just can't mix with kids your age
She knows what she likes

I know you look much older now
But you ain't figured out life somehow
You got a different number on every page
She knows, she knows what she wants

Crazy, crazy, you amaze me
Crazy lady, rearrange me
