Well, well, well, well
I look over yonder and what I see
Seems like a chariot coming after me
Swing low sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home

Why don't you swing down chariot, stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot, stop and let me ride
Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord, calm and easy
I got a home on the other side

Swing, swing, swing
Well, Ezekiel was out in the middle of the field
He said he saw an angel with a chariot wheel
He wasn't too particular about the chariot wheel
