It's a funny feeling, not really
Comfort me, cos I'm hearing violins
In the streets, friends I meet say
It's all over this town

The way you cheat, the way you lie
The way you want me to die
Over this
Over this
Over this town

The way you drive through the night
With a gun, me in your sights
Over this
Over this
Over this town
