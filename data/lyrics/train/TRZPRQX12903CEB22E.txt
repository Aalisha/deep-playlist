I am a river in the ocean
Particles spread far and thin
But I can still remember what I was then
Now I am something greater
Though less of what I was

The day that I discovered
I was a river in the ocean

I am a bird whistling in the dark
Stuck in this cavernous mine
When silence falls
You know it's time to start running

I am a bird that's never seen much light
Stuck in this cavernous ark
Soon they'll send me out to look for land
And I'll bring back a little bark

I am a stroller in the park
Wrapped 'round this beautiful babe
I and the dark skinned woman
Pushing me are its slaves

I am a stroller in the park
Walking my flypaper skin
Through the balmy August air
Which sucks my body's waters from within

I am a river in the ocean
...
