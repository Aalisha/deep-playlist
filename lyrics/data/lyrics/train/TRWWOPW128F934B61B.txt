Trapped in the moment of death forever
Dead
I'm not a man, I'm a fucking beast

Born to kill
Alive to die
You live no more

I hate you all
I wait to kill
To taste your blood

The cold embrace of the grave
We're all deceased
An empty hole awaits us all
Soon to fall

No escape from this fate
In the tomb
...
