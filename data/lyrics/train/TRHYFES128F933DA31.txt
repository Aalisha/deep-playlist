Oho, oho, oh
Yeaheah
Tadaridada
Dadadaridada I don't mind when you say that you're going away
Just don't wanna be lonely
And I don't care if we share only moments a day
Just don't wanna be lonely I'd rather be loved and needed
Depended on to give a love I can't give
When you're gone, when you're gone
Just don't want to be lonely I don't mind when the time sets the sun to the moon
I just don't wanna be lonely
