This is the kind of affair to make you dance about
But there's something to say for the things
You wouldn't regularly let out
At least this chase
Makes you feel new

She holds a key
Tight in her hand
Clutching his neck
She is begging her man
Listen you sinner
I'm sinning too
Just wait until the darkness falls so I can sin with you

You've run through the whole gamut of gameplay
the headtrip parade
Without any experience
