You turn me on
You lift me up
And like the sweetest cup I'd share with you
You lift me up
Don't you ever stop - I'm here with you
Now it's all or nothing
'Cause you say you'll follow through
You follow me
and I, I follow you

What you gonna do when things go wrong
What you gonna do when it all cracks up
What you gonna do when the love burns down
What you gonna do when the flames go up
Who is gonna come and turn the tide
What's it gonna take to make a dream survive
...
