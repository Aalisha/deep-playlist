Now I Give You All My Lovin'
And All You Did Is Cause Me Pain
Now I'm Getting Tired Of Waiting
So I'll Hang My Head In Shame
And I Know We Talked It Over
But I Don't Acknowledge The Blame
The Condemned And Guilty
Did You Know There One Of The Same
And Now That I Know That

My Future's Written On The Judgement Wall
And I Got The Feeling
Right Now She Doesn't Really Care At All
