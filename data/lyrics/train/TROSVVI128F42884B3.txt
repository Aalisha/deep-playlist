What cha thinking 'bout, what's on your mind?
Baby don't keep wasting all my time
'Cause your body's here but I know
That your mind is on somebody else
It's feelings you can't hide

Baby I'm not afraid to be alone
So pack your things, it's time for you to go
'Cause your body's here but I know
That your mind is on somebody else
I got to let you go

Baby, it all got started in the month of June
And that's when I noticed the change in you
You never spend any time with me like we used to

Forget telling me that you love me
'Cause I'm not buying it
And baby it's no mystery that you're lying to me
You can't run that one on me

I know on the low, you've been around
You think you're fooling me
I can see so easily
But I don't have you mentally, so tell me

What cha thinking 'bout, what's on your mind?
Baby don't keep wasting all my time
'Cause your body's here but I know
That your mind is on somebody else
It's feelings you can't hide
...
