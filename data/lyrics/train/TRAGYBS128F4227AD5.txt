I remember nigga
Boosie Bad Azz
I remember nigga
I remember nigga

Now I remember everythin' from them cold night on the block
I remember the struggle, I remember the shine
I remember they faces when they saw me shine
Nigga I remember everythin', I remember nigga

Outside with no shirt, I remember nigga
Talked loud in that church, I remember nigga
Nigga stole all my work, I remember nigga
Kirby took my lick in court, I remember nigga

Them plantation days, do you remember that?
The good times that we had in big digem lac
Do you remember Debra Proch when it was hot and steamin'?
Do you remember when we moved shop down there by leman?

Do you remember at the room hoes caughtin' semen?
Do you remember I busted two with the green eye demon?
Yeah, nigga I remember cross the tracks
When Capt. Ricks and Kenny Wayne had a gang of that crack

Mane, I remember all that when E-40 was jammin'
Everybody play B's and D's listenin' to that Dayton family
I remember Daddy-O when he put me on syrup
Remember Junior was fourteen workin' with a quarter bird nigga

Them long nights on the block, I remember nigga
Went from a little to a lot, I remember nigga
And in this world with no dreams, I remember nigga
