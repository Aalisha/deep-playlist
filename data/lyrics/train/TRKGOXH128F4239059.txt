Hey! We got it going on
Hey-ey-ey! We got it going on.

No separating, me and my ladi.
We firm as the rock of Gibraltar, and mountains around Hi-rusalem.
You labor in vain if yuh try tobring us pain cuz youll neva will
You can not go round us, she said Tarrus, nothing divides us

Now theres more than a million reasons to quit, but well never split
More than a million reasons to quit, but were holding on
Love is what dreams are made ofand in my visions all I see is her
We got something strong and so were holding on

Dem never know me serious, never want go link pon anotha
Till around at that time to carry home to motha
Dem put up all type of tracks and barriers
Fi ah show dem dat true loves a conqueror

More than a million reasons to quit, but well ever split.
