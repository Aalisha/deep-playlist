See, I'm leaving
This warehouse frightens me
Has me tied up in knots
Can't rest for a moment
Soon I'm going
I'm slippin' slow away
Hoping to find something better than
I've got inside of here
And the warehouse slips away

Hey, reckless mind
Don't throw away your playful beginnings
You and I will fumble around
In the touches and be sure to
Leave all the lights on
So we can see the black cat changing colors
And we can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide turns you around and around

Hey, we have found
Becoming one in a million
Slip into the crowd
This question I found in a gap in the sidewalk
Keep all your sights on, hey
The black cat changing colors
And you can walk under ladders
And swim as the tide turns you 'round
...
