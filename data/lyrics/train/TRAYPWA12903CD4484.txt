Greetings from me to all my friends
to my girlfriend and my parents
I'm leaving this town
I can't forget to say goodbye
I can't forget the laughs and cries
The moments I spent
That's nothing to weep about
The rain's starting to pour down
Here the time's slipping away
I don't pretend I'm ok 

Grief is preying on my mind
...
