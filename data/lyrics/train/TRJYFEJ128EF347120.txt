Give me a ticket on a jet airplane
I'm a-gonna take it
I live my life in the fast lane, the only way to make it
And I keep on going all night long
Cause that's the way I like it
And with what you got in the heat of the night
I know we got to try it

Until the flame burns out
Until the flame burns out

So turn it up, your radio
...
