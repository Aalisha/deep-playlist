Monday had a sad child
Always feeling low down
Tuesday had a dream child
She's always on the go
So I'm in love with Saturday's child

Every time you take her out at night
 (She drives me wild)
You want to kiss and hold her way up tight
 (Gonna spend my time)
You can tell the future's looking bright
 (Making sure that Saturday's child is mine)

If you love a Wednesday
You live your life apart now
And if you love a Thursday
She's gonna break your heart
...
