Put your sweet fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
It's hard to read between your lines
We were the clock hands at midnight
Now you're four whole hours behind
Put your sweet fingers a little closer to the keyboard
I can't quite see the whites of your eyes
Though you bat your eyelids from across the ocean
And I fall over in their breeze
I don't bring you spices from the East
I don't bring you the world's you crave
'Cos everyday you need a new one
