Looking for the boy who is always on my mind
Looking for the boy who is oh so hard to find
So many tears fell down my wasted face
That’s another talk and place
My future’s here and it’s now
And I think you may be the one to hold the key

So baby don’t you hurt me
Gotta have a man who wants to be by my side
Don’t want a boy who’s gonna make me cry
Baby don’t you hurt me
Gotta have a guy who speaks for honesty and true happy
Then my sweetest gonna be you
Baby don’t you hurt me
