Caught up in whats in.
Caught up in the things that everyone wants.
Caught up in whats out.
Caught up in the things that you could do without.
Well what if I was one of them?
So I will say,

Chorus
If I live for a million years i would be Right there to catch your tears.
Will you get over it this time?
And is this the last time?

On this night we breathe air.
What makes it so different?
What makes you not care?
Well I wish that we could be the same.
And I wish that you could give up this game.
Don't wanna be one of them.
