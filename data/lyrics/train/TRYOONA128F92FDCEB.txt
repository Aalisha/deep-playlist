Lone star light the lowlands, show up every stone
So far only you can lead us all back home
If they could keep me chained in
Still my heart would roam

To sleep enraptured
Waking up captured chills me to the bone
My home's in the westward direction
Of my own resurrection

Sunbeam be my highway, stream in on my sleep
Face me towards the new day until it breaks in me
Love is where I'm aiming
Down way is just as steep

To sleep enraptured
...
