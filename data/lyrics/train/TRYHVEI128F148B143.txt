I spend my nights dead, face down on my floor
But the drugs aren't really working anymore
The nights are mostly just depressed
From staring at my open chest
I'm bleeding and I'm heartless, but I'm yours
And I'm scratching down every blurry scene
On the mattress where you used to sleep and dream
I'd rather chew on broken glass
Than keep on living in the past
And wasting time on words I know you didn't mean
Dear everybody, or whoever's listening
