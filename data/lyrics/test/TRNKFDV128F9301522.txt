[Hook]
Listen to precision *scratching*
Listen to pre-ci-ci-ci-cision
Listen to precision *scratching*
Listen to pre-ci-ci-ci-cision
Listen to precision *scratching*
Listen to pre-ci-ci-ci-cision
Rhyming *scratching* rhyming

[Verse 1]
Y'all sendin' motherfuckas to an early grave
murder men then murder slaves
verbal plays vacant so you herbs behave
When I was your age I wasn't that a rave
I was bangin' jackin' spades lacin' page after page
At that stage, you rookies would've bat at the bat cage
With pride up in ya swingin' stance
While I was catchin' finger cramps
Writin' in a dark room wid swingin' lamps
You sing and dance, you won't step you bringin' ramp shit
Ring the bell, I fight you like a horse in a cell
Bumpin' this hell toward the rail like a sorcerer's spell
7L holds cream like a tortoise's shell
