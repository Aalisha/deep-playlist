We flew over the Cascades
We were forced to behave while we sat
Rows are turning
I crossed some standard state lines
I finally found myself so far away from home
Even though New England tree dust goes through us
Are bones are cold as stick and stones

We flew over the Cascades
Just to find ourselves in storms we've never known
The winds are like a beast with wings and yes
Everything was blown so far away
