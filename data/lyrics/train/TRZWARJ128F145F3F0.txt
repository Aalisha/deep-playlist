Looking back she thinks about that moment in the sand
But what was just a summer fling got so far out of hand
She knew that he was taken
But she gave in anyway
She believed when she heard him say

Soon
I'll be free to be with you
Soon
I'll be telling you know who the facts of life
I want you to be my wife
And our dreams will all come true
Soon

Christmas finds her all alone with no cause to rejoice
So she calls his code a phone just to hear his voice
She knows that it's useless
...
