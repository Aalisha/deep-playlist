Everybody take the hands of the ones you choose
And everybody lead them to a place that appeals to you
Hold it up closer to your heart so to spread your potion
Everybody join up as one and together we'll grow
Everybody
Here we go to the edge of the moon
We are blinded for now by the goodness of groove
We are dancin' and we're singin' with the light of the moon
We are blinded for now by the goodness of groove
If you comin' here with love or bounce in your feet
Then here and now would be a good place to meet
Someone from a place that appeals to you
And together we can share all the goodness of groove
Everybody take the hands of the ones you choose
And everybody lead them to a place that appeals to you
Hold them up closer to your heart so to spread your potion
