There was a time when my world was filled with darkness, darkness, darkness
And I stopped dreaming now
I'm supposed to fill it up with something, something, something
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody I knew before long long long ago

But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Am I free or am I tied up
I change shapes just to hide in this place
but I'm still, I'm still an animal

Nobody knows it but me when I slip yeah I slip
I'm still an animal
There is a hole and I tried to fill up with money, money, money
...
