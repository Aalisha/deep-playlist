I don't want your money honey
I want your love
I don't want your car baby
I want your aahhh!
I don't need your friends
They don't need a mention
I just want your love
And all of your attention
I don't want your money, I want your love
I don't want your car, I want your aahhh!
I want your your love

I don't want your books on Marilyn or Bobby D
I don't want your records, your pictures
Or anything, I want your funky love
I don't want your money, I want your love
I don't want your stars, I want your aahhh!
