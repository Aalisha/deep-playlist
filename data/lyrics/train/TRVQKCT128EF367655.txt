Warden's calling for a lockdown, baby
He'll call on interim inequities
This is the last night in my body;
Assist in the escape
Warden's calling on a jailbreak, baby
He'll fly like only a jailbird could
He'll fly like only a jailbird could

Like a felon, he fell into scandals,
Scams, and master plans
To circumvent all circumstances
He thought to his throat,
"We can swallow this key and leave when we please"
Let's hope this stomach, stomach
Let's hope this stomach disagrees

Warden's calling for a lockdown, baby
He'll call on interim inequities
This is the last night in my body;
Assist in the escape
...
