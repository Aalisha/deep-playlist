All the highways
Lead to this town
I pick up the dics, kiss 'em
Throw them down

Because it's my lucky day
Oh, my lucky day
My lucky day
I think it's my luck day

Once upon a time, now
Moses, Pharaoh and Robinson Crusoe
Discovered a goldmine in the middle of the desert
Stole a car and drove it to Vegas

Celebration come the day
Lady luck gonna smile my way
Said, oh my luck day
