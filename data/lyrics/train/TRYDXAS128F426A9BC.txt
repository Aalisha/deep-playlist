A garden of seeds lost, ashen spirits embrace me in pain
Like scars that shed the plague of flames, my thirst awakes

Aceless to my feelings, inimicial to my pulse, like disease
Sand in my eyes, I am hiding from pleasure, yearning for breeze
Draw my bare tears from this melody now that I can't flee
Take refuge in me or vanish, my beauty, bring or tear the silk

To weave the drops of passion or strike the winds of misfortune
Mourning I stand, my senses in abyss, under skies of torture

Devour my womb, these obscure roots
Release my dying touch, unchain me from my doom
...
