She's gone away but still they stay together
People call me crazy, crazy
My thoughts progress, I think about forever
My mind tells me maybe, maybe
I wish I could drive away to the sunset
Back to the day that we first met
Only believe the things I wrote
I'll put it in a note, yeah
Cross my t's and dot my i's
Better say hello, don't you dare say goodbye
I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name
P.S. I love you, forever and today
Two weeks go by, seems like it's been the weather
