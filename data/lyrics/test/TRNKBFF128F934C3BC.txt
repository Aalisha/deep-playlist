Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It will all end in the dirt again

He starts with the draining of liquid mass
His victims lie helpless and wide awake
Bodies are shriveled to skeletal form
To decompose
Victims die helpless while siphoned awake

Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot

Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
...
