She's a black widow best friend
Cold as the cock of a colt 45
She fled the scene, she shed the sheets
And sold the movie rights
She swore before her chastity
With tongue and burning cheek
But fiction can be fun, fiction can be nasty fun

Oh no no no no, you better watch your back
Cause x's can't be o's
Oh no no no no, you better watch your back

Goldmine valentine, my bankroll butterfly
She'll steal your heart and make you proud
Right before she sells you out
Goldmine valentine, makes out with open eyes
She'll steal to save her skin
And she steal your heart again
...
