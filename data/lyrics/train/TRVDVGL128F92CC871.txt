From the shadows of the stars
Comes a man with no face, soul of million scars
An evil Count, The End of Days
There are many ways to

Take full advantage when we cannot see
Make us live in a part-time reality

To get a hold of the only seed
We must make them all see bloodshed that is he
Splitting hairs is not the key
