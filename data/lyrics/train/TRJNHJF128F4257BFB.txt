I stop to catch my breath
And I stop to catch your eye
No need to second-guess
That you've been on my mind
I dream days away, but that's okay

It's like I want to hear a silent sound
And then hold it in my hand
But a rose won't blossom from a ground
Of desert sand, but I like to pretend that

One day I'll turn around, I'll
see your hand reach out
I'm only fooling myself, yeah, yeah, yeah
But maybe when you smile
It means you'd stay awhile
Just maybe you'd save me now
I'm only fooling myself, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm only fooling myself

Well, now it's etched in stone
That I can't survive alone
You have the missing piece
That I need so desperately
...
