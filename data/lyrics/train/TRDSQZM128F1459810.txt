I can do it
Yeah mayne! Now I can do it
Aww this that rollin beat man
I can roll with this
I can roll with this just like ridin over that Bay Bridge
Golden Gate y'nderstandwhatImean?
Oh look at that skeezer over there man
I ain't with it

Now now now the drum gets deeper and the beats get stronger
So take a deep breath before you're forced under
The line that divides what's yours from mine
In effect is what I am cause I served my time
Concrete solid beats topped off with rhymes
A fly posse put together by the Hammer's mind
Now the song is in effect and my soul is fed
And these are my words, that's what I said
