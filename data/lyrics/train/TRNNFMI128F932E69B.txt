Conversation thickens
As we become old friends
And your pretty fingers fidget
With a glass that's close at hand

I sat there and watched you
She sat there and watched you
I sat there and watched her
Watch you
I went for my drink
She went for her cigarettes
You went for your smile
The night rolled on
Now everything cool
Respectful of rule
