Call my phone, baby, call my phone
Baby, call my phone, I've been waitin' to hear your ring tone
Call my phone, baby, call my phone
Baby, call my phone, I've been waitin' to hear your ring tone

Lost without my other half
How can I live without you?
I don't want another
That's why I'm messed up about you

Can't even dream without seein' you
Why should I even try to breathe?
And everything is off without you
Guess it's all my fault, lady sing the blues

No one could deny it
We were flying like united
Thought we'd never be divided
'Cause the love we had inside us was

Inseparable, if you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong
Inseparable, just lost your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought that y'all was inseparable

Thought we'd stay together always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable
Except for us, one of us just got to pick the phone up
