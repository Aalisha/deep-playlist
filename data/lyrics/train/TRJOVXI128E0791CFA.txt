You're the entertainer
The entertainer
You're the entertainer
The entertainer

You made em laugh
And you left em feeling glad
You made em cry
And you left em feeling sad

They've seen you perform
In so many plays
But they're not to know
You're unhappy today

So they'll never know
Go on with the show

Cause you're the entertainer
The entertainer
You're the entertainer
