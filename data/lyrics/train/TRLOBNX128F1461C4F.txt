Anything to get your attention
I'll do anything to get your attention
I'll do anything to get your attention
I'll do anything to get your attention

You don't come when I call
You act as if I don't, don't exist at all
I think there must be some, some trick to it
Some kinda, some kind of slick gimmick

I'll do anything to get your attention
I'll do anything to get your attention
I'll do anything to get your attention
Anything to get your attention
