That aweful memory of yours,
What a blessing, What a curse
And all our confessing forgotten every word we're saying

From the womb I heard my name
On your lips it sounds the same
As the many times I've ignored it since that day

That awful memory of yours
I'll never make anyone happy that way
Telling all the mistakes that I've made
But I promise you I'd never be the same

Would you found me like a treasure
...
