When I first saw you
I thought that I knew you
Now I know, I don't
Just wish that I did
Honey made a right
Stepped of, took flight
Upstairs, up more
Made a left and head

Looked down at my shoes
And the cuff in my slacks
Hand inside my pocket
Came out with something sticking
Double mint goes in my mouth
Jaws are breaking north and south
Look around to see who's looking
Figure that my breath was kicking, so

In the bathroom I go
And fixing his fro
You guessed it, the Long One
What's up Black
Goes the hand smack
I get the feeling that it's time
For some Black Sheep fun

The club is on the bush
Why you are no holding a cigar
Then you never know
Probably a Philly
Long cracks a smile
Oh no, here it comes and says
"Yo, Drez, honey, made you look silly"

Step back in the joint
And gear is kinda funky
My breath no longer kicking
So now it has pep
Strobe light help
That I don't know
Walks up, asks your sign
We quickly do the step

Where you at, hon?
Where you at?
Where you at, hon?
Where you at?
Where you at, hon?
Where you at?
