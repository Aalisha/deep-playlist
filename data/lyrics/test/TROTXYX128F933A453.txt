In a Sentimental Mood I can see
The stars come through my room
While your loving attitude is
Like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make
My Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
...
