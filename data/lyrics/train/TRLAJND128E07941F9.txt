I may be just a foolish dreamer
But I don't care
'Cause I know my happiness
Is waiting out there
Somewhere

I'm searching for that silver lining
Horizons that I've never seen
Oh, I'd like to take just a moment
And dream my dream
Oh dream my dream

Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
Where my mind oh Lord, is fresh and clear
And I'd find the love that I long to see
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Whoa, I like to greet the sun each mornin'
And walk amongst the stars at night
I'd like to know the taste of honey in my life
In my life
