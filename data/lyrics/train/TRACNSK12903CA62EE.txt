Well everybody knows what i'm holding here
Tell all your friends i'm not fooling around
Cuz i’ll point this barrel at any one of their heads
Tell all your friends to get down on the ground
Oh baby, baby i’m screwed up so bad
Come back, come back will you come back to me
Yeah you know you know that ill treat you so right
Tell all your friends to stay down on the ground
