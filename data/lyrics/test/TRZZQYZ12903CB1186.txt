Oh captain tell me true
Does my sailor sail with you
No he does not sail with me
He sleeps on the bottom of the sea

What did the deep sea say
Tell me, what did the deep sea say
It moaned and groaned
And it splashed and it foamed
And it rolled on its weary way

He promised he'd write to me
His promise he never kept true
...
