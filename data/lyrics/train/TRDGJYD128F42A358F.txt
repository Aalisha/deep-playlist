I've had enough
This is getting nowhere
You said you're leaving 'cause you said I'm not fair
I'm not happy but you hardly know this
Did you think that I would never know this?
It's all in your kiss
Your love I do miss

I never trusted all the friends you've been making
The time it's been taking
The rules you've been breaking
Ignored me when I asked if you have been faithful
You called me ungrateful
They made you so hateful
