Something I need from you
I really want to know
Like the way you do
I've been burned before
But not this way by you

And I need to know I can trust you with my life
On the Golden Gate bridge
Or a fire in the night
Or the edge of the night
And I really hope I can have you all my life
A fifty second anniversary
Of the whole of time
...
