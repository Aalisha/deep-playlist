Man, I've been workin too hard
Ten hour days and I'm tired
Damn this knuckle busted',
back breakin', no paying job
Know where I'm goin from here
Hot headed women, cold beer
Kick up my heels for a little while
and do it country style

[Chorus]
In my dirty 'ole hat
with my crooked little grin
Granny beaded neck
and these calloused hands
...
