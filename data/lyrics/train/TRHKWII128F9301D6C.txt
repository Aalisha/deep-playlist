Friends I know darn well that I'm heading straight to hell
If I keep living the crazy way I do
But I really have to say I have come a long, long way
For a hillbilly girl with the blues

So if you think my song's too rough please recall the roads been tough
And don't judge me darling until you wore my shoes
