there's plenty of time left tonight,
i promised i'd have you home before daylight.
we do the best we can in a small town;
act like big city kids when the sun goes down.

if it's not too late for coffee,
i'll be at your place in ten.
we'll hit that all-night diner
and then we'll see.

there's so many things i have to say,
i'll stay up all night to hear about your day.
we do the best we can in a small town;
act like kids in love when the sun goes down.
