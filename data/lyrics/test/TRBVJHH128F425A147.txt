Where are my mama and daddy?
They came a long time before me
Now, we've come on the steamship Atlantic
From our home far across the stormy sea

I have their letter in my pocket
They said, we would meet on the pier
But the day it is now, almost over
And the darkness and cold, soon draw near

Will they know, their lost little children?
As they look for my face in the crowd
It's been so long since they've seen me
