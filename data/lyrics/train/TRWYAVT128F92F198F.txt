Whiskey River, take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey River, don't run dry
You're all I got, take care of me

Whiskey River, take my mind
Don't let her memory torture me
Whiskey River, don't run dry
You're all I got, take care of me

I'm drowning in a Whiskey River
Bathin' my memory's mind in the wetness of its soul
Feeling the amber current flowing from my mind
To a warm and empty heart you left so cold
...
