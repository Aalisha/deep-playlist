Your love is like a see saw, baby, see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby, see saw
First it's up and then it's down
It changes so fast, it never hits the ground
It goes up, down, and up like a see saw

When you said you'd be my baby, see saw
When you said you'd be my baby, see saw
I thought your love was sincere
