Cavalry leader with a bold upper hand
Boyhood dream was achieved
Praised by the soldiers down by his side
The regiment followed his lead

The antagonists were so obsessed
Glory hunter his name
Fearlessly fighting the savage man
Brought him fortune and fame

My command, my command
A voice heard throughout the land
My command, ride by the sand
A must to fulfill the plan

Inner voices scream
