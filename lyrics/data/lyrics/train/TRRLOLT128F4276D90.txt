Come with us
We're gonna make you feel alive
When the lights go down
Feel the fire burn inside
So you've had a rough year
Let's leave it in the dust
Tonight you're gonna shine
Tonight! Here with us

Don't ever let them make you feel small
Don't ever let them make you want to crawl
Don't let them make you feel incomplete
Don't let them make you feel obsolete

On our way
To devastate
Wall of Sound
Sonic Beatdown

Ride with us
Cause you know We're gonna take the lead
