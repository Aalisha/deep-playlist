I see you sittin' there all alone
Crying your eyes out
While everything's going wrong
You know there's gonna be
A whole lot of trouble in your life
Listen to me, get up off your knees
'Cause only the strong survive

Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Hey, you gotta be strong
You gotta hold on
I said don't give up, no don't

I said don't go around
With your head looking down
Dont you let'em make you feel like a clown
There's a lot of opportunity
Out there just waiting for you
But you'll never succeed if you've given up
...
