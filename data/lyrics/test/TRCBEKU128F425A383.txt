I'm your door to door lover
I'm your cyclone pacifier
I'm your cheap trick honey
And my baby's my bionic liar
I don't bleed cause the gasoline
That flows right through my veins
I'm a motor at heart
And if I don't start
I get pissed off just the same
Your high heeled river of love
Is drippin down your thighs
