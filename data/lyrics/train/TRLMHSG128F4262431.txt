Times I'm uncertain I can't unwind
The shit we learned became a lie
Can't live forever angry and blind
The lengths we go to satisfy

It's a natural
It's a natural high

I'm not your savior no fuckin' lie
I'd kill myself to stay alive
Forget the future regret the past
No present tense is gonna last

It's a natural
It's a natural high
...
