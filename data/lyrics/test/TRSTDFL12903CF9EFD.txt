[Intro] [Consequence Talking]:
You're in a privileged position to learn a thing or two.
You got the right to wear something tight and have the time of your life.
Come bounce with your boy. Cons.

[Chorus] [Consequence] (Kanye West):
When you're ready to stop runnin'
Ready to stop frontin'
Ready to pop somethin'
(You got to turn yourself in)
When you're ready to start confessin'
Face the consequences
Then baby come learn your lesson
(You need to turn yourself in)
So would all my sexy ladies
(Come on out with your hands up)
And all my pretty mommas
(Come on out with your hands up)
And if you got a body
(Come on out with your hands up)
This one's for ev'ybody
(Come on out with your hands up)

[Verse One] [Consequence]:
It goes whoop whoop
That's the sound of the police
When they catch me goin' beast cause my face is in her teeth
And I'm just like Mr. Cheeks
Hit the Lights, get the Cameras
When we in the streets we can fight or get the hammers
Body or the wrist? also weekend in Atlanta
Came and drop more money on the jewels/Juelz than Santana
Cause that's the fine you pay when you shine this way
If it ain't about no money then that crime don't pay
See I find new ways to slide 'em out they dress
