picked the wrong time to be looking up at the night
popular belief came down,
destroyed his house and claimed his sight
forwards in lockstop barely able to draw breath
yeah curiosity killed the cat,
he's buried alongside every great mind we never had
i'm sorry i know it's only rock and roll
but i've felt this twinge in the back of my mind
you do not have a monopoly on the truth
