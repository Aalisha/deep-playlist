Was it you who spoke the earth to be?
And left it all in mystery
For the taking
For the taking
Is it thee who turned away my soul?
Could never have been so beautiful
What you gave me
That you gave me
When I've fallen in the shadows of the sun
Only you remain the hope on what's to come

(CHORUS)
Cause on a night like tonight
You bring me to life
And remind me there's another side of day
Where I will see all that you are
More than a sky full of stars
And the worries of this world will fall away
...
