I know you're holding tomorrow
So I will trust you today
You may not keep us from sorrow
But I know you will never ever change

You've overcome the world
To rescue my soul
I don't have to worry
'Cuz whatever comes You're in control
Forever I will worship You
I'm amazed by the things You've done
Well, I am overcome
