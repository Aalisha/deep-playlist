Your fragile eyes brainwash the weak
Remaining silent so to speak
Your dizzy head and weakened bones
Play funeral dirges in skeletons (skeletons)

Brainwash my head
To clear away all the lies
That I've been forced and fed
What could have been?
What could it be?
That you saw inside of me
That you would ever give me your love

I believe the fact that God worships you
Is going straight to your head
I'm dying to feed on your disease
(And I swear I heard you say)
Drive through to the next window please
Drive through now

Brainwash my head
To clear away all the lies
That I've been forced and fed
What could have been?
