Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?

If you look around
The whole world is coming together now, yeah
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Feel it in the air
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?

All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's alright
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who is hating his brother, when hate won't do ooh
'Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you
And now tell me, can you feel it, eeh, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Now tell me, can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Yeah, yeah, ah
