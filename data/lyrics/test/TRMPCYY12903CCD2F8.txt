Come here to me, my little chickadee
'Cause I think it's time you knew
That you're the kinda gal, I've had in mind
And I wanna play house with you

Bought the ring, took care of everything
And I'm ready to say, I do
You'll be the Mama and I'll be the Papa
'Cause I wanna play house with you

I never thought, I'd ever would get caught
By a gal who's five feet two
But it's a cinch, I love you every inch
