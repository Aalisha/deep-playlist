I'm at the darkest side of life
I've crossed the demons paradise
I've seen the fallen angels eyes
Some call this state insanity
It's just as dark as it can be
There's no way out I won't be free

Can someone hear my call?
Come and help me through it all
Can you ease the pain?
So my life won't be in vein

I'm heading to the stars
But the road won't lead no longer
Up to the sunrise it won't heal
The liberty seems far away
Can't find the way
The vision won't be clearer
I see blood on my hands
No more footprints in the sand
Diabolus

All through my life is close to hell
