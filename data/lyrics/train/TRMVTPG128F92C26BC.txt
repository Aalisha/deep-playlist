I'm comin', comin' down
Took so long for me to come around
They tell you, it smashes brain
Drain you of all the blood you've left in your veins
Spare me a brew and a double bed
Give me time to clear my head tonight
With these stones you cast so fast
It makes me think, we will never last, yeah
I hear it, hear that sound
