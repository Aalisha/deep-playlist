Creepin an a crawlin through the dusty track
I was only crawlin cos I broke my back
Living like a dosser in a rich man's house
Come and set me free, come and let me out

Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you can't see through the walls
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
Though you're standing tall
Ah-hoo ah-hoo
There ain't nothing wrong at all
I want you to believe...

Living like a lizard in and out of line
Fell down from the top and nearly broke my spine
Won't somebdy help me through this torrid time
Now Im changing colour and Im going blind
...
