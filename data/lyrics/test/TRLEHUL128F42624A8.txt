I don't plan anything
I'm trying to come home
Thoughts of you are always on my
mind
A runaway from problems, my excuse
when I am there
You roll over - once again I'm gone

It's old, it's plain to see this life of
tragedy
Save it for later - that's what we always
said
What will that do for us?
What will they do for us?
What will they do for us now?
