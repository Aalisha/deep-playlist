He was the captain of a team in forty two
A favorite of the fans and the ladies too
I still love those stories about the rock

He fought for his country in Normandy
And drove the Germans back to Germany
Captains right hand man was a rock

And to me he look tall as a tree
At times I though he'd never notice me
Standing in the shadow of the rock

I try to make him proud of me
But my mistakes was all he'd see
