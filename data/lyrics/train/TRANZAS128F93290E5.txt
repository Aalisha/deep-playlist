Her narcissism, his foul mind
Her promised love, deus ex machina
And mastic guns that skull-bind
A frail love, deus ex machina
She didn’t wanna know. She fucking never know
She told him lies and raised the deus ex machina
She didn’t wanna know, said she could never grow
She sold demise and raised the child a would believer

Her last incision, the last guise
Dementia? Love! Deus ex machina
Flip out the guns and skull fire
A frail love, deus ex machina
She didn’t wanna know and loves a wicked soul!
Her cold disguise now raise a deus ex machina
...
