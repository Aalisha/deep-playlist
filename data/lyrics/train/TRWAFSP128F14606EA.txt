Don't stand around
Like friends at a funeral
Eyes to the ground
It could've been you
And why do you weep
For the passing of ages?
You slip with the back of your hand, you're taking it out on the one you love
I couldn't believe it

And we might still survive
And rise up through the maze
If you could change your life
And never be the same

How long must I wait
For you to release me?
