Won't be mistaken with the saints of youth
God's backed up again
I swear when I scream
we're not home again

run from your probelms, but you cannot run from yourself
run from your problems, but you cannot run from yourself
you'll take this back

broken I've lied
pick up the pieces
you'll try to live for yourself
...
