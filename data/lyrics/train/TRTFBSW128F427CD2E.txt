You've got a famous last name 
But you're not to blame 
Baby I see you for who you are 
A one time apple queen, 
And a one time tramp, 
And an old time movie star. 
You're a shell picker, 
Of the pickiest kind, 
But you always find the ones to keep. 
And in or out of bed, 
You keep you're head wide open, 
...
