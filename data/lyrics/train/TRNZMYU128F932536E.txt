Fuck the American Dream
I know it all too well, I've watched my whole life
I've felt those calloused hands and looked into those broken eyes
One more bleeding heart that will never see its time
You suffer to survive, it will bury you alive

Fuck this place, burn it down. Everything I've loved is gone
This is not my home, I've played my final song
Tear us down, free us all
