If we're gonna say O.K. 
To submission at the border 
Who if anyone will say 
"I don't believe in law & order"? 
All the thoughts of alienation 
Feeling guilt through association 
Appearance altered fit the plan 
Making it as easy as we can

All you got is regulation 
All I got is inspiration 
All I get is your resistance 
I just wanna shrink the distance

Welcome? Hardly -- Face the flag 
Total strangers rape my bag 
I had no room to pack the bomb 
...
