We are called out, we are ransomed
We are not of the world we're in
We are chosen, we are blessed
To bring light to the lives of men

So Father sow Your seed
Give us life in community
Wake us from our sleep
This is Your time, this is Your place
And we are vessels for breaking

Under Your grace, we are led by Your Spirit
You have redeemed us by the blood of Your Son
Send down Your Word, we are eager to hear it
Ready our hearts to carry Your love

You are sunlight and You are morning
