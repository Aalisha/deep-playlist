A little girl I was looking at a magazine
Wondering why I could never find too many girls that looked like me
All I saw was hair so blond and eyes so very blue
And the words under the picture said, "And you can get this look too"

They cannot define beautiful to me
Someone else's eyes don't see what I see
Follow like I'm blind just won't do for me
God made me just fine, that's why I got to be

I N I, I N I
I N I, I N I
I N I, I N I
I N I, I N I
