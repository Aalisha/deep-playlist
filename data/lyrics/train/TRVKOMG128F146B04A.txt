And again I wait for you
My tired hands are turning blue
I'm not sure if it's night or day
My body's aching in the cold and rain
But, I can't go home in case you're on the next train
So, here I stand - I'm just waiting for you
Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes

Playing games I turn around
I kick my heals I count the clowns
I watch another lonely man
Oh, but there's something in the air

that says I'm in the right place
So, I gaze at the crowd I'm trying to find the right face

And there it is - You say you're sorry too
Everybody I know has to face the trains
Everybody I know makes the same mistakes
Well, there's a hole in the ground

that seems to eat me up
I can't say enough about the two of us
My arms are breaking I can't hold you enough

Oh, I can't hold you enough
Oh, I can't hold you enough
...
