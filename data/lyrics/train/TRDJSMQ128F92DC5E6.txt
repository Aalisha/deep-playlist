Box of sunshine, bottle of rain
Fistful of wind from a West Texas plain
Tell me you want it, baby, that's all you've gotta do
I'll do anything for you

I'd walk the Mississippi, I'd drown in your kiss
Catch a star in a mason jar so you could make your wish
Whatever that may be, baby, I'll make it come true
I'll do anything for you
