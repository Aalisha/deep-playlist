You tell me that you're leaving
I can't believe it's true
Darlin' there's no living
Without you

Down, dooby, do, down down
Come-a Come-a
Down, dooby, do down, down
Come-a Come-a
Down, dooby, do, down, down
Breaking up is hard to do

Don't take your love
Away from me
Don't you leave my heart
In misery
Cause if you go
...
