Ah here's a dance you should know
Ah baby when the lights are down low
I say grab your baby then go

If you don't know how to do it man you're out of luck
Push ya baby out then you hunch her back
Start a little movement in your sacrolliac
Wiggle like a stick wobble like a duck
That's what you do when you do the Hucklebuck

Oh - Workout
