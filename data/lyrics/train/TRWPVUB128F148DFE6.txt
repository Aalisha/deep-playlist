You opened up your door
I couldn't believe my luck
You in your new blue dress
Taking away my breath
The cradle is soft and warm
It couldn't do me no harm
You're showing me how to give

Into temptation
Knowing full well, the Earth will rebel
Into temptation
A muddle of nervous words

Could never amount to betrayal
...
