If all you've got to do today is find peace of mind
Come round you can take a piece of mine
And if all you've got to do today is hesitate
Come here, you can leave it late with me

You could be taking it easy on yourself
You should be making it easy on yourself

'Cause you and I know it's all over the front page
You give me road rage racing through the best days
It's up to you boy you're driving me crazy
Thinking you may be losing your mind

If all you've got to prove today is your innocence
Calm down, you're as guilty as can be
If all you've got to lose alludes to yesterday
Yesterday's through, now do anything you please

You could be taking it easy on yourself
