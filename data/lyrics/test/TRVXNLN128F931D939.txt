Rubbing my eyes so I won't fall asleep
From driving all night
Wind in my hair, and no shoes on my feet
No one else in sight

I still think about your love sometimes
The feeling I left behind
And I miss you

Drop to caddy
Nineteensixtynine
Eldorade midnight blue
Big block horses
Running back to you
Ridin' on a freeway
Sunrise are breaking through

Freedom was calling and I had to leave
But that was a long time ago
Wide open spaces taught me to see
And now you need to know
...
