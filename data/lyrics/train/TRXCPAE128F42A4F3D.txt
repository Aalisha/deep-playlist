I can't stop the rain from falling
Or hold the sunshinie in my hand
Just as I can't stop this beating of my heart
And I could not resist you from the start.
When I saw you for the first time
Felt like the eart began to move
The only man I saw in the massive crowd
I'm lost herre in the shadow of a doubt
