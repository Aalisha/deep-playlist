Why the eagle flies
When the wind blows in his eyes
And he goes no where just to feel good

You don't know the reason
Our love is like a season
Breaking down and building up again

Why you hold me up
When I feel like falling down
Is the love you have that makes me feel good

Ahhh
You make it easy
Take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance

Ahhh
You take it easy
When you let it go
I was hurtin' inside

Time rides all alone
When you're left back on your own
