Let me pour you a tall one
Come sit down next to me
Baby, you look so damn good
In those faded jeans

Well, I've been stoned cold sober
You've been cold as ice
Hey, I got a good idea
Let's get drunk and fight

Let's get drunk and fight
We'll keep the neighbors up all night
Now you can scream at me
And I'll make you cry

And when the morning comes
We'll make some make up love
...
