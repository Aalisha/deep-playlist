Smooth getaway, yeah
One time on my ass
(Getaway)
'Bout to make this hundred yard dash
With the cash

I'm fleein' the crime scene on the major decon
Power steerin', lost the handle in the Jeep spin
Deep in the seat, high pursuit by the precinct
My co-defendant turned stake and let the beast in

They rush my old Earth lab, grabbed 50 g's cash
In the stash and let the glock splash
Sun dash down the fire escape past the weed gate
The weed gate, thought it was a sting, popped the tre' 8

Jakes givin' chase, now the dread's my 'space
I was creepin' down the staircase, we met face to face
In the lobby, cold stares, show no fear
We out for now, but next time we might go there

'Cuz po's here, must've turned down the walkie talkie
I thought I heard one tell the other that he caught me
Damn, they got my man, he knows shit
Bitch nigga that I rolled with told shit

I layed low, 007 'til I get dark
He told where my wiz lives and where the whip's parked
Got my address off the license plate
That eliminates, headin' to my next restin' place
