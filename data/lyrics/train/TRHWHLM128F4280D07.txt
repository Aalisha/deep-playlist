I might as well be cheating on you I do
I might as well cheating on you

I always knew that you would be
Cheating on me finally
I never knew it be this soon
I didn't see it comin'

Yesterday you let me down
The only friend I thought I found
Sleepless nights heart in two
Baby who is kissing you

If this would have happend to me
ten years ago
I'd make sure that you'd be lying
six feet underground
But little girls we grow up
knowing love will find a way
So now we have an understanding
I can't see why I

Might as well
Be cheating on you
I might as well
Do all the things you do
I might as well
Have a little fun
Baby you inspire
