Lone man, yeah
There's no, no yawning, man, here

There's no sugarcane
No relaxing in the living room
No wonderland
No diggin' up old memories

No instruments
No sitting down for a cold one
And how about it, man?
And how about it, man?

He was someone you'd run up to
You can't just walk up to
You gotta swim it, you gotta swim it
The hard working wall

The hard working wall
The hard working wall
The hard working
And he didn't even know it

There's no Hollywood
...
