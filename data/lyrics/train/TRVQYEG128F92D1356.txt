They'all wanna go like that

Damn videos almost crash
You knows make the boys go crazy Everytime I turn my back
That was when I get explained
Cause I treat them
Like I need them

Cause I'm single
I don't need them
And they try to grabbed my hand
Every single time I seen it

Look what is worst in my jeans
They wanna spend money on me
Pop is the whole I seen
Love me like coffee in the morning
Cause I treat them
...
