Let me tell you now

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd

But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look

Oh baby, give me one more chance
To show you that i love you
Won't you please let me

Back in your heart
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go

But now since I see you in his arms
Yes I do now [(I want you back)]
Ooh, ooh baby [(I want you back)]
