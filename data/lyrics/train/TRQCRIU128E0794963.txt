Sit yourself down boy and talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Don't keep on telling me every thing's okay
'Cause if it was you wouldn't be crying
You been acting real funny when I see you lately
Sitting around poutin' all day long
Now how in the world you expect me to understand
Oh when I don't even know what's wrong girl

Let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out
Baby let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out

For the last few days when I saw you baby
Oh I admit something just wasn't right
It's so many things going through my head
Oh an' I didn't want to start another fight
But if your tired of people being bothered baby
In the world we'd be all alone
Instead of being apart of a problem baby
You and me ought to be getting along, yeah
