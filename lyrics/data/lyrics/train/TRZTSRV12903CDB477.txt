Shallow minds tighten the grip
Killing the last of the poets
He fell down to his knees
And drowned in the cold concrete flow

I long for what's untouched by man
I will dismiss answers based on nothing-ground
I forge dreams to uncoil

I long for what's untouched by man
I even seek answers where they may not be found
...
