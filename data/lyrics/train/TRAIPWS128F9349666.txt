And I can't control this feeling
Gonna put my arms around you
'Cause you are the heaven I need

Just what you're doing to me
Gonna put my arms around you
And surround you
'Cause you are the heaven I need

And I can't control this feeling
I gotta tell you
Just what you're doing to me

And I can't control this feeling
I gotta tell you
Just what you're doing to me
Gonna put my arms around you
And surround you
'Cause you are the heaven I need

'Cause you are the heaven I need
'Cause you are the heaven I need
'Cause you are the heaven I need

Come on, open up and let me in
Life is short and I wanna be lost in your love
'Cause I know tonight is the night
Ohhh, ahhh

Oh boy, will you show me love with an open heart?
Can't you see I wanna be alone with you?
'Cause I know our love is alive
