These four wheels feel like home to me
Enough with living broke at home and bank robberies
These faces I see and these fumes I breathe...
It's proof enough this is where I want to be
These photographs tell a story of their own
Two fists, white knuckles on a microphone
These highway lines, these miles and miles
They breathe

It's just begun and our broken backs are so cold
And these four wheels feel like home to me
