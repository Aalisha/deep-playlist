You gave me unmerited favor
Indescribable peace
And every morning
New mercies i see
Great is your faithfulness
Great is your love towards me
You bear all my cares and nothing compares you're Everything to me

And when the storms of life arise
It's your love that makes it alright
You said if we live for you there's nothing you Would not do
So we come to you
