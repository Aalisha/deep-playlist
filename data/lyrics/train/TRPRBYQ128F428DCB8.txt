She is waiting for an answer
She is waiting for the waitress to come back
And the coffee tastes like metal
So she pours in another pack of sugar
Ain't life sweet
No not really
But it will be
If she can just get where she's going to

So she's asking for directions
As she's asking for the cheque
And she feels the truckers staring
So she bums a cigarette
From the big one in the booth
And she laughs inside
Nothing to lose
...
