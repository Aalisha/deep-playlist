(victoria shaw/chuck cannon)
I like the feel of your name on my lips
and i like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
the way that your fingers run through my hair
and how your scent lingers even when your not there
And i like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
and how you enjoy your two hour bath
and how you convinced me to dance in the rain
with everyone watching like we were insane
But i love the way you love me
strong and wild
slow and easy
