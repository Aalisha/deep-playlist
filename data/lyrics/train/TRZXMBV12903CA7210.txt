Down are the times that I felt like shit
I felt so lost
That my mind couldn't find it's way
I know that I'm okay

I turned around and locked the door
What should I expect, well I don't know
Will I screw up? Will I do fine?
It's only a matter of my

Time is all I had to lose and all the changes
Have become the truth
