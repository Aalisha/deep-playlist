Dial the 7 digits,
It's quite simple
I'll be there in a hurry
Jack be quick Jack be nimble
Call me up when you feel the need to talk
When words aren't of the essence I'll soothe you with my presence
A kiss here and there from head to toe
Just call me up when you want more
You can be king for a day I'll be your queen let me treat you that way
