Over, over

What if I knew you was still keepin' old
What's her name around then you couldn't say nothin'
And what if you was spendin' up my money
Taking her out on the town then you couldn't say nothin'

What if I knew all the nights you was out
You wasn't with your friends then you couldn't say nothin'
What if I been done with you and you just didn't know until the end
Don't even try 'cause it would be

Over if that's the way that you was treating me
It would be over, there would be no need to beg me, baby please

'Cause you, you would know to leave
You, you would know to pack your things
Don't, don't forget your keys, I'm tellin' you it would be over
No get back, no sorry, can't fix that, just over
