I hit you on the spot
It was getting hot
You were just about to let go
We were in my car
We almsot ran to far
But we stopped fast when you said no

Your momma taught you it aint right
So you wont
Everytime we get close
You say don't
She told you what to say
To keep the boys away

But your momma wont know
If I hold you tight
Your momma wont know
If we kiss tonight
Your momma wont know
If we do or if we don't
All I wanna know is if we will or if we wont
