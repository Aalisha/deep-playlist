Do you wanna dance, Do you wanna dance.
Do you wanna dance, Do you wanna dance.
Do you wanna dance, Do you wanna dance.
Do you wanna dance, Do you wanna dance.
Ooh oh
Do you wanna touch (yeah)
Do you wanna touch (yeah)
Do you wanna touch me there, yeah.
Do you wanna touch (yeah)
Do you wanna touch (yeah)
Do you wanna touch me there, where, there, yeah.
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Well you're dirty and sweet, clad in black
Don't look back and I love you.
You dirty sweet oh yeah.
Well you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of a hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl.
Get it on, bang the gong, get it on
Get it on,(We want sweet) bang the gong, we want sweet), get it on.
We want Sweet, we want Sweet
All over the land
The kids are finally startin' to get the upper hand
They're out in the streets, they turn on the heat
And soon they could be completely in command
