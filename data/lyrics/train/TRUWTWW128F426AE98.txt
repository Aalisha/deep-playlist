I want to know what he knows
I want to feel what he felt
I want to go where he's been

I want to know what he knows
I want to hear your secrets
I want you and I want him

'Cause you smell like apple candy
And we're singing hallelujah
And the edge in your affection broke my skin

But I want to know what he knows
I want to touch what he touched
