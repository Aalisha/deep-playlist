Got your back, you've got mine,
We take up arms, fight along each other's side
You're scared and that's all right,
We're gonna make it, I know we'll make it

Are you with me or them, yeah
Cover me I'm going in

Hey, whose side are you on anyways?
No in between, no lukewarm
So, please, you're either for me or against me

You're treasonous, I know
A giveaway when you let true colors show
You're safe with them for now
