Outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall
There's a chill in the air and a howl of the wolf
While the rain beats at the door.

Seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high
And the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry.

When the dawn of a new day will see the light
And the strongest hearts grow old
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow.

Dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead
In the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one hears what once was said
And the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold
When the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold.

When the color of night will fade to light
And the weakest hearts grow cold
And the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow.
