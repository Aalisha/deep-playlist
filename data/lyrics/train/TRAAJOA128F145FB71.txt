Feelin' funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixin' to die
Oh, funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixin' to
I don't mind dyin'
But I sure hate to leave my children cryin'

Well now look over yonder to that buryin' ground
Heh, look over yonder to that buried
It sure seems lonesome, Lord
When the sun goes down

Oh, why
Oh, why
Oh, why

Black smoke risin'
...
