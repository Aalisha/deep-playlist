I don't want you to be no slave
i don't want you to work all day
i don't want your money too
i just want to make love to you
love to you
love to you
love to you
I don't want you to wash my clothes
i don't want you to keep our home
i don't want you to be true
i just want to make love to you
love to you
love to you
