There is a place
Where you can hide away
And let the music in your mind
Just take control
There is a place where
You can fly away
And let the music in your mind
Just start to flow

Let it flow
Let it flow
Let it flow

Feel the music in my mind
I hear you calling
Music in my mind
I hear you calling me
Feel the music in my mind
I hear you calling me
Music in my mind
