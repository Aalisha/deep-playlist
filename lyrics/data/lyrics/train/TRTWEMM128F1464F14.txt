See how much you mean to me
you're my electric symphony in blue
Just one look in your eyes,
Maybe I was hypnotised by you

You told me on the telephone of a picture so serene
And the beat goes on, feels like a fever burning and I say

Yes to your love and there's no secrets
high and ascending, delving deeper
fly like an angel wings unfurling
fanning the flames of love eternal
