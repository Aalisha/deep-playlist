Now will you overcome this impression?
When the life that you lead
Is second guessing me?
So you've come for things you left behind
You left me here with all this on my mind
I'll be fine

Now I feel so stung
Now I feel so stung

All I want to feels is affected
When all you want to be is protected
And when you realize you're on your own
The wind can push the sails and drive you home
...
