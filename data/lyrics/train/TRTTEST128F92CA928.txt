Everywhere I go
I take a little piece of you
I collect, I reject
Photographs I took of you
The towns that I passed through
I've got to have a memory
Or I have never been there
I have never had you, had you, had you
I can't remember, give me a reminder
I collect, I reject memorabilia, memorabilia
M-m-memorabilia
Let me hear you
M-m-memorabilia
Key chains and snow storms
Give me a reminder
Give me a reminder
Give me reminder
