Miller time at the bar where all the English meet
She used to drink in the hills
Only now she drinks in the valleys
Where every road has a name like Beachwood Avenue
or so it seems
A Croydon girl could really hope to find a home
But with a thousand miles of real estate to choose from
You begin to see the value of your freedom...
The moon is bright in the haze above old Hollywood
And deer look down from the hills
And it's three o'clock in the morning
Pill in hand you can hear his golden surfer voice
...
