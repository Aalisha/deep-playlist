Well he's a cross dresser honey, he fights for his team.
He dishes out a kickin' with a thong under his jeans.
He's a cross dresser honey and it don't seem right.

His train pulls into the station, all the way from Leeds.
He's gonna do somebody till his knuckles bleed.
He's a cross dresser honey and it don't seem right.

He gets home switches on the news, kicks back in his high heel shoes.
Switches channels to Eastenders, cleans his house in his red suspenders.

This is the court report, front page of the Daily Sport.
Skinhead cross dresser caught, for smashing up someones car.
Smashing up someones car.

Well he's a cross dresser honey, he's down on his luck.
