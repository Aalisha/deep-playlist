Come ride along, up front in my car,
come see the world as it's passing quickly.
Gaze into a scene thats moving.
Floating by, and then gone forever!

You never wanted to stay at home,
and I didn't blame you,
when you had to go!

Trace the lines, that now lie broken.
Face the past, don't be denied.
See if time can be your healer,
...
