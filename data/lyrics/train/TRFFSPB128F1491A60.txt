Get down get deeper and down,
Get down get deeper and down,
Saturday night
Get down deeper and down,
Get down get deeper and down,
Saturday night
Get down get deeper and down,
Get down get deeper and down,(Ok)
Saturday night
Get down deeper and down,
Get down get deeper and down.

I'm not alone, no you're not in my mind,
You were the victim of your crime, I left you behind,
Boy you were a fool, to treat me that way,
Not gonna let you, I'm gonna forget you, there's nothing to say. Eeei
You're a twisted lover, kiss and telling on a superstar,
That's what you are
Well it was Saturday night, I know the feeling was right, I didn't know we'd get so far.

Get down get deeper and down,
Get down get deeper and down,(Ok)
Saturday night
Get down deeper and down,
Get down get deeper and down,
Saturday night
Get down get deeper and down,
Get down get deeper and down,(Ok)
Saturday night
Get down deeper and down,
