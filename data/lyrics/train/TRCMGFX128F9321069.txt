Anyway mi go, mi she, mi must leff, mi stamp
Marijuana weh, mi smoke dem, seh too ignorant
Just some odda day, some puff a whole mek fi one

Then mi bredda Juju and mi idren name Don
Bounce and listen to gong when mashin' up di traffic jam
Police pull mi over talkin' 'bout him smell bud
From mi look inna him face and know this bwoy have a plan

Juju touch mi pon my shoulda, seh di bwoy a demon
First ting him waan to know is where dat smell is comin' from
Are you smokin' marijuana and I said, yes I am
True him, seh, some man trance, seh, it cost a couple grand

Him seh mek mi see di license and registration
And where are yuh headed? What's yuh occupation?
Dun know, seh, ragamuffin nah go answer question
As is says on the paper, read di information

From mi, nah go tek nuh switch or interrogation
So book mi, if yuh book mi carry dung a station
Mek mi show dem, how we did it inna style and pattern

Pom, rom, pa, ba, dom, ba, dom, ba, ba, dom
Babba, dom, ba, dabba, dom, ba, dom, ba, ba, dom
Pom, rom, pa, ba, dom, ba, dom, ba, ba, dom
Babba, dom, ba, dabba, dom, ba, dom, ba, ba, dom

I'm di judge, di lawyer Juve, I'm my own bails man
And if yuh check it out dat would be my station
Mi she, sekkle Juju royal for yah run England
And when mi plane land yuh, nah go thru nuh customs
