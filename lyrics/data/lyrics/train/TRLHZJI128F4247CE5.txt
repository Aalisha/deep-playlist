When you wake in the night
Do you think of me
Think about me
When you open your eyes
Tell me what you see
What do you see
ooo ooo ooo ooo
ooo ooo ooo ooo
Cause I heard that the light
In your eyes had gone
Where has it gone
All along
Does it hurt when you drive
So far away
Do you wish you had stayed
