Even the strong can get weak

I'm ashamed to say I followed you today
Stood so far away
But somehow I just knew you knew that I was watching you
You gave that silly grin the one that pulled me in
It's got to be a sin
That I just can't face the facts that you're not coming back
Just count me with the lonely
Go ahead count me with the one's that truly
Truly won't admit that you gotta quit before the fire starts and scars
Scars you back again but it pulls you in

'Cause still the waters run deep
Emotions run high
And I pray I'm over you by and by
Still the waters run deep
My tears barely dry
And my mind works in rewind and repeat
Still the waters run deep

I went out for the night thought I be all right
