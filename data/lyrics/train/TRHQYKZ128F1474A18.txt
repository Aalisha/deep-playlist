What happened to the way we were
We be fighting and yelling things
And we can't seem to get it back together
Pride gets the best of me

I said, Oh, I ain't even called you in days
And oh, I miss you but I'm playing the game
I need to check myself before I throw it away
Stand up and be a real man?

Girl, I know, I got a good thing
And I know, that you're my everything
So you'll always be all I need
Girl, nothing means more to me

I can try to find someone that's more special
But I'd search all my life for someone 'cause they're no one like my angel
