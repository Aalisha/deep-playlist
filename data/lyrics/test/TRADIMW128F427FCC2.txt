[Intro:]
She was 5'6", brown eyes, sexy toes & i liked her smile.
Yes she was.
Nice thighs, i won't lie, and the big ole jelly ass.
And the way she danced, she turned all the boys in the room crazy.
G'on girl, let me see you do the dance, do the dance for me.

[Chorus:]
G'on girl, let me see you do your thing.
Get your ass on the dance floor, let me see you do your thing.
G'on girl, let me see you do your thing.
Get your ass on the dance floor.
