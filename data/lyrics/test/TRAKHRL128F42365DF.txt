Can't match the stare within these eyes 
Do you have the strength for all your lies 
Can't stand the pain with which i see 
This integrity is what i breathe 
I inhale this life i gave to you 
And exhale the vile 

Time will tell Because my friend and 
Never will I concede the end 
Cause catarac resin fills my eyes 
Never gonna see the man Through your fake lies 
Tell me the things that'll take time 
To help see the things That'll take this 
Burn inside of me
