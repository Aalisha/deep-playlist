From the ice, the blinding white
A schooner's gliding through the night
Angry sea, we sail alone
At last I'm going home
I'm going home

Phantoms lured me off my course
Tried to kill the man I was
You sent a guiding light
Lead me to my lavish bride

To the crag that braves the tide
To the beacon in the night
I trust in you and I'm watching over you
To the souls that crouch in fear
...
