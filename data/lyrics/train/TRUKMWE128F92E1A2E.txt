Temperatures rise at a hundred degrees
Bet you don't freeze at the Mile High Club
The crash axe would be my only defense
Dogs go berserk when my engines start
Any any animal, any any animal
Get your feet up on the floor, find your father, four to four
Any any animal, any any animal
Jack you were wiped out, blood's still running
Sex gang children gang up on you, jump on top, on top of you
