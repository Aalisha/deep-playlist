I gonna jump with my baby
No, I don't mean maybe tonight
Ooh, jump with my baby
No, I don't mean maybe tonight.
I gonna jump all night
It's gonna be all right with her

I gonna swing with my baby
No, I don't mean maybe tonight
Ooh, swing with my baby
No, I don't mean maybe tonight
I'm gonna swing all night
It's gonna be all right with her.

I'm gonna jump with my baby tonight (C'mon boys!)
