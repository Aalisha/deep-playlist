(Lawrence Gowan)
Born of pride and frustration
Under heavy sedation
Fought to be realistic
Everyone pessimistic
Filled with anger and regret
That's how I was till I met you
Trapped beneath indigation
Search for retaliation
Bit the hand of the feeder
Never trusted the leader
Locked and held in a cold sweat
That's how I was till I met you
But you awake the giant
You awake the giant
But you awake the giant
The giant in me
