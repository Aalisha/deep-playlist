The kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck, y'know I'm sayin'
Brooklyn's prime time
The kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck, y'know I'm sayin'
Brooklyn's prime time

The kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck, y'know I'm sayin'
Brooklyn's prime time
The kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck, y'know I'm sayin'
Brooklyn's prime time

Now ain't this some old shit, I'm bringin' it round the back like no question
I'm swingin' 'em with the cranes and I'm swayz like the Jetsons
I wreck shit, I biggity-blast off, duke, I'm hectic
Just look at the funk that I brung from the young and the restless

Don't test this, I'm miggity-makin' yens in Japan
Diggity-don't give a fuck 'cos I rap like Saran or antiperspirant
I riggity-roll my punctures like a speed stick
I giggity-got the pops so kniggity-knock when you need it

So freak it, I speak it, I giggity-gots ta bring it
We're freakin' a track for Jersey, yo Krazyie spring it
Speak of the devil, figgity-fuck the dumb shit, it's over soldier
I riggity-roll just like a bulldozer

I'm kniggity-knockin' butts and smokin' blunts that's my slogan
Check it, I wriggity-wreck more heads than Hulk Hogan
No jokin', I be's the, um, best at how I'm speakin'
I riggity-rock a show and pack 'em in like Puerto Ricans

I'm phat, I biggity-bang heads like Jerry Cooney
I'm swingin' the shit from West, pump her up to the booty
Buster, I miggity-musta stunned ya, blunder
You blewa, I speak it, I freak it, I'm super, so do a

The kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck, y'know I'm sayin'
Brooklyn's prime time
The kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck, y'know I'm sayin'
Brooklyn's prime time

The kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck, y'know I'm sayin'
