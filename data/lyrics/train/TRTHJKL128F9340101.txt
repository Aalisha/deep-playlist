Movin' to the country, gonna eat a lot of peaches
I'm movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat me a lot of peaches
I'm movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
Peaches come from a can, they were put there by a man
In a factory downtown
If I had my little way, I'd eat peaches everyday
Sun soaked in bowls just in the shade
Movin' to the country, I'm gonna eat a lot of peaches
