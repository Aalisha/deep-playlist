I wish we could live forever
Then melt into the sun, melt into the sun
Time is gonna change you
Once it gets you on the run, gets you on the run

There will be, there will be
There will be a light, there will be a light
There will be, there will be
There will be a light, there will be a light

I've been running ever since
