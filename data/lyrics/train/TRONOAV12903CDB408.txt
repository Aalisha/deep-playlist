Come to me, I'm your boogie man
Come to me, let me take your hand
Smile, you waited for some floor
Come to me, understand
Baby, don't you want some more
I've got what you need, what you're dyin' for

Ride the pony, satisfy your funk
Ride the pony, satisfy your funk

Dance with me, I'm the rhythm king
Dance with me, and shake that thing
Babe, I feel like I could die
â€˜Cause I've never been so high, higher than the sky
