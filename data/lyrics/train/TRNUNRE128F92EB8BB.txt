How're you going to make your way in the world
When you weren't cut out for working
When your fingers are slender and frail
How're you going to get around
In this sleazy bedroom town
If you don't put yourself up for sale

Where will you go with your scarves and your miracles
Who's gonna know who you are
Drugs and wine and flattering lights
You must try again till you get it right
Maybe you'll wind up with someone different every night

All these people with no home to go home to
They'd all like to spend the night with you
...
