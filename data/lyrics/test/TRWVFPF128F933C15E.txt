There is love, there is lust
there is love fueled lust
and a thing called trust which i must not break for you
forsake in all others but you

there are storms I must brave
there are things i must do,
things i must not do, to break for you
forsake in all others but you

and i will see you when your older, when we are older
and i will see you when your older, when we are older

strong arms they held you to it
...
