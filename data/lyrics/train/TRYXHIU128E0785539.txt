I knew that you were cheatin' on me, baby
You were cheatin'
I knew that you were cheatin' on me, baby
You were cheatin'

I tossed and turned on many a nights in my sleep
Yes, I did, baby
Wonderin' if you were with somebody else
Those late night times with your girlfriends
I knew it was all, all a lie
I knew you knew you were with somebody else
How could you do me that way, girl

I knew that you were cheatin' on me, baby (I knew it, baby, I knew it, baby)
You were cheatin' (I knew you were cheatin' on me, girl, yes, I did, ooh... woo... hoo...)
I knew that you were cheatin' on me, baby (Why, why, tell me why)
You were cheatin' (Ooh, yeah, girl)
