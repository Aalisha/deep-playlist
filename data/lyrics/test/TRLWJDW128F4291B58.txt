Run, run for your life
Ah, run for your life

Keep on running
Run run run
Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run

Don't, don't turn around
Don't make a sound
Cause somebody's watching you tonight
Don't close your eyes
As darkness arrives
Cause, somebody's watching you

Look to the right (it could be nothing at all)
There in the light (it doesn't matter at all)
Coming into sight
Don't be afraid of the night

You'd better run (run)
Run for your life
The loneliness around you cuts like a knife
Do you run (run)
Run for your life
