Mis-Teeq, yeah
How could you do me like that?
Yeah, Mis-Teeq productions
Check it out

Seems like the more the days go by
The less I miss you by my side
Lately you've been carrying on
I've never seen you act this way
All this 'cause I came home late

If you had just talked to me
Then you would know how much I care
Instead you chose to be
Insecure and complicated

How could you do me like that
Had your back when things got twisted
No, you ain't got it like that
With me 'cause I'm a queen

And if you don't recognize
I'm the most high
And if you don't realize
I'm the most high

Why you feelin' the fire?
Check it out

No matter how much I did for you
You would never notice me
You never took me out for dinner
You were always too busy

I warned you that someone
Could take your time and space
But your ego kept tripping
Now your baby girl's slipping

If you had just talked to me
