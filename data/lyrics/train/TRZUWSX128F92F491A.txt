You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I like what I hear.

And now I'm stuck in the
The web you're spinning
You got me for your prey

Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back.
A likely story, but
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

You're intruding on what's mine
Yeah, and you're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you "Please let me be".

Communication
A telephonic invasion
I'm planning my escape!

Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
