Everybody's got a turning point
Everybody's got a choice that they can make
Could a moment change the course of life
When it hits, will you run or fight?
And why is it with life so many things get backwards
Could be me or you or something in between
Now here tonight, when everything you thought before was wrong
Let worlds collide, let love survive

Can you feel it?
Love could be the all that you needed
Everybody come on believe it
Turn it upside down and open up your heart
To fall in love again, fall for love
