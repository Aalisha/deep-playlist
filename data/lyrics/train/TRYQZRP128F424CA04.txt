Dark powers manifest
Spiteful horrors crush the sky
Escape from the twilight of a blackened mind
Blood of our enemies
As time shows no change
Embrace by the veil of malicious death
A story told of suffering, blood and pain
Screaming of hate the demons now descend
Smell of dying flowers
Enchanted voices dies
War cry from the darkness, loud and weird
Resistance of mankind
A small flame of hope
Show no mercy, the time has come to fight
The world is dying and here we all die
