Ain't go'n be no eyes
To make me turn away
Ain't go'n be no kiss
To make me contemplate
Walking out the door
And never coming back no more
(Ain't go'n, ain't go'n, ain't go'n, ain't go'n, g-g-go'n)

Ain't go'n be no cologne
To make me say goodbye
Ain't go'n be no words
To make me change my mind
Throw away all I know
For something physical
(Ain't go'n, ain't go'n, ain't go'n, ain't go'n, g-g-go'n)
