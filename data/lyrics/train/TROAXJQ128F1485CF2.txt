It was the hottest day in summer of the London town
I was dressed to impress, you know how I gets down
Every guy that I passed looked at my ass like "woah!"
And this one in particular couldn't hold it down
He said...

Hi,
Do you wanna go for a ride?
I got it all,
I'll give it to you, I'll give it to you,
I said you're promising the world,
Thinking better make me your girl,
But if promises are comfort to a bull,

And you don't know my name
Is it some guys are idiots?
And their dumb lines are getting me
Ladies if you with me, let em know
They gotta up their game
You better brush up your ediquette
A girl like me, you'll never get
Think you're gonna win it, but you wont
Don't even know my name

Now me and my girls are ringing at the hottest bar
...
