Walking under the lion's gate
Bitter tears for a city's fate
Raise your voice in an ancient song
Say goodbye to Babylon

Hanging gardens with falling leaves
Temples robbed by the Persian thieves
Once this empire was standing strong
Say goodbye to Babylon

Never say never
Never forever
Always and ever
Always forever
