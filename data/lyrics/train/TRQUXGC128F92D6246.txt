I know I'm losin' you, I feel it all the time
And I know if I lose you, then I'll lose my mind
So Lie To Me, Lie To Me, make me believe everything you say
Just, lie, lie, lie, li-i-ie, I'd rather have it that way
 
Nobody told me you were cheating
Aww it's just a feeling I had
So if I'm right, you got to Lie To Me
