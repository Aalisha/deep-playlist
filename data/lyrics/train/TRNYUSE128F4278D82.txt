I made my home in Georgia,
after my first relapse.
Your broken down home,
come-down and I decay,
no matter what I've had.

'Cause I've had seizures by the sea-side honey,
and I'm back because I'm coming off the bat.
Your descriptors are not prescription honey,

I made my name in California,
after the first act.
If I was too prolific,
then honey, you better, you better watch your back.
So when it's time to come down to where you lay your mat,
my home is your home honey, not matter what I've had.
