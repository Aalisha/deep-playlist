You know I care for you
But pretend and lead me on, that's all you do
I try to still believe but now I'm through
And the only place I see is calling out to me
It's the only place I know
It's the place where I must go

On the moon, that's where you'll find me soon.
I'll be alone again
That's okay, I must be on my own again.
I'll be waiting on the moon for you
