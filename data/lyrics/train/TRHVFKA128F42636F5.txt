(George Bennard)

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Chorus:
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown.

Oh that old rugged, so despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction for me
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
...
