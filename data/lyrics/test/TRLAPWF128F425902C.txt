It's the words you don't say
That keeps ringing in my ear
I feel like an idiot
To think that you are really cared
It's the kiss you don't blow
That I keep brushing off my chin
It's the punch you don't throw
That keeps hurting within

I only loved you
I only loved you

It's the words you don't say
That keeps ringing in my ear
I feel like an idiot
To think that you are really cared
It's the kiss you don't blow
That I keep brushing off my chin
It's the punch you don't throw
That keeps hurting within

I only loved you
I only loved you

Whatever you do
Whatever you say
...
