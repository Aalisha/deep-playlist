First thought through my sleepy head when I fell out of my bed is I
hope the sky is grey I'm gonna write a sad song today.
So I make up my mind, slip on my shoes,
I'm gonna pick up a paper and read the news
Cause I'm sure to find plenty'nuf blues to write my sad song
But when I open the door and the sun spills through
Takes away my breath and I think of you and the only blues that hit my eyes are those beautiful blues in the clear blue sky

so much for my sad song
so much for my sorry attitude
let's make this a love song instead
cause I'm so in love with you
...
