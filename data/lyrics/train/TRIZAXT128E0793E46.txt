Look at me, I'm young and bold.
Even though I may be growin' old,
I'm never slowin' down.
No, I won't slow down.
I feel like dynamite, I'm ready to explode.
Amplifier pushin' overload.
Outta touch with reality
To the point of insanity, yeah.

Goin' down on a flight to nowhere.
Goin' down, gettin' nowhere fast.
Goin' down, I'm on a flight to nowhere.
Goin' down, goin' down, goin' down.

Opinion is a piece of mind.
Some are good, some are just like
Where the sun don't shine.
