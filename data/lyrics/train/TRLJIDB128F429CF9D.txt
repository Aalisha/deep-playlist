Yeah, I'd walk those streets
I'd walk those streets alone
And though it was a long way
A long way from my home

Didn't know many faces
Some they look like stone
Some like hungry jackals
Ragged to the bone

But I'd go on believing
It was only a state of mind
And then my love would appear
She would shatter my bitter mind

Only game in town
You are the only game
...
