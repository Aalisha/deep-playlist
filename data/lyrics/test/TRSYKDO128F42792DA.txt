Sitting in your little car it's feels like something's pulling us apart
Maybe it's just gravity some force of nature bigger than the two of us

If we wait and see,
we could live like this forever and never really see,
that you and are not meant to be alone,
floating in the night

Don't tell me that we're not connected
Don't tell me that we're not the same
Don't say that we'll be the only ones floating all alone
Not you, not me, not us
...
