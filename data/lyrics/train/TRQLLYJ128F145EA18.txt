Momma cried when you left me
Know she's always loved you so
She said "hey fool what the hell did you do?"
I said "mom I swear to God I just don't know"
Picture book sittin on the table
Memories stacked up through the years
But tonight there ain't no pictures on them pages
Cuz your kinda girl, never gonna come back home again

Yeah tonight all the dancehalls are empty
No young lovers on the floor
So I'll sit here with my whiskey
Drink it 'till I just can't drink no more

And I don't know why you had to leave me,
...
