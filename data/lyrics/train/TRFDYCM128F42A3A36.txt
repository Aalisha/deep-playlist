Well life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack
It's early to rise, early in the sack

Thank God I'm a country boy
Well a simple kinda life never did me no harm
A raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm

My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God I'm a country boy
Well I got me a fine wife I got me a fiddle

When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funy funny riddle
Thank God I'm a country boy

When the work's all done and the sun's settlin' low
I pull out my fiddle and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low
