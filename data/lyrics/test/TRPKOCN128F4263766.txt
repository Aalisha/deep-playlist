Give it up, you're never gonna make it
Don't even try
You think it doesn't matter
Cuz you're a nice guy

Load up the barrel
Roll up the apparel
Yeah come up and make bombs away
Your McAlienation is contamination
It's contamination to me

Talk it up
It's a piece of fucking genius
But it don't apply

Your pointy shoed science is just an appliance
...
