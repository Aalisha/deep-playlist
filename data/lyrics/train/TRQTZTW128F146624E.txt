I can see the look in their eyes
Their fears, cold tears fall to the ground
And their words just echo more lies
More plans, blood stained hands all around

Look at me, I'm watching worlds crumble
Look at me, I'm making walls tumble
Take my hand, oh lord, it's all I've got
Look at me, I'm watching worlds crumble

With their hearts they ask me to stay
One life, one voice, calling me
I see their eyes and I can't look away
...
