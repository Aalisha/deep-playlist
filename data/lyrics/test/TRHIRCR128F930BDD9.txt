I have got a secret, hidden behind my eyes
A violation tragedy of violence hate and lies
Locked deep within a chamber, dark recesses of my mind
A tribute to insanity through hours days and time

Rotten to the core

Recite the testimonial, truth and nothing more
Accusations nominal Fall rotten to the core
So take a look, read a book, reach a new plateau
But stain the soul a life you took
You know not what I know
...
