Come on, my lover, come on, my lover
There is so much we could ever discover
She said, "Boy, you can't find me, no, you can't find me
But, girl, you can find me, yes, you can find me here"

Hey, hey, hey, hey
I felt alone today
Hey, hey, hey, hey
There's nothing left nothing left to say
Just nothing, you can do nothing
Since you broke my heart in two
Oh, right on

Maybe discover a new way to love her
What's the girl hiding underneath those covers?
Singing, "Boy, you can't find me, no, you can't find me
...
