Well I'm free, I'm free like a world, I am
I'm higher than the moon and so much higher still to go
I'm dancing on the silver star, my boot prints on the white-wall tire

See, see everyone's beautiful
Beautiful and terrified by the sun that's rising up in the east
I gotta find my way home soon or I'll just drown in my delight

And if I stumble my way through another year of blindness
I don't deserve to come down from these drugs inside my brain
And if I fumble my way to the people who are mindless
I guess I get what's coming to me and my evil wicked ways
...
