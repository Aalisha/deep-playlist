You took the same road
As some sly jeweller
Where you wouldn't get two bob
For everything in the window
Did some bad business
With a spook called Sherlock
Who smoked steroids
And he got me in a headlock

And the boy was so proud
Of the crocodile on his sock
Someone had to tell him
It comes from planet Reebok
