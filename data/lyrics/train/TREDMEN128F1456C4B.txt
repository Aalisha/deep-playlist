Comin to getcha, one autograph, one picture
buyin the shots, hittin the rock, yeah muthafuckers even trying to cockblock
And they say "hey, remember me?"
you know my cousin's friend's mother's sister's brother
Shakin the hands, kissin the babies
hotel lobby, pictures with the ladies
dudes throwin me sacks of weed on stage
chicks showin their racks to get backstage
People so strange and bizarre
i know you know that you know who you are
well, i think i dig you so strange
...
