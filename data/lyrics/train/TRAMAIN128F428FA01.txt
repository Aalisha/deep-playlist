I trust in You for life to live, air to breathe
Purity fills my lungs
I trust in You for life to live, air to breathe

My heart beats with great devotion
This is the start to a new beginning

I no longer live in solitude, no longer bound
My heart beats with great devotion
This is the start to a new beginning

On my knees praying for mercy
Hands raised high, humble and broken

Wanting Your grace, wanting Your security
Memories of laying face down motionless
With such a hollow feeling inside
