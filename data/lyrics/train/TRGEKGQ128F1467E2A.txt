A fire burns, water comes
You cool me down
When I'm cold inside
You are warm and bright
You know you are so good for me, yeah

With your child's eyes
You are more than you seem
You see into space, I see in your face
The places you've been
The things you have learned
They sit with you so beautifully, yeah

And you know there's no need to hide away
...
