Every girl thinks I'm so lucky
Just to be with you
I know that you agree with them
But here comes the other shoe
You don't know what you've got
Since you took a gamble on me
So stop messing 'round like you own this town
'Cause you've won the lottery
Don't think I'm playin' around
'Cause we're having too much fun to see
I'm not trying to bark, but our future's dark
You know what I mean

Goldo Rap
I'm so tired of making you cry
I think we're all okay and then I wonder why
You get so mad when I'm out on my own
You like it when I'm there when you come home
I just want you and everything that we got
Girl, you know I love ya and I love ya alot
But I need some peace in a world so cold
You gotta know when to rock and not to roll
