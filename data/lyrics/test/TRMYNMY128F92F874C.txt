So awake it'll sting your eyes
Rot your bones and leave you paralyzed
This demon's got you she destroys you line by line
Like a train on a one way track
Keeps on goin' never coming back
No don't wait until tomorrow

Your night is vanished by the devil
Your lies and empty promises are never gonna make it right

[chorus:]
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE
Nobodies gonna wake you up
