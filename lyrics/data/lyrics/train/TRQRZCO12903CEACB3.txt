Why won't everyone just forget about it?
I left a trail of blood with love not violence
And I don't deserve anything you're providing
I am cold, leave me alone

I tip-toe corners these days, always hiding
My mind, it swallows whole every last distraction
And all that I'm left with are a million questions
Like "have you grown cold?"
"Are you fucking miserable?"
