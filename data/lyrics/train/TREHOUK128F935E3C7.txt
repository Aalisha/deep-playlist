i can't get off my high horse and I can't let you go
You are the one who, you are the one who
Makes me feel so real, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, what I'm I supposed to
Oh, what I'm I supposed to do baby
When I'm so hooked-up on you then I realize, oh, I realize
That you are somebody else's guy

Oh yeah

Can you remember the times we spent together
Sharing the days in the sun
