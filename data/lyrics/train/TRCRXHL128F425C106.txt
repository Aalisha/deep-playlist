Reasons flying through the winter sun
I wait for you but you don't hear me
Blood runs quicker when the sun is low
But I don't have more blood to give you

Pretty pictures on a dirty wall still
Make me think of nights together
Lying naked on Venice Beach
I thought we'd stay like that forever

You want me
You need me
Why can't you believe me?
You touch me
You bleed me
How could you deceive me?

You want me
You need me
Why can't you believe me?
You touch me
You bleed me
How could you fucking leave me?

You want me

Broken feather
shattered glass
Are symbols for the way you treat me
I write poems in the dark alone
