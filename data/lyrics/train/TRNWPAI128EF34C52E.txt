Situation’s looking cold tonight
You’re a heartless killer and I’m in your sights
Causing pain with your attitude
Turning the screws when you’re in the mood
I don’t need you’re guilt manipulation
I got to get out of this situation
So here’s a warning
Here’s a law
It don’t matter, matter who you are

What goes up, must come down
Must come down to the ground, to the ground,
And the world goes around
Comes around and around and around to haunt you
