Oh, oh baby
Yeah baby, ooh baby
Yeah

You been leaving every night at the very same time
You claim you've been going to work but I ain't seen one damn dime babe
Does this job require that you I bring a night gown trim in lace
'Cause the one that I just bought for you disappeared without a trace

Late at night I hold my pillow tight and I wished that it was you
I'm up till 6 o'clock when you turned the lock
Feeling like I'm abused
'Cause baby I think you doing me wrong

Fee fie foe fum
Got a feeling you've been creeping with someone
How could you do this to me
Thought that you really love me

Fee fie foe fum
Got a feeling you've been creeping with someone
