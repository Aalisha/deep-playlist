[chorus]
you gone love it when we dance tonight
so cmon sugar put your pretty hands on mine
cuz anyway you like it, i can blow your mind
and you gone love it when we dance tonight [r-les]

[uh] lets take it to the top right now
[uh] turn your body upside down
[uh] just watch it when the lights go down
cuz you'll be reaching out for meee [take it down]

i checked into the right hotel
i know your body type so well
and what we do tonight, dont tell
just keep it between you and me, yeah

[bridge]
we can kiss and whisper
make a wish as this goes down
im a real good listener
so tell me how, you want it now [you gone love it girl]
