There's only one way to my galaxy
Hop on your moon soon
Don't separate from me
Your feet won't touch the ground
'Cause there's no gravity
Experiencing my trilogy

It seems like you're ready to go
Got your bags packed up
And your mind is set on touching the stars
Can't you tell I'm ready to leave?
So I can meet you wherever you are, baby

Something 'bout the sky
Something 'bout tonight
Something 'bout the way you look
Something 'bout your eyes
Something 'bout that flight
That makes me wanna ride in outer space with you all night

There's only one way to my galaxy
Hop on your moon soon
Don't separate from me
Your feet won't touch the ground
