The call of the wild, brings me to my window-sill, eyes to the dawn.
A tug on a heartstring by soft, unknown, fingers.
Leading me on, But there's only a streetlamp,
standing guard to my soul,
In the morning air.
A silent companion, waiting like me for the dawn...
Faint stirrings of life are heard 'cross the rooftops,
Breaking the spell,
Echoes of footsteps that call down the pavement,
With stories to tell,
And Chimney-smoke towers reaching out on the grey,
Of the morning light,
Passionate fingers, outstretched in welcome for the dawn...
The sound of the city,
Thunders around me,
...
