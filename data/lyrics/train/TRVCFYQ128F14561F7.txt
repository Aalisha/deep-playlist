How d'you know the music when you don't know the score
Do you think that you can make it when you don't need no more
Is it really the reason when it is not a need
Are you trying hard to write it before you can read

Hold you back, hold you back, and slow you down
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down
Hold you back, hold you back, slow you down
Slow you down, you've gotta try

Does the clock that you're watching ever tell you 'bout the time
