The mist of time is still concealing
The vision that I seek
Those who died have all borne witness
If only they would speak
Yet I saw it all inside me, for a moment

Have we done it all before, is there really so much more?

Now and then we've all been given
A glimpse of bygone days
I'd give all to see it clearly
