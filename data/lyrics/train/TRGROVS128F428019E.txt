This world is crazy
Holdin' on tight
Trying hard just to keep control
Don't let go

But don't worry, baby
I'll show you tonight
A way to soothe your soul
C'mon baby, let's go

Oh, I know you're achin' baby
But I'm gonna hold you tight
Until you stop all this shakin'

Put a little ass on it
(Oh, listen, baby)
Put a little ass on it
(Like a baby, like a baby)

Put a little ass on it
(Feel the smooth)
Put a little ass on it
(Oh, baby, like a baby)

Everybody's running
Rushing to nowhere
Or just running away
Losing their way

But help is coming
Gotta have faith
In a better way
A brighter day
...
