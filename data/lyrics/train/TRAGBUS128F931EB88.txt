Woke up next to the king
Got up, gonna fix me some things
And it makes me sick how I can't trust him
No I can't trust him

Said the bottom of his belly
That's where he would keep me
Christ Jesus
As I'm floating
And you get a brick and you drop it down on me
Christ Jesus
Have you seen us
Down on our hands and knees
And tell us what's the reason

Like a heart that's hung in the sky
