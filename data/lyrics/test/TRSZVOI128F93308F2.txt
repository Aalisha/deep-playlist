She's a must to avoid
A complete impossibility
She's a must to avoid
Better take it from me

You'll think she's a prize at the start (Prize at the start)
But take my advice, play it smart (Just play it smart)
She's nothin' but trouble
Better cut out on the double
Before she gets into your heart

She's a must to avoid
