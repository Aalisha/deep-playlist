You're soothing and extravagant
Your sex appeal is nonchalant
Your herbal essence shampoo shine
Sends shivers down my pimpled spine
Your decolleté is never loud
Your wardrobe is most talked about
You drive a new Mercedes Benz
You think in dollars, not in cents
But money won't disguise the face
You hide behind that phony grace
Your eyes are like the dying stars
They’re a darker shade of Laura Mars
You trap your victims with a smile
And simply take them home a while
And they melt away like a
Cheddar cheese fondue
Hold your smile
Rien ne vas plus - it's all over
...
