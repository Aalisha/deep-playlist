Zion, dreaming from an Iron gate
Dragon, fire ago burn dem all
Jah gonna start the revolution
The light struck the night,
Too indiscipline a battle dem fight
Walk and talk they steal, mash dem down we will
With the strength of a lion stand still
Iya, Iya, war today, oh steal I hear war today-ay-ay
The youth dem call upon the elders of which we seek after
The Congo Man a chanting, oh dem Congo Man a chant...

Oh the youth dem know, but what they cannot see
Is how dem use to laugh, and then kick upon we
Oh all the youth don't know, of all those tears we cry
...
