As I try to find my way, this broken compass seems to lead so much further away
To live and breath another day, to see the things that I have seen, only a few of us may
Reap the rewards of life, so much is missing or mistaken, so much doesn't seem right
Please guide me through this maze, engulfed by the gutters, trapped in this haze
So sick of this mess I'm in, far away from all the people that they really want me to be
So When did this road begin, things are getting worse it's almost to the point where I can not see
That there's more to life, so much is questioned in what's written, so it may seem
Shackled in so many ways, engulfed in the storm, trapped in this haze
