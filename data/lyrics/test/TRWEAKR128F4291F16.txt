When day peaks it's head from the blanket
And the numbers blur on the clock
He gets up and says, "it's time to shine again"
And even when the clouds shout in thunder
He tries his best to yell back and slap from slumber

They're just numbers, they're just words
They're just symbols, and they hurt
They're just sticks and stones buried in the earth

They're just numbers, they're just words
They're just symbols, and they hurt
They're just sticks and stones buried in the earth
