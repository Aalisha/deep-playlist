i drank from this cup
till it watered down my soul
i need You so i'll thirst no more

i started down this path such a long, long time ago
i need to find my way home

i want to be the one that holds You high
i want to be the one that gives You glory- only

i want to be the one that holds You high
i want to be the one that brings You praise
