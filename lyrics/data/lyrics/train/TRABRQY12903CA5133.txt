I love my friends cos they've got no standards, 
Morals or ethics in the quest for braggin' rights.
We take a plane to a foreign country, 
Loaded with [booze] and a head of white lies.

Trust me, trust me, I'm a doctor.
Trust me, trust me, I'm a doctor.
I know, I know what I'm doing.

La la la, la.
La la la, la.
La la la, la)

Numb and imune to my advances -
Calls for a plan of radical action.
