What, what
U don't give a damn about me
Do do do do, do do do
Do do do do, do do do
You've got some nerve, you call me after all this time
And expect me to be cool, what the hell is wrong with you?
Can't just pop up out of the blue, baby, that ain't how you do
Someone you're claimin' that you love so true, oh
That disappearing thing
(I don't play that)
I know your phone ain't off
('Cause I pay that)
Am I okay with it, please believe it
('Cause I don't need it)
Why'd you call me?
(Baby)
If u don't give a damn about me
(Damn about me)
Let's see how you do without me
(Without me)
Why you tryin' be where I'll be?
(I be)
U don't give a damn about me
Whatever you do, go on and do your thing
But in the meantime just keep one thing in mind
The way you dress, the way you drive was all because of me
Now it's over, babe, I hope you're happy
That disappearing thing
(I don't play that)
