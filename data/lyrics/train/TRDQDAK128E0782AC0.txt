The hangman's in the noose,
The prisoner is loose,
The wheel has come around,
And the velvet curtain coming down.
And I left it there,
A suitcase on a chair.
I feel my weight
And something tells me
There's a river underground,
In a place where there's no one to be found.

And no one came to see
The oldest show in town
And no one came to see
The oldest show in town
And no one came to see
The oldest show in town
