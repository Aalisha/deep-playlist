I see you fall, my raven star
You can make me pray like a superstar
I hear you call through the wall
Every time you're so far away but I'll find a way

Starlight darling falls down like the weight of a stone
You fall prey to my love, Yvaine, you'll never be alone

I see you're blue, my raven star
You can never change the way you are
So close to you, can you see me too?
I will try to take you away for my love
