[Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo Poobs let's go nigga - ahh, woo!
Ayyyo, I said I'm sicker than yo' average
One up in yo' cabbage and leave you there
I only brought the revolver here, no shells
Throw the jacks away I ain't talkin on cells
Get low, get a hoe, tell her where to go
Fuck her 'til her pussy sore, make her watch the door
I said I'm sicker than yo' average
Pump in the baby carriage, no fear
Nine in the Build-a-Bear, listen here homey
I said I'm sicker than yo' average
If I don't know homey I'ma fuck up his marriage
Get head from her, get a little bread from her
Put cum stains in his Hummer, listen dawg
I said I'm sicker than yo' average
