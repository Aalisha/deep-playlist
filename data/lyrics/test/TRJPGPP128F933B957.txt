Take a look at me, wired to a machine
Never would believe it, this can't be happening
Boxes that go beep, little lights that leap
Tapping on a keyboard, what's happening to me

And when the electricity starts to flow
The fuse that's on my sanity got to blow

System addict
I never can get enough
System addict
Never can give it up, oh oh, no oh

Beauty or a beast, don't know which I see
Still I couldn't leave it
Fascination won't it cease
...
