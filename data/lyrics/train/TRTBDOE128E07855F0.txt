It was a good night I stayed on key
Me and the drummer were on the same beat
Had coordination in both my feet
Oh what a night

I took off my guitar and I met you
Sweet little angel beneath the moon
The stars were shining and so were you
Then I saw the light

So I took your fingers to my face
And with the tips began to trace
The way that my eyes and my mouth were shaped
And you had your sight
For a moment that night

Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
What a delight
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
I see you in the daylight

You're only seven and you taught me
Life is much more than what we see
Behind the veil of history
Til faith becomes sight
(Believing is seeing)
