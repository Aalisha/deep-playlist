Put a ribbon round my neck and call me a libertine
I will sing you songs of dreams I used to dream
I will sail away on seas of silver and gold
Until I reach my home
Give me a guitar and I'll be your troubadour
Your strolling minstrel 12th century door to door
I don't know anymore, if that feeling is past will it last
Oh, how can you be sure?

And how do I know if you're feeling the same as me?
And how do I know if that's the only place you want to be?

Give me a stage and I'll be your rock and roll queen
Your 20th century cover of a magazine
Rolling Stone here I come, watch out everyone, I'm singing
