Winter Bites - Malfunkshun

Turn me over baby-wont you turn me over oh yea
Turn me over woman can't ya' turn me over oh yea
The world's my prison baby-The world's my prison
The world's my prison! The world's my prison yea

(now listen to the bassist)
I've heard your logic-And I've seen it in action
What more are friends for-The losers conquest
So I'll go out dancing with the ladies
