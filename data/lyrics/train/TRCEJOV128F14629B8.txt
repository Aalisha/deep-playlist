Let me be, let me be
Let me have my privacy
Let me be, hush, don't speak
Now, silently

I don't want to hear your voice
I don't want to see your face
I don't want to have no choice
In my mind, I want no haze

In a chair, in a chair
In a chair by the window
Let the sky be my sky
Let the moon be my halo

Let me love you upon a canopy
Let me love you upon a flower
Let me love you upon a canopy
...
