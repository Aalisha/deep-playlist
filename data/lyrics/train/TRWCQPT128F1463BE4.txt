Red lips, blue eyes and little white lies
Oh darlin', I'm a fool for you
Hey darlin', why can't you be true.

Red lips, blue eyes and sweet disguise
Oh darlin', the things you put me through
Your little white lies are breaking my heart in two.

You come around and tell me that you love me so
You take a little lovin' then you say you gotta go
