The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I try to lose

Oh yeah

My mama said to slow down
"You must make your own shoes"
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

Oh yeah

Keeping my groove on

They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Oh yeah
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
