I was born in Tennessee
Late July humidity
Doctor said I was lucky to be alive

I've been trouble since the day that I got here
Trouble till the day that I disappear
That'll be the day that I finally get it right

There is hope for me yet
Because God won't forget
All the plans he's made for me
I have to wait and see
He's not finished with me yet
