If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you
If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you

I'm not saying I want to change you
I don't wan't to rearrange you

If you let me make love to you
Then why can't I touch you

From the very first moment I saw you
It's been a different world
From the very first moment I saw you
It's been such a different world
