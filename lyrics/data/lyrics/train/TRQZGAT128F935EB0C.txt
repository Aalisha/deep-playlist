Every time we meet, everything is sweet
Ooh, you're so tender, I must surrender
My love is your love, now and forever

You're the one that I long to kiss
Baby, you're the one that I really miss
You're the one that I'm dreaming of
Baby, you're the one that I love

Keep me in your heart never let us part
Ooh, never leave me please don't deceive me
I want you only, you must believe me

You're the one that I long to kiss
