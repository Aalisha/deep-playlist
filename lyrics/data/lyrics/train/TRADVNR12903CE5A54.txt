For all that I love you, that's how much I hate you
And it hits me like a flick of the switch
You're my perfect angel, but sometimes
All I see is a fuckin' bitch
The problem's not you, I know, it's true
There's just somethin' goin' on in my head
Everything has changed, everything's so strange
And now you're stuck with ab-normal again

For all that I love you, that's how much I hate you
And the button gets pushed all the time
For all the fun I have inside you
I could leave it at the toss of a dime
