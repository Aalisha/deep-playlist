I don't wanna wait too long
And I don't wanna break it down
The sun is sinking just like stone
And it's hard to for me to breath

My mind is missing pieces of you
And fear and the pain have gone
But I'll keep holdin' holdin'

And I'm higher before than I've ever been
I was walking a tightrope can't you see
That nobody wants to be alone
I was walking a tightrope
Can you catch me?
If I let go
