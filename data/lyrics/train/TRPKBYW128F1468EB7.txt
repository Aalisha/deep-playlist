Her soul went runnin' to find out if she'd been misplaced
How could I be lost stop the world let me get off
No peace could she find, the devil kept messin' with her mind
The girl was so tough, but one day she had enough

Pardon the miss, she's gotta right to have a nervous breakdown

Her baby's daddy left, she still got on fine
She fell in love again but lost one more time
Woe to the day her heart began to decay
