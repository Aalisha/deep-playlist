Narnia... Narnia...

No one believed her
No one imagined it was true
No one could see her winter haven coming into view
She says she's seen the land beyond
She said she's walked her Babylon
She felt the cold beneath her feet
And time stood still where the winter won't sleep (where the winter won't sleep)

Chorus
I've seen a new world... like nothing before... just step through the door right
Into a new world... Into Narnia
I've seen a new world... like nothing before... just step through the door right
Into a new world... Into Narnia
...
