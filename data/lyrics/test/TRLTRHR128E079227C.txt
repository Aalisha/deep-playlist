Mmmm, mmmm
Do do do do, do do

Love washed out
The colours fade
Love so red
Is now pass' (La, la, la, la)
Never found a pot of gold
At the end of all my rainbows

Blue afternoon
Nothin' to do
Wonderin' why I'm feelin'
Blue afternoon
Thinkin' of you
Wonderin' why I cry on
My blue afternoon

Kay sera
Is what will be
I indulge
In sweet envy (La, la, la, la)
