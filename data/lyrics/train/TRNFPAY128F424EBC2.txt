Sister your time has come
Got to lay it down
Got to get things done
But you're looking so hard
And you just can't see
Trying so hard dragging on me
I'll tell you something baby
I'll tell you what I know
It's oh so cold - do what you're told
It's hard when they're telling you no
I said it's oh so cold - do what you're told
