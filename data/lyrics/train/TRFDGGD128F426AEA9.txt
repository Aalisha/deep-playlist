Does he love me?
I wanna know!
How can I tell if he loves me so?

(Is it in his eyes?)
Oh no! You'll be deceived!
(Is it in his size?)
Oh no! He'll make believe!
If you wanna know,
If he loves you so,
It's in his kiss!
(That's where it is!)

(Oh yeah! Or is it in his face?)
No girls! It's just his charms!
(In his warm embrace?)
No girls! That's just his arms!
If you wanna know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss!
