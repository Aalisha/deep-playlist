Taught to believe from the onset
Of heaven & hell & between
The institution's retribution
Damnation from on high
Living & dying together
Never did nothing at all
Except for the few
Who got rich off of you
& the rest
They were herded like sheep

(Chorus)
Mine are the eyes of God
& what I see is not
What was meant to be
Mine are the eyes of God
Mine are the eyes
Mine are the eyes of God
