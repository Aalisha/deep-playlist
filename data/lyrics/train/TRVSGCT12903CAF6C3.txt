It's the calming before the storm
alcohol sits nicely in your stomach warm
when you wake up hungover
you wish you were sober
I dance with the devil and drink with the demons
that'll sleep with death and fell short of breath
when you wake up hungover
you wish you were sober

just be pretty but naive
anything here is what you'll believe
let the rhyme get stuck in your head
wish you had undressed me in your head
it's the low before the high
it's been so long, I thought you were dead
...
