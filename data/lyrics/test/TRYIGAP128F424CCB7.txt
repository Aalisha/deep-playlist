I can see blood
Tears and pain
Frozen faces too
Yet expressive
Like these paintings
Engraved in our memory
Which we're gazing at
In a deafening silence

I see your face again
Its angelic lines
Overcome by this evil spell
Which will do us part
Some could see in it
Visionary signs
But all this belongs to the past

This curse blinds us
Something makes me so oppressed
I thought I would see you in the darkness
Why has nothingness
Nothingness replaced your face

In your eyes
I saw my tragedy
In your tears
I felt how sad it may be
There is no place
For us here
No room for memories
