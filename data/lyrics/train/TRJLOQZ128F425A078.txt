How did we get from the top of the world to the bottom of the heap?

I don't recall you mentionin' the boss is such a creep.

We still have the ingrdients to make this summer sweet.

(Well,) I got rags instead of riches,

And all these dirty dishes.

Just wish I had three wishes.

(Okay, guys, break it up.)

We've got to work, work to work this out.
We'll make things right; the sun will shine.
If we work, work,
there'll be no doubt.
We can still save the summer
if we work this out.

(Dude, what have you gotten us into?)

(Come on, we can totally turn this thing around.)

I'd rather face a seven footer straight up in the post.

That sure beats hangin' here

And burnin' someone's toast.

I needed Banjamins, but this ain't woth the stress
