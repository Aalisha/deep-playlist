I got a girlfriend and her name's "Divorcee"
That's what it is
That's what her parents named her
That's who she is
She's named Divorcee Moore
And I watch Divorcee go
And I watch her go go go

She's got two kids but still has a body
It's all there and she knows how to use it
That's for sure
Yeah Divorcee knows
Yeah Divorcee knows
Leaves me wanting more more more
