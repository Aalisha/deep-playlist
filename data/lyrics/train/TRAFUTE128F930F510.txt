A promise is forever ...
Supposed to last forever
So why do promises just simply fly away
Though love has passed me by
And left me alone and crying
I still believe that love will come
Along one day

If I have to search forever to find
Where love begins
I'm not exactly sure
Where I should start
But I still believe with all my soul
And heart, when it tells me ...

Chorus:
Somewhere, just beyond the reach
...
