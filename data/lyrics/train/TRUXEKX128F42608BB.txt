Nobody Spoil My Fun
(Saxon)

You know there's always someone
Who wants to spoil your fun
When your fun has just begun

So I'm going to find some little girl
And we're going to go on the run
I'm going to take her down to broadway
Where the lights and the music are gay
Gonna teach her how to play
Every night and every day

'Cause I want
Yes, I want
Nobody spoil my fun

You know I'm gonna dress her up, real fine
So much, your going to blow your mind
And then she's gonna put her high-boots on
You know you want to go along
I'm going to show her how to lose
Her baby baby blues
And then I'm going to give her love
A love she really can use
