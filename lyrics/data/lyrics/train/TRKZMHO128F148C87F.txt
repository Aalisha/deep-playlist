Alone with pain, I thought I'd made a friend
Why do you leave now is this what you've planned
Wait your turn it's a long time before you'll breathe
Stay underwater and tell me are you free

Cannot complain the pain will stay here for today
It seems to stay
Cannot complain the pain will stay
Cannot complain

I want to be there for you
You can't seem to take this ride
I want to be there for you now

You're not a shoulder if I'm the one to lean
As I see your red side when you always bleed
...
