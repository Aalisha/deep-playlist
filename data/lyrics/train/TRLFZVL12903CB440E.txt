Tell me what you're friends call you, and let's save some time
You've got three different colors in your hair
Is the real one hard to find?
Yeah baby, are you the type that thinks you're right all along?
Well if you want to be my girl, then you've got to be wrong
Most of the time

Things that you love, they can disappear, ooh ooh

Tell me what your favorite movie is of all time
Are you a book worm, or a worm eating apples stuffed on pie? Hey, yeah,
Are you the type of person that would really understand, hey
Are you the type of person always busy making other plans
I tell you, things that you love, they can disappear, ooh ooh
Yeah, baby
