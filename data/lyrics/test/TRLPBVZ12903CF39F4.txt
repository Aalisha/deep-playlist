Woe Na Na Na
Hey Yeh Yeh Oh Yeh
This is to whom it may concern
Raggamuffin rastaman return
Says we all got a lesson to learn
This is the reason that

I'm back to my roots
Back to my roots
I'm back to my roots

We took that commercial road
Searching for some fame and gold
And gained the whole wide world
And almost lost our souls

Some say we should have lead the way
Take it over from Bob Marley
Got brainwashed by the system yeah
What a heavy price we paid
...
