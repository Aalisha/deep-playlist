VERSE:
I've got an angel with me, in my sleep
Watching over me and my soul to keep
I've got an angel looking after me
Going to and fro and waiting me
When I'm in need
Protects me from all dangers
Seen and unseen
Stripping the powers of darkness
Angels encamped aroung me
Touching me in the morning
My eyes to see

Got singing angels
I can hear'em, I can feel'em
Encamped all around me
Got ministring angels
...
