Here comes sweet Nadine
I see her face just like the perfect dream
She's long and she's lean
And the fire in her eyes could burn a hole
In my soul right through me

I love sweet Nadine
I'd be her fool, I'd be her anything
Now you know what I mean
If lovin' her is deadly, death is what I'd need

Sweet, sweet Nadine
Sweet Nadine
That ain't her real name
But you know what I mean

Listen here sweet Nadine
