Source and seed of misanthropy
Is the age of inquisition
Where kings and queens got the power
To lay down immoral religions
Pursuit of innocent flesh
Shredding of their blood
Plundering and robbing
A thousand natural lusts

Hypnotised by the smell of death
Stiff walking to the stake
Amusement, tar and feathers
You are gonna loose your faith
Delivered from the hell's great fear
Spirits lost in gloom
Seek them in their dread abode
