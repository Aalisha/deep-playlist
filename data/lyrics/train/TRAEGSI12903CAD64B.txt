Every step I take, takes me farther from you
Every move I make reminds me that I'll always love you
Since you were a child we've built our lives around you
Now how am I supposed to live in this world we made without you?

Sometimes late at night I go to the field
Is that where you are? Are you a shooting star?
Can you say my name? Darling, can you hear me?
Tell me where's your heart now that it stopped beating?
It's right here, it's right here, it's right here

When you joined the war we were so proud of you
You seemed so grown up, living life the way we taught you
Then your first letter came, it sounded nothing like you
It took all my strength to keep myself from running to you
