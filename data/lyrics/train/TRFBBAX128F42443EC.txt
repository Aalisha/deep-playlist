I still recall every summer night
like it was yesterday
the time would never end
and my friends were family
nothing mattered more
than the loyalty we had
now i'm a world away from everything we shared
I had something better
waiting ahead
i try to take control of my heart
i had something better
but i'll tear it down and i'll tape it up
...
