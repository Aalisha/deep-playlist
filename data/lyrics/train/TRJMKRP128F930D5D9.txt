Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, yes, yes I
C'mon, c'mon uh, uh uh
Another one of those Saturday nights y'all

Yo y'all, take heed
Yeah, check it out, c'mon
You're now rockin' with the best uh
Without a doubt
Take heed y'all
C'mon, yeah, uh
Uh, yo, about to give you what you need y'all
Without a doubt

Check it out now, it's the type cerebral
World renowned, illustrious, ille-gal
My musical affection, bubblin' within your zone
Like champagne, known as the Fifth campaign
Thought be doin' his damn thang
Bent like, a boomerang, tryin' to maintain
I'm both yin and yang from Mi Kan Lang
What your lady gettin' me up? I'm never answering

Let her miss me, see me then she off tryin' to kiss me
Talkin' 'bout, "I dig you Tariq, the way you twist me"
Meanwhile, she comin' home tipsy, all grinnin'
And what you used to fit em before, you now swimmin'
Just take a dive P-5 deep, the team winnin'
Takin' hip-hop back to, the beginnin'
'Cause MC's are pretendin', I slap your sound
Out the sky like I'm goaltendin', bring your career
