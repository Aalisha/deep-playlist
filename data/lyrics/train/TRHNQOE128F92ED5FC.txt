I remember summer
Of nineteen ninety three
She was tall and blond and tan and man
She was all in love with me

She started talking about our future
And it scared me half to death
So I ran away but to this day
Her memory takes my breath

Should've seen her smile
Should've heard her laugh
Oh, the way her eyes would dance
When she brushed her hair back

She could've been mine
...
