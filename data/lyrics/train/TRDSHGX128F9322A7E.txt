All I want is a little sign 
to tell my left from right, 
before the ground beneath me 
sets it's sights. 
All I need is a reference guide 
to tell the day from the night

The sky is red. 
That mean ol' world's been 
 messin' with my head. 

Down is up to the upside down, 
is that what's being said?
