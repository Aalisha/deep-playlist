No lies, no angels
No lies, no angels
No lies, no angels
No lies, no angels
No heaven, no heaven
No lies'

No lies, no angels, no heaven
No lies, no angels, no heaven

Waiting on a corner of a red light street
Where the dealers and the junkies and the graveyards meet
By the light of a street light moon
If you hang 'round here babe, you're leaving soon
...
