You've been gone much longer than you
ever said you had the plan to
I'm just gonna wait 'till you come home

Though I count the days, they're grey without you
The weather's much better when I think about you
I'm just gonna wait till you come home

Empty glasses, burnt out matches
Curtains drawn on near-full blackness
I'm sleeping through the day
You're coming home
To reclaim this heart you owned

Lover
Leave me
Make me burn
You're coming back!
You're coming back!
I'll wait patiently
...
