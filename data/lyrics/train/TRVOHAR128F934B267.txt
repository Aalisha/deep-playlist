Said she came from Memphis
You can look but, please don? t touch
Didn't like rock and rollers
It seemed a bit much too much

'Cause it? s the natural thing, you feel at the start
Natural blood starts to flow
Yeah, the natural thing, you get at the start
Then she? ll never let you go

Hey girl, now does it feel alright
Think I? m gettin' through
Don? t you think the band? s real tight
Wait till we start to move

May sound funny, but you gave it to me
I didn't even like it
May sound funny, but you gave it to me
And now I got to live without it

Why? d you do it?
