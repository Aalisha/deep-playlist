I don't wanna change
I wanna know
I wanna do
I don't wanna wait
I wanna know
I wanna see
'Cuz there's no way I'll stay
No way I'd pray on my knees
Ooh, Baby please
No way I'd be fading
And loosing my game
And loosing my game

I don't wanna change
It's a picture of me 
I'm insane but I'm happy
I don't wanna wait
This is where I wanna be
Call me vain, call me crazy

I don't wanna change
...
