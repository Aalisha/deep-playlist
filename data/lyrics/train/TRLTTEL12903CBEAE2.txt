Black rain
Floods the downs
Ferrets burrow
Moles make mounds
Round your bones
Deep underground
But nobody knows
Nobody knows
How I wait for you
Summer, Spring
Autumn, Winter
Here perishing

Gypsy, stray
Bleak orphan
No one could say
The land you came from
But deep in my arms
You belonged
But nobody knows
No body knows
How I wait for you
Summer, Spring
Autumn, Winter
Here perishing
