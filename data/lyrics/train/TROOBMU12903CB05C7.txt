Here I stand,
Helpless and left for dead...

Close your eyes,
So many days go by
Easy to find what's wrong,
Harder to find what's right

I believe in you,
I can show you that,
I can see right through all your empty lies
I won't stay long,
In this world so wrong

Say 'Goodbye,'
As we dance with the Devil tonight
...
