Sometimes I just can't find the words
To tell you the way that I feel
'Cause I found a love that's so real
And I've been searching all my life
For someone to show me the way
Then you turned my night into day
I see clearly now, my arms are open wide
And I'm gonna make it through with you here by my side

As long as the stars light up the sky
Until the rivers have all run dry
There'll always be love in this heart of mine
Forever true (always for you)
As long as the world keeps turning round
I'll always be thankful for what I've found
I'll never let the sun go down
I'll keep shining through
...
