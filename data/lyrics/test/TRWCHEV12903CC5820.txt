Damage is what You and I will find

I sense
You're running out of time
Fragments that You walk on
Craving for a little piece of mind
And I sense
You're running out of time
Fight the tears and walk on
Damage is what you and I will find

Faster then pain
I'll get You out of here
And You won't be back again
All they will find
Is a tiny hole
Black and beautiful
