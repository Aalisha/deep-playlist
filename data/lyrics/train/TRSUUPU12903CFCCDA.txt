Verse 1:
Hear the notes they're ringing
Through the air I'm breathing
I think I've heard this song before
In my head, In my head
Feel the room it's swaying
Slowly dancing with me
I fall asleep to the words
In my head, In my head

Verse 2:
Sweet redemption find me
Hold me, keep me, blind me
With the truth of Your love
In my head, In my head
