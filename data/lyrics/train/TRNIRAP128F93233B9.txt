According to gibbons, this stands for "mean rhythm" and indicates
the album's general mood. 'straight from bo diddley land'.
Solid-silver beat machine
hunkin' down
funkin' up on magazine
on rhythmeen in new orleans

Drinkin' dixie 45 with hot links
in a silver continental
wired as hell and doin' things
...
