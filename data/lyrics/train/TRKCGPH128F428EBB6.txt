There's nothin' I can say
There's nothin' I can do
To show you the love
That I got for you

There's nothin' in this world
That could ever take your place
When I look into your eyes
I see a sweet face

I'll never set you free
'Til you give your love to me

'Cos I love you
(I'll never set, set you free)
And I need you
(I'll never set, set you free)

Yes, I want you
(I'll never set, set you free)
'Cos I love you
(I'll never set, set you free)
