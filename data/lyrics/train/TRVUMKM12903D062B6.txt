I can't talk to you once I've had a few, it's a shame
I can't talk to you once I've had a few, it's a shame

A free ride on a guilt trip
She makes out like it's the fall of Rome
Nobody likes a martyr love, so leave it Martin Luther
I can see your dream's gone stale so I'm going home

Because I don't wanna die in the same hole I was born
And I don't wanna live if it's all been done before
And I don't wanna get married in the same church as you all
...
