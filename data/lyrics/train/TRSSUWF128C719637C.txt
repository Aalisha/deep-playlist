Can't you see
That I wanna be
There with open arms
It's empty tonight
And i'm all alone
Get me through this one

Do you notice... I'm gone?!
Where do you run to
So far away?

I want you to know that
I miss you
I miss you so
I want you to know that

I miss you
I miss you so
I'm writing again
These letters to you
...
