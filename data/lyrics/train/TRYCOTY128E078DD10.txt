I heard some news from a friend of mine
Strugglin' with the woes of life
Just broken down as the rain kept steady pourin'
We questioned and we philsophized
But the only truth that we surmised
Is rain will fall so the rose will keep on growing

Sometimes it's hard to understand
How fate can deal with such a heavy hand

But in the end
You're gonna find that strength that lies within
And in the end
All you need is the comfort of a friend
And in the end
You won't break 'cause you're learning how to bend
And the hand of God will guide you always
In the end

Now I know a woman so abused
