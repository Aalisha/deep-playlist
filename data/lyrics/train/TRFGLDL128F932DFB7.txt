I've spent
twenty-two years in this zoo of broken faces.
Parents, and school children watch me sit on this neon nest, naked.

There's a girl in a cage,
making love to a switchblade.
There's a girl behind bars,
never had a cause.
There's a priest in shackles,
building bombs out of bibles.
And piano wire vines and the men in the pines.
That spin round, and round, and round, and round, and round.

(come on, come on!)
Take me to the pit of celebrity pregancies.
(come on, come on, come on!)
I wanna wear the skin of a magazine baby.
