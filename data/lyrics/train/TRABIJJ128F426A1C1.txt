[Intro] [Psycho Les talking]
Yeah, this is for all my beat heads right here.
"Yeah you know how we comin'"
Yeah, hit me again with that shit.
"Yeah you know how we comin'"
{Girl talking}
Yo yo yo Les, how you comin' this time?
"Raw grooves with the funky drum drummin'"

[Verse One] [Psycho Les]
I might joke around
But you know my beats don't play money
I know you don't got money, so I know you trying to save money
At the same time a nigga like me, is trying to make money
You a greedy nigga so don't make me force my way in and take money
Out your stash
WHAT! You holding shit from me?
I'ma get it out your ass quick fast sonny
You like that fast money
Me? I'm looking for that long term money
Cause I loves to buuuurnn money
