There are some things that you never want to see
Situations that you struggle to believe
Now you're older and I am older too
There are some things that you said you'd never do
But we both know that's not entirely true
You did them, didn't we do them together?

So where did you go?
What do you know?
You can't hide your head in the clouds forever
What did we say about drifting away?
We said it won't happen to us, now we're too clever
Well I guess we weren't that clever
