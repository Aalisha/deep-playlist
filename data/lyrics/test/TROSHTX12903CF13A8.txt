Hey you, what do you know?
There's something weird on the radio,
Turn it up, play it again,
It kept you quite and it made my day.

You're you, you do what you do,
But there's a rain cloud hangin over you.
I'm me, who else could I be?
If they turn around then I walk away.

[Chorus]
You will never stop us,
Cos you are you, we are us.
You will never change us,
Cos you are you, we are us.
