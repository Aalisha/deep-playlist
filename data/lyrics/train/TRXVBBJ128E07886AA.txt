Well
you made your bed
better lie in it - get back to sleep!

You should see me when you're not around
I'm a genius in this town

I'm a queen bee when the coast is clear

now I know I don't need you
dear.
So leave your hand like a magic man and disappear!

You're history
like a beat up car
No good for me
like an old film star
You're history
that's what you are
na na na na

You're history
you're history
No good for me
no good for me
You're history
you're history
na na na na na

You should see me from your ivory tower
I'm the hero of the hour
...
