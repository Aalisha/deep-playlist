They say, "trust on us"
They say, "our time will come"
And "your dreams will come alive"
One day, we will find
No way to cross this line
It's where our worlds collide

This world is not made for you and I
It's build on blood and a million lies
This world is not made for you and I
It's build on blood and a million lies
