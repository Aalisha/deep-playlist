Crane-J. Du Cann

Lost in space,
Lost in space,
Lost in space.
(Lost in space) - lost without a reason.
(Lost in space) - loved with a feeling.
(Lost in space) - trapped in a 22.
(Lost in space) - time is running out now.
(Lost in space) - love never showed how.
(Lost in space) - lost 'cause you've gone away.
You know you took it all away,
Losing control.
