Come to me now
I will host you
I'm the alchemist of your times
I know exactly what you need
You've climbed so high
You've gone so far
So you deserve something special

Come to me now
I will cure your soul
I'm the savior of our times
I know exactly what it needs
You've let yourself go
You've felt so down
So my hi-tech salvation is just for you

Obsession
Obsession
Obsession

To be the best
