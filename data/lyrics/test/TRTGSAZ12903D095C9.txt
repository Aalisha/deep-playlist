Come on, get out
Is there something that you're feeling let out
'Cause there's a price you'll pay and get out
Won't you get outta here?

Come on, be free
From your demons, lay on to me
So now I feel the pain that you feel
And it's not getting better

'Cause I've been there before
A soul I came back for
What does life have in store
Before I lay, I lay
