"Bitch-ass motherfucka! Peter Pie ass nigga! Stand on your own two feet
bitch! How the fuck you gon' bite somebody else's dick, nigga? Yours ain't
long enough to put in your mouth! What's up with that shit?"
(Background): "'Turn that shit up louder!'
Muggs, make it rough."

So many fools swingin' from my sack
Let's talk about the one who had my back
Down in the west coast, so lemme kick it
To the motherfucker who calls himself "wicked"
No rest, no peace, no sleep
Doughboy rolling down the Hill 'cause it's all steep
Jackson, lemme figure out the name
Jack 'cause you be stealing other niggaz' game
But I'm the wrong nigga you wanna fuck with
On my dick so hard, now ya wanna suck it
Go on the head, gobble up the nuts
Get your lips ready and tear this motherfucker up
Talk about Eazy, correct yourself
Cube, better sit back and check yourself

"Yeah, nigga! My homie thought he had a homie in you. He let you listen to
our motherfuckin' cut, and you turned around and put some old "Friday" shit
out. What kind of shit is that?"

Hmmm... Let's talk about this
