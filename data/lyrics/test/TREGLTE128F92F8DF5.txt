Mama never understood
what it`s like for a losing man
when her number one son goes bad
playing cards with the devil`s hand
But daddy got real sick so quick
for wars i`ll never understand
i was the one that good with the fun
took the money from the rich man`s land
Gimme some water
cause i shot a man
on the mexican border
cool, cool water
gimme some water
i need a little water
Jimmy grew up so fast
then he met me at the pass one day
said, you`re a wanted man
take your brother`s hand
i`ll be running with you anyway
So we rode late in the night
like the fires on the desert sand
til one day, the posse caught us
cause the sheriff always gets his man
