(feat. DirtBag, Missy)

Yeah, Imma set it off

(Missy)
Yeah
Ohh
This that hot shit ya'll set it off

(Monica)
You remember when I was just a young one
And I was to afraid to quickly let you show me thangs

(Missy)
Hol up, Hol Up
Big show DJ's
This joint so crazy put the needle back on the record let's do a double take

(DirtBag)
Now listen baby im a dirt bag
I don't know the different faces, I cant take it
But I got a jeep, so you lead and I'll follow
Lunch up in a diner, if ya act right we dine in the Bahamas
Now wow lil momma, im a gangsta
Anywhere ya wanna go imma take ya
Oh my god you caught my eyes like from 20 yards
