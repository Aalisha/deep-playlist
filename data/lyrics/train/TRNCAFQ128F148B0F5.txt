Father, father speaking out
Wants to tell you what it's all about
But you don't listen, you don't care
No one tells you what to do around here.

Got your girl, and it's all good
You're so tired of being so misunderstood
You'd love to get him off your back
You just want him to cut you some slack
You said, "He don't know where I'm at", yeah.

Get what you give, don't you know, don't you know
You get what you give
