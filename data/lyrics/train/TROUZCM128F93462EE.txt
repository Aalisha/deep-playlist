Wednesday night and I'm going out, 
It's been so long since last time.
Thursday night and I'm going out drinking
To cure the heavy head of mine.
Friday night and I'm going out drinking
This is where the weekend begins.
Saturday morning I do some thinking, I think, 
Think; think till I start to drink again.
Why not just another shot, 
Once I've started why should I stop.
You pour me up another cup
I never say stop.

The sunlight hits the ground again, 
I do my best to walk but then again
I crash, I fall
...
