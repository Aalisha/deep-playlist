Roll my tape
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Thirty days...
Anyone doin' that one?
(Which one?)
I'm doin' that one

30 days in the hole
(Yeah, that's nice)
30 days in the hole
30 days in the hole

'Come on in man, that's it. Yeah. Right.

Chicago Green, talkin' 'bout Red Lebanese
A dirty room and a silver coke spoon
Give me my release, come on
Black Nepalese, it's got you weak in your knees
Sneeze some dust that you got buzzed on
You know it's hard to believe

30 days in the hole
