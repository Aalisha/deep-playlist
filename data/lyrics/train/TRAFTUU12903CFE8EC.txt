Laying here dreaming, Staring at the ceiling
Wasting the day away.
The world's flying by
Our window outside
But hey baby that's OK.
This feels so right it can't be wrong
So far, as I can see

What you wanna do baby
I'll do anything.
If you wanna go, Baby let's go
If you wanna rock, I'm ready to roll
And if you wanna slow down
We can slow down together.
If you wanna walk, Baby let's walk.
Have a little kiss, have a little talk.
We don't gotta leave at all
We can lay here forever
Stay here forever.
