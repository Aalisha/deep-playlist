You don't know anything and you don't know what's happening
And chocolate is like everything there's no you and me
That's why I'm all at sea
And everyone came along everyone singing songs
Everyone drank some more and everyone giggled at the bore
That amount of hindsite makes me blind
What's more and I like watching you sleep
I never knew anyone quite like you I'd like to be
And I know more than this fishing is more for you
...
