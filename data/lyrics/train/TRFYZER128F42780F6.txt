Well, come all you children, give a listen to me
Let me tell you 'bout a new boogie beat
There's no hesitation, it's sweepin' the nation
It's the Rhumba Boogie down the South American way.

While Madame Lozonga was teachin' La Conga
In her little cabana in old Havana
We were doing the Charleston and Ballin' the Jack
Then that old black bottom till they started the Jitterbug rag.

Then across the water came Cuban Pete
He started the boogie to the Rhumba Beat
It's the Rhumba Boogie let's give it a whirl
While he plays the Boogie in the South American style.
