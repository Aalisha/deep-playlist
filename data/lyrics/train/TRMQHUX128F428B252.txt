(Carolyn Dawn Johnson/Mary Danna)

Hoah

My married friends keep asking me
When I'll settle down
They tell me time is passing
And there's not to many good ones still around
I tell them I am not afriad to be alone
And there's no need to rush into something wrong

So I'm not gonna worry
No I'm in no hurry
It's in the hands of fate
There's nothing I can do
And it might be tomorrow
Or the one that follows
...
