Forced to your death as the darkness holds the smile.
Calling no more to the liars in a land which once only cried.
Call forth to me your whimfull dominus and feel the breath of fire choke his mirage like a soft pirouette.
And we'll triumph with time.
Laugh at the cross, spit on the cloth, call the blasphemous demons forth and run with the storm.
Rising to the other side, the nightmares dancing on the horizon feed the sky and cleanse the soul.
