If I Could Change
Fast livin' got me trapped in this street game
Before i die i hope i have a chance to make a change
4x
I'm at the time in my life when a nigga ready to change
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this thang
feel like I'm trapped in a prison slowly waiting to die
it's getting harder for my people yet we don't know why
they cuttin sistas off welfare these kids can't eat
and it's the children like thuggish minds turned out by the street
I couldn't see it while I was outside slangin my rocks
servin' death to my people, commitin the ultimate evil
robbin' and killin' my own kind, Lord forgive me
blinded by this life of crime, God somebody hear me
since the death of my momma, my life is filled with drama
lost both of my kids, punished for what dirt that I did
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget
all the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game
