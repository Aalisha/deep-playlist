When you're out walking, and there's no one near you
But a voice keeps calling and you hear your name
It's not the leaves or the whispering breezes
It's me that's calling you back again

Oh can you hear me? Oh can you hear me
As you roam through lonely London town?
When evening's falling you'll hear me calling
"Come on home now to the County Down"

Do you remember the fiddlers playing
