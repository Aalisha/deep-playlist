in this hour you were like a tone, cutting me 
in this hour you were like thorn, hurting me 
i felt the pulse in my temples 
the aftermaths of restlessness has begun, has begun 
like a lashing of my soul - pushed in and thru my dreams 
with cosmic explosions - in and thru my dreams 
and at the doors of perception i had a dangerous experience 

our picture is darkened and you seem deaf 
our relationship broken and bleeding to death 
it's a dangerous experience and what will come next?
