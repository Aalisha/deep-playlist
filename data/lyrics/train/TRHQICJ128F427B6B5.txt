But you don't love me the way that I, I love you
'Cos if you did girl you would not, do those things you do
You killed my heart just to see if, I will rise
Above your anger and above your lies

And all I see of you
Is when you're not so busy

And you don't love me the way that, I love you
'Cos if you did girl you would not, do those things you do
You turned my life around and for that, I am glad
