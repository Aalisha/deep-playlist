Lord, I want to thank You
For every good thing comes from You
And with the gifts You gave me
I wanna tell the world how much I love You

'Cause I'm Yours forever, Lord, a living sacrifice
And on my journey, Lord, I want You to lead me
Then I know everything will be all right

Lord, I won't ever forget whose I am
