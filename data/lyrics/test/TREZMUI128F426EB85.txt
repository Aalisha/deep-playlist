Let's be romantic baby
Let's stay in love

When I think of the magic
And all that it means to me girl
Girl I get so, so excited
Thinking of love and all it's possibilities
And to think of the madness
So many broken homes, so many broken hearts
Well baby that won't be you and me
Together we'll both make history
'Cause we got a love so strong we're boundless through time

Let's be romantic baby
Let's be the ones who stay in love
Let's make a promise
...
