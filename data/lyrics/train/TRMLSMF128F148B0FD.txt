A thousand people here but I'm alone
My only friend is my dad's radio
Seventeen feels like I'm thirty-four
How do I get myself up off the floor
I need a cure

Happiness and misery
I'm up and down so confused
I want to scream
But there's nobody listening

Stop the war inside of me
Pull the plug, kill the lights
...
