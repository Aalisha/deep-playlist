Storm blew a tree down in my backyard
My axe wouldn’t cut it and my saw wouldn’t start
Good excuse for a trip to the hardware store
To give that little hottie workin’ a thrill de’ jour
I know that she digs me ‘cause when I walked in
Here she come a runnin’ with a can I help you grin
Like a puppy on a leash she followed me around
I left her droolin’ at the mouth when I walked out

Chorus:
But I guess you had to be there
To believe what I saw
Her blue eyes glued to my Liberty coveralls
She didn’t have a prayer
But I guess you had to be there
