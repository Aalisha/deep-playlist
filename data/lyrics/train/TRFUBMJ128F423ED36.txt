For about four years I've hated this town
Yeah, so much I just wanna get out
Since graduation was long ago
Please somebody get me out of this hole
Cause I don't want to get stuck in here
When I am thirty-four just talkin' 'bout high school years
No I don't wanna be there, and feel so stuck right here
Back and forth, side to side, oh my dear

My foot to the floor I will drive to the place
Where I can kick it with friends through the night
A place we'll talk about now and the past what the future holds
Hanging out with not much to do
Just aimless with each other - is what we do

Cause this ain't where it's at
My friends will second that
And I gotta admit sometimes it's pretty sad
But it's like were our own brat pack
We're always kickin' back nobody can take that
And that is that it's like its all we have

Whoa! Whoa!
