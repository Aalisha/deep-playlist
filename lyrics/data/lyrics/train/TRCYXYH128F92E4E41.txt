Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, I never heard it all

Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel

And here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart

Never tell a secret with your eyes
...
