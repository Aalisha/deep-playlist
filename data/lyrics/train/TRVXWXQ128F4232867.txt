featuring Marisol Angelique

Here goes another one, on that Mynt Blast! Are you ready?
Shoutin' out Al B., It's your boy the Riddler and yer girl Marisol Angelique

[Verse 1:]
So you dance with me
And you spoke to me in my ear softly
You picked me up in your arms nicely
I thought I'd go insane
But baby don't rush me
And don't presume that you will get any
You gotta talk to me like endlessly
If you want me to stay

[Chorus:]
