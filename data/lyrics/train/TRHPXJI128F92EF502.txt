You fall asleep
with a company you keep.
you're losing ground.
you should have told me before now.
Walk away
this masquerade is all i have to give, my friend
let's take the time to peel away
the wrong and crawl back in again.
Waiting for you to break.
in denial i hide my face.
You're wide awake
with a company you hate.
you're spinnin' round
...
