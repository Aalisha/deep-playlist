We get high in back seats of cars
We break into mobile homes
We go to sleep to shake appeal
Never wake up on our own

And that's the way we get by
The way we get by
Oh, that's the way we get by

We go out in stormy weather
We rarely practice discern
We make love to some weird sin
We seek out the taciturn

That's the way we get by
The way we get by
Oh, that's the way we get by
