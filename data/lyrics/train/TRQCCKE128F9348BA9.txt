I am goin' away, baby,
And I'm goin' to stay;
You spent all o' my money,
You got no time for me.
Yes, I'm goin' away, honey,
And I'm goin' to stay.
Baby, you' going to miss me.
That's when I go away.

You called me yo honey,
You spent all o' my money,
And you think that's funny?
That's why I'm going away.
