I just had to call, cause babe I got your letter
And I understood almost every line
You said T. L. C. is what you miss from me
You want back in my arms P.D.Q.
And ooh I love this game
Them three letters by your name L.O.A. what does that say?

She said ooh baby it's so simple
I did not mean to make it hard to understand
I've been gone so long
Want you to know I miss my man oh yes I do
And that message for you
Tells you what I'm gonna do when I get home oh yeah

L.O.A. (Love on arrival)
For you (Love on arrival)
L.O.A. is what I'm gonna give to you
I've been countin' the days
I've been lonely, I've been blue (Love on arrival)
For you (Love on arrival)
And now after all this time
...
