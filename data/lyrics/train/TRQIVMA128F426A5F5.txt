Addiction's held you back
But you don't care
Cause you're on a high again
And it's not fair
Consuming alcohol
While I gotta drive
Take a hit from the drugs you stole
And try to survive

Since your life was over, you
Haven't yet been sober, you
You have held me back so long
Everything you do is wrong
