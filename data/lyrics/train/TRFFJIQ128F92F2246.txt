I can't strain my brain
I know how it feels to worry all the time
I can't take the pain
I know how it feels to worry over, just a dime

Yes, I guess it was me, for us to guess
That we're gonna have to be free, keep on runnin'
When you feel her pullin' back you're goin' strong
Don't stop runnin' if you're real
You'll never slack, you got to go on
