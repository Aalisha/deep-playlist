In a church by the face
He talks about the people going under
Only child knows

We're lost and crazy
We're lost, lost, crazy

A man decides after seventy years
That what he goes there for is to unlock the door
While those around him criticize and sleep

Lost and crazy
We're lost and crazy

And through a fractal on that breaking wall
Well, I see you my friend and touch your face again
Miracles will happen as we trip

Lost and crazy
Lost and crazy

But we're never gonna survive
Unless we get a little crazy
No, we're never gonna survive
Unless we are a little

Crazy are the people walking through my head
One of them's got a gun to shoot the other one
And yet together they were friends at school
...
