Hiding deep in the dark
It's true what they say
You're insane
But you can't stop
Your morbid ways
In search of victims
To light up to dress up in flames

Guided by voices in your head
Killing to get through another day
Sanity has left your brain
Urge too strong
To see people die in flames

Holding tight
