A thousand break lights on my window
Dennis Brown playing on my stereo
Wait all this time riding up on the kings highway
So I see you set up the roadblock
With an empty quart, I drove right through the stop
Don't ask me where I've acquired my brand new car

I've been holding tears, it's taken me a couple of gears
I noticed that the lights have changed
The freaks are somehow normal and accepted deranged
So why must I be confused, I can't be around your abuse
Let me tell you

Your mixed up moods and attitudes won't work
I'm done with this type of love we do, do you hear me?
All you do is confuse and hurt
