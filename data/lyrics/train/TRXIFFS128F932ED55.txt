And I wish I could pretend I'm not alone
And I wish I could defend everyone
I wish I could take you all in my arms
But ignorance is such a bliss

And we're all going to hell, yeah
Sing with me, sing with me now
We are all going to hell, yeah
Sing with me, sing with me now
We are all going to hell, yeah
Sing with me, sing with me now
Just be glad someone bothers to tell, yeah

And I wish you dared to walk up to me
And I wish you had the courage, the bright eyes to see
But I realise you're not the one to save me
And expectation is such a drag
