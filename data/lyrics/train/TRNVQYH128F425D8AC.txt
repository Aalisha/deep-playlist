(Billy Dean/Tim Nichols)

Remember Ricky told Diane when he slipped
That gold ring on her hand it was there to stay
Now the attorneys are on the phone
Dividingup everything they own
They're going separate ways.

So many hearts get wasted
In those Ricky and Diane cases
And I hate to see good love die young.
