I was sitting lonely in my car
Watching her come and go
I could feel the strings pulling my heart
From the old house,
That I used to know
Like the river that was flowing
She was coming without knowing
Our love's the river that somehow lost it's flow,
Lost it's flow

From my car I can see her there
As the curtain slowly moves
As he runs his fingers thru her hair
And the fire slowly grooves

What's the answer to this pain
I want to get back to her love again
And there she's sitting in that room
When she walked 'cross the street
...
