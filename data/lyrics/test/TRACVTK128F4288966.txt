Outerspace music man beating ya'll niggas in the back of skullcap

If I'm alone in the zone take away my throne
'Cause a king shouldn't roam too far from home
My ground's too sacred for the naked to fear
Feel free to arrive and quickly disappear
No need to indulge into a war of words
Got a ground full of thorns that leave you torn and served
Only break bread with fam I trust
And extend my hand to those who understand us
King Size, you ma nigga for life, Vinn Paz you ma nigga for life
And we gon' ride till the cops come tear the doors down
The next millenium underground motown
Now let that sink in
Let that marinate and leave ya'll thinking
And catch the bait
We fishing for competition is ragged
Ya'll niggas faggot my love is just filled with ratchets
