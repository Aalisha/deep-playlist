My baby, she left me, my baby, she's gone
My sweet little Angel has spread her wings and flown
Can't think of a reason for going on
From this day I will play the blues
She said it was over, this time it's the end
Bad luck and trouble gonna be my only friend
I still can't believe it, after all we've been through
