None of that's true, we do it not you
That' why I got you stuck on to my style like glue
The crew definitely is back again
But I'm back to win so just tell a friend

That I'm still twisting and bending
Minds and rhymes until the very end
With the rhymes and the loops
Stomping out wack troops in my big black boots

Collecting respect and the loot
From the way I grab the microphone and execute
[Incomprehensible] think I'm cute
Say what?

Yo man, I pay them no attention
I stay deep into the cut
'Cause I leave the tricks alone
'Cause my name is not David Copper-Filled

Pockets, never net a man, who don't hate it
So let it be stated
Niggas couldn't fade it with an edit
And Xerox M.C.'s are pathetic

They tryin' to duplicate
But their comin' out synthetic
The name is Bootie Brown
And phony M.C.'s forget it

Imani Bootie Brown Fatlip and Slimkid Tre
Imani Bootie Brown Fatlip and Slimkid Tre
Imani Bootie Brown Fatlip and Slimkid Tre
We do it this way, we do it this way
