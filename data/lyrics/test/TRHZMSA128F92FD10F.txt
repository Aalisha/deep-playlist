[Spoken:]
Do you recall the night?
That very, very special night
Do you remember a girl?
That very special girl
Well, to the old and to the new
We rededicate this song to you

Oh, what a night
To hold you near
Oh, what a night
To squeeze you, dear
That's why I love you so

Oh, what a night
To love you, dear
