The beauty of a butterfly that turns into something new
And I feel a new beginning
The beauty of a butterfly that turns into something new
And I feel a new beginning

So I go to work and smile
And I'm happy with myself
A brave face for my crowd
Correcting all my faults
With prescription medicine
My trouble surges

The beauty of a butterfly that turns into something new
And I feel a new beginning
The beauty of a butterfly that turns into something new
And I feel a new beginning
...
