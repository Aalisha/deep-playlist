Well I dream that I was Portuguese
inside my hotel room
the word upon these beautiful streets
sweet poetry is born, here
who knew these dreams inside my head
would reach my seed sown soul
and hear those things that seem so far away
they seem to be so near

Is it wrong to want love
is it wrong to never hate
...
