Every Beat Of My Heart
Rod Stewart

Through these misty eyes I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country
heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
but don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
...
