If I told you 
Heaven knows 
Got me spinning from my head down to my toes 
Oh... 
Without warning I'm exposed 
And my heart misses a beat when you're so close 
Oh... 

And then Love Comes in a heartbeat 
Love Comes and you can't breathe 
oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh) 
And then Love Comes in a heartbeat 
Love Comes and you can't sleep 
oh oh oh oh oh oh heartbeat heartbeat-beat-beat 

Caught a rainbow 
...
