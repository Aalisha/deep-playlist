There's holes up in the sky
The devil punched down to the monkeys
And now they've got drive through
And a video store where there used to be real live actors
Used to ride around here
Up on my high horse
With all the other good little butcher boys
A plagiarist of course
So roll over sweet thing
Like a nuclear reprisal inbound from outer space
There's a comparison here I'm trying to swing

God damn it's deafening!
