how many times have I sat drinking my tea?
how many feelings are loose within me?
cant really hear what you want me to see
you come and go just exactly like you please
you dont give me no explanations
you dont give me any explanations 

cosmic structures and I'm breaking down walls
I'm caught in a garden so I hide behind them all
I could be your hired help, you could fire me at will
...
