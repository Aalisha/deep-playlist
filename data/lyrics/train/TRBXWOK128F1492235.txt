Everybody move your body
Now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move & groove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on
Everybody move your body
Now do it
Here is something that's gonna make you move & grove
Hey D.J. keep playing that song, all night
On and on and on

It's Friday night and the weekend's here
I need to unwind, where's the party, Mr. D.J
I am ready to call my friends
So we could all get down
