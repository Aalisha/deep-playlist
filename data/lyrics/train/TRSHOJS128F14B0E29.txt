I met a Cosmic Cowboy and He's ridin the stary range.
He's a supernatural plowboy.
He's dressed up kind of strange.
At first you know, I didn't even see him;
Hey, I was out there on the run.
But that old hat that He's wearin,
its shinin brighter than the sun.
And when my eyes adjusted,
to the flashin of his smile;
Oh, I saw his invitation. He said, "Come on, we'll go ridin for awhile."

And you know we rode along together,
for more than half a day.
Right through the changin weather; the sky was all turning gray.
And the chilly winds were blowin, and the cold was cutting deep.
Then it started snowing,
the trail was gettin steep.
