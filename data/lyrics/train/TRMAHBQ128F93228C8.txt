You know I've been thinking
Counting up the days
I try to forget you, but you just wont fade
You know I've been losing
Losing my mind
I'm just a prisoner in this world left behind

I don't where I'm going, what I'm supposed to do
One thing I know for sure is that I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
So baby come back now, back now
Pull me out of my misery
Now it was a good love, bad love
I don't know what you did to me
I try to hold on, hold on
