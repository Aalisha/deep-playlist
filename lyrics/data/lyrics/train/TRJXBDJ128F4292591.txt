A few kisses ago, you loved me
Took your pocket knife, carved our names on a tree
My heart skips a beat to whatever you say
What have I done to make you push me away

You are my focus, you're the air that I breathe
Can't imagine you with someone else other than me
You don't kiss me no more, and I need your energy
Tell me where will I fly to if you set me free

1 - Stars fell like snowflakes on my head
Now there's emptiness in my bed
I still believe all the things you said
...
