Listen Up

Gotta Getcha for me now, oh oh
I know i Gotta Getcha for me now, oh oh

I know i wah ah ah ah ah
I know i wah ah ah ah ah
I know i wah ah ah ah ah

Life, life could be fine
Doing things together
Any kind of weather
Don't waste precious time
Making hearts surrender
Get it on together
I, i always knew
We were for each other
Living to discover
Dreams, really come true
Nothing could be better
