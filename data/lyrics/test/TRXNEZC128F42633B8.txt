A pint of beer and a pretty girl
A pack of Camel lights
Another night, another bar
Green, green neon lights

Smoke acts as a camouflage
For every lizard with a line
Forget about the pretty girl
A Saranac will do just fine

A pint of beer and a shot of jack
A pack of Camel lights
Some days don't see the day
And some don't see the night

Damn barstool wobbles
There ain't no footrest at the bar
When I pass through my water glass
I can, I can see who you are

One more bottle, one more bottle
...
