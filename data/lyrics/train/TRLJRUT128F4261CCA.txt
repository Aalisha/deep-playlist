Talk about love, talk about trust
Talkin' 'bout forever, baby
When you're talkin' 'bout us
I give you my word, stick to my guns
Believe me, when I tell you, baby
That we've just begun
You don't understand, no
The full intent of my plan

Baby, I wanna be soul provider, yeah
Baby, I wanna stay that way for the longest time
Baby, I wanna be soul provider
Just say you'll let me and, darlin', I will, I will yeah
