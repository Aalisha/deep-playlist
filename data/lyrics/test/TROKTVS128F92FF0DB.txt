Now baby don't worry,...if he troubles your mind,
it'll all wash away, girl,.in the river of time.
If you need a shoulder,...I'll be a-round.
Be your rock to hold onto... till the river goes down.

It's hell and high water,...that your goin' thro.u.ugh.
But come hell or high water,.I'll be here waiting for you.
