've traveled over this country wide a seeking fortune fair
Up and down the 2 coast line to travel everywhere
From Portland East to Portland West and back along the line
I'm a going back to the place that's best, an old hometown of mine

Oh, eight more miles to Louisville will come into my view
Eight more miles on this old road and I'll never more be blue
I knew someday that I'd come back I knew it from the start
Eight more miles to Louisville, the hometown of my heart
