Once I had a little girl as pretty
as I have known
Lord, you know I loved he so and then she
left me all alone
And I swore here on this barstool
I'd never make that mistake again
Well you ain't so fine but you're all mine
And I'll love you till the end

Chorus
So darlin' don't you worry 'cause they
Say that love is blind
Lust has eyes like an eagle it's gonna drive
me outta my mind
