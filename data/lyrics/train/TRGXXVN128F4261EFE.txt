(Mike Lawler/Bill Rice/Sharon Rice)

Well, good mornin'
Tell me how'd you sleep last night
You're still smiling
So we must've done something right
Don't feel guilty
Because you turned to me last night

We ain't done nothin' wrong
We've just been lonely too long

We've just been lonely too long

It's only natural
When you've been too long in the dark
