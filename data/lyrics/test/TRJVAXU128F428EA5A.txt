Baby, baby, baby, babe
Ooohhh

Oooh if you could read my mind.
You know how much I want you girl
All the time
Baby if you only knew, what I could do with a woman
like you
Everyday I fantasize
See visions of your loveliness, laying by my side
Baby if you only knew, what I could do with a woman
like you
Oooh baby, I make you scream and shout
I show you what loves all about
