You know
Tonight
I'm feeling a little
Out of control
Is this me?
You wanna get crazy?
Because I don't give a...
Ow!
I'm out of character
I'm in rare form
And if you really knew me
You'd know it's nothing norm
Cause I'm doing things
That I normally won't do
The 'old' me's gone
I feel brand new
And if you don't like it?
Fuck you!
The music's on
And I'm dancing
I'm normally in the corner
Just standing
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care
Cause this is my night!
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl
