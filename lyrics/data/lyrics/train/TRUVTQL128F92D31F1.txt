I am, I am, I am
I said I wanna get next to you
I said I'm gonna get close to you
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you too
Hurt you too!

I ain't, I ain't, I ain't
A buyin' into your apathy
I'm gonna learn you my philosophy
You wanna know about atrocity
Atrocity!
I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know, you know, you know, you know

I am a man, a man
I'll give you something that you won't forget
