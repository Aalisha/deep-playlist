Workin' for a man that you don't understand so forget it
Spendin' all your dough yeah you know as soon as you get it
Wastin' your time on an assembly line you want out of it
Pickin' up your pay at the end of the day and get out of it
And get away

Cause you're wonderin' if it's gonna change
Cause the weekdays are the same as always never changing

Make a break, another escape
I gotta get out, I gotta get out
Make a break, another escape
I gotta get out, I gotta get out
Long live the weekend

Monday - don't want to get out of bed
