Don't want to lie to you
Don't want to cause you pain
But it's all I ever do
And it's driving me insane

So how much deeper will I sink
So how much further will I dare to go
I've gone so far that I can't think
Can't take it all away
But I want you to know

I never meant to hurt you
What did I turn into
And now... I just have this feeling
Sorry's lost its meaning
And I feel alone...
