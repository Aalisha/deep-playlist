outside of a level head with the glasses drying at the edge of my bed
i just need some time alone for awhile
locked up in an empty tomb with your photographs spread on the floor of my room
reminding me i once knew how to smile

all that i need is, all i really need is, all that i need is air
all that i need is, all i really need is, everything but you're not there

so i don't need a thing to remind me
so i don't need a thing to remind me
no i don't need a thing to make the world think that i don't need a thing at all
