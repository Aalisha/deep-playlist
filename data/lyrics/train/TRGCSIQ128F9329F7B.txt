And this blood on my hands
Now it won't go away
I've been out on this road for days

And the fear on the wall
Watch it slowly cascade
As the door holds the wolves at bay

The emptiness is building from
The nothingness that we've all become

The emptiness is building from
The nothingness that we've all become
...
