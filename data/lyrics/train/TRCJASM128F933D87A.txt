Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R
Listen shawty, can't nobody rock your body like the R

I ain't a doctor, can't save a life
To say I could I'd be outta my mind
I ain't no pro athlete, can't run for miles
That's another thing I won't even try

See, there's a lot of things that I can't do
Can't hear mistakes, I make a lot of
But in a couple of categories I do
I blow the competition out of the water

There's only 2 things in this world that I'm the best at, it's true
Number 1 is music and baby girl
Number 2, can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do
Can't nobody work your body out like I do, like I do, like I do
