Won't walk the Earth a specter
Won't hold my tongue from lashing out
This is my writ of honor
Drawn by the blood that I have shed
The beasts will soon assemble
Conjoining in their putrid flesh
Their hearts don't beat desire
They pump violence and poison

Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Death's embracing, all is ending
Death's embracing, all is ending

Time will not heal all of your pain
I cannot wait for it all to come crashing
Down

The monsters walk among us
Leeching the blood out from what's good
Infecting at transmission
Swallowing innocence from life
Our time has come to stand forth
The wretched womb from which they feed
Behold the loathsome demons
Send them into the hell they made

Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Death's embracing, all is ending
...
