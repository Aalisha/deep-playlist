I could be your new tomorrow
I could be your shining star
And if you should dare to follow
Woe betide your beating heart
I said ooh - you make it happen
Ooh - you make it right
Ooh - you do things to me
Ooh - right through the night

Call me
(when you can't take the hunger)
I'm on the tip of your tongue
(desire will pull you under)
I'm on the tip of your tongue
