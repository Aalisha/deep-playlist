(Raul Malo)

We spent the night in a hobo town
Like a pair of runaways
We lit a fire and sang the songs
We learned from yesterday
Settled down and built a house
With our own sweatin' hands
What happened next I'll never know
Or never understand

Finished with my working day
And headed straight for home
I looked inside the bedroom door
And you were not alone

Well I hope you find a better way
