i am eternal
the ruler of the earth and sky
i am infernal
i am on a quest to see the heavens die
my fascination with the dead
won't be fulfilled here on this killing spree

and when they dream
that's when my spirit arise
and when they scream
a little part of them dies
i find my way into the minds of the weak
they are led astray
it's now my path that they seek

you die before me
your destiny is in my hands
you are soon to see
my one desire is to rule this world eternally
