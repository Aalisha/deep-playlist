Oh no
Who's got you all dressed up in those clothes?
Said, I don't know
But you're gonna need some help out of those

Oh, you're alright, you're alright, you're alright
But you smell like your mama is smoke
So tell her, tell her, you tell her I said hello

Oh, we could do it any way you want
We only like you 'cause you're cute and young
You gotta work what daddy gave you, son
Go on and show me that you know how to use it
And do your duty

And get on the floor
Don't make a fuss, just do it
Look out I'm fixing to thrill
We know you're one of us

What's all the fuss?
Just do it
Uh huh
I'm fixin' to thrill

Yeah the girls, the girls they're looking round
...
