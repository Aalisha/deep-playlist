Lisa's kissing men
like a long walk home
when the music stops...
take a tip from me
don't go through the park
when you're on your own
it's a long walk home
well if they follow you
don't look back
like Dylan in the movies
on your own
if they follow you
it's not your money that they're after boy
it's you
pure easy listening
...
