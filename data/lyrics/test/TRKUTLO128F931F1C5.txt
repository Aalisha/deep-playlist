Have faith in me, cause there are things that I've seen I don't believe.
So cling to what you know and never let go.
You should know things aren't always what they seem.

I said I'd never let you go and I never did.
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it.
If you didn't have a chance then I never did.
You'll always find me right there again.

I've gone crazy, cause there are things in the streets I don't believe.
So we'll pretend it's alright (pretend it's alright!)
and stay in for the night, what a world.
I'll keep you safe here with me (with me).

I said I'd never let you go and I never did.
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it.
