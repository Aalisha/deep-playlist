Yangyang holds on to a giant phone
Yangyang's soft voice goes on and on
I hate you, I hate you, where did it go wrong?
Yangyang goes talking to himself on the phone

Yangyang sends his men pebbles and stones
Yangyang rips his women down to the bones
I own you, I own you, so give us a song
Yangyang goes talking to his world on the phone

Yangyang's born with a phone cord round his neck
Yangyang never fails to stick to his kick
I want you, I want you, you're making me sick
But Yangyang, the chords never long enough
To reach your mommys trick
