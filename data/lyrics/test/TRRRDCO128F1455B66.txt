You're in denial, you're in denial
And I know
Well what's my name, well what's my name?
I don't know

Baby if you telephone
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Call me if you're on your own
And maybe I can meet you in the morning

You're in denial, you're in denial
And I know
Well what's my name, well what's my name?
I don't know

Baby if you telephone
Maybe I can meet you in the morning
Call me if you're on your own
And maybe I can meet you in the morning
