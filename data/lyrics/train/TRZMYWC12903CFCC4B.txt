I'm not alone, I really believe
You never go, You never leave
Here and now, You always stay
and "I love you" could not be said a better way

Chorus
It's everything You've promised
There's no greater love than this
From prophets until today
A man laying down His life for His friends
Your sacrifice has spoken, You gave everything
...
