Let me hold you tight
If only for one night
Let me keep you near
To ease away your fears
It would be so nice
If only for one night

I won't tell a song
No one has to know
If you want to be totally discrete
I'll be at your side
If only for one night
Yeah
If only for one night

Your eyes say things I never hear from you
And my knees are shaking too
But I'm willing, willing to go through
I must be crazy standing in this place
