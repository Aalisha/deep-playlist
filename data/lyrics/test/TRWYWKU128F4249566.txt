[Intro: Hell Razah]
Lost Ark...
As they search and invaded countries
And territories and lands...
More and more places, they searched
And they invaded, and destroyed the conquered people
For the Ark of the Covenant
Holy of the Holies... instill...
And the word translated in English read...

[Hell Razah:]
Don't touch the deck of love, we was made in the image of God
We was formed out of the dust, when they finish the stars
I'm Israeli, and half alien, covered with skin
As a sperm learned to swim, now we flooded in sin
My results of DNA, was a sign of may day
When they looked and seen my X-Ray, they started to pray
My street team was seen in a dead man's dream
Go 'head, get ya green, til my album is king
No tribe can make music, like Judah bloodstream
