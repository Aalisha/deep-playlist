Could you give me just some kind of sign
To let me know that I'm not wasting my time
I just need a reason to believe
I've lost all visibilty
'Cause I can't see just what you mean
By what you're telling me
Should I stay or go, do you even know
It's all a riddle to me

Show me a sign and give me reason to believe
Don't waste my time, just give me some kind of sign
Show me a sign and give me reason to believe
Before this all just fades away, away

Would you tell me 'cause I can't read your mind
I'm so lost but it's not that hard to find
...
