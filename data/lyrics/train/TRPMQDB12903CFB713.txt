Like Tim Burton colours
When the eve is coming down
We live in Coppermoon a dreamy little town
Where rusty lamplights longing to replace the day
And trying to enchant the impure on our way

But demons are shining brighter
And (A) swear it's my only moon
I stare in the Visionlighter
A liquid of the sun

In our dreams they create new realities
The relations of vision and life
The other side ...other side... other side
...
