You gotta love to lighten that load
You gotta live to die
You gotta lie to somebody sometime
Better make it white
Cause someone will be waiting for you
Somewhere dark and deep
Someone will be greeting you
Somewhere in your sleep
Oh somewhere in your sleep
I think I might need an adventure
I need a visit to some place new
I'm happy enough with the temperature
