28 Days
Miscellaneous
Rollin Gang
What the fuck is this thing
I pictured four wheels
I can't ride that
I'm reading the warning
Jimmy takes over and says fuck that
Because it reminds him
So much of snowboarding
Don't even think of bailing cause
It doesn't have a break
Watch out for the trees
They can be nasty
If you miscalculate the line that you take
Face in the dirt
Your mates are all laughing
