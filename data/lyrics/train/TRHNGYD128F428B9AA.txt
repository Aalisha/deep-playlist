White Stones Queens
1974
Father's talking shit
Mother fucker slammed the door
Hit the streets running
Cannot take it anymore
In the reins of a train,
I cuddle on the floor.
Well the park bench door
Sleeping here for free
Little kid sitting in the shooting gallery
Set your self up
From innocence to misery
Oh this is what you want
Not the way, what they fucking say

Hanging out with sid yet again in the U.S.A.
Sidney Sidney in the U.S.A.
