Well, I gotta have a talk with my baby
Well, I gotta make her understand
'Cause we had a lover's quarrel
And it got a little outta hand.

Well, now usually we kiss and make up
But it's never been like this before
And I got a funny feelin' that she won't be back
If I let her walk out the door.

She's talkin' about walkin' out
Ain't no doubt about it
Gotta talk her outta walkin' out
Before it's all over but the shoutin'.

Gotta talk her outta leavin'
And believin' in me again
Yeah, we had a big fight last night
Now I gotta make it right.

Before she hits the door
And there ain't nothin' more that I can do about it
She's talkin' about alkin' out
Ain't no doubt about it.

Gotta talk her outta walkin' out
