Another lonely night in your head
This is only a matter of mind
And when you play this game your whole life
How can you say if it is wrong or right?

You can wait for a change of your mind
this is only a matter of time
And when you close your eyes overnight
He will awake in the bright moonlight

I don`t know how these feelings change
It must be more than only Jekyll and Hyde

Take the pain lose again
He is a friend you know
