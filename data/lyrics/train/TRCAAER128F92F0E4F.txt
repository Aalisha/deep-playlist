Anoint. Alight. Align.
The Mind says, "I am not of the Body.
When the Body ceases, I will be set free.
I direct the Shell to move."
The Soul says, "I am not of the Body.
When Death comes, I shall reunite with the Void.
I am the Engine of the Vessel."
The Spirit says, "I am not of the Body.
If I die, there is no longer reason to Exist.
I am the fuel that fills the Form and gives it Power"
The Body says, "It is only through Me that you are realized.
I am that which makes you known. Without Me, you have no Home"
The Fire says, 'I am your Master. I govern you all as Passions.
The Body melts at my touch. The Spirit burns at ignition.
The Soul ashes at recession. The Mind an inferno at my stoking.'

Crippled  Salvaged  Assimilated
Asphyxia  Deluge  Collapse

Mechanism exposed
In atrophy
Slime  Corruption  Filth
