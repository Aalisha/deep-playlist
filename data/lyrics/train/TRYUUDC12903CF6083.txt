Do, what you do
what you say, what you did
do, what you do, put your hands over me

Sometimes life can be a burden
Trying to stay one step ahead
I feel the world upon my shoulder
Each time I'm standing out on the edge
My hopes have all deserted me
Like their washed away in the sand
And it's hurting my pride, trying to survive
But I know that I stand a chance when you lay your hands, oh yeah

'Cause it's the only thing I have that still makes sense

Oh baby when I'm calling out, give me love and affection
keep telling me, showing me the way
Oh, If you see me falling down, lift me up from the shadows
will you take me away to a better place
And when I'm in my darkest hour be by my side
To turn the tide 'till the suffering fades
Life is getting me down, getting me down and close to defeat
Come and lay your hands on me

Do, what you do
what you say, what you did
Do what you do, put your hands over me
...
