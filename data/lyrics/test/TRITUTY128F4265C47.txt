I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise
Ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you
Chorus:
Tell me if you want me to
Give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you
Cuz you blow my mind
I promise boy that I'll be true
...
