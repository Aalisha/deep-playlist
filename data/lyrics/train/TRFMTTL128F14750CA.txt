I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box
Religion is the smile on a dog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean, d-do ya?

Choke me in the shallow water
Before I get too deep

What I am is what I am
You what you are or what?
What I am is what I am
You what you are or what?

I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know, if you know what I mean

Philosophy, is a walk on the slippery rocks
Religion is a light in a fog
