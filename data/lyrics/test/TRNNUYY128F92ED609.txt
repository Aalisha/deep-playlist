The first naked lady I ever saw,
Was that tattoo on my uncle's arm.
On daddy's farm that summer he drove up,
And helped us build that barn.
He rolled up his sleeves,

When I asked him who she was.

I wish you could have met her,
She was everything to me.
Hear it all the time,
Love at first sight.
When I saw that girl I knew I had to love her all my life.
I was just 19 when I got this thing,
And I swear that it still stings,
