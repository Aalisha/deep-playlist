John Henry was about three days old,
sittin' on his papa's knee.
He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel;
said, 'Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.'

'Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,

Lord.
I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.'
