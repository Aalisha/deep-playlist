Got a green light gotta green light yeah
But i'm going nowhere
Gotta green light gotta red light yeah
No cop no stop I don't care
Everyone of you could be the same
Everyone of you could play the game
Gotta green light gotta green light yeah
But ya goin' nowhere

You know the best things in life aren't for me
You know the best things in life aren't for free

Gotta new life gotta new plight yeah
And it's going nowhere
...
