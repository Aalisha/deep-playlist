Regret, so long.
Overlook my best intentions,
And now I'm taking it back.
I'm taking back my life.

If you could only see the way that she smiles at me,
You'd see there's nothing to gain,
I'm not to blame.
So count your blessings girl cause we will never be the same,
You know we're not alone,
You know I'm coming home to write you out girl,
To see you off and let you go,
And let you go...
