You see them everywhere
You know those magazines
Yeah I've bought a few
They show you everything

So many news stands
as I'm passing by
but rows and rows of you
are bound to catch my eye

Now everyone can gaze upon your body
its good for you
I guess you have no shame
I never knew if how I acted
would make you seek revenge
and now I know
and you're in magazines
...
