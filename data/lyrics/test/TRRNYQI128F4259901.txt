You're lying again
You say you don't but then you do
I'm trying again
To build a wall around your heart
Then break it through to you
You make it happen

Everything's blue now
Oh lucky you
Oh lucky you
There's nothing to lose
If it's really true
Oh lucky you

You're chasing the moon
Reaching out to touch the stars
