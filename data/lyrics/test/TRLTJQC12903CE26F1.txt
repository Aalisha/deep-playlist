Could it be, this is just the beginning of the age of grinning and winning
Four soldiers united and strong Proving our enemies wrong
From deep within the beast has been re-released
From the south east it hunts for a feast
A feast that will feed all the fury and might
It might work, it just might work

I don't care how far you have flown
How fast or how slow
I don't want to know you
You're only slowing me down
As the crow flies
