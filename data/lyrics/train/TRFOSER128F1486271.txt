Now I can taste
The war that I've been fighting
Start to fall
But I'm still standing here
Behind this wall of dying faith

I can't forget
The fight that's growing stronger
Face to face
With hopes of longer days
To build on something we should save

I stand alone, I'm on my own
My hands will bleed
(My hands will bleed)
...
