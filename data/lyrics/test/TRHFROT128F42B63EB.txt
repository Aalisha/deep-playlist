Please come over
I need assistance
I've taken something
And I have little resistance.

'Cause mouth, you're dangerous
And highly contagious
You'll say anything
Just to get what you want

I'm low, low, low, low
I'm low, low, low, low
I'm low, low, low, low
I'm low, low, low, low

Lay down, stay down
Lay down, stay down
...
