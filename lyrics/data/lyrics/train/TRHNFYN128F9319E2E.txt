Behind the song you love
There's a story you wont forget
I'm like a flag in an open space
I can sense the wind ahead

I'm a difficult person
Life has made me so
When trouble comes around
I will never run

I STAND FOR YOU, YOU STAND FOR ME
TOGETHER WE STAND AGAINST THEM ALL

We are like an outfit
That's getting thin and bleached
...
