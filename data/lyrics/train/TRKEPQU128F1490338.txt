i'm country
Well there's a little word and it fits me to a t
I don't know how you spell it but its country and that's me.
I laugh when i'm happy and cry when i'm blue
cus when i'm mad like i'm suppose to do
On a saturday night i'll have a drink or two
And hollow at the moon i'm country.

I chew tobaccer and spit it on the ground
Talk to the cows when no one ain't around
I'm trapped on the mountain when the snows falling down
Yes sir boys i'm country

Chorus
