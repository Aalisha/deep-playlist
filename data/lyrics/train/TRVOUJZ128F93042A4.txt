I found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like, home
Just so you know, you'll never know
Some secrets were meant to be told,
but I found the cure to growing older
I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again

And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends now
Douse yourself in cheap perfume

It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up!
So douse yourself in cheap perfume
It's so fitting, so fitting of the way you are
You can't cover it up, can't cover it up! No
Find a safe place, brace yourself, bite your lips
I'm sending your fingernails and empty bottles you've sipped
Back to your family "cause I know you will be missed"
