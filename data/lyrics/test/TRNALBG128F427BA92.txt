In the streetlight while I'm walking
I hear voices, someone talking
When I listen, no affection
Something missing, no direction

Ooooh... Every moment
We have wasted, there is nothing
Ooooh... In the distance
Through the wreckage, I hear something
Oh... Love is calling
Oh... Love is calling me home
