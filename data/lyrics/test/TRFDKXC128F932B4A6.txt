Why be afraid of being swallowed by the sea?
When it comes to down it we're nothing but an entity
Living a life so full of fear
That it becomes a life of everlasting misery

I tell no lies
This is how I paid the price
I tell no lies
Can you feel the dream of mine?

One more day and one more night
There's no end in our sight
Creeping into all your layers
Until a total existence failure

(I'm creeping into all your lives, you'll see)
Until a total existence failure
...
