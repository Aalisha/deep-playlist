Everybody say blessed, say blessed, say blessed

Blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed
Blessed, blessed

Since though hast walked uprightly, as a light in a dark land
Since though hast placed in thine heart, all the Lord's commands
He's set thee above nations and cast thine enemies away
He's standing up within thee, so let me hear you say

We're blessed in the city
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
For the Devil is defeated
We are blessed

Though believenth in God only and put no confidence in man
Everything that does concern thee, you placed it in His hands
Though a host rise up against thee to try and spoil the day
They'll rush in one road to harm thee but they'll flee in seven ways

We're blessed in the city
We're blessed in the field
We're blessed when we come and when we go
We cast down every stronghold
Sickness and poverty must cease
For the Devil is defeated
We are blessed

We know that God's word is clothed in truth and righteousness
