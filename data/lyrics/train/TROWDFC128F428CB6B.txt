A multitude of anger 
Ring out vulgar tone 
Obscenity fro your pride 
To isolate small flaws 

Down right inhuman 
On the moral ladder 
Escape the cutthroat pack 
Another trend has passed 

Ahead of the line of fools 
Preach to stand above 
To overcome a fault 
Explanation for the weak 
Envied idols die 
Thru these eyes of a jealous mind 
One more bottle of sin 
For this aggravation 

I've watched you lose your temper over small things 
A spoiled child's things 
Kill it all, kill the past, reunite for the final grasp of breath 
A gun in the hand of loyalty, sound of the trigger 
...
