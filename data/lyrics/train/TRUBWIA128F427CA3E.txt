I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there

It was a straight-faced lie I believed
It was a straight-faced lie
You would ever leave me
So for now I'll keep believing your words
And soon enough my strength will return

I'll take care of you
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there

So keep breathing
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there

Let me draw the blinds for you
