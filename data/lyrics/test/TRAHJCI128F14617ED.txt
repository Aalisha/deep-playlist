You failed so many times it's sad 
 because one thing you've never had and that is confidence in you! 
 You went out thinking you're so weak... 
 you couldn't stand up on your feet, you didn't think your voice was heard by anyone at

 But you don't understand ('em ) so I'll make sure, you'll hear em once more... 
 
 "I know that I can make it...
