Well, I just need a place to lay my head
Forget the chain that hangs around my neck
These guns are not as heavy as the hearts they defend
And I can't wait to get back home where I can find some rest

When I lay down my guns and lift my hands
Surrender to love and live again
May this desert reach its end where my new life begins
When I lay down my guns and lift my hands

And I have seen the devil in this place
...
