Wishing I could see you again, dear
That the fires of love could burn once more
But I know that's just wishful thinking
And too much to be wishing for

Just thinking of how you once kissed me
Wishing that it hadn't meant goodbye
But I know that's just wishful thinking
Now I know why some people cry
