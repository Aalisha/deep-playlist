GUN â€“ Better Days

Yeah I heard about the trouble last night on the radio
Seeing is believing, now tell me do you like what you see
Cos I've been holding on to promises now yeah for too many years
It's happening all over the world to people like you and me

Things could be heaven but this feels like hell
So hold your head high cos you know I'd die
For better days

Read a story in the paper last night people living in fear
It's easy saying nothing it's easy just to watch things fall
But I was taught that there's a time in your life
When you've got to stand proud
