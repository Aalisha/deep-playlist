I still be on the grind
When it all collapse
And if it's my worst grind
I'ma take it right back

I still be on the grind
When it all collapse
And if it's my worst grind
I'ma take it right back

I still be on the grind
When it all collapse
And if it's my worst grind
I'ma take it right back

I'm on the grind
Time to go for mine
We still climb
Feelin' alive
Flowing line for line
It go

I still be on the grind
When it all collapse
And if it's my worst line
I'ma take it right back

I'm on the grind
Time to go for mine
We still climb
Feelin' alive
Flowing line for line


Yo, we trail blazing
Prevail's amazing
Raisin' the bar
For fame and fortune
Is the fortunate part
Never a guarantee
To where we'll be
As time pass on
One of us passive aggressive
The other mad calm
Combine a hundred rhymes
Swollen Members Black Magic
Tour bus the pure rush
This album is a classic
Cuz legend has it
The veteran of letters is drastic
An energetic performance
And the chorus fantastic


Stomp on the soul
Of the misguided angel
I reach up touch the sun
And the rainfall
But there's no rainbow
People are painful
