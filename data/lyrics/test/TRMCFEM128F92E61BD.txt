Never thought that hanging out
Was gonna give me a feeling like this
Never thought you would take my heart
I had a feeling that wouldn't accept it
It's totally cool that you and I
Are gonna spend a lot of time together
We'll do anything that you want
Stay at home or do whatever

When up wake I want to wake up right beside you
When you laugh I want to be the one who made you
