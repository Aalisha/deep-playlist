My name is Mary
And I'm from Greenville, Mississippi
Yeah but this is where I live
Here in this old folks' dormitory

And every Sunday night
Sarah comes to see us
And she plays that old upright
But Sarah always seems to leave us

And when she plays
Something comes over me
Goes from my head
All the way to my feet

And I wanna dance
I wanna snap my fingers all night long and dance
I wanna move around the room just like a woman in a trance
All night, I said I wanna dance

I wanna wrap my arms around your neck and dance
I wanna listen to the music that's been ringin' in my ears
