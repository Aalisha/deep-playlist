Fits of inspiration, cryin fingers. A puppet with no nails that will beg no more.
Chartruce regalia, she's a rock n roll refuge, her glowing diamond head will rest away.
Oh mercy me. Do I enjoy these games? Why did I chase her and why did she stay?
And if you were my freind, I'd give you the ball on everyplace. Until the ocean. yeah
