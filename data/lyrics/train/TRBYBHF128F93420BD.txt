There's a curve in the highway just south of town
Where a man has pulled over to figure life out
With only his conscience and the lonesome sound
Of diesels windin' up the grade

He's got a wife and two kids, they love him so
And a woman down in Georgia, she startin' to show
He's damned if he leaves and he' sure damned if he don't
And he wonders how life got this way

('Cause its) A fine line in between right and wrong
(Yeah) He's been crossing over that border way too long
He shoulda seen it comin' at him right from the start
Now there ain't no escape from a broken heart
...
