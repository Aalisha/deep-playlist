You walk into this place
The light shines on you're face, and I wish you were mine
There used to be a time
You aim a smile at me
I can't even speak
I'm too scared to try, just a waste of time

Just a waste of time

Tina, you just act like you don't know the way I feel
You call me back each night to reinsure my dream is real
How long do you plan to keep on stringing me along?
I'm realizing I was wrong and you're just a waste of time
