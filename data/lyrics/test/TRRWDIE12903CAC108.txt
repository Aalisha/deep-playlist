Dyin' flame, you're free again
Who could love, do that to you
All dressed in black, he won't be comin' back

Save your tears, got years and years
The pains of seventeen's
Unreal, they're only dreams
Save your cryin' for the day

Fool, if you think it's over
'Cause you said goodbye
Fool, if you think it's over
I'll tell you why

New born eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the mornin' sun
Fool, if you think it's over
It's just begun

Miss Teenage Dream, such a tragic scene
...
