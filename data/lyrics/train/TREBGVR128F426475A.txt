Don't call me a fool
I know where she's been
When they turn on those lights in town
She'll go there again

There's no need in crying
You don't make the rules
I know where she's going

Well, I don't know the reason
That you seem to care
About my new heartache
Well, I know it's not fair

But I'd rather hold her
Whenever I can
