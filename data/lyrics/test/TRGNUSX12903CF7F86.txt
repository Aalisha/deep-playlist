I got somethin' MCs Can Kiss
I got somethin' MCs Can Kiss
When I start to rap
I start to rap
I sta-sta-sta-sta-start l-li-like this
I got somethin' MCs Can Kiss
I got somethin' MCs Can Kiss
When I start to rap
I start to rap
I sta-sta-sta-sta-start l-li-like this
I got somethin' MCs Can Kiss
I got somethin' MCs Can Kiss
Now don't say don't say don't say this
I got somethin' MCs Can Kiss

Yeah, I got something MCs Can Kiss
It's a nice bum cheek and it goes like this
You fuck with the wrong bitch
(Is the battle over here?)
I don't care, I quit
There's two kinds of MCs out there
There's the ones who rap, and the ones who don't care
And frankly, I don't give a fuck
You might be dope on the mic, but your music sucks (uh!)
Not me, I got some dope beats
I'm an entertainer, not a lyricist
I'm so far from all you girls out there
If I get popular, I know that ain't fair
