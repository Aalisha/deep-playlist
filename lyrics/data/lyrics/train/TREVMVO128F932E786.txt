Who's in a bunker?
Who's in a bunker?
Women and children first
And the children first

And the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow till I burst
Until I burst

Until I

Who's in a bunker?

I haven't seen enough
You haven't seen

I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first
And children first
And children
Here I'm allowed everything all of the time
