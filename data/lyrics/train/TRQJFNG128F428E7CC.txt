Intro:
Karma usually comes wearing a stranger's light; it's easier to deal with that way. But now it's you, I've hurt you, disrespected you. There's nowhere to hide, no turning back, no rearrangement. Only what lies aheadÂ…and you're so heaven sent.

Hook:
I know you're feeling hurt because of what I did to you.
If it's blame I'll take it maybe we will make it through.
'Cause I love you, I love you,
Think about it baby.

Verse:
I'm sorry for giving you the cold shoulder.
Never been this wrong before,
Never stood my ground and breathed it in before.
All I wanted to do is hold ya.
Never felt so brave and so afraid before,
Never faced alone and felt the peace before.
With tears in my eyes I come to you sincerely.
Excepting this space I'm in,
Growing outta the phase where I just wanna win.
