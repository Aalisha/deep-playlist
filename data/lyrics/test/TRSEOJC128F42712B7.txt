Sometimes I know I become
All that's weak in a man, and weak in a boy.
But I keep trying and I won't quit,
And that must be worth something more
Than a strong man who believes
That there's nothing left to try for.

And I can be cold, I know, I know
But a woman is a warm breath on the back of your neck
And a warm belly pressed against yours.

We need to feel the sum of all our parts
Are more than what's laid out in lines upon our palms.
