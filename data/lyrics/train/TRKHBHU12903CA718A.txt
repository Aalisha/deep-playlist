Sometimes I feel so all alone here, people in my ear
Tryin' to destroy this love of ours we've built
I'm tired, drivin' me crazy, the things they have to say
And insecurities you know there got my mind to roam 'cause

I would never ever hurt you
Can't you see my love is sincere
See, I just want to be the one
You call when you need someone near in a hurry

Check it out, yo, the situation is ill
Went from lovin' and trustin' one another to just payin' our bills
From holdin' hands in public to displayin' the grill
We need a resolution, yo, I'm sayin' for real

Wanna treat you with the right respect
Tryin' to play a bigger role
Than the nigga who just writes the checks
And standin' at the door, wanderin' from right to left
Tryin' to decide if it's right to step and just bail with it
