Make something of yourself,
Or search for someone else who makes you feel real.
Whoever thought that I could feel like this...
Pull back your mask and show us all who you really are.
How can you live like this, pretending everything's fine?
It's not alright, you're not alright, find yourself.

So this is what we've come to.
Life is what you make of it.
