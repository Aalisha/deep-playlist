From the cradle of silence and of light
It took a birth in human blood - angels cry -
To the ages of violence and of hate
To explore the left hand path I came alive
Into my striding, the shell of a god in the cold
My soul is just hiding, my spirit haunting on to control

Flame of the Nile, fire in the darkness
To swallow the light
Behold the ghost of a god
God from the Nile, eternally roaming
To swallow the light
Behold the spirit of a pharaoh,
Pharaoh, pharaoh, no!

To the world of spirits he's sailling on and on
Why magician don't you feel they broke the seal
Cyril's facing the tyrant everywhere
Far away from his grave, Seth is free

Roaming through ages
Begetting advice for your kings, yow...
Leading the stages
