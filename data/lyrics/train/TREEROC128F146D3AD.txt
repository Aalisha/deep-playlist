It's no good believing in somebody else
If you can't believe in yourself
You give them the reason to take all the power and wealth
It's no good you trying to sit on the fence
And hope that the trouble will pass
'Cause sittin' on fences can make you a pain in the ass

If there's something you find to believe in
Then the message must get through
So don't just sit in silence
When you know what to do
Turn it up
Turn it up, make it louder
Turn it up
Turn it up, make it louder

There's no conversation if nobody speaks
And nothing gets done in the end
There's no confrontation when fantasy makes you its friend
