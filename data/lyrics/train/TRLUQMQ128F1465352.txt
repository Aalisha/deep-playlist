You take my breath away, oh-oh-oh-oh
Love thinks it's here to stay, oh-oh-oh-oh
There's still so much for me to do
And I can't stop loving you
Oh, can this be true

If you could see what I have seen, oh-oh-oh-oh
Broken hearts and broken dreams, oh-oh-oh-oh
Then I wake up and you're not there
Pain finds me everywhere
Oh, but you don't care

Don't forget me when I'm gone
...
