Hey honey what you trying to say
As I stand here
Don't you walk away
And the world comes tumbling down

Hand in hand in a violent life
Making love on the edge of a knife
And the world comes tumbling down

And it's hard for me to stay
I'm going down to be by myself
I'm going back for the good of my health

And there's one thing I couldn't do
