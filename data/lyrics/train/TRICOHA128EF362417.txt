You're the future
And you've come for what is yours
The hidden treasure
Locked behind the hidden doors

And the promise
Of a day that's shiny new
Only a dreamer
Could afford this point of view

But you're a driver
Not a passenger in life
And if you're ready
You won't have to try 'cause

You are the universe
And there ain't nothin' you can't do
If you conceive it, you can achieve it
That's why, I believe in you, yes I do

You're a winner
So do what you came here for
The secret weapon
Isn't secret anymore

You're a driver
...
