Sick of the way I am feeling
Waking up, watching myself slipping
Should I just take out my eyes?
No longer want them for this life

Acting strong only on the outside
Hiding shame and pain on the inside
I've tried to block my mind of this
And pretend that this doesn't exist

Losing my mind once again
Stranding my thoughts
(No matter what I said)

Sleepless nights staring at the ceiling
Sanity running on empty
...
