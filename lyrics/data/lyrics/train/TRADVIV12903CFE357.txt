What we need is a good jump kick, jump kick
To the head to get our ambitions in gear
For example, Jude at the party was taking her clothes off

We greeted them with conversation and delight
Since Jude was mad at her dream for landing nowhere near the marker

To a boat on a island where nobody? s been
Except your best memories and your favorite friends
