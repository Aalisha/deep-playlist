I had months to write a song
That captured who you are
But I fear I have done you wrong
'Cause I've failed so far
The chord that struck, an angel fell
Sky's went dark and it all comes down
The choices made, the lies forgotten
Oh, well

This is the way that I know
This is the way that I know
I would give everything for some hope
Are you different, could I be different too?
Nobody knows you, nobody knows you like I do
