Why should I hate you?
After all, it's been so long
Since I've lived in town.
Let it go for now.

Have a drink at your favorite bar till dark.
Stumble into empty baseball park.
Strike one and strike two...
I guess we're both out.

Stumble past the record store
End up at the movies.
Try and think of something else.
Nothing's comin' to me.

Stumble past the record store
...
