All I am, all I'll be

Everything in this world, all that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes, shining at me
When you smile I can feel, all my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine

And a thousand sensations seduce me 'cause I
I do, cherish you
For the rest of my life
you don't have to think twice
I will, love you still
...
