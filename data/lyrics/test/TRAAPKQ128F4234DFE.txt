Guess who's coming to dinner, Natty Dreadlocks
Guess who's coming to dinner, Natty Dreadlocks

Oh I can see you brought some herb for me, Natty Dreadlocks
And Rasta near land Nyah Binghi Cudjoe are coming over the hills
Say in time like this we must live as one
So the Book of Rule shall stand, Dreadlocks, Dreadlocks

Guess who's coming to dinner, Natty Dreadlocks
Guess who's coming to dinner, Natty Dreadlocks

So let's give thanks and praise, Natty Dreadlocks
I appreciate the herb you brought for me, Natty Dreadlocks
Now that things and time have changed
Something make me realize what it takes
And that I'm to be a Natty Dreadlocks

Guess who's coming to dinner, Natty Dreadlocks
