Mmm, ooo

Baby, since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasies, what love could really be

Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of a cloud we're floating away

Ooh, this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby, we're so high, walking on cloud nine
(You got me up so high)
So high
(My shoes are scraping the sky)
So high
(You got me up so high)
Oh
(My shoes are scraping the sky)
