Checkmate honey, beat ya at your own damn game
no dice honey, i'm livin' on the astral plane
feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain
oh, heads i win, tails you lose, to the never mind
where to draw the line
an indian summer, carrie was all over the floor
she was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store
she'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me
...
