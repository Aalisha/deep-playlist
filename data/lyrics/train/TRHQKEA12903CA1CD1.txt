I'm in a haze
Been here for days
Don't know how long it's been
Since you railed me in
Your wicked way
Will make me stay
When I don't know if I should
You know that you're good
And I'm the dice in the palm of your hand
You blow on it twice now you're my man
Ohh baby
I think I've got a crush
Ooh lately
I cannot get enough
Ooh honey
