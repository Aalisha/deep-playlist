If you had not committed such acts a curse like me would not be sent upon you.
God cannot be captured in house of brick and stone.
Commanding the thoughts of millions.
Now the day of dread has come.
Disfigured there faces? Nothing will save you.
You have the nerve.
You will be added to the pile of friends behind you.
As we storm the ramparts.
Your flesh will be my earth.
Fell the voice of thunder.
The time of dread ash come.
