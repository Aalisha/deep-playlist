Ladies a-and Gentleman,
T-The party h-has j-just be-begunâ€¦
We are here to have some fun,
so get on up (Repeat 3x)
We're shaking up the party
it's time to get down
We're rocking with your party
to the heavy sound
No leaning on the walls
whoever you are
No walking through the party
trying to act like a star
We are hereto have some fun,
so get on up We are hereto have some fun,
so get on up Because the party has begun...
We love it when you show us you had a good time
There's nothing gonna stop us,
or leave us behind
...
