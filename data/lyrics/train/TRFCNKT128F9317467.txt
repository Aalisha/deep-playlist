(Again)
Keep my mojo flowing
(Again)
Keep my mojo flowing
(Again again again)
VERSES:
Left my soul on the other side of town
Had no idea that it was goin to bring me down
The strongest of the pack
It terminated me...
She left me on the curb
and fully buried me
The blood from my hand
It dries up like the sand
The whole of the man
Gets away from me
The blood from my hand
It dries up like the sand
The whole of the man
...
