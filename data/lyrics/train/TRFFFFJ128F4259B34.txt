Callin' di weak and di humble.

Inspection!
Get ever'ting ship-shape an' shine.
Check. Check one.
Hot shot! Boom shot all kind of shot
We don't take dat back, hehehehehehehe
Whatcha doin' here?
to all yout and yout
'member we don't talk foolishness we talk trut'
Long time wit'out dey a come for it now
You think tink we'd it done, ya tink we do it all
but hear now
Goin' out to all the wretched souls
Come again
Come again.

Check one.
Check one.
Check, check one.

When mi come a dance, a tuff me tuff
Some a dem a sey mi raggamuffin an' ruff
Come a dancehall an' me must mash it up
