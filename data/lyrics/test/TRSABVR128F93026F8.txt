Take the chances I'm given
And use them up
'Cause they don't come by often enough
Who's the light-haired fair man to the rescue?
If I thought for a second
This wouldn't work
My mouth I would not have opened, no no no
But that's not how I pictured this ending with you

Now it's over my head
Don't forget every word I said
...
