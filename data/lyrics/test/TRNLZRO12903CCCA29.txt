So let me tell a story, friend
Of diamond hands and one night stands
I guess the good life paid you once or twice

Just when I thought I had it all
Caught a sucker punch and lost it all
Just never thought it would have come from you

So here I stand alone again
With one eye open, I'm a broken man
Life flashed before my eyes, but I'm alive

I found out the hard way
And your day's coming soon
I found out the hard way
I pray you'll make it through

So what am I supposed to do
