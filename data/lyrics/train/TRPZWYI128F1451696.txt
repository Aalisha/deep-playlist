We three kings of orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Glorious now behold him arise
King and god and sacrifice

Following yonder star

O star of wonder star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading still proceeding
To thy perfect light
Westward leading still proceeding
To thy perfect light
