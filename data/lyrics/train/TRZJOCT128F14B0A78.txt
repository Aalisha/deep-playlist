You are waiting on a beach
For a healing word to come
Maybe an apology in a bottle
Maybe a flare that says I'm sorry
and the hurting leaves you numb

will you forgive?
will you forget?
will you live what you know?
He left his rights
will you leave yours?
you don't understand it
let it go

You are waiting on a beach
This is where the east meets west
And as another sun sets on your anger
...
