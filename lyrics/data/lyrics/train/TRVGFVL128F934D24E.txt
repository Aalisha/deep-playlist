Feel the atrocity, human decay
Religious damnation for all those who stray
Time to stand up, we'll set our mark
To lead a free life, we will attack

We rise against demons, we rise against God
There's nothing beyond us, it's only just us
We fight for our right to live without lies
We curse all the priests who play with our lives
