things are getting slippery
things are getting kinda crazy
maybe it's all in my head
maybe it's just the way you make me feel

even after all these years
the only thing that keeps me here
is gravity and fragments of reality
i thought were real
and even when we die, there's nothing new
we just don't move, don't need to breathe
