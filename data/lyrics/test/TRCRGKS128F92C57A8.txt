At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always found it best
Instead of getting 'em off my chest
To let 'em rest unexpressed

I hate parading, serenading
As I'll probably miss the bar
But if this ditty is not so pretty
At least it'll tell you how great you are

You're the tops
You're the Colosseum
You're the top
You're the Louvre Museum

You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss
