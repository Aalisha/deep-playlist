Check out the avenue, New York, New York the rotten apple
We grapple in the streets to stack loot and slip the shackles
I'm currently, servin' twenty nine to life
Duckin' the searchlight, no sleep for like the third night

The big life is trife, got the young kids hyped
Cops shoot on sight, heat pipe be blowin' through the night
The land where you ain't fam, there's no pity
Similar to chocolate city, ten times gritty

Hittin' hard, liquor's god, niggaz plottin' on the come off
And come off, quicker than the clothes on the stripper
And slide like she doin' up and down the railing
Bitch tailing in the range with golden arms smooth sailin'

The clock's tickin', somebody's on the block snitchin'
The plot thickens, phones are tapped, cops listen
Too hot for prison, plus too cold to hold my girl
'Cause I married this life and she's my whole world

It's just a sign of the times
Calmly listen to these lines
I'm goin' out of my mind
Livin' the street life

Aiyyo, aiyyo make me wanna holla way they do my life
My life, is like a carousel one endless night
Where most die for pies, some holdin' their chrome
A large percent die for causes not even their own
