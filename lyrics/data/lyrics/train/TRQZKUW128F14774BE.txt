"you are sleeping! you do not want to believe.
You are sleeping!"

* dj richie rich cuts
"guide you out of triple stage darkness" -> rakim, +i ain't no joke+
And chuck d saying "follow for now!" *

"prime minister!"

Black zone darkness, void as snakepit
So i'ma spit a lyric at the packed lip
Sit stunned i drum lyrics in your egg case
Space filled, darkness a blank face
Recognize unknown throne at deep depths
A prime minister incites a slow death
Of a rational thought through the physical
Triple stage darkness, first stage lyrical
Sight to see, a piece of the serch-light
Truth is loose, lips slips to twilight zones
Prone to blow revision
I'm 20/20 and your in-tune is in prison
Switchin from this track, move back in motion
Unaware of your own evolution
Regress through the tunnels and flee light
Illumination, the first stage, my birthright
...
