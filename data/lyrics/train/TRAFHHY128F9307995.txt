Forget about your ex he wasn't good enough
Only when he called is when the spot got rough
Girl I need to know if I qualify
You can call my ex just to verify

Forget about your ex she wasn't down for you
You know I got your back 'cause I'm feelin' you
Tell you right now I qualify
Come at me for real, all games aside

Baby just relax, see you don't have to ask, I got niggas flippin' packs
I'll give you finer things, like carats in your ring
I'll take you to the lot, which one you want to cop, the seven or the drop
Just tell me what you need, it ain't about the G's

See money ain't the thing, it ain't about the rings
And those artificial things 'cause all it really brings, is a lot of pain.
What I need is trust, a little bit of lust, so that every time we touch
I feel it in your kiss nothing means more than this

Forget about your ex he wasn't good enough
Only when he called is when the spot got rough
Girl I need to know if I qualify
You can call my ex just to verify

Forget about your ex she wasn't down for you
You know I got your back 'cause I'm feelin' you
Tell you right now I qualify
Come at me for real, all games aside

Forget about your ex he wasn't good enough
Only when he called is when the spot got rough
