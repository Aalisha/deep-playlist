Is this what they call freedom
Justice and liberty
To take me unconvicted
And wrongly punish me

To strip me of my clothing
And throw me in this hole
A school of pain, imprisoned
With nothing but my soul

My brothers tried to free me
Their efforts cost their lives
They leave behind a legacy
And several mourning wives

Am I to blame am I insane
...
