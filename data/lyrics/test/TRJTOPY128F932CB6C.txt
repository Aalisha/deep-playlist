Oh, Yeah

Sometimes
I feel like I'm going out of
My mind
Boy, the way you do me it's a
Damn crime
But, then you smile at me
And it's all right
With you there ain't no in between

Every time that I walk out the door
Tell myself I won't take it no more
There's a part of me won't let you go
I keep saying yes but, my mind's sayin' no

Me and my heart we got issues
Don't know if I should hate you or miss you
Damn, I wish that I could resist you
