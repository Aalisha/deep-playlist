Laying on your holy bed by the hallowed door
Feeling like an infidel, not worthy of your fall
Tempted by your innocence, beckoned to my fate
I won't face the consequence, I wouldn't hesitate
I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture, rushing through my veins
I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture, rushing through my veins
I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture, rushing through my veins
I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture, rushing through my veins
I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture, rushing through my veins
Passion, flaming, in my heart
Heavenly surrender once again, yeah
Shackled like an animal, chained to my desires
Just another sacrifice to love's eternal fires
Tame me with your tenderness and break my brittle heart
