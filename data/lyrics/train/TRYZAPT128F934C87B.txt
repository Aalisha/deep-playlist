I surrender all my love
And you, you make my desire run
Hot, hot as the desert sands
Your eyes have power to warm me
Like no others can
Fallin’, I keep on fallin’
So much deeper, so much deeper for you

Forever, forever, forever
Fallin’ for you

High, we’re flyin’ so high tonight
Touch, your touch makes the passion rise
Strong, strong as the mighty sea
...
