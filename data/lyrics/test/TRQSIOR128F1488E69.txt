I never felt the wind so cold
Until I had to walk alone(without
you girl)
I never knew what it was to be a man
Well let me show you baby
'Cause I understand

I never thought it'd hurt so bad
You never know 'til you lose what you
had
I don't need to waste my time runnin'
around all over town
Now I know where to find true lovin'

And I knew the first time that I ever
seen you
