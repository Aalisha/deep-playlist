[Verse 1:]
Walked up in the spot like what, gettin'
love from the ladies and the thugs
I'm just, tryna get this party off
So this, can be a night to remember
Ladies lookin' so damn fly
About, ten of them caught my eye
I might, show them the time of their lives
'cause its, a special party tonight

[Chorus:]
Everybody in my party is VIP
We gone sip champagne for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
Lettin' people in
'cause everybody in my party is VIP
We gone shot patron for free
...
