Whoa, baby, ooo, ooo, ooooo
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, baby
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, baby

Yeah you know what this is
You granted all my wishes
And damn it I'm gon' miss it
If we fade away
I don't wanna be down
Loving you I have found
Girl I want you around always

Pre-chorus:

Don't you believe that
Nobody needs you cause I do
I need all of you babe
If you can't see that
Nobody needs you like I do
I need all of you babe

Chorus:

Anytime I'm needing someone
I think of you for comfort
Can you feel me
Anytime you're feeling down or
Need a friend for comfort
Can you feel me
