Shine eye gal is a trouble to a man
Shine eye gal is a trouble to a man

...
I arise early looking some tea, rise early
...
Looking for the daughter but she noh on ya
...

I take a walk down the street
...

De gal deh pan corner weh push mouth lorna?
And her bed no spread
Shine eye gal is a trouble to a man
...
