Up against the wall and spread baby
Ha, ha, ha
It's time to pull over and put 'em all down

Aaoo
Ooh, the lady in red, well she's drivin' me mad
Her very first offense was just lookin' at me
But that second glance was a felony
Ooh, the lady's so fine, but I think it's a crime
She's just too much for a man like me
They'd better lock her away and throw out the key

(There oughta be a law)
Against a girl like you
(Oughta be a law)
Against the things you do
(Oughta be a law)
For breakin' hearts in two
(There oughta be a law)
Against a girl like you
Against a girl like you, Baby

Ooh, the lady is cruel and she's breakin' the rules
If only looks could kill, she'd be killin' me
Guilty, murder one in the first degree
