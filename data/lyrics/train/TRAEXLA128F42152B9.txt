Why the fuck do they keep making those guns?
Chew compassion save some sons
Why'd you keep buying their guns

Foolish, life's too short for stray bullets
Why'd you keep buying their guns foolish
Corporate companies love when they kill themselves
It boost up the record sales

Why'd you keep making your guns?
Chew compassion save some sons
Why'd you keep buying your guns?

Foolish, life's too short for stray bullets
Record companies love when they kill themselves
It boost up the record sales
