I was seeking now i find ,yeeea, Mankind!

It's not about class, colour or races,
let's get around and see different places yeah,
put a smile on those distant faces,
wipe away your sorrow with no traces.

It's not about class, colour or races,
let's get around and see different places yeah,
put a smile on those distant faces,
wipe away your sorrow with no traces.

Joy, boy, let "your soul a vibes"
let your voices be heard a make a joyful noise,
joy, boy, full time NOW realize,
the truth havi be told to recognize,
You nuh see say we a step ina di footsteps of Jah Jah,
hear the "Eden" a talking but dem just can't bother,
but step by step nuh so we climb up the ladder,
with truth and rights we help another.

It's not about class, colour or races,
let's get around and see different places yeah,
