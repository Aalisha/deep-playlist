I should concentrate on slowing down
Cause all I wanna do is drive fast
I don't think I know my way around
I'm seeing what I've already passed
I've been racing through my life without
Really knowing where I fit in
It's only dreams and my reflection now
Where I still see him
I might break
I'm all that's left from your mistake
I'm still trying to prove myself to you
I can't escape from this as fast as you
