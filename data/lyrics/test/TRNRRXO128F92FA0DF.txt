written by David Crosby and Dean Parks



I come through here quite often
and I think about you
I come through here quite often
and I wonder what you do

a wrong turn at the corner
I could say I got lost
a confusion of memories
where two streets crossed

the vision I remember
is eyes through the steam
coming off the coffee
...
