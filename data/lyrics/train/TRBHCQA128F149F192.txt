Fingertips tappin' on the table top
She's right there with you but she's not
It's like she hears other voices when you talk
She can't stop, she's gotta go
Doesn't know where, don't know why

She runs away, she runs right to it
So fast, she'll run right through it
I don't ask her where she has to be
But sometimes she runs to me

She's a born-again burnin' restless soul
Leaves a sweet empty place when she goes
...
