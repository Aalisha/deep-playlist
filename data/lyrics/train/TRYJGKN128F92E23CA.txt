I went to bed too late
and got up too soon
My poor head still spinnin'
from too much booze

I got a foot in the gutter
A foot in the grave
I ain't seen home
In the last three days

Oh my god look what the cat dragged in
Livin' my life sin after sin
Night rolls up and I do it again
Oh my god, look what the cat dragged in
...
