Its twilight and I wake up hot
My body's soaked in a cold, cold sweat
I reenact the lurid scenes
And clawed engravings in my head

Oh, I can't punch hard enough and I run
I can't kick high enough and I run
I can't shoot straight enough and I run
I can't hold on enough and I run
Oh, I can't stay down enough and I run
I can't take pain enough and I run
I can't bleed fast enough
I can't die dead enough

The air is thick, but the oxygen's thin
My heart is beating like a drum, boom!
And ice is flowing through my veins
Explosives on my lips and in my lungs
...
