I spent some time in the hills of old Kentucky
Iâ€™ve travelled south on down to Tennessee
I thought I found true love in Carolina
But I woke up next day in misery

Cuz youâ€™re the one I love
Next to you is where I want to be
Weâ€™ll travel all around this whole wide country
Cuz anywhere is home when youâ€™re with me
