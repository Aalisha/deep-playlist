You said you could not love, but instead you love to hate,
the liars and the vampires will break these bloody chains.
You say you can not love, but inside you love to hate,
the liars and the vampires will break these chains!
I saw you out the window, as the blood-line fills this town with razors,
I saw you out that window... it is not the same... her face is gone and dead.
