So many reasons to be thankful
So many blessings that I can't repay
And I never would've made it here without You
Sending angels to guide me on my way

You keep givin' me joy
You keep givin' me happiness
You keep givin' me hope
You keep givin' me everything I wish
You keep holding me up
When I'm about to fall
And if even all of that was not enough
You keep givin' me love
(You're givin', You're givin' me love)

I know that I'm not always easy
And I know I put You through some trying days
But in spite of all the worries that I gave You
No, You never let my Angels get away
