On track to an early grave
And I don't stand a chance against the monsters that my mind creates.
I don't want to be here, I just want to be numb
Escape the fucking people that believe in this system.
You know they're watching, counting on your mistakes
Waiting for failure, can you carry the weight?
Once had a future, now I'm watching it die
Damn my reflection in the shadows of night.

Listen closely, hear this whole world crumbling
