Here are a few notes from the underground.
Load them at your pleasure.
These are the dusty pictures that I found
While on my search for treasure.

Here is the hazy vision that I saw,
Here's what she said to me:

Unless you're ready to handle the nation
I'm cold and I'm bold and I don't do what I'm told.

She wore mirrorshades.
And I can't explain the thing about her mirrorshades.
But I know that I can't live without her mirrorshades.
