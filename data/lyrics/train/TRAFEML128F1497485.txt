Baby you know you're so kind
Oh you cover my back in sweet little kisses
When I lie awake I'm sure you kiss me softly and you tell me
Tell me we'll be far away

Like the red sunlight when I wake up
It's streaming through my window shining through my bedroom door
You are the golden dawn and I'm loving and I'm loving you
