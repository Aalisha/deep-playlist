Suffer!

Running and hiding the innocent are dying defenseless this killing is
Wrong protecting the land from the enemy's strong hand refuges are
Losing their lives

Suffer!

Shooting and firing
The bullets are flying bodies expire when they fall
Strike and attack with deadly impact never to be taken alive

Suffer!

Pushing them back, rebel soldiers attack
...
