So maybe you could do with a break
You've had about all you can take
You need to find somewhere you can run to

Somewhere a long way from here
Somewhere where the skies are all clear
Somewhere you can think all your thoughts through

It took a long time to make me understand
You gotta meet life and shake it by the hand
You gotta use your emotion

You talk a nice line to put your mind at ease
You want to sit back and count your memories
But that's no solution
...
