You don't know
You just don't know me at all

Can you
Tell me what happened here
Tell me how I should feel
When my life seems to be in disarray
I feel you testing me
With all your fanasties
And you tryin' to keep me down
But I won't stay

Cause you don't know me

I've been through all this hell before
I've seen it all and more
If you think I'm gonna fade away
You don't know me
You think you have the upper hand
Well that's not my plan
Stronger now I see the truth
You just don't know me at all
...
