Won't you be my honky tonk girl?
Won't you be my honky tonk girl?
I may be going home
but I dont wanna be go alone
Won't you be my honky tonk girl?

I saw you workin' last saturday night
I asked you if you needed a light
I said excuse me baby please
but you brought me to my knees
Won't you be my honky tonk bride?

Yeah, we will have kids and a tractor
