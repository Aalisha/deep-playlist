Once again, I slip back in the gin and settle in
Oh, my bottle and me sail out to sea to meet her again
That El Caf√© Kartoum near a quiet lagoon where we played and played
All the ladies sing your Caribbean dreams drinkin' Tanqueray.

Chorus:
Tanqueray, take me away
You're a time machine that I need day by day
Tanqueray, take me away
