I could never be your boyfriend
'Cause you know I gotta special girl
And I could never be your husband
But that don't mean you still don't rock my world

And I can take you to an island
We can be there, just the two of us
Girl, I love to see you smilin'
All I ask is that you keep it hush, girl

Be my number 2, girl, I love you
Be my number 2, girl, I need you
Be my number 2, girl, you're so fine, so fine
Be my number 2 but you will never be my number 1
My number 1, my number 1, my number 1

I could take you out to dinner
But there's a couple of places we won't go
'Cause number 1 is no beginner
And there's a couple things that she don't know

So I can take you to a hotel
We can be there just the two of us
Girl, I love you 'cause you don't tell
