I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody

Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody

You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
