I've been there a thousand times
Felt the rain like a thousand knives
And it hurts
I know it hurts

I've been there like a fighter plane
Trying to fly my way through a hurricane
And it's hard
I know it's hard

Don't be afraid
You'll make it through
Just call out to me and I'll come running to you
And hold on

Hold on when the current pulls you under
And your heart beats like thunder
...
