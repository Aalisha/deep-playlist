Go ahead, get captivated
Will you ever give your secrets away?
My mind says it's gonna drive me senseless
But it's only tunnel vision
It's only state of mind

It's alright
It's alright to make the move
It's alright
Get there, stay there
Babe it's alright
It's alright to feel the mood
It's alright
So good, so fine
Babe it's alright

There has to be
Some kind of harmony
To keep the maddening
Silence away
So hang on, we'll be moving on
'Cause it's only your confusion
That's keeping us behind
...
