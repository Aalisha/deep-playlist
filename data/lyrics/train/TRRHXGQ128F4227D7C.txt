I dreamed I was a pigeon
Slipping through the heavens
Like a 747
Everyone left down below

Locked in a house of my invention
Learning the "don't"s of fire prevention
If I roast marshmallows over their bodies
Do you think god will still find their souls?

Just want to be like we used to
Under the influence
Just want to see like we used to
Under the influence
