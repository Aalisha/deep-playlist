The going rate on seduction must be a dime a dozen.
So don't get your hopes up.
This life's a contradiction, a typecast for hypocrisies, 
But you run the miles away only to sell yourself short.
And I am the one who dreams of you.
I dream of you, I still dream of you.
Sirens fade from silence this is where the story ends.
In a dream of truth they'll never find you.
