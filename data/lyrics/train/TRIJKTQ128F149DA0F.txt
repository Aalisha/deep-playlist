It was raining when I met you
You were soaking wet no time to be impressed
And I remember so much later on
I knew that you were someone I would not forget
Everybody's searching hungry for the glamor
You know too many hearts are in a rush
No matter how you try to, you can't explain
The places you find love
I can't explain it but I can feel it
All around me the need to find the place
Where feeling can be safe, it's not money that buys happiness
No, it's not the shine of silver that puts the heart to rest
Everybody's pushing the clock is always running
And no one ever seems to have enough
And when you least expect it
You come upon the places you find love, love, love
Remember in a flash the feeling can hit you
After all the times that it missed
