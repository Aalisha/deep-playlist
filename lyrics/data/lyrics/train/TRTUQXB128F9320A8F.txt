Hey girl don't bother me, hey girl don't bother me
Go away come back again another day don't bother me

I heard about you from my friends
The word really gets around
They say you broke the heart
Of every boy in town

They said you were out to cheat
They said you were just a little flirt
If I fall for you, surely gonna get hurt
...
