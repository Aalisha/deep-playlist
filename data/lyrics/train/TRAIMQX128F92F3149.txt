(J.P. Maunick / S. Grey)

People gather together where the love shines
And everyone is truly free
There's a light on the world for you and me

Trip around the world
Take a good look around, tell me what you see
Everyday people looking for love
Yes they are searching

There's nothing in the world
Nothing else to be found, that can compare
With the power of love
Everyday we are yearning

Now gather together
