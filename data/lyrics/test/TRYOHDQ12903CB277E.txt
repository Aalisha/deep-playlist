We've got, we've got
We've got/we want
We've got, we've got perfect motion
We've got/we want, we want/we've got
Because we've got perfect motion
We've got/we want chaos
Because
We want/we got perfect motion
We've got/we want the lot
We'll knock
We'll knock until the doors break open
If rhythm's a drug, I'm hooked on you
So show me every move
