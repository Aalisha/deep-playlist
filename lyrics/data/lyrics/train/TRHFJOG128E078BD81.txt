[Female voice:] As day turned to night, I saw the end approaching
No hope for us, but yet our faith stays strong

Kill them, hatred, flows inside my veins,
This will be the end of our days
All is lost but this blood will stain
My hands, my heart.

Die by my hand, all you hopeless ones
Deep down, my heart, darkest blood it runs
Through my veins its fire's burning bright,
You won't live through the night
...
