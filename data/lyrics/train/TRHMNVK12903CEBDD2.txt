You are the air i breathe
You are the song i sing
You mean the world to me
O yeah! O yeah!
I'm covered in your love
Delighted in your word
I live for you alone
O yeah! O yeah!

You are the air i breathe
You are the song i sing
You mean the world to me
O yeah! O yeah!
I'm covered in your love
Delighted in your word
I live for you alone

O yeah! O yeah!

You are the air i breathe
You are the song i sing
You mean the world to me
O yeah! O yeah!
I'm covered in your love
Delighted in your word

I live for you alone
O yeah! O yeah!
