What would you do if you were me?
Impatience wears so easily.
How many times is a second chance?
Can I count all those times with my two hands?

I know you're just sorry,
but I don't know if that means more than just goodbye.
Tell me the same old story.
Faking a smile, you can't hide behind your eyes.

You know that I'm willing to forgive.
All of those times, I will relive.
