When you're out there on your own
Trying to make it all alone
Cause you seek the missing pieces of your life

It's a rough and tumble journey
On a road that never ends
It's a cold, cold world you're walking through, my friend

But when you're loved, when you're loved
You always walk in love's reflection
When you're loved, when you're loved
Some how you find the right direction
...
