A heavy heart I bring
For I am tired Lord
Awaken my lost love for You
Take this heart of stone
And warm this bitter cold
Awaken my lost love for You

Let your children fall down and worship
Fall down and know You
For You are holy
Let Your children rise up before You
Rise and adore You
For You are holy
You are holy
