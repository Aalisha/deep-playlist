Maybe I act on confused behavior
Maybe waves crash like semi-trailer
Maybe I'll spend my off-time without you
It seems like we need our own space

And all this time I've wasted away
To not feel good unless you stay, stay, stay
And all this time I've chased you away
Simply to catch back up with

Your solitude is welcome, welcome
Your attitude is welcome, welcome
Your solitude is welcome, welcome
Your attitude is welcome

All you see is red lights behind me
Maybe this isn't what you wanted, baby
