Live version

We'd like toduce tonight the kings of a brand new style
They're hungry to play
We'd like toduce tonight the new heavy steamrock style
Quite different and strange

Alright, how do you feel tonight
Get up to see and cry the name of the band
(steamrock band, steamrock band)
Steam right with hands and feet tonight
Get up to see and cry, and they will begin

Here they are

Steamrock fever, screaming rock believers
Steamrock fever in l.a.
Steamrock fever, screaming rock believers
Steamrock fever in l.a.

Alright, how do you feel tonight
Get up to see and cry the name of the band
(steamrock band, steamrock band)
Steam right with hands and feet tonight
Get up to see and cry, and they will begin
