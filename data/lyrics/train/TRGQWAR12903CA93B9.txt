(Verse 1)
So my heart has been ship wrecked again
And I try to swim to dry land
To reach the shore, 
It's a desert island and I wright help, 
In the sand as large as I can, 
That you ignore, 
So I'm waving at air planes, 
Waiting for ships to come take me away, 

(Pre chorus)
When I noticed the tide
Sure is coming in fast, 
And I guess that this song
Really could be my last, 

(Chorus)
I feel like I'm stranded here with, 
No-one to rescue me
Abanded by everyone I need, 
I feel like you played me, 
I feel like I'm such a fool, 
Left stranded here by you, oh
...
