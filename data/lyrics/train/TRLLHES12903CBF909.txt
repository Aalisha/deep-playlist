We used to go together
Looking after each other
I thought that you were better
Look at you (look at you, look at you, look at you)

You used to be so laid back
You always kept it so cool
I loved you 'cause of all that
That's the truth (that's the truth, that's the truth, that's the truth)

I don't think you know where your head is
I was always there to help you break the fall

And now you wanna pretend that you're a superstar
And now you want us to end what's taken you this far
Don't tell me that your done as far as we go
You need to have a sit down with your ego
When everyone's gone and you are by yourself
