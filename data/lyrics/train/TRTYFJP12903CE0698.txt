Hi, my name is,
You wont remember, wait till December.
Cause you thought that I was pure as snow,
Guess you didnt know.
Hold tight, surprise, open your eyes its springtime.
Flowers blossoming, I am one of them, bet you like how I've grown.

Cause now Im that bitch,
Youll never get to uh.
Cant get what you want, so youre acting like a punk.
You were too fly then, so fly away now.
Now Im that bitch, and youre just a clown.

Why, should I even remember, back when you blanked me, to
put it frankly.
But now Im back, Im not attracted, and youre not getting none.
Cause Im, not for the taking, Im not a bender, return to sender.
I laugh at you even asking to, to get with me tonight.

Cause now Im that bitch,
Youll never get to uh,
Cant get what you want, so youre acting like a punk.
