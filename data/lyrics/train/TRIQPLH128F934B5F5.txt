Blood is on my hands!
Stand strong, watch out! Forward to desecration!
Never me, it's all for you.
Contact, collapse - domination of the wicked,
Indecent, heaven sent.

The world hates me.
I've got this glorious feeling.
Blood still rains on me, the slaughtering has begun.
I am out of any emotion, I leave this place behind.
My revenge tastes bitter sweet in a war of pain and deceit.

Ignorance and hate is my recipe, a step to hope or misery.
We are all on our way to burn a mark into the history,
Satisfaction in a higher form.
Doesn't matter what you want, you'll get what you deserve!
