Girl you know I'd love to know your name
but I don't have the lines
Unfortunately we're taught baby oh so tastelessly oh
How could I waste your time
Everybody knows girl I'm so in love with you
It's no mystery
Ooh, I just want to be your lover baby
Forever naturally

So tell me girl,
Can you help me?
Baby can you help me?
Can you help me?
Baby can you help me?

Girl you know I'm not the type that feels I'll win your love for sure
