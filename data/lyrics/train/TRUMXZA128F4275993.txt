A healthy argument to start the day, what better way
We chew the fat of life, we're moved to tears
Lend me your ears
But you spend all your time
Waiting in static shopping lines
And all your troublesome debates
Are solved in glossy magazines

Too much small talk leads to a small mind
So tell me what your views are
And I will tell you mine

Well how's the weather
(Grey and boring)
