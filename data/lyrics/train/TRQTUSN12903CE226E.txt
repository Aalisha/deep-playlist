Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
(What? Go money)
Money makes the world go round
TM

Yo, for those who live the way that I live
We came a long way
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL
It's Nas and R. Kell

[R. Kelly]
Never thought that I'd ever live this life
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side
Anything I want, I can say it's mine
