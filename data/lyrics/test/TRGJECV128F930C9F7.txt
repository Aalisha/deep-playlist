This is the story of Gad-About-Garth
He was the kind of man you see in every bar
An old school bling bling guy, shades on in the dark
"I'm here for the ladies" he'd say, "light up my smoke"

Workin' the dancefloor, he'd shake it about
Chains and jewellery shimmering, bling-a-ling, glimmering
Workin' the females, not a butt he didn't slap
Dropping one-liners, some chauvinist crap:

Hey Ba-by! Have you ever been south of the border?
Yo Shugah! What would you like for breakfast in the morning?

Garth's fellow-workers at the office were fed-up
"I swear if he tries som'n with me I'll smack his ass all the way back to gooberville!"
Especially the ladies who felt they had enough
"Damn straight" "Uh-huh!"
