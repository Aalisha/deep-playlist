Who am I trying to fool
As the night falls upon me?
Who am I trying to be
When this leads to nothing?

I need some medication
I need your medication
These choices I've been making
They make me hate myself

Are you there?
How I long to be with you
Are you there?
Listening to my despair

Standing right at the shore
Knowing life is so much more
I said what she wanted to hear
