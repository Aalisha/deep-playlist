Yeah, Attic Crew, Attic Crew and Cooley C, my nigga
Yeah, yeah, my nigga, it's Attic Crew and Cooley C, my nigga
Yeah, Youngbloodz, Youngbloodz and Cooley C, my nigga
Um, Mark Twayne

Now it's time to let y'all nigga know about me
Oh, I can get mo money, mo money, don't come to me
And everythin' I say that be on the blow
Rap for the love of money, stack it up once mo'

Going once, going twice, got the O for the low
Got my cheese in the soil, tryin' to make my flow grow
Hell no, never fall off, slip pimpin'
You can get it hard or get it soft

All day, round the clock tryin' to get it in
I ain't worried bout' the rich 'cause I'm in the wind
All I got is my folks, Lord forgive me for my sins
And if this ain't for me, please make me thank again

Gotta get my shit right, tight like these gurls draws
Let me recognize the game and all the flaws
While I'm out here, please let me come up
And watch my every step so I don't have to duck

Never wanted this, damn how a nigga stuck?
Hit me on the hill nigga, I'm a' sack it up
Rabbit on my head all day for good luck
On the hustle everyday but who really gives a fuck

So what you got when you ain't got nothing to show
Thangs movin' slow, can't get your hands on no blow
Ain't got no flow naw, need some quick cash
If hustlin' is the answer nigga, get up off your ass

So what you got when you ain't got nothing to show
