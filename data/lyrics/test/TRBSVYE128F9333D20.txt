I need a kick drum
A guitar now
And a bass line

And I'm a show you how
How to rock
How to dance
How to get down
All I need is a piano in my track now

Throw your hands, throw your hands
Throw your hands, throw your hands up
Whoa, whoa
Cause you can't, cause you can't
Cause you can't, cause you can't stop
Whoa, whoa
Can you hear me
(Hey)
Do you feel it
(Hey)
If you're with me go
(1, 2, 3)
Cause we're here and we're now
And we're all together
So let's make this last forever

Turn the amps up
Turn the lights down
Brush yourself

I'm a show you how
How to rock
How to dance
...
