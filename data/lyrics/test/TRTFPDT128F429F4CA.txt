I have my chance what in the hell am I waiting for
I offer my apology for the millionth time
I try in vain to try to get you to just open up
You never have an answer and I never question why

I stare outside your window
Waiting for it to begin
As you turn I'll keep my head low.
Why can't you let me in?

I'm in your head, too bad I know that's not what I said
You twist my words til they seem good enough for you
...
