Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

The only girl I ever loved has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her he took my heart

Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care
