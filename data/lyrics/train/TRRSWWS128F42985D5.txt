I'm coming home i've done my time
i feel i've lost my piece of mind
oh with you in my life so intense day and night
i hope i can understand why
(don't you know) I don't want your love
(just trying to say) And you can't help the way your feeling
Every time a feel the sign
Hope you can understand why
Warning Sign
Didn't feel this right
Warning Sign
(hey)
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Warning sign
Going threw my mind
Warning Sign
(hey)
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
I'd been a fool and let you go
I'd be a fool and let you leave me now without a sound
Cheated by love
And mistreated by trust
God knows i understand why
Warning Sign
Didn't feel this right
Warning Sign
(hey)
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Warning sign
