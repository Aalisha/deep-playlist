Spray the masses with gunfire
Foreign pigs will live in fear
They never learn
Light the match, flames burn higher
I need to exterminate the queers
My stomach turns
Would not heed your worthless cries
Strike with fear, 'cause I won't wait your misery
Stick your fingers in my eyes
Just like somebody blind by hate
They cannot see

Yes I'm prompted by my own self-doubt
I need to hate them because they're strange
They never learn
I have plucked my own eyes out
I live a life that's ruled by rage, my stomach turns
Powered by ... elders lies
Strike with fear 'cause you know I won't wait your misery
Stick your fingers in my eyes because ...
Just like somebody blind by hate
They cannot see

Spray the masses with gunfire
Foreign pigs will live in fear
They never learn
Light the match, flames burn higher
...
