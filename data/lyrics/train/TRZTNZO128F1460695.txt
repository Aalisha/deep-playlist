Straight to the whole world
I got the cocaine okay?
Yeah, I got the cocaine man
I got the Yey, YA
Scoe Montana
Scoeldie Montana, remember my name

[Hook: Mr. Kane]
I'm just a ballin ass niggaro, you best to get ready
Straight out the penitentary, to makin all this feddy
We gangsta rock steady, Bang this in ya Chevy
We pushin weight heavy, even if they won't let me

[Roscoe]
Scoe is chillin, makin a million
Stackin his loot till I touch top ceilin
Miraculous, toothless, but top notch women
Acura roofless blastin my music
Adelle on my right, He done got me for my life
I'm a star like Tri
Crazy youngster livin the Hard knock life like Jay the hustla
I'm a professional mic clutcha plus a dope rhymer
Ghetto potent, perfect timing I"m an opportunist
Takin advantage of my youth, fresh when I do it
The homie Kokane, tighter than choker chains
Soakin up the game with dreams of Roscoe's name being a houshold name
We ballin, ghetto fabulous, just trying to do my thang
