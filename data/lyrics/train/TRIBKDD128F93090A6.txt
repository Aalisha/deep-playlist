Wake up another day
it's funny how you put yourself in cruise control
you say you say your life is very plain
waiting for a spark to light the coal inside
and that is when you feel alive
but that's just where it starts
are you too comfortable in the dark?

*CHORUS*
you threw it all away
you had so much to gain
you threw it all away
