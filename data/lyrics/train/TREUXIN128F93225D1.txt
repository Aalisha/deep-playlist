The cold night wasn't trouble enough for him
Another swallow never seemed like enough for him
They say the past is the past but it never treated me like this

He couldn't ask for a better understanding of how
What goes around comes back around twice as fast
He's got no hope for a cure so he'll put himself to sleep, oh

Now we just sit back, we sit back
While we watch all of them react

So tell me what to tell you when the world won't listen
The start to the finish, come on and let me hear you speak
Oh, and use up all the time you're given
...
