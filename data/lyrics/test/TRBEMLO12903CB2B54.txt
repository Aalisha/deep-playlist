What can I say that hasn't already been said
The cold spot in my bed
Already tells a story about it clear
Feels like my heart (on a merry-go-round)
Loving and loving and leaving all over again
Not even sure if I can't pretend
That I've got my self-respect, what's left of it, he-ey
[Chorus]
I learned to rely on my instinct to guide me
But I'm not as cold as I thought, oh
Try to deny all those feelings inside me
I'm sorry I still have a heart, oh
