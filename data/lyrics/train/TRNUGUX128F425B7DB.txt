God damn this dusty room
This hazy afternoon
I'm breathing in this silence like never before

This feeling that I get
This one last cigarette
As I lay awake and wait for you to come through that door

Oh maybe, maybe, maybe
I can share it with you
I'll behave, I'll behave, I'll behave
So I can share it with you

You are not alone, dear Loneliness
You forgot, but I remember this
Oh stranger, stranger, stranger things have happened, I know
