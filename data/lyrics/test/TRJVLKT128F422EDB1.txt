Machines of Death, Storm through the night
Destroying and slaying whatever in sight.
Bodies melt where they stand,
Exposure of metal tears through the land
Terrorist Attack, blood stain the walls
No prisoners take, no one lives at all
Life lived in darkness, now lived in fear
Yield no pain, shed no tear

Trial by combat, the agony prolonged
A neverending death, it always lives on
Holocaust stricken, the temptation? unknown.
The pain seems unbearing to your flesh and bone
Soldiers of fortune kill for their cause,
Showing no remorse when lives are involved
World domination is what they all fight for
Victims of States power will take it no more

Retaliate!
