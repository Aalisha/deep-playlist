I stood as tall as a mountain
I never really thought about the drop
I trod over rocks to get there
Just so I could stand on top
Clumsy and blind I stumbled
As I crawled through desert sands
I didn't stop to think about the consequences
As it came to pieces in my hands

I thought I was a maritime marvel
I believed that I ruled the waves
All I could say is time is motion
And every effort others made I would save
...
