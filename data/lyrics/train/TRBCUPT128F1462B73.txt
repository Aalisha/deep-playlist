One day the dreamers died within us
When all our answers never came
We hid the truth beneath our skin but
Our shadows never looked the same

A ghost is all that's left
Of everything we swore we never would forget
We tried to bleed the sickness

And when we couldn't stop the bleeding
We held our hearts over the flame
We couldn't help but call it treason
And after that we couldn't fill our frames
