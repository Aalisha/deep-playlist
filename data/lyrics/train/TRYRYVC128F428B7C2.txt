I'm money broke and it's no joke can't cope use the rope this time
Knuckle up buckle up the rides getting rough but i will not loose my mind
I asked them if i could come in and the first thing they said was NO
If I can't come in, that means I can't come back that means I got nowhere to go

(repeat 2x)
I'm a hyena fighting for lion share
Sometimes the lions share ain't there

Absent from political authority an animal I've become
Total disorder and confusion is the lifestyle that i run
Permit me to do what I want and I will I'm a nomad to travel
