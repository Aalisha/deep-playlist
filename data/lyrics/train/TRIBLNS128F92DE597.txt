If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong than right

My mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
But as long as I got you by my side
I don't care what my people say

My friends tell me there's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want
I'll see you when I can

If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong
I don't wanna be right
