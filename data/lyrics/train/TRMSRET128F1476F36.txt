'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing
'Cause I wanna take you downtown
Show you my thing, show you my thing

Go down, go down, go down, go downtown
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Your face never saw the sites, the bright lights
The walls that always invite
Get it right, no fight
You'll be there up all night

I'll give you a bus ride, a park slide
A high rise full of surprises
A smooth path, follow track
All the way to my flat

Come with me, come with me
Come with me, come with me there

'Cause I wanna take you downtown
