Feel!
The beat of song I'm singing
Love and joy to all I'm bringing

Feel!
The times I felt I'm falling
You were there to catch me baby

Fly me to an endless fantasy
A neverending story
Dreams are never quiet what they should be
A sound of love
You and me

Whoo! Are you feeling alright?!

Feel!
The beat of song I'm singing
Love and joy to all I'm bringing
