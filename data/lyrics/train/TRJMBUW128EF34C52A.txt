Day to day
And the time has passed away
Feel a heart beating lonely
One for every day
I known many
But I’ve known you many times
I’ve gotten older
And I’ve written all these lines
I stop and think what’s been going on
It’s a hunger and I’ve wondered
Till the brink of dawn
Every night and every single sin
This situation is the mess I’m in
