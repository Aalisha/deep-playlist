Take a breath and tear it apart
See things crystal clear
And then scream against me
hurt me beat me

We were just joking like clowns
Handling life and letting it drown
"are you kidding me?"
I heard myself loud
Because I shouldn't let you go
Can't be waiting anymore

I've got enough of senseless cries
It's not easy to break through
But then scream against me
...
