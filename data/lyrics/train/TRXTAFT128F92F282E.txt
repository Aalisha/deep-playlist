(Woo - hoo - woo - ooo - to - do)
(Woo - hoo - ooo - oop - to - do - do)
(Woo - hoo - woo - ooo - to - do)
(Doo - do - do - do - op - to - do.)

The cattle are prowlin' the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the dogies bawl
Where spurs are a - jinglin', a cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call.

(Woo - hoo - woo - ooo - to - do)
(Woo - hoo - ooo - oop - to - do - do)
(Woo - hoo - woo - ooo - to - do)
(Doo - do - do - do - op - to - do.)
