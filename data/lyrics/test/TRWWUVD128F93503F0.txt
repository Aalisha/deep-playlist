Welcome to this crazy world
Can't you see what it's done to me
Losing touch and I've lost control
Things ain't what they seem to be
I know you see
It's my reality
I'm lost in pain
I'll never be the same
What's the use of screaming
No one hears you shout
No one gives a damn
What it's all about

They're taking me to the asylum
Come along for the ride
