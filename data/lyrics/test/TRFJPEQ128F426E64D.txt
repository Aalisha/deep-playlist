You say
I'm gone
This road
We're along
You cry
Alone
We fall
On our own

Got me something
Souls
You got to let it go
Got me something
Souls 
You got to know, know, know
Got me something
Souls
You got to let it go
Got me something
Souls

Well I said, I said
I'll just leave it alone
All the bets on the other ones
You leave it alone
You place your bets on the other ones
You wanna go home
