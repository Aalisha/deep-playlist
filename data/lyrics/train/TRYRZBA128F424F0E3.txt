It's too late
The time has come
I kept this inside me
For way too long
Silence will leave me cold
Lost on a highway
That never takes me home

I wanna step aside
I wanna give it up
Before I lose it all
It's tearing me inside
The way you break me down

There will come a time
When I will come undone
And you will let me fall
I'll leave it all behind
Before you break me down
