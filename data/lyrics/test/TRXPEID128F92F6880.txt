With Her Little One In One Arm
And The Laundry In The Other
She Sure Could Use A Helping Hand
But Thats The Life Of A Single Mother

Somebody's Calling On The Phone
Somebody's Knocking At The Door
She Forgets And Burns The Dinner
Throws It Acrossed The Kitchen Floor
And For A Moment She Wants To Give Up And Break Down

But Nobody's Crying But The Baby
She Ain't Far From Going Crazy
There Are Time She Wonders How She's Going To Make It
