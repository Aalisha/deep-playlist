The earth need some Moulding 
I'm gonna dig and dig some holes in 
And bring forth some fruits, oh Lord 
Trees bearing fruits 
The earth need some Moulding 
Arise my sheep if you're sleeping 
And bring forth your fruits, oh Lord 
Trees bearing fruits 
Trees bearing fruits 
 
Said I know of a place rich and silent 
With these lots of word for each and everyone 
To be done, it's no fun 
Bring forth your potions sistrens and bredrens 
I believe that heaven's now come 
Let's not tore he, 'cause her hurt is ready 
...
