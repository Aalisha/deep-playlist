I bought Van Halen 1.
It was the best damn record I ever owned.
TG&Y, 1978.

Two hand tapping guitar technique,
really got me off,
eruption yah.
Ain't talkin' bout' love.
I'm on fire.

Tomorrow may come,
Tomorrow may never come again.
Can't you hear Jamie cryin'
She's runnin' with the devil.
Oh lord, oh lord.
