Woken by lifeless moonlight
Abandoned by dream and night
All awake but still inside
Trapped behind words too subline

Desperation is long dead
I am lost and I am damned
To watching the world go by
Without a trace, without a smile
...Wake me up...

My voice drowns in tears
As I left go of your hand anf tell you to leave
Still I'm choking on unsought thoughts
...
