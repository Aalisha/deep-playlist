She said "It's just a woman thing" and pulled out of the drive
I said not to worry I'm an understanding guy.
I've heard that when you love someone, you gotta let em go.
She hollered "When I find myself you'll be the first to know."
Ooh No news

I learned to do the laundry, feed the cat, and clean the house.
I promised to be patient while she worked her problems out.
When she packed her bags, her destination wasn't clear;
But I sensed that her intentions were honest and sincere.
Ooh No news
