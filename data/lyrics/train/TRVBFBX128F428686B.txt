[Intro:]
Uh, She was a young thang (so sweet)

[Chorus:]
She was a young thang, a pretty young thang
She was a young thang, a pretty young thang
But I'm a gangsta and I could neva love ya
She was a young thang, a pretty young thang
She was a young thang, a pretty young thang
But I'm a gangsta and I could neva love ya

[Verse 1:]
She was a young thang, a pretty young thang
19, fully independent, own whip, own tilt, had me feeling it
I parked up popping game but she didn't believe me
And then I let my hair down like black Jesus
She start looking in my eyes and I starting squeezing
Naw I ain't touch her when I first met her
