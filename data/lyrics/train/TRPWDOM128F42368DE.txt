Hello there how you doing
I've got all these thoughts just floating through my brain
They bump and they collide and cause a flurry of confusion
And it's getting on my nerves
I try to hold myself together
fighting off this mental weather when I can (Sometimes I do)
But this shitstorm's never ending
And the atmospheric pressure's calling for rain

This is what I've got going on
This is where I belong tonight

It's chaos in the courthouse
And the left side's all upset
Because the right side wants a summer home
and knows we can't afford it
I try to mediate between
This constant tug-o-war machine
