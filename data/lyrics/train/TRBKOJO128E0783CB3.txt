I've been workin' baby for too long now
Just wanna get next to you boy
I've been searchin' baby, a way to tell you how
Gotta get through to you boy

Never said it was sunshine but you took it all of the time
Never said it was sunshine but you took it all of the time
All of the time, all of the time, all of the time
You took it all of the time

There's no escaping now
...
