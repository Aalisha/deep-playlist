Silently, I wish to sail into your port, I am your sailor
Quietly, I drop my weight into your sea, I drop my anchor
I sway in your waves, I sing in your sleep
I stay till I'm in your life

I realize now you were not to be blamed my love
You didn't choose your name my love
You never crossed the seven seas
I realize now you were not to be blamed my love
You didn't choose your name my love
You never crossed the seven seas
