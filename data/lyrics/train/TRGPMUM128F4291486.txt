And so it has to change
The notebook's now in pieces
Words we'll never sing
I know you'll say i've simply jumped the gun
And that they've won
But you can't keep making the same mistakes
You see I've had this thought
It took its time in coming
But now won't be denied
I'd always gone about these things all wrong
But not this song
Cos you can't keep making the same mistakes
...
