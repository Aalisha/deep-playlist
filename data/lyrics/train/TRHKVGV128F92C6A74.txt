\"Here smokin' on a train
Leanin' on the pain
'Cause all I have is my own hard luck
Yeah I took off
Had to get away
I didn't want to pay a penance to all the cold hard luck

Somehow I knew your intention was to
Wrap me up around and around
Lock me away
So I just put my foot on the ground
I walked away

No way to tell me when
I screw it up again
Falling victim to my hard luck
