Dead Serious
 Lizzy Borden
 
 I know what's going through your mind
 You think we'll be together for all time
 I'm not just playing with your head
 Cause I'm not for sale, but I'm yours to rent
 
 You're over your head
 I won't play hide and go seek under the bed
 
 Cause you're dead serious
 You're dead serious
