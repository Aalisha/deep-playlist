I've been
Runnin'
In circles all day long
I'm out

Of breath
But I'm still goin' strong
I'm gonna get you yeah
No matter what they say
You think I'm losin'

But I always get my way
(Hey)
Don't walk away when I'm talkin' to you
This ain't no time for your bad attitude
Don't gimme
That face
When you know I'm really down for the chase
