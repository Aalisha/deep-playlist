i just can't stand around and play along like good dogs do
cause when i live the lie i know my time here is all through
we all try cutting corners
yeah we all prefer the ease
but i can't see above the fray when i'm down on my knees

don't worry, i'm still on it, on it
still strong and on it, on it
this song goes on and on and on

don't worry, i'm still on it, on it
still strong and on it, on it
...
