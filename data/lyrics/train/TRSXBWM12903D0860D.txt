The party's over, everybody go home
I'm sorry but I'd like to be alone
'Cause every time I see her I have to weep
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep

I threw this party, never thought she'd come back
All she wants to do is see me cry
And when I see her I just have to weep
I'm gonna cry myself to sleep

Cry y-y-y-y-y
Cry y-y-y-y-y
