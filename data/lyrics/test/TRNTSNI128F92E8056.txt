Okay so I was wrong about
My reasons for us fallin' out
Of love I want to fall back in

My life is different now I swear
I know now what it means to care
About somebody other than myself

I know the things I said to you
They were untender and untrue
I'd like to see those things undo

So if you could find it in your heart
To give a man a second start
I promise things won't end the same

Shame, boatloads of shame
Day after day, more of the same
Blame, please lift it off
Please take it off, please make it stop
