Double Lovin' 
 The Osmond Brothers 
 
 I'm gonna double your lovin 
 Double your fun 
 You get two for the price of one 
 
 It took me a long time to find a good woman 
 One that would be true 
 That's why I'm gonna double what it takes baby to hold on to you 
 
 I'm gonna make my lovin twice as good as it was before
