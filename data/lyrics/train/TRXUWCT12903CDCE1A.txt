Can I withstand all the pain that dwells within.
I won't let go for my wounds are far too deep.
I'm on my knees in submission to the pain I've caused.
Will I give in or can I find the will to breathe again.
I never thought I'd be on my own.
Now bring me peace that shelters me.
You shed your blood just so I could live again.
For a time I walked in darkness yet you were there to lead me through.
