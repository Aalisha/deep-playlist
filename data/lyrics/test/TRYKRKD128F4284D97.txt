I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming

Boy there's so many things to give
I've been aware of your charms for so long
And there's nothing that you can do
To stop me from coming around

I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming, I'm coming

I'm coming home, I'm coming home to your house
I'm coming home, I'm coming home to your house
I'll be your queen upon a throne in your house
I'm coming home, I'm coming home to your house

You can build it from bricks and stone
But there ain't no use in being alone
...
