I've noticed lately
The birds they sing throughout the night
Their body clock ticks over
Their inner mess the same as mine
December's warmer
Than I remember as a child
It's 12 degrees at midnight
The sky glows orange from the

City where the parties never stop
And all the eyes are trained on
Watching, simply watching

The morning pass us by
And once again we've missed the sunrise
You see my father told I should think before I speak
So now I don't speak about the obvious

I see you clearly
