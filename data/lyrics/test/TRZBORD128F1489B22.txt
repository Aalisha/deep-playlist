One hundred million souls have joined together
And hope for something better
A daring one shoots out a question
Why does all this work?
Cause the answers have all lost their meaning
They got us all believing
We really have a future
And who will get there first?

[Chorus]
Knocked down, stumble and you fall
Sit down, find some use for it all
...
