I see you roll your eyes
You know it makes me smile
You are like the sun to me
Bright as liquid fire

I feel so powerless
To hold you up above the world
You are quite a lot of trouble
Such a pretty little girl, such a pretty little girl

You know I'm never home
I'm always miles and miles away
I feel I'm runnin' out of time
Say the things I need to say

Call you on the telephone
You will not talk to me
Yeah you just don't understand
You are my everything
