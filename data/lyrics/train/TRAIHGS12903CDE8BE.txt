[Verse 1]
I had a vision of a murder
X-Raided sitting in a house with a 9 in my hand and a joint in my mouth
Straight fucking with that sisqo, it got me noid
I never should've started fucking with that 40
Now sprung out, stuck on the killa trip
Trippin like a motherfucker, but now I'm through with it
Got on the phone said "Amigo I'm on my way
My bitch is tripping, I need a place to stay"
she's talking to me like I got no brain
Cause of that sisqo, or cuz I'm insane
Brotha Lynch's been through the same thing though
But X-raided can be tripping over no hoe

So I got my 9 I was stressing
Trew out a lotionhead to keep em guessing
Went outside a house there was a dead bitch
That what she gets from marrying a lunatic
Im on that killa spree shooting that 9
Niggas dying cuz me and my bitch had a fight
I know its fuckedup and fooled but thats the price ya paying
Niggas fading my bitch is too when I sprung
See I dont give a fuck about shit
Even if ya know me I smoke ya and let you be a (dead homie)
show me that you're a lunatic like show and ya might live when ya fuckin wit
a psycho

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Dont fuck with a crazy Motherfucker
Dont fuck with a (a motherfucking Psycho)
Dont fuck with a b----

[Verse 2]
(Hell yeah) I did a walkby and the attitude I have is
