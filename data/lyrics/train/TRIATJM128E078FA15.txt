Throw away my dreams
this fight for my life
isn't dead and behind me
and I've been told to scream
when no one can hear me it doesn't mean nothing

so make me believe
just take me away from this hell I've created
and I'm afraid
I'm breakin' my own vows
knowin' I'll go down in flames

I know this can't be right
there's got to be something more that I can live for
and I can only hide
...
