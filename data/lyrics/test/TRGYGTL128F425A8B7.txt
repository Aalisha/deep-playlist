I know you, who are you now?
Look into my eyes if you can't remember
Do you remember? Oh

I can say, I can still find
You are the only voice my heart can recognize
But I can hear you now, yeah

I'll never be the same
I'm caught inside the memories
The promises, our yesterdays
And I belong to you

I just can't walk away
'Cause after loving you
I can never be the same

And how can I pretend I never knew you
Like it was all a dream, no
...
