I lost your love and started drinkin
cryin hard to stop from thinkin
I found that it was not the thing to do
I cant stop my heart from throbbin
Couldnt ease the pain my sobbin
Forgive me dear If Ill always do whats right
its my fault my heart is broken
angry words we have spoken
Im so sorry for now ive seen the light
