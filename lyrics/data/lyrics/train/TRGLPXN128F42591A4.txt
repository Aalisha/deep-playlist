I feel so bad I got a worried mi-ind 
Im so lonesome all of the time 
Since I left my baby behind o-on Blue Bayou 
Savin nickels, savin di-imes 
Workin till the sun don't shine 
Lookin forward to happier times o-on Blue Bayou 
Im goin back some day, come what may to Blue Bayou 
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine on Blue Bayou 
...
