I wonder why that south-bound train don't run
I wonder why that south-bound train don't run
Now you don't need no tellin', little girl, you know what you done

You made me love you, now your man done come
You made me love you, now your man done come
Now you leave me here worryin' baby, and I'm just the lonely one
