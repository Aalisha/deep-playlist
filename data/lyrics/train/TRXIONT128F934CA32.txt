Stars falling in my eyes
Blinding, bleeding, hiding from my sight
Freight train blood rush blowing through my head
Try to remember what the ghost of God said

"As each nail pierces your flesh
Smile and love each dog to death
Find a ride down the line
Travel the unlit corridor of your mind
Until the questions don't matter anymore
'Cause the answers, not the questions,
Will cause you to whore!"

Staring at a picture of life
Pulls my heart out through my eyes
Force me to remember the only ties that bind
Which serve to remind of the hardened empty husks of the once loved left behind
In the dusted trails of tears
...
