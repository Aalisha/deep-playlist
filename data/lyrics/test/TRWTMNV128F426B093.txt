These shades of gray are the essence of night
They're the defenition, I'll make your life
Darkness and fright. your last cry
Withstand my deadly grip

Survivor of tyrants. survivor of emptyness. survivor of lies
Your soul will die for me

I'll take your wildest dreams
I'll take you everything
I'll be your ressurection, your annihilation
I feel teh day has come, it's come... for the end to rise
one pain, one sin, one humilation for this degradation
