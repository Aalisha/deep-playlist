I'm on fire
Nothing's gonna hold me back
Endless blue sky
And a pocketful of tricks to try

Oh, you pick a color and I sing it for you
I know you feel the same way
Say, say, say you feel the same way

Your fingertips are like superhuman touch
Can't get enough of this electric love
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

The sparks flying out in every direction
There's more of this to come, I think it must be heaven
Burning the sun with just a wave of your hand

I'm on fire
...
