You know we steppin out trying to find the hottest spot
Where the girls is all 10's and the party don't stop
You know the type of place where I can get shitfaced
Then slap behind the bar and start making the drinks
Where underground cuts bangin through the speakers
Walkin in the front door sportin dickies and sneakers
Hat to the front but its leaning to the side
Eyes bloodshot red cause you know I'm always high
You need to hurry up quick you need to hurry up quick (hurry!)
You need to spin this record everybody's getting tipsy (let's go)
Dancefloors empty and all the hoes want to dance (I can't dance to that!)
Keep playin the same song over and over cmon man
Next time I see you I'm gonna flip you a 12 inch (here you go!)
I'm gettin tired of the same ole song doin the 2-step (2-step?)
Come on dog, I mean Mr. super DJ top 40
Play this underground shit and watch the girls get dirty (so what!)

Hey DJ spin dis shit
(I said uh) Hey DJ spin dis shit
(uh!) Hey DJ spin dis shit
Till the amps start to clip
And yo records start to skip
(so uh) Hey DJ play this song
(uh huh! I said uh) Hey DJ play this song
(uh!) Hey DJ play this song
And watch the club pop to the early morn

D to the dash, sippin on a glass,
Hat to the side, always laying in the cut (uh)
Ya'll know wassup, I'm all about a nice butt (beeeattch!)
Drinks, cash, good grass, some hoes I wanna fuck (ooooh)
