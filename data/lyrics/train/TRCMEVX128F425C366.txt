Sometimes I watch you passing by my window
And sometimes I watch you passing through my dreams
And sometimes, when I look at you
You take my breath away

Sometimes I try and understand your reasons
You choose to feel the way you feel about me
And sometimes, when I turn around
And you're there, like today
I wanna say:

Why me?
I look at you and I get to feeling
Why me? (Why me, whooh)
I know it's true but I can't believe it
