If we can't live in peace then fuck it let's die 
They ain't tryin' to hear us then fuck it let's ride 
Catch a traitor then stick a needle in his eye 
Smash mode soilder we runnin' out of time 

If we can't live in peace then fuck it let's die 
They ain't tryin' to hear us then fuck it let's ride 
Catch a traitor then stick a needle in his eye 
Smash mode soilder we runnin' out of time 


From Zumbi dos Palmares na mata fechada 
To Commando Vermelho bustin at the cops with them choppas 
Che Guevara and Castro bangin' in Cuba 
To the Zapatistas and Latin kings that bust with that Rugger. 
We ain't forgot but baby boy that block still hot 
People still broke they went from snortin' coke to that hop 
Tryin' to escape and take your brain up up and away 
And you ain't gotta worry about them bills that don't get paid 
Ho's get made in the 7th 8th 9th 15th grade
Studyin' that trickin' game as if they takin' a trade 
Little brothers is getting smothered like potatoes and gravy 
Got a name and street fame Jesus Christ couldn't save him 
And he gonna ride until that day he gone 
Slide him that black or chrome 
Live in your facial erase you and hit that gas get gone 
Why am I still in chains why am I still a slave 
Why am I poor and broke strugglin' workin' minimum wage
