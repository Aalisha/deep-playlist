Selassie I... Thunder rod (yeah), lightning, flashing...(mi know)
stars and the moon shining... Mi know, mi know, mi know, mi
knowwww... mi know
dem fear me, mi know... mi know, mi know, mi know, mi know...

Me hear dem sit dung and dem time fi hear dead, time fi hear mi dead
Fell off and nyam di fish and bread
But, Im sipping Hennessey and smoking all mi get, smoking all mi get
And have dem gyal inna mi bed
Again...
Me know dem sit dung and dem time fi hear mi dead, time fi hear mi dead
Fell off and nyam di fish and bread
But, Im sipping Hennessey and smoking all mi get, smoking all mi get
(Selassie I...) And have dem gyal inna mi bed...

Im so far, my main spars dem no near mi
Singing my song to let my enemies hear mi
Still dem man huff up and ah pits like a cherry
When da business so big, the whole ah we can share it

Some ah make ah bag ah talk, and dem sound contrary
One bag of nighs, the fans can hear clearly
After sing, mi ah sing my life story
Whole of dem mark and ah ploy fi take my glory
