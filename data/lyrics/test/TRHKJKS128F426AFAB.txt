Do not pity me, this useless being
Do not save me, this frail being, infant in size
So I broke the pact again and in so many different ways
I chose to quit this act. On the very last of my days
You long to cling to my soul, I'm not going anywhere
I'll leave you alone, you end this ride
This sure was a bond of souls, I'm not going anywhere
I'll search for the whole, it's your turn to end this ride
Don't you fear, do not compare
