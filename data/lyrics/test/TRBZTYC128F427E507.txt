From the moment I woke
In receipt of a blackmail note
And these curious eyes
A new disease of the last seen eyes

A live Christ in the city
I got my black-eyed mind
I'm gonna poison up the wrong way 'round
Like a bad design

It's in the way that I'm cold
Left dealing with a famished soul
I won't give you the time
It's greed sparked in a goldmine

I can't view your condition
It's as failed as they come
...
