Soldier: Heart-carved tree trunk, Yankee bayonet
A sweetheart left behind
Girl: Far from the hills of the sea-swelled Carolinas
That's where my true love lies

Soldier: Look for me when the sun-bright swallow
Sings upon the birch bough high
Girl: But you are in the ground with the wolves and the weevils
All a'chew on your bones so dry

Both: But when the sun breaks
To no more bullets in Battle Creek
Then will you make a grave
For I will be home then

I will be home then
...
