(Is that all you've got?
Is that all you've got?
Is that all you've got?
Is that all you've got?
I've got one for you)

Did you not make me
Take the blame for you
Did you not take me for a fool
And then you made me cry
What did you achieve
Blood/hate I believe
Watch as I deceive you in hell

Did you not make me
Take the blame for you
Did you not take me for a fool
And then you made me cry
What did you achieve?
Blood/hate I believe
Watch as I deceive you in hell

So you lived your life
On a level of indiscretion
Which I've never seen
Your ignorance
Makes my silent anger
Just wake up and scream

It's bloodstained

So in all this hate (hate)
And suffering (suffering)
It makes me go insane
