Don't say the word if you don't want it done
Don't tell me your name if you don't want it sung
Don't come any closer that's good enough
Don't go away, I can't stand the thought

Ohh it's too warm inside your hands
Ohh it's too hard, ohh it's too good
It's just that when you touched me
I could not stand up, ohh I fell into, ohh I fell down

Why can't you tell me is it worth a fight?
Do I sound crazy? Well I just might
