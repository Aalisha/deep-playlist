This is the last of the weakness
Cause i can't let it, i can't let it slip again
And if i face you will it ever be alright
If i never let go
I can't let it go again with all that's left undone
Cant lie let go
Is it in me
Everything i'll never see
Cause i will never live again
I will never live again
