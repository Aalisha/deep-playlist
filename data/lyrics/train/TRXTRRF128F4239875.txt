I just cannot cope with it anymore
Something is missing
My old faith is dead
I know you want some more force-fed hatred
And I'm gonna fill you up with a kiss

I found my redemption
I'm OD'd and there is no more entertainment
I found my redemption
And now the scene is so utterly dead

I failed
You won
My sin was pride
Excuse me my friends
I have to cast all aside

I have to clean up
Face the serpent's eyes
My life has been so deadly fake
