Breaking dawn will bring revenge
We should know by now we're so sick.
It was building up and no one was watching
We're running out of darkened corners to sweep the waste into

When we lined up at the edge, we were open wide
Like fools waiting for a sign
It was a free fall
An act of desperation, our backs against the wall
It was a free fall
