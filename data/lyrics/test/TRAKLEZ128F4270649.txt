Left the pain before the dawn
She never thought it would or could be easy
Been inclined to carry on
Hold my hard head
And watch you walk out on me
See the tears one by one
They fall down my hard head
Forevermore

Fall around into the ground
Deep down
Far as you can

Go out tonight and meet the dawn again
...
