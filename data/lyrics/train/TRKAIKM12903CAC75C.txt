(Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow! Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow!)Yeah, yeah, yeah! How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care -That you care? When every time I look around, The people suffer in the suffering
In everyway, in everywhere.
Say: na-na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na!): We're the survivors, yes: the Black survivors! I tell you what: some people got everything; Some people got nothing; Some people got hopes and dreams; Some people got ways and means.
Na-na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na!): We're the survivors, yes: the Black survivors! Yes, we're the survivors, like Daniel out of the lions' den(Black survivors) Survivors, survivors! So I Idren, I sistren, A-which way will we choose? We better hurry; oh, hurry; oh, hurry; wo, now!'Cause we got no time to lose.
