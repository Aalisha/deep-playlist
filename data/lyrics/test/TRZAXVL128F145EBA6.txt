I found you throwin' pebbles at a star
And countin' rain drops in a jar
I had forgotten that some people
Really are still dreamin', they are still dreamin'

You never knew what fear was all about
You never felt the hollow ache of doubt
That someday you just maybe without
A next time, without a next time

I wish that I was stronger and able to hold
Without the help of someone weaker, I can mold
Into the person I would like myself to be, to be, to be
