She thinks I'm crazy
Judging by the faces that she's making
And I think she's pretty
But pretty's just part of the things she does that amaze me
She calls me sweetheart
I love it when she wakes me when it's still dark
And she watches the sun
But she's the only one I have my eyes on

Tell me that you love me
And it'll be alright
Are you thinking of me?
Just come with me tonight
You know I need you
Just like you need me
Can't stop, won't stop
I must be dreaming
Can't stop, won't stop
I must be dreaming

And she moves in closer
Whispering to me, "I thought I told ya"
