There's a purple heart on the stars and stripes tonight
It's pinned to the chest of the latest liar
And if you try to speak your mind
They tell you keep it to yourself
You got friends in the armed forces
They wanna know which side you're on
Doesn't matter cause we'll all be off

To train, to fight
Disregard our human rights
To play the part
The conscience of the damned
You say you're defending me
I'm sick of tying yellow ribbons
Praying not to see

Another folded flag to a mourning mother
He was an army of one but they'll find another
...
