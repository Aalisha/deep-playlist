Rebellion
Malicious hatred for her creators
Resentment in heart and mind
Abandoning the careless swine
A pedophile father, an alcoholic mother
They called her "spawn of the dark one"

Encouragement of self mutilation
Their blood in her veins
She cuts herself to drain their ties
She knows no other way of life
