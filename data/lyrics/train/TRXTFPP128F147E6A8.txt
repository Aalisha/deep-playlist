High noon cometh, not a moment too soon
There's gonna be a firefight tonight
A reckoning to confront the residents of this tomb
A gunpowder partyand it feels just right
There comes a time
There comes a day
There comes an hour when...

CHORUS

In every man's life
In every man's life
When he must...
Brandish his steel
Mount up his steed

In every man's life
In every man's life
My will, My will be a dead man


All is quiet in the dusty alleyways
Few men dare to penetrate this land
And live to tell this terrible tale
My trusty six shot, my own right hand
...
