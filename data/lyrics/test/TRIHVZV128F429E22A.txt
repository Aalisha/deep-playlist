Yo, microphone check one two what is this
The five foot assassin' with the ruff neck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Win ans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game 'cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half

I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Messin' round with this you catch the sizin' of 'em
I never half step 'cause I'm not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed so won't you Suckle With the Mission

I never walk the streets, think it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

Uhh, uhh, uhh, uh
Zulu Nation, brothers that's creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse to get my
Point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
