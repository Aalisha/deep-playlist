What have you learned, can you remember?
What would you like for me to do?
Everything you need from me is in your hands
And everything else is up to you
You’re like a butterfly on a windy day
You use directions in a roundabout day

What have you learned,
Now that you’ve been burned
By the guy who used to be the center of your eye
And you’re blown away by your own hurricane
And you wonder why
Cast away and you’re looking through the wreckage for your pride,
But you can’t salvage what you don’t supply
...
