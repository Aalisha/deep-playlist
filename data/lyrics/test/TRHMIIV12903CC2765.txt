Leave me here to make this right
One true thing is all I need
Leave me here to make this right
All I need is - ONE TRUE THING

If there was a time to make this right
There’s no better time then right now
I’ve got to make a change for myself
I’ve got to find the will to change somehow

This is the start of the bottom line
This is the end of giving in
This is the end of a life long lesson
This is the end of asking why

Leave me here
I swear I’ll make it back, let’s make it clear
One true thing is all I need
