I'm here with all of my people
Locked up with all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me

Tall and tan and young and lovely
I follow all around the world for you
And you'll find out tonight oh it's a world of extremes

Political ceremony
They'll never find a happy home for you
But know that's not the only chance you'll get yeah you'll see

I'm here with all of my people
Locked up with all of my people
So let me hear you scream if you're with me
...
