We call upon Your name,
Humble ourselves and pray,
Move in our hearts,
Move in our land,
Every national tribe and tongue Will proclaim Your Kingdom come

chorus:
We pray, pray
Open the windows of Heaven on us
Today,
we pray,
Pour out Your spiritYour wonders on Earth

We come on bended knees
We bring an offering
Lead us in Your way, Everlasting
Every heart of every man Will pray
