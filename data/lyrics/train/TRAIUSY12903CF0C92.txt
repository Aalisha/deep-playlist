I, the vermin
The leader
The failure

Brother
I shall not weep
When you meet your doom
Not again shall I be your savior

This nation is moribund
You just can't see

Lose your soul or lose your life

In the name of Gallia
In the name of my tribe
In the name of my greed
I became the minion

In the name of the Gauls
In the name of the kneeled
...
