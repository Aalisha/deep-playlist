Sometimes you've got to take the heat
If you're gonna walk down on the mean street
Take the heat and you see it through

Do what you gotta do

Sometimes it goes right down to the wire
And you might have to walk through the fire
Walk on, boy all the way through
Sometimes it just comes down to
Do what you gotta do
