(J. Osterberg/D. Alexander/R. Asheton/S. Asheton)

So messed up I want you here
And in my room I want you here
And now we're gonna be face to face
And I'll lay right down in my favorite place
Yeah you know what that is

Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
(C'mon) (I wanna be your dog you know it)
