On my quest to find tomorrow, can you catch me to tame the ride?
I'm not fair about tomorrow, then you forfeit your own hand.
I see the light, I trail the light, I know the light
Can you will the right, as you place the time?
And you rules are blind, as you force me to loathe it'
I'm not wild about tomorrow, I just live for a moments time
Got this place inside tomorrow
I can't get there you know it
I see the light, I trail the light, I know the light
Can you will the right, as you place the time?
