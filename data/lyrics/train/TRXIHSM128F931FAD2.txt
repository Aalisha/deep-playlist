The nickel dropped when I was on
My way beyond the rubicon
What did I do?

And the games that I could handle
None are ones worth the candle
What can I do?

I'm a frightened, fickle person
Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin'
What should I do?

Oooh, after all the folderol
And hauling over coals stops
What will I do?
