Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie
Oh Maggie

Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to stop you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

The morning sun when it's in your face it really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to stop you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's a pain I could do without
