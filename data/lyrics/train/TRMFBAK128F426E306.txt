Taking it easy
Wasting my time everywhere I go
Then you try to please me
Telling me things I already know
Think I'm going on a vacation
Slippin' on my shoes
Do I need an explanation,
One that I can use?
But I know - That it shows - Here I go

Skatin'...Oh -
Skatin'...Over the water
Skatin'...Through my heart,
Through my heart I go
...
