[COVER THEIR EYES]
© Krista Detor, [Cover Their Eyes]

Somebody’s whispering behind the curtains
I am the seeker and they are all hiding
And out in the kitchen under the cupboard
Is my little brother, he thinks I won’t find him

Miniature bottles all stand uninspected
Right next to the beer steins my father collected
Dust from the curtains is snow in the air
And they are all hiding still, back behind there

CHORUS:
I count to a hundred, by fives to a hundred
In hallways and stairways they run where they will
And I’ve covered my eyes and I let them all hide
And in cupboards and curtains they’re all hiding still
...
