You're awake in your darkest dream
I have come for you
And nobody can hear you scream
When I reach for you

Don't you remember they're feeding your face
Before they have carved you in stone
And don't you remember your sweat and your pain
When you were drawn to the bone
When you were left on all alone

Living on a dream
Dying for an angel
Reach out, waiting for a miracle
No sign of wings, as you turn your back on me
Living on a dream

Lonely call to dial
Head up, feet down in the fire
Can I tell your gone
Dying for an angel
Everyday
