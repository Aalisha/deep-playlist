When you hit the dance floor you gotta be Jumpin Jack
(Jump on in, jump with your baby)

When you hit the dance floor you gotta be Jumpin Jack
(Jump on in, jump with your baby)

Like a wild train rollin right up your track
(Whoa Whoa, you just can't stop it)

Like a wild train rollin right up your track
(Whoa Whoa, watch it, watch it)
