Stand up
Like you mama said
You can be a mouse or
You can be a man

I don't have the time for
A little boy like you
Respect just ain't a word
It's something that you do

You need to prove
She's everything
She's a goddess and a queen bee
Show your loving boy and you'll be king

Come on!

Kiss your mama
Give me everything I'm waiting for
Kiss your mama
Show respect
Go and unlock the door
