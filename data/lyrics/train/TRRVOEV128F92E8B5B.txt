You’re watching everything you ever held on to
Slip away from you
And all you’re running from
Well, it’s catching up to you

Got you looking for a lifeline
Swimming in the high tide
Waiting for the daylight
To bring you home

The world is too big to never ask why
The answers don’t fall straight out of the sky
I’m fighting to live and feel alive
But I can’t feel a thing without you by my side
Send me out a lifeline

You’re watching everyone you ever belonged to
