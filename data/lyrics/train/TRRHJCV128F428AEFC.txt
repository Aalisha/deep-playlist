I believe in the things i see
and there's something ain't right
the reflection in your eyes
and a fire burning bright
when you come to me
in the night
and you're feeling down
will you come to me
in the night when there's
something that ain't right
I have seen, i have seen
so much hate in your eyes
i have seen, i have seen
and i only want to be a past of you
...
