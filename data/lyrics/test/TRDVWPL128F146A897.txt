You'll let me take you to the next level
Let your mind be free
Let your mind be free
If you wanna get with me
Simple as 123
Talkin 'bout ABC
Like it real nasty
If you wanna play with me
Oh boy don't waste my time

You can keep me on a chain
But I don't think you can take the pain
And all the things that I put you through
It just drove you crazy
Cos I'm so crazy

You took control and set me free (set me free)
Between the flame of you and me (you and me)
And even though I had it all (had it all)
I still reached out for more

Let your mind be free
If you wanna get with me (get with me)
Simple as 123
Talkin 'bout ABC (ABC)
Like it real nasty
