Flesh shall flay
Peeled back -- exposing the nutrients of contents of mammal
Nutritious, delicious fruit

The stratified-squamous: keratinized
Epithelia dissected
Pseudo-stratified columnar, uni-cellular goblets (cells) secreting mucus
Gored out

The flesh is ripened - ready to gorge
Visceral contents empty on the floor
Like a fine wine the organs disgorge
Victim lies begging but I'm wanting more
The pain is insane, a new anus is torn
...
