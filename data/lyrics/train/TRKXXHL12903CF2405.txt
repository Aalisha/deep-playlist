Tear a-way, from my life force
Torn a-way, from my existence
Take me away, from all reason
Tearing away.

How does a soul solidify,
And Create Destination!
With extasy comes agony,
But You Wont Mind A Ballance!

Must...
Must De...
Must Decide...
Must Decide Sacrafice!

Emotion Stands on High,
Living and Dying by the Sword.
Weight of the Risk is Great,
...
