You know we back right?
Clear the streets out
Come on with it
Ha ha Star Track

Niggas just hate us, I'm doing deals like the majors
Ice Cream Sneakers, I signed my first skater
So you can pay three and buy yourself some bapestas
Bulletproof on the T-shirts because they hate us

Dude like Snoop say, "Step ya game up"
Double the caboe, mediterrain up
D-Class action cuts, tuck your chain up
Liberachi fingers, niggas hit Lorraine up

Just last week, I was out in Aspen
Me and Puff hoppin' off the plane, both us laughing
A week before that, I was out in Italy
Attire heart throbs could not get rid of me

Up and down the tella crib, me and like ten hoes
Call from the cell phone, give me that enzo
I know what your thinking, yeah Me Too
Okay everybody meet Mr. Me Too

Been two years, like I was paddy wagon cruisin'
The streets was yours, ya dunce cappin' and cazooin'
I was just assuming you'd keep the coke movin'
But I got one question, fuck y'all been doing?

Pyrex Turs turned into Covalli furs
