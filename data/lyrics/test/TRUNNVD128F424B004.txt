Well, there ain't nothing to this but your daughter
And the life you would not give her break your plans
Traipsed across the continent a squatter
For your lies at night to sleep between my hands

When the lights come on, this whole place gets ugly
But when they're out, strangers fall in love
She could never say that flat out she don't want me
'Cause I could never say that halfway ain't enough

New Order's on the turntable, we're dancing
'Cause what else do you do when you don't talk?
Crucified to crawl into your mansion
Yeah, that's why I learned to crawl before I walked
