Heaven is a switchboard that you want to fight
She would even miss you if you taught her sight
Power politician leaning to the right
Baby's got a trust fund
That she'll want to go off like that
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack 

Now we wear same-colored yellow uniforms
Sky is burning, but at least we know we're warm
Go and run yourself a million miles
Hoping that the colors run out
And you go off like that
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack
