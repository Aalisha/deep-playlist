Going back to the memories
Reminiscing 'bout you and me
Thinking how it used to be
It's plain and clear I treated you bad
But, girl, you know that I care
Every relation have wear and tear
Just draw near girl and try to hear and listen
What my heart says
Many days and many nights
Many heartbreaks, many fights
Many wrongs but so many rights
So, girl, don't let this love die
Never meant to cause you no pain
Girl, I never meant to treat you lame
Gimme one more chance rewind come back again
Don't let this love die
Just cry baby cry
(Don't cry no more)
'Cause every tear that flows
Falls into the ocean
And rises to the sky
And then the rain will come
Right before the sun shines
Can you feel me reaching out to you
Girl, can you hear my open thoughts
Never want to disrespect you
Girl, don't let this come break us apart
