Oh oh. Yeah.
Shoo doo doo doo doo doo.

Last night I saw you out, hangin' with another girl.
Tell me what that's all about. You used to be my world.
Six days, seven nights since we tried to say goodbye.
But I'm still feelin' you. Can't get you off my mind.
And I tried so hard to fight, but I can't let you go. No way to deny it.

And I betcha she don't love you like I do.
And I betcha she's not givin' you all that you need.
If you don't remember let me remind you.
No one in the world will ever love you better than I do.
Oh yeah. Better than I do.

Don't even fool yourself. She'll never take my place.
Put her up back on the shelf. She'll never win this race.
Through all the ups and downs, I was always there for you.
And now you think you found somebody else that's true.
So what you did is better. Don't you know that I'm the one. I'm waitin' forever.

And I betcha she don't love you like I do. (Betcha she don't love you like I do)
And I betcha she's not givin' you all that you need. (All that you need)
If you don't remember let me remind you.
No one in the world will ever love you better than I do.
No way. She'll never take my place.

No one could do the things I do. I bring the lover out in you.
Deep in your heart you knows it's true. Better believe it.
You know that you should be with me. I got the lovin' that you need.
It's just the way it's gotta be. Can't you see it?
You know I treated you right. I know the things that you like.
And this much I know for sure that no one in the world could ever love you more.
Oh yeah. Oh oh yeah.

And I betcha she don't love you like I do.(Betcha she don't love you like I do.)
And I betcha she's not givin' you all that you need. (All that you need)
If you don't remember let me remind you.
No one in the world could ever love you better than I do.

No one could do the things I do. I bring the lover out in you. (Lover out in you).
Deep in your heart you knows it's true. Better believe it. (Better believe it)
You know that you should be with me. I got the lovin' that you need. (Lovin' that you need)
It's just the way it's gotta be. Can't you see it? (Can't you see it?)

And I betcha she don't love you like I do.
And I betcha she's not givin' you all that you need.
If you don't remember let me remind you. (Let me remind you)
No one in the world will ever love you better than I do.

And I betcha she don't love you like I do.
And I betcha she's not givin' you all that you need.
If you don't remember let me remind you.
No one in the world will ever love you better than I do.
