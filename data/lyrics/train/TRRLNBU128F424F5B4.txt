Rock and roll became my first impression
Before my lips could make a word
Those scratchy memories from those old "Sun" sessions
Are still the sweetest sounds I've ever heard

I'd tuck my radio beneath my pillow
So no one else could hear the minstrels play
I soared the heavens on a magic carpet
I'd catch the currents and drift away

Then suddenly I could be everything
I always dreamed I could be
Suddenly alone in my fantasy
Everything inside of me was singing

Music has no borders, no color, no creed
Music is the language of my soul
A technicolor vision on a black and white screen
It will always be, yeah
