Patiently I wait for you to come to me
Can't you see me breaking down
It's another day without sleep
It's another night without dreams, dreams

Full moon and my eyes are wide
I will wait for you till the sky turns blue
When the time is right

Make me dance, make me move in time
I can't go to sleep when I hear the beat
I come alive

Patiently I wait for you to come to me
