Descending upon convulsive... devourment
Visions of the war descend... they will be...
Extracted for the thirst... from the catacombs...
With spawns of hate; devourment

Forgotten filth, revile and devour... beyond divinity
The infected and fallen descend upon a dawning
Of vengeance, unleashed unleashed to infuriate the
XUL Gates released, swarm conjured give birth to this emptiness...
...
