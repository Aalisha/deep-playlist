A little love, a little life
A little love, a little life
Let it show
A little love, a little life
Let it show
A little love, a little life

I feel in my mind, I've got to let go, I've got to unwind
I need a good time, I need to find love, I've got to get high
I feel in my mind, I've got to let go, I've got to unwind
I need a good time, I need to find love, I've got to get high

You've got the passion to feel inside
A little love, a little life, now you decide
There ain't no reasons why we can't share
A little love, a little life can take us there

You've got the instincts and now you know
A little love, a little life will let it show
Just take a hold of what you feel
A little love, a little life will make it real

I feel in my heart, I want to let go and make a new start
I have got to break free, I've got to unwind, I've got to believe
I feel in my heart, I want to let go and make a new start
I have got to break free, I've got to unwind, I've got to believe
