Heaven knows I've changed
I couldn't be the man I was but I know
He's a part of my being today
and I'm dealing with my life of those days

In the back of my mind there's a taste that lingers
The burdens I buried
And I was too good to be bad, cos innocent like Jesus
All the reasons I've carried
And it was the bitterness of hunger for the things I've never had
I was fighting with a beast in my head
Heaven knows I've changed
Even god and love are not the same
I feel all my scares today
