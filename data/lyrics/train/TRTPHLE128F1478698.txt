Now listen to me now
My brothers and sisters
I beg you now listen to me now
Oh now listen to me now
My brothers and sisters
I beg you now listen to me now

They na be man
(Which man?)
Wey talk oyinbo well well to rule our land o
(That man!)

Oh yes

[Chorus]
Him talk oyinbo pass English man!

Him talk oyinbo pass America man
Him talk oyinbo pass French man
Me I say him talk oyinbo pass Germany man

The better oyinbo you talk
The more bread you go get
School start na grade four bread
B.A. na grade three bread
M.A. na grade two bread
Ph.D na grade one bread
The better oyinbo you talk
The more bread you go get
