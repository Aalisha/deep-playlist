Kiss me for old time's sake
Kiss me for making you wait
Kiss me for old time's sake
Kiss me for making you wait

Kiss me for screwing everything in sight
Kiss me for never getting it right
Kiss me goodnight

I've got to pick out what’s in the pocket
So I can leave those pockets clean
I've got to pick out what’s in the pocket
So I can leave that pocket clean

An’ I know that I will always want you
But there’s not much that I can do
I’m sweet, will always have to do
Rewind and give me a good clue

An’ I know just how your mind works
Open your eyes and watch the roadworks
Come on out it can't get much worse
Sit right down quench your big thirst
...
