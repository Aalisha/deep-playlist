All my thoughts and this confusion
Brings me down to this conclusion
That I'm a man of conviction

I've wasted time out of window panes
No place to go to recreate
The feelings that I have inside
When I spend time with You

We are never alone
Bringin' down angels today
His promises are true
He's always closer than we're far away

T-t-turn it up
I want to feel alright
