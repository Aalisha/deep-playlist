What the hell is your name?
And can you explain this mess?
It seems you're playing a game
Where you only know how to take out the best

Cause if assholes could fly
This place would be busier than O'Hare
There's proof in the sky
It's as thick as our skulls yet it's thinner than air

I have something to say
If the chip off your shoulder should fall to your chest
Get it off right away
Cause if you don't, then it won't be in peace that you rest

It's just a matter of time
That we all go away to a better place, I'm told
