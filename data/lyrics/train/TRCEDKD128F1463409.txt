The light of day is fading fast outside
I cannot hide the way I feel inside no
I learned to live with something I can't find
I will never learn
I will take my turn

I can't forget the things that you said to me
so deep inside my heart that can't break free

I can see your eyes
I can see what you're after
And it's no surprise to me

If you abandon me
Tonight will last forever
I'm stranded here inside this prison called my soul
If you abandon me
...
