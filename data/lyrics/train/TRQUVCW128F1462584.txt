I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
Yeah I should, but I can't stop
In all my dreams I've never found
Somebody like you

I know it's crazy, but I can't stop
Yeah I ought to, but I can't stop
When we're together I'm in heaven
I don't know what to do

I can't stop my lips when we kiss
We can't go on kissing like this
Wow!
