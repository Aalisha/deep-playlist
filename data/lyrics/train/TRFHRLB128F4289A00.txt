Listen
We don't call the shots here
We don't make the rules
We take what we get
Get what we can

That's learning the hard way
Here on the streets
You can't build a dream
Without a plan

(Passion speaks)
Let them hear you speak
(Play for keeps)
They play to win
We play for keeps

It's not over 'til it's over
It's not over 'til we get it right
...
