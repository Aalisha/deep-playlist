When the wind don't blow in Amarillo
When the moon along the Gunnison don't rise
And I cast my dreams upon your love
Lie beneath the laughter of your eyes

Snowin' on Raton
Come morning I'll be through them hills and gone
Snowin' on Raton
Come morning I'll be through them hills and gone

Mother thinks the road is long and lonely
Little brother thinks the road is straight and fine
Little darling thinks the road is soft and lovely
