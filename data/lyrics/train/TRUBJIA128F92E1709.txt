I hope you're feeling happy now
I see you feel no pain at all it seems
I wonder what you're doin' now
I wonder if you think of me at all
Do you still play the same moves now
Or are those special moods
For someone else
I hope you're feeling happy now

Just because you feel good
Doesn't make you right (oh no)
Just because you feel good
Still want you here tonight

Does laughter still discover you
