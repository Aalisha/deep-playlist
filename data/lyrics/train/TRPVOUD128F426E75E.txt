I'm not the man you want of me
I'm not the same I used to be
I think for myself now
I don't need you in my ear
I'd love to hit you in the face
I'd love to know you've gone away
I don't wanna see you again
I hope you can understand me

Get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
I don't understand why you think you
Can do the things you can't

So get out of my face
Get out of my sight
Get out of my head and give me back my piece of mind
My piece of mind

You're so mad 'cause your losing control
