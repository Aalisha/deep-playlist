(Kirsty MacColl/Johnny Marr)

I want to tell you something
It's not a secret or anything
You're not alone in being alone
At the end of a perfect day
And if you leave all your dependents
Then they will gain their independence
Don't make a martyr of yourself
It's just the end of a perfect day
And it's never how it seems
The rain may fall on the best laid schemes
But in a written testimonial I'd say
I never really knew you anyway

I want to tell you something
Now don't go crazy or anything
Just want to tell you that it's over
