Cheers then here's two old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And its not worth another try
Familiar place familar face
But feeling's not the same
Try to relive what we once did
Its just a silly game

Cheers then here's two old friends
We thought we'd never say goodbye
But those good times came to an end
And its not worth another try
...
