I started out to find my dream
I gave it all
But nothing worked 'till I found you
I knew I had to take a chance
I made the call
Sometimes you've got to follow through

Now as I'm standing here and looking at you tonight
I just know deep down inside that I was right
Our love is like a song
That we can sing together
Sometimes we get it wrong
It really doesn't matter
There's nothing else so true
As the melody in you
Just knowing that you're there
Just knowing we belong
Our love is like a song
