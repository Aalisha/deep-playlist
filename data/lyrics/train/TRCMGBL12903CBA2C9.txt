I lost my way, I did so much wrong
God, I need a friend to help me get along
I need my baby, gotta get her back
I need lady luck to get her from where I'm at

Gotta make it rain, million dolla baby
Make it rain, million dolla baby
Make it rain, million dolla baby
Luck be a lady, luck be a lady tonight

I lost my soul out on that road
Sat in the darkness, ain't leading me home
