We were waiting at the gates to the tick of the tock. Waiting for the train with the beat of the clock.
He was winking his eye down in the blotter as his face dissolved in the water.
He sliped down the tubes, sliped down the slide.
Swallowed him whole.
Now he's inside.
Running quickly by an intent look in his eye.
Run through the tunnels with colors passing by.
Enjoy a new glass of tea.
Observe this world you see.
Scenery is manifesting, its morphing fluidly.
