When the moon is full and burning bright
Comes a strange feeling
Something's watching in the night

I'm tossing and turning
In a cold and sweaty bed
I search for answers
To questions that are ringing in my head

Must I kill again tonight
How can I fight the Beast within
Must I kill again tonight
...
