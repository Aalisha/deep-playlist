I'm walking the thin line and I realize
There is only one way to go
A one way street back to hell

Well I can't go on
Cause the truth is mine
I could only wait
My heart beat's the rhythm of time
There's only one destiny

Watch me die again, I'm losing faith
There is nobody holding the flame

Feel the touch of the wing
Feel the eagleheart
Feel the look of his eyes
It takes me higher and higher
...
