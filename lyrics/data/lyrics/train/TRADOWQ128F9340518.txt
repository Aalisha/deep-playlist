I judge by what she's wearing
Just how many heads I'm tearing
Off of assholes coming on to her
(Each night seems like it's getting worse)
And I wish she'd take the night off
So I don't have to fight off
Every asshole coming on to her
(It happens every night she works,)
They'll go and ask the DJ
Find out just what would she say
If they all tried coming on to her
(Don't they know it's never going to work)
They think they'll get inside her
With every drink they buy her
As they all try coming on to her
(This time somebody's getting hurt).

Here comes the next contestant.

Is that your hand on my girlfriend?
Is that your hand?
