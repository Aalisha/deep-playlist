Sometimes,
I watch you when you're sleeping
I wonder what you're feeling
Both wide awake and dreaming
Of yesterday,

I want you,
To kiss away the tensions
Of issues never mentioned
With all the best intentions
But you turn away

Oh baby, if you find
I'm not the loving kind
I'll buy you flowers, I'll pour you wine
Do anything to change your mind
I know you may be disinclined
To find the love we've left behind
So kiss me, then make up your mind
I'm not the loving kind

I'd do anything
...
