1 for the beat
2 for the real
Right cats who never doubted I was dropping the skill

For all my peoples in NY and SA who blessed me
A gas face to all those who still wanna test me
3 for the fans who already know the name
4 smacks to all wack niggaz in the game
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 for the flows
'Ey yo Len, drop it to zero, this is how the story goes.

Drama, so close to not completing the missing piece of the puzzle
Quit again, in again, drop suit be following
Swallowing prod like porn stars and money shots
I'm hitting ya blocks, spinning as heavy as SUVs doing 360
I'm ready as ever, over due like the rain in New York
Sustained a steady fan base, but you still don't know me
Hold me in your highest regards, I'm your homie
I relate it's personal, nothing fake, read me - wait, I'd rather dictate it
Relay it to you on a deeper level
Kick off your shoes and light your
Ls and talk and get to know each other
I'm Jean, honorable team player for years
Emceeing on the low, in videos devoid of the hoes
For sho' it's crunch time, I'm the one they sent to piss your label off
They won't fuck with me, unless I'm parading and taking it off
Nah man, executives, con mans
This record is too hot to get pushed back another minute
