You and I headed straight into the west
Sun is rising behind we're heading straight into the darkness
And it's been so long since I've seen you
But I'm forced to stare at these lines
That are laid out here before me
Say you love me give me peace of mind

Chorus:
Straight into the darkness headed you and I
Straight into the darkness further into the night
But at least you are here with me
