Brewster 
Milburn 
Where are you going now, our Davey? 
Don't be late now, our Davey 
And all his friends say "Why do you act that way?" 
But all the boys say "You coming out to play?" 
And all the pretty girls they're singing 
La de da, de da de, da de da 
Davey boy is such a pretty little boy 
But don't you think about your mother, all alone? 
She's waiting for your call
