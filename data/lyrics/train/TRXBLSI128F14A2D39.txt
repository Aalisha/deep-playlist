I don't know what you might've been told
But the rumors are here
But my girl gets away
With a ball and chain

And I can't see what you want from me
We're runnin' out of time
That girl, she never tells me
Just what's on her mind

Oh, I've been tryin' for 28 days
To make things come out right
And she'll be cryin' for 28 days
'Cause I won't be home tonight

Well, I can't see or feel another deal
Unless you send it back on me
The things you do
...
