You know you're not a strong man
And you're just about to cry
Hang on . Hang on
It's alright... It's alright

You worry about the future
The sign said "Yoga Class for Cats"
It's okay . It's okay
It's no fun...

You're frustrated by the cracks
In the pavement
And every mother's back
Once again
The carnival closed down
...
