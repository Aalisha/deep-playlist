What did I say to ya, what did ya see me do
That made ya turn to stone overnight
I thought I played it right
Lovin' you deep in the night
The chain of love is broken now
Why can't we start again
Cause my heart won't mend
But you say no, then you go, and I break down

I'm still a lonely man burning in love
I'm still a lonely man burning in love

What did he say to ya
What did he promise you
...
