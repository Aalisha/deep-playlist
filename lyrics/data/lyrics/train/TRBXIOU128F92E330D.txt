I'm coming

Hunt me down, seek me out, bring your best
That's how I want it to be
Full of doubt, full of fear, all's unclear
It's over 'cause now I can see

Like a tank, seething strength, crushing all
Pulling you under my treads
Lost some years, lost some days, that's okay
I piss on what's in my way

Your two-faced abusin'
Mindless confusion, resolution
 (I feel I'm breathing my first breath)
Manipulation, dyin' salvation
You'll never rest
 (You can't kill what's stronger than death)

Your two-faced abusin'
Mindless confusion, resolution
 (I feel I'm breathing my first breath)
