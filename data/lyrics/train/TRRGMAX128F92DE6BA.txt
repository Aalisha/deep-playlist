I met you down at the Seventh Veil
The first night that I got out of jail
Your lips were red and your skin was pale
You were the one that I wanted to nail

Yeah.

I asked you for a table dance
You came over and put your hands in my pants
I ain't lookin' for no wild romance
but by the way: hey you got any blow?

Stripper girl
Heaven sent, pay my phone bill, pay my rent
Stripper girl
I love you, all my friends really love you too
I really love your boobies

I wanna love you til the end of time
I wanna love you in a 69
