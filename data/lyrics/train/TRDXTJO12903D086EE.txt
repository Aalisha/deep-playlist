Keep holding
Keep holding
You keep holding on
Keep holding
You keep holding on
Keep holding
You keep holding on
You keep holding on

Your not alone
Stay strong no time to feel weak
Wake up it's time to look deep
Don't wait to the end of time

Open your mind
Open your mind and see
Trust is there and the writing is read
Surely it's time to deal with me

Look I know the feeling
I know your deep in working it out but their aint no reason
And I know it's all deceiving
I promise you that I'm the air that your breathing
We're here with you
In the same pace as you
By your side
Believe it's true
We've got the clearest view
Hand in hand
Side by side
Not concerned about who's outside
Not alone we're all inside
Open your mind and rise
Open your mind and rise

Your not alone
Stay strong no time to feel weak
Wake up it's time to look deep
Don't wait to the end of time

Open your mind
Open your mind and see
Trust is there and the writing is read
