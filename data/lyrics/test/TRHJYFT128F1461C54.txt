Send up a smile for me, baby
I say to the rising flame
A dynamic woe blows in with the cold
And brings back the loneliness again

Your voice, it haunts my nature
With the words that I used to make you bleed
With one hand and my imagination
I thought I'd never need for anything

But my spaceship crashed against the wall
My neighbour's grass ain't so green after all
I wouldn't have a second thought about the fall
But I'm wondering who will love me in winter
