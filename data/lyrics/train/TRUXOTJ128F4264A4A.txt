There was a time when I didn't know if I would ever see a sign of real love,
Until I met you I didn't know about true happiness, about true devotion,
I could have a faith... a faith to move a mountain, but without love I'd be worth nothing,
I could give all my money away, but without love I would gain nothing,
I know that you're the main connection that can put me on the track headed in the right direction.

This is the way of love, this is the way of love,
There'll be no doubt about it, I know it's true,
This is the way... this is the way of love.

Love is patient, love is kind - that's the kind of love that you give me all the time,
I like a love that keeps no record of wrongs: loves me when I'm good, loves me when I'm not,
I know, whether night or day, I'll be waiting for the moment just to hear you say...
