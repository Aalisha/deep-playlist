Well well well

Taskmaster burst
The bionic zit splitter
Breakneck speed
we drown ten pints of bitter
we lean all day
and some say that ain't productive
but that depends upon the demon that you're stuck with
'cos right now
I see clearer than most
I sit here contented with this cheese on toast
I feel the pain of a third world famine
Segue
we count them blessings and keep jamming
'tis him
scumbag, scum of the earth
his worth was nil
until he gained the skill of tongues
from 15 years young straight to my grey back self
I stay top shelf material
Jerk chicken, jerk fish
Break away slave bliss
Generate G's and then we stash them in the Swiss
Fools can't see this
Audio pistols
a fistful of hip hop donzai
Progressin' in the flesh
Esoteric quotes most frightening
Duppy took hold of my hand while I was writing
