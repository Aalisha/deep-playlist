Where in hell did you go?
You left us all alone I wasn't even eighteen
You never turned around
Like some kid out on the run
You headed for the fun down in Biloxi
And the Gulf of Mexico

Chorus
Where I guess the girls they're pretty
And nobody says it's late
And you can stay out all night long and never have hell to pay
Down in Biloxi
Even when your 41
Just forget your problems down in Biloxi
...
