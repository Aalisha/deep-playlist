So kick it, so kick it
Oh oh, you got it
So kick it, so kick it
Oh oh, you got it
So kick it, so kick it
Oh oh, you got it
So kick it, so kick it
Oh oh, you got it

Don't turn around you're driving now
It's all allowed and double-checked
Make every second of it count

And then you take her out
And then you rise above
You're gonna make it up
