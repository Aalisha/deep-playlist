There I was completely wasting
Out of work and down
All inside it's so frustrating
As I drift from town to town
Feel as though nobody cares

If I live or die
So I might as well begin
To put some action in my life
Breaking the law, breaking the law

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
