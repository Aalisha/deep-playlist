I can save you
If you'd ask me, just ask me to.
There's hope for you tonight.
I can save you
If you'd ask me, just ask me to.
I can save your life.

I saw you move from across the room
and I knew who were you
You act like you are afraid of who you are
and I'm afraid for you.
Try, trust and believe in me.
I can show you that there's so much more.
There's still hope for you.
