Tell me was it worth it?
(Worth it all)
Tell me was it worth it?
(Worth it all)
Tell me was it worth it all?
Tell me was it worth it?
(Worth it all)
Tell me was it worth it?
Tell me was it worth it all?
(Worth it all)
Tell me was it worth it?
(Worth it all)

[Verse 1:]
Before you were no good.
You used to be so good.
And then you changed and flipped on me.
So tell me what's the reason all this time
you've been preaching, acting like you know
everything.
Look into my eyes... and tell me what you see.
Was what you got worth losing me?
Now all your lies has caught up wit your game.
It's a different picture, but in the same old frame.
Tell me was it...
