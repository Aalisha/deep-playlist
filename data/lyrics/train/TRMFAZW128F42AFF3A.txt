(Kent Blazy/Neil Thrasher)

I start every day with a smile on my face
And the feel of a kiss on my lips
When the world plays to rough I can find a healin' touch
Life's never been better than this

That's what I get for lovin' you
Heaven's right here in my hands
A dream that is real and a heart that beats true
That's what I get for lovin' you
