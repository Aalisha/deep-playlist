I thought I knew the girl so well
If she was sad, I couldn't tell
I missed the point, I missed the signs
So if she's gone the fault is mine

I know, I know
A whole lot of little things
And even though
I could list them 1 by 1
She would still be gone

Her eyes are blue, her hair was long
'64, she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song is 'In My Life'
I memorized her every move
