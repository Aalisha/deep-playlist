Lately I've been feeling strange 
Deep down inside
Something kinda hard to explain 
Like butterflies
Suddenly I'm only longing for the hot stuff
Something inside me tells me this is real
Now I've got the vibe tell me that's the same way you feel for me

Chorus:
So baby can you fix me
Cause my fever
Is only getting stronger
It's burning like a fire
Baby let's rock the night away

So baby can you fix me
Cause my body
Suffers from my hunger
A superstrong desire
Baby let's rock the night away

Verse 2.
