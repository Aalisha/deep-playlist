God I hate your needles and
Your dirty little vial of pills
I guess I love the sweat you put me through
I know I love your body
Like I used to love your mind
But now your soul's a slave
To all the things you use
I put you in the tub babe
With five big pounds of ice
If you don't get back up
I don't know what I'll do
I've walked around the room
Here nearly 37 Times
Can you hear me now
And am I getting through
