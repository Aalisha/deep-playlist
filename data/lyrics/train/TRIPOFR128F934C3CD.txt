Carnage formed rebirth
A sickened lust of hatred
Damned to an eternal plight
Obscene art alive through death

Crafted gore
Masterful slaughtering
Splatter soaked
Sinister demon incarnate
Maggots feast
Horrible putrid thing
One more piece
Scraped from bone, born of decadence

Created from decay
Cold innards used for torture
Prey sought by a twisted beast
Pray to hell no one survives
