Let's say I'm feeling better
Let's say I'm feeling fine
Let's say I gave you all I had
And now I'm out of time
And the best wasn't good enough

And now there's time to wonder
Now there's time to heal
Time to let it all come down
And i don't know what i feel

And it aches and it hurts and it burns
Oh it kills me

Tick, tock, you don't stop
You don't fade
You just stay
But I'll do it all again

Tick, tock, you don't stop
You don't fade
You just stay
But I'll do it all again

Now don't you call me baby
