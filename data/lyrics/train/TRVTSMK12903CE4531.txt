I longed for you since I was born
A man so sensitive and warm
And that you were

With pride and strength no one would test
But yet have masculine finesse
And so much more

You took me riding in your rocket you gave me a star
At a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world

You took me riding in your rocket you gave me a star
At a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back
down to this cold, cold world

Just like a Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best
...
