f/ E-Wreks, Wiz Gam

[6-Nine - overlapping chorus]
Don't let nobody else in this bull.
One two. one two.
Is this mic on?

[Chorus: RAM Squad]
I see nothin but gangsters up in here
I see nothin but ballers up in here
I see nothin but dough stacks up in here
I see nothin but flossers up in here
[6-Nine]Aaaah yeah!
[B Backs] We gon' mash it up
If you lames want war, we gon' blast it up
If you think you got bling, we gon' flash it up
RAM Squad/Universal gon' stack it up

[** extra before Tommy Hill **]
[6-Nine]Aaaah yeah!
[B Backs] We gon' mash it up
If you lames want war, we gon' blast it up
If you think you got bling, we gon' flash it up
RAM Squad/Universal gon' stack it up

[Tommy Hill]
Yo, I spit six million bars, had sixty-six cars
Got drunk in over thirty-six bars
Been in six shoot-outs, seven busters
Fucked up, five clutches, stick shifts I can't fuck wit
Had two rovers, had a land turned that over
