Summer's comin'
There're gonna drive us crazy
Let's go!
Oh yeah

When I saw him diving,
Diving deep into the deep end
I just had to ask my girlfriend
Who he was
She said I don't know his name
But, he's been sweating you all day
So maybe you should dive in
With him, girl because

Summer's here, the radio is playin'
All the songs we know
There're gonna drive us crazy
Ready set go!

Summertime guys
School is out, the sun is shinin'
Summertime guys
I think I wanna make him mine
Nothin' like the feelin'
...
