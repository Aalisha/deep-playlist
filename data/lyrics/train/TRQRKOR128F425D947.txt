The Arizona sky
The sky is bigger there
It took my breath away
That doesn't happen every day

Manhattan's music, man
On every avenue
You've heard no greater sound
Too much can get you down

Decorate, paint it for the union
No reason to give up on the illusion
Take confident possession of yourself
No reason to give up on the illusion

Venice is sinking fast
