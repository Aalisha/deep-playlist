verse 1:
im on dance floor
with my cup got a couple cuties
they got big old butts we feeling naughty
tryna miss behave looking for a freak they
welling to demonstrate holding dollar bills
get them off the ground its time for me to hit
get me off the mound hit me out of here
get some belvedere or some doogy houser and have wonder year

Hook:
now shawty dont say that you wanna the night
cause frankly we can get it in tonight
you know who you is a night full of shots
that mix shawt and jeremih


Course
now if you gone eat it ima feel you
on up and if you at a party gone throw yo hands up
man this party's jumpin bumpin jumpin man this
party jumpin bumpin jumpin

now if its 200 degrees and it aint
coming back down
now if you really wanna you do it right now
man this party's jumpin bumpin jumpin

Party stay jumpin don't nobody wanna leave

Verse 2:
Now you don't wanna leave
and its after 3
with the heat up can nobody breath
