You make it so easy to run
well I'm still crawling
I'm still crawling.
Now I'm game for the feeding chain,
and they're still scraping

Taking measures to see myself,
but I seem to forfeit all my findings,
it's not easy to take these steps
or to fake these breaths but urge is blinding.
And you can deny this,
but I won't let you,
