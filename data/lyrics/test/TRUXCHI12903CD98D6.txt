How many years has it been to this day,
We've known each other in so many ways.
Sometimes it seems so hard to agree
You said, I don't even know if you're listenen to me
Well, you're right! It's time for the Big Compromise.

They had to drag me kickin' and screamin'
Tomorrow's plans I may not believe in.
Still, all and all it's been a good run.
Maybe, too many heads are better than one.
