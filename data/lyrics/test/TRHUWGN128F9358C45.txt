ohhhhhh ohhhh
ohhhhhh ohhhh
ummmm
She's staring at me

I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Nobody's talking
Cause talking just turns into screaming
And now is I'm yelling over her

She's yelling over me
All that means
Is neither of us is listening

(And what's even worse)
That we don't even remember
Why were fighting
So both of us are mad for

Nothing
Fighting for nothing
Crying for) nothing

But we won't let it go for
Nothing

(No not for) Nothing
This should be nothing
To a love like what we got
Oh, baby, I know sometimes
It's gonna rain

But baby, can we make up now
Cause I can't sleep through the pain
(Cant sleep through the pain)
Girl, I don't wanna go to bed
