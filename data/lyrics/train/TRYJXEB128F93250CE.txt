Don’t stand too close to me
If you’re left alone with me, uh oh
And leave that door open
Get someone to keep us company

‘Cause I’ve been making up a list of things I’d do to you
As we both dance on either side of the room
But it’s too late I’d never say it, anyway I’m taken
And we’re both leaving with whom we came

Somewhere you’re sleeping it off, but I’m wide awake
Chasing a runaway thought
So come on, say it

You can feel it too, don’t hide you liar
Some kind of thunder inside
Don’t speak, don’t breath, don’t touch the fire
It’s gonna burn us alive

I know you can feel it too, I saw you liar
Setting off dynamite
One look, one touch, we won’t survive it
It’s gonna burn us alive
