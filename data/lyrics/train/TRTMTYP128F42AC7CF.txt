Well, I kiss the rain, I waited up
You're pouring dragons in my cup
Don't try it, I can't cope with it
We'll get over it, yeah I'm over it
I'm tired of night and I can't breathe
You blew me off so easily
It's different between you and me
And I'm over it, you'll get over it
Chorus
I'm not the jealous type that doesn't sleep at night
You got your karma, I know I got mine
And all of my tears will air dry with just a little time, Air dry.
