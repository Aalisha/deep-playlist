You know I need your love, you got that hold over me
Long as I got your love, you know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life, I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, woman, right down the line

I know how much I lean on you, only you can see
Changes that I've been through have left their mark on me
You've been as constant as a northern star, the brightest light that shines
It's been you, woman, right down the line
