Your smile cuts through a smoky room
Chasing silence from the air
Your empty eyes and hollow smile
Complement your vacant stare

There's something more
To stand on
Something of worth to live
Your life on

Higher ground, on higher ground
Build your house where love resounds
Higher ground, on higher ground
See your purpose from higher ground

Your determined words dance on my heart
...
