Outcast a time of war, where mankind lost control
Of life and death, under surveillance
I watch the children pray, while God just turns away
Our in the ruins they seek shelter

These streets were once my home
But those golden days are gone
Now I'm fighting to survive

Stone cold
Stone cold, man or machine
Stone cold
Stone cold, the end of our dream

The word is on the street, it's kill or to be killed
With no exception you are on your own
...
