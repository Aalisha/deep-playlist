If I could I'd tell you (I would tell you how)I feel girl, when I'm close to you
At times I'd wish that my (heart could tell you how)Much I love you, but my heart speaks in whispers...
If my heart could speak you'd know
Girl if my heart could speak you'd know
That I love you so (and I'll never let you go oh-no)If you can feel what I felt (just now, kiss me)To prove that your love for me is true
