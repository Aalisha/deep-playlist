Something breaks inside of you
with the spectacle of all the shows
with fifteen fights and your six bucks
has gone up some promoters nose
jaded eyes see clearly but only half of whats there
good old days are left behind whats left is boredom and despair
but sometimes every once in a while 
sometimes every once in a while 

It's beautiful what I would say, 
I wouldn't have it any other way
...
