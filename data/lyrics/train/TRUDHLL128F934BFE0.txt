I'm not much on mystery
Yeah, you gotta be careful
What you dream
I thought this might pass with time
Yeah, I thought I was satisfied

But oh baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
Baby let me tell you
I got a thing about you
It don't matter what you say
It don't matter what you do
I, I, I got a thing about you
