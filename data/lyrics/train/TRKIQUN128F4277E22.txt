When another midnight come to rest
On the cheek of our sleeplessness
All crusaders will wake and dress
Pull their flags from their pillowcases

Or a time for a new dress

How to live a noble life
In this the age of insanity
Where every promise faces turn and white
It's the look the look of can it be?
