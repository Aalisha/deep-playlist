If You Only Knew

Never, think just for shits and giggles
Do we spit syllable riddles for bits and kibbles
So chicks can wiggle and shake
Cuz this image is fake

AKIL
I'm trying hard to relate in a place filled with so much hate

MARC 7
No overnight success or running the bets
Just pure unadulterated work progress
I'm willing to bet the farm you'll give you right arm
For a piece of the pie ask yourself why

CHORUS
If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we've been through
But if you only knew, we real people homey just like you
