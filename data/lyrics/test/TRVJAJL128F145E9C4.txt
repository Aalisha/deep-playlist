So you think the areas are gray
But it continues each day
A bad example of the attitude you portray

Act like I owe you my life
You should be burdened with strife
Can't find a single reason I could live with you as my wife

So I continue to pray
And hope that you'll go away
A bad addiction to a home wrecking thing who plays

With my heart and that's the bottom line
I feel so empty now

What can you give me that I can't give myself?
Just what part of my life can you fix
That I can't fix my damn self
