Love ain't nothing
But a monkey on your back
No, love ain't nothing
But a monkey on your back
Well you better watch out boy
Or love will lead you down a one-way track

I found out that love ain't nothing but a word
Yeah, I found out that love ain't nothing but a word
I mean a crazy word I swear I wish I had never heard
