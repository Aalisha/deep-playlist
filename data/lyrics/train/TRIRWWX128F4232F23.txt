Lady don't take no shit insists on respect
The sister walks around acting womanish
She won't speak less it's something worth sayin
Don't play, girl take herself so seriously
People stare curiously
She got a natural way, her hips sway furiously, yet luxoriously
Carries herself like the cutest most purdiest
Thing I've seen, this side of the bay
Goes about her business so purpose-fully
Got razor sharp wit just won't quit
Flauntin it, body built like a house made outta brick
She got the smile, the style and finesse
Compounded with the blessed and profound intellect
Select few, have ever seen her butt naked
And they too wanna see the rep protected, cause...

She don't like violence
But she can throw them things,
Don't let your guard down
Her thighs are soft but her eyes are hard
...
