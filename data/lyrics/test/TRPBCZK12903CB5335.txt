One, one night in Rio, (in Rio)
Two, two days in LA (in LA)
We had a short, a short stop in Moscow
But there was no, (no…) no time to stay (to stay, to stay, to….)

We’ll had to meet this promoter in New York
So we met at the Hilton Hotel at the lobby
We said we have to leave immediately to Germany
So we hired a cab,
When I saw the cab I thought I’ll faint! because this little cab
Was jut a Mitsubishi, a shifted car,
I’m used to ridin’ limousines, luxury cars, with all my stuff,
a minimum one suitcase, two pairs of shoes and three backup singers
I’m used to this, I need this!

Anyway, this driver had no idea how to get to the airport,
‘cause at the 14th street he took a left turn, instead of a right turn,
and I was really mad at him which us:
Hey man we have to.. to be at the airport in a few moments!
So how hard can you do that!
‘cause the flight, leaves, to Berlin!

One, one fancy cocktail (in the sky)
Two, two pieces of lemon
Three, three crying babies (next to me)
And after four drinks, they wouldn’t serve me no more…
