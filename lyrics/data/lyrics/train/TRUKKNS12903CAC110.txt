Just why I stayed around
When all I found was heartache
I believed your every word
Didn't know the hurt and pain that you'd make
But why did it take so long
At last now I've seen the light
I've found the heart to say

No more the fool who waits around
Waiting for you to bring me down
Those days are gone now
No more the nights lying awake
Crying and waiting for the day to break
No more the sound as my dreams
Fall and hit the ground
While I wait around
No more the fool


You thought I'd break, then you were wrong
That I won't see what's going on
But I knew
Here I am, I'm alive
And you'll see I'll survive without you
And I won't be the one who comes running
It ain't like it used to be
...
