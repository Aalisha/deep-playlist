The prisons are empty, the homeless have houses
Nobody's hungry, nobody's poor
Nobody's judged by their faith or their color
Nobody's wrong in this world without war

We buried our souls, we don't fight anymore

You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move
If we loved, if we loved a little harder
Yeah, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved, if we loved a little harder
