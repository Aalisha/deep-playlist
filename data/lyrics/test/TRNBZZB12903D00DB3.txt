In the darkness I rise, long before 
The dawn 
I was dreaming of home and the life I 
Led 
I can hear the sound, of the engines

Where I'm safe (there I'm safe) 

But the call is clear, and the task is 
Set 
And my enemies wait in the dark sky 
Do they fear the same fear, 
Do they dream like us 
Do they long for the day when it's 
Over 
And they're safe 

We are cruising above the horizon 
Neve knowing if we will return 
In a moment we'll loose the
