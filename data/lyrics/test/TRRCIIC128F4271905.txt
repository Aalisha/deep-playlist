Bird flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by
You know how I feel
It's a new a dawn
And a new day
And a new life for me
And I'm feeling good
So good, yeah
Fish in the sea
You know how I feel
Rivers running free
You know how I feel
Blossom on the tree
You know how I feel
It's a new a dawn
And a new day
