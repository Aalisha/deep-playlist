You say you've seen too many things,
that turn out to be too good to be true.
Against your better judgment, opened up your heart,
'til you found the joke was on you.
Looking out on the rest of our lives,
If we're gonna be together or apart
About the only way I know how to come,
is right straight from my heart.
I want you now,
I'll show you how
I can be the man you need me to be
I've been around,
but now I've found
that you're the only one for me.
