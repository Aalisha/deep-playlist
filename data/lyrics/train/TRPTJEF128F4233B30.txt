No to violence.
Yagidi Yo.
Bad man over East and West and North and South.
Listen ever word from Anthony B mouth.
Yagidi Yagidi Yo Yagidi Yagidi Yo So me tell you.
Lock the gun dem.
Don't tek them out.
All the guns in Mi no want no guns out.
Yo lock the guns dem.
Don't tek them out Mi no want se no marrow jump out Yagga yo.
Repeat 1: Park up the pump dem and the Uzi and the shotti.
