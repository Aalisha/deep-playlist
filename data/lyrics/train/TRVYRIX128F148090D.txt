I've got the time
and you've got the space.
I'm gonna wipe you down
and lick the smile off your face, the smile off your face.
Tho we know that it's wrong,
towel sets,
matching combs.
Oh it looks so good but does it turn you on?
I want you now,
I want you here,
so lie down by the fire
and if the neighbours hear, the neighbours hear
Cos they don't understand
what you've got in your hand.
Oh it looks so good but does it turn you on?

Are we going to do it again?
Sideways.
I was stuck in the queue when you came.
Delivered me from his 'n' hers,
you pulled the units down.
Delivered me from his 'n' hers
and when I saw his face,
it made me feel better.
