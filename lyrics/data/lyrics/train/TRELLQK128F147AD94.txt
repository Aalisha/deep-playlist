Of all the boys I've known and I've known some
Before I first met you I was lonesome
But then you came in sight, my heart grew light
And this whole world seemed new to me

You're really swell, I have to admit you
Deserve expressions that really fit you
And so I've racked my brain, hoping to explain
All the things that you do to me

Bei Mir Bist Du Schon, please let me explain
Bei Mir Bist Du Schon, means you're grand
