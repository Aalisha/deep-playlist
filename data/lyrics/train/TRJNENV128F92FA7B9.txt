DJ Paul)
So this is what I'm a do man, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm a get each of you niggaz, you know what I'm sayin'
From the bay by the b-ball piece, when you see this nigga
You know what I'm sayin', I want y'all to whoop his bitch ass
Man you know what I'm sayin, beat his motha fuckin ass
To the ground like a motherfucker man fuck this bitch ass

(Juicy J)
See this how ass kickin' get down, your boys get
(Beat down!)
Your bitches get
(Beat down!)
Your brothers get
(Beat down!)
Your mothers get
(Beat down!)
Your cousins get
(Beat down!)
And any nigga that try to clown we leavin' em on the ground
'Cuz we stomp a hole, until his ass throw up, and after that
Them signs is gettin' thrown up, them hats is to tha right them hats is to tha left, we snatchin' your chain and check
Your pockets 'till nothin' left
