I won't be neglected
I won't be denied
The pleasure of your kisses
The pleasure of your smile

I think you take for granted
I'll always be here
Just because I love you
It doesn't mean I won't disappear

CHORUS
Been so long . . . of missin' you, baby
Been so long . . . of missin' you, baby

Thoughts and mellow memories
Of once upon a time
Slowly creepin' on me
And they linger on my mind
...
