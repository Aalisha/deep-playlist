Hey man can you do me
A favour of a grand nature
Break into my house
And pack up all my stuff
And send it to me
Send it to me
'Cos I'm never comin' back
No never comin' back

'Cos I'm so disappointed by the visions of this man
So poor at heart
Now I know where I stand
I'm so disappointed by the visions of love
The visions of the love that I've been dreamin' of
The visions of the love that I've been dreamin' of
