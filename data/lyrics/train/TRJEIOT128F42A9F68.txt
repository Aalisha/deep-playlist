The way your mind works
Drivin' so fast, carving your way
Through the city

Well, you can't tell me
You get what you want
You've figured it out
And you're just fine

'Cuz you're talking to yourself
You don't hear a thing
And all history unfolds before you

But you shut your eyes
But you shut your eyes
...
