[Darien Brockington]
I tried and tried my best to keep you waiting
But curiosity has got my heart for sure
And if by chance, this is a chance we're taking
I really wish that you would let me know and
Call... call...
Call... (all you do is)
Call... call... call on me
I tried and tried my best to go without you
But this is something I know we both want to see
Loneliness kills me, lady forgive me
