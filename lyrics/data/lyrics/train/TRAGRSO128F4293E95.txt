I thought about calling you when I got off the plane
Everytime I see this city through the clouds, I get that way
Call me crazy for missing you like this, but I do
By now, I figured you had all your numbers changed
It's been at least a year, since I called you up to say
We need to talk, I got this job and I think I'm going to take it

Cause I been waiting all my life
For a break like this
It's my chance of a lifetime, I just know it is
I gotta go find these dreams
Was the last thing that I said
