Take me to the temple, where the gods are always near
I am only satisfied if you don't fail
Take the stones; collect them all, you shall have no fear
You are the only key to free me now, so

Faster even faster, you must be faster now
I am only satisfied if you succeed
So take me to the temple where my cure is more than near
We are almost there, so you just have toâ€¦.

Ride
Into the night
I'm so near and this time I'll survive
Survive
Out to the light
Prepare to great fight, cause

This time will soon be over, so you must be quick
Together we can end this war eternally
I will fight forever to find a way is there
This place where I am is too empty for my soul
