You look around, you say what's up
You see another Irishman taking to the 'sup
You see that's the way
That's the way they came

You look around, you say what's up
You see another Paddy and he taking to the 'sup
You see that's the way
That's the way they came

Take me out on the jar today
We'll drink stout and we'll be okay
We might get out of our holes tonight
We'll get in a fight, alright
