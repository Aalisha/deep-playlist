Tonight's the night that we got the truck
We're goin' downtown, gonna beat up drunks
Your turn to drive, I'll bring the beer
It's the late, late shift, no one to fear
And ride, ride, how we ride
We ride, lowride

It's roundup time where the good whores meet
Gonna drag one screaming off the street
And ride, ride, how we ride
...
