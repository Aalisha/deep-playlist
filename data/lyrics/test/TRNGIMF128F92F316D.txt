Let me tell ya 'bout the birds and the bees
and the flowers and the trees
and the moon up above
and a thing called "love"
Let me tell ya 'bout the stars in the sky
and a girl and a guy
and the way they could kiss
on a night like this
When i look into your big brown eyes
it's so very plain to see
that it's time you learned about the facts of life
...
