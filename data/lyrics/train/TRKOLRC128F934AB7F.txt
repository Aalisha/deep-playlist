Speed Freak

Get me to that show on time
Think I'm bout to lose my mind
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Drivin' like a maniac
Capable of heart attack
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
Unyielding is what i am
I don't really give a damn
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!
I've a lethal tendancy
Like no other you have seen
Speed Freak!
Speed Freak!

[Chorus]

Driving hard
Power mad!
Wheels don't stop
