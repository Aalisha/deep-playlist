Early in the morning when the dew is on
Each and every rose bud you will find me gone
So knock me down and pick me up
And knock me down again
Break my heart steal my gold
And slander my good name
Seven lonely hours on the morning train
Takes me to a place where I won't come back again
Seven lonely Pullmans speedin' down the line
Takin' me away from an old love of mine
