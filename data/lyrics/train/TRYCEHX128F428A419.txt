I remember there were 
Fights and screaming in the streets that night 
I had to run from the 
Insinuations all about my life 
It didn't matter I was 
Armed and ready I was on the run 
Up in the mountains I've got 
Food and shelter I'm a loaded gun 
Steal away into the hills 
My world is turning 
Secrecy becomes my mask 
My cloak and dagger 
...
