It's the simple things like the robots Stevie G draws
And the ease with which we seem to pull those tricks
There are moments of escape for every one of us
And the beauty in the times that we create

I saw you smiling...
And I need my vehicles and animals
And I will be alright
Take me back to nineteen seventy nine
So I can find my open eyes

He can play all by himself for many hours
I have never seen a kid who's so content
There is nothing from the outside that can touch him
'Cause he's just learning how to be alone with one
