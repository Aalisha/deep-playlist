Oh Love, Well We Finally Made It
Barry White

Hey you know I don't really give a damn
If it would have took forever
I would have waited baby
And waited,
And waited,
And waited...(Fading out)

I, Ohyea

I think that everthing will be alright
(all right)
We'll have to work our sweet love at night
(at night)
Ah, the two of us in love together
In short, now and forever
...
