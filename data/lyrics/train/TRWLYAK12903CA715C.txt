A space between three transverse lines
That move toward a point sublime
Each in it's turn each turn in time
First one before then one behind
We lift the bell across the chime
The watcher sees with watchman eyes
Each in it's turn each turn in time
First one before then one behind
We shield the soul with faces cold
To feed the young we eat the old
Each in it's turn each turn in time
First one before then one behind
The grave is waste hear people cry
