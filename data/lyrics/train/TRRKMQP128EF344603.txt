one day they'll pay to know your name
but you'll be dancing in the rain
you touch your heart to feel the beat
must take precautions in the street

and all it was to know you
ten seconds that I owe you
will it be coming round again?
just time to share a cigarette
I promised I would not forget
I'd like to see your face again
my friend
