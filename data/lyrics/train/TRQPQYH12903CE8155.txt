It's snowing on the west side
Let me take you for a ride
I'll be Bonnie and you'll be Clyde
See if we can get ourselves killed
Before we die

And we will drive like bandits
On the Queensway
We'll hold hands like in the movies
I'll say 'oh Clyde you drive me crazy
And you'll just capture me like it was
Armed robbery.
