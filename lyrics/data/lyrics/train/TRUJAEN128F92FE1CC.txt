Baby oh baby
Tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind
Well let me run on out and tell the cab to keep his meter flying
Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind

Break my mind
Break my mind
Well I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine
Break my mind
Break my mind oh lord
