Black eye date tonight
With what's left of my life
'cause I've been living like
I'm staring death right in its eyes
And it stares back at me
And whispers in my ear
The way you're living now
It wont be long 'till you'll be here
Hey death, i don't know much and this may sound trite
But what the fuck is wrong with life
A broken generation that's fantasized
...
