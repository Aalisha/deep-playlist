Well, I've been gone for so long, feels so good just to get back home
Back to my friends and all the faces I love to see
Like a rainbow in the sky, a certain twinkle that's in her eye
Telling me they believe in what I am, and what I want to be

Don't it make you wanna dance? Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down, down, down in the country could you sing a while
Don't it make you wanna dance? Don't it make you wanna smile?
When you're down, down, down in the country could you sing a while
