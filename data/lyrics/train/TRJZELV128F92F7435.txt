Every time you love just a little
Take one step closer, solving a riddle
It echoes all over the world

Every time you opt in to kindness
Make one connection, used to divide us
It echoes all over the world

Ahh, ahh, ahh

Every time you choose one more morning
Goodness or meanness, life has one warning
It echoes all over the world
