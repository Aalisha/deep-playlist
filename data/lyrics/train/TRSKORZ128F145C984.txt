Now the night train is waitin' to take me away
And I'm still feelin' guilty cause you're wanting me to stay
Well I know, how I know, it's harder on you
But you said it yourself, there's nothing else we could do.

When the wheels start turnin', takin' me through the night
Out there in the darkness, there's a star shinin' bright
And it makes me feel better just to see it up there
I hope you're thinkin' about it, hope you know I still care.

So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home
So goodnight, yeah goodnight
Goodnight train is gonna carry me home.

Now I know you've been waiting, but I'll be seeing you soon
Meanwhile I just lay here staring at the moon
And a light made of silver, through my window it creeps
And the train keeps on rollin', and it just rocks me to sleep.
