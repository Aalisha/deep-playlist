A young man drivin' down a dusty road
Like he's got somewhere to go
Driving like he's got a destination
Like he's got somewhere to go in that beat up ford

See there was a time when he was a young lost soul
He was chasin' butterflies and rainbows
Until one day when he found his pot of gold
In the words of a young man who turned old
And the old man said

Chorus
You gotta have a good imagination
If your gonna live a life of hope
...
