Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is the new bird
He's singing our song, as we go along
Walking in a Winter Wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
