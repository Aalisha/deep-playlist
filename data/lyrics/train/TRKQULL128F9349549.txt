You can dance
Every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight

You can smile
Every smile for the man who held your hand
'Neath the pale moon light

But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me

Oh I know
That the musics fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
