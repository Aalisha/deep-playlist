For as long as I can remember I've worked down in this pit
But today it's all over for this is the day I quit
I'm gonna take my sweet little Ginny and make her my own
We gonna move down in the valley and built ourselves a home
This is the last day in the mines

I can hardly wait for my boss to tell me that it's time to go
