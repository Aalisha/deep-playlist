Two in a row is a line
Two in a row is more than fine
I can't say no
And you cannot say yes
We have to kill hollywood me
We have to kill hollywood you

Yesterday yesterday

Memories and fantasies are to be seen as enemies
To look at things the other way around
Will do as good we'll take us further from hollywood
I was afraid to move on when I dested
