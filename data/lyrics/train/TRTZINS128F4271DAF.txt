Tied my baby to the railroad track
Train rolling down the line
Givin' that woman just one more chance
To give it to me one more time
Engineer wishin' he was home in bed
Dreamin' about casey jones
Wide-eyed woman with a hole in her head
Crying over broken bones
It's your love that i want
It's your love that i need
It's your love got to have
Baby it's your love

Everybody flying across the sky
...
