We ain't got nothing to fear
I ain't got nothing to hide
I wanna live in the truth
I wanna live in the light
All this material excess
Is just our fear covered up
There's no such thing as success
Unless you're living in love

Love's the solution, all they got is problems
Global prostitution, modern city Gotham
Drugs and pollution, God's kin forgotten
Now's the revolution, stand act stop watching
Love's the solution, all they got is problems
Global prostitution, modern city Gotham
Drugs and pollution, God's kin forgotten
Now's the revolution, stand act stop watching

Come out of your mind, go leave it behind
