Slim Thug)
You need to stop playing round with all them clowns and the wangstas
Good girls gotta get down with them gangstas
Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it
[Chorus]
Ohh Boy you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over check up on it, I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twirk it, stop it, check on me tonight
If you got it flaunt it, boy I know you want it
While I turn around you watch me check up on it
Oohhh you watchin me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin, you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin, I might let you have it
You think that I'm teasin, but I ain't got no reason
