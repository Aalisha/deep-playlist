He was a King without a crown
They hanged Him on His throne
And nailed Him in the ground
The prophet He upon the tree
Sacrificed Himself for the whole world to see

He bled for you, He bled for me
On that day, that day at Calvary
It was a day, forget I never will
It was the day the earth stood still

It was for real upon a hill
The Savior gave His life so you and I could live
He had to die to pay redemptions price
It was the only day the Angels ever cried

He died for you, He died for me
That lonely road on His way to Calvary
