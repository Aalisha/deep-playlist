SHADOWS COME AND GO
BLUE SKIES TURN TO GREY
BUT I WON'T LET THAT STAND IN MY WAY
YESTERDAY'S BAD NEWS
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU
SUNSHINE'S NEVER FAR AWAY

THE LOVE, THE LIGHT
THAT SHINES WITHIN YOUR HEART
LIVES INSIDE OF YOU
AND THE WHOLE WORLD IS IN YOUR HANDS

THE LOVE, THE LIGHT
THAT'S BURNING BRIGHT IN YOU
