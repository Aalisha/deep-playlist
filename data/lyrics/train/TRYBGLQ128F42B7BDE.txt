Open your eyes, there are only murderers in this room, this the life we chose the life we lead, and theres only one garantee, non of us will see heaven.

40 cal. Verse one

They call me 40 cal. see niggas try to conceal me,
In the court of law, if you touch me your guilty,
Now your finger prints filthy, your guilty your charged
This is grown man shit, for the realest of squads...

See my hood is a jungle, the block is a zoo,
Im down da block from 40 wolves, and da tigers and drew,
Cops bring gorilla warefare wit snipers on roofs, rifles to shoot, knifes in dey boot,
Oh yeah its real homie,
And ill show you how dirty yo boy work,
Ill make his blood splatter,
Now you gotta dirty boy shirt, Churp.
Get more dirty wit em, if i heard he snitchin,
Ill give his face a double-chopp like a dirty kitchen,
Na dats keepin it hood, yeah i be ina hood,
Wit other street thug, be misunderstood.
