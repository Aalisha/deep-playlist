I'm a soul-dier and I fight, fight, fight, fight, fight
And I fight for my rights and my music's my own right
And my love's in you, night is over

Don't you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Don't you lie about your life?
Gotta live, don't look behind
Gonna fight for you

No need to tell you
I know that you can feel me

I'm king in my life and my music is my life
So I fight, fight, fight, fight, fight and I fight for my love
Just for you

I'm king in my life and my music's my own right
...
