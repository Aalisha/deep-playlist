It's true I hit the streets tonight
It's true I drowned my soul tonight

I drowned my life
I drowned my
I lost my pride
I lost my
I drowned my love
I drowned my
I lost my hope
I'll leave today
I walked away

I threw it all away
I walked away
I lost my faith today
I walked away
I gave it up today
Just walked away

I know you told me a million times
I know I've left you in the lurch again
