If you're feeling down gonna try and move your soul,
C'mon gather round everybody lose control
So c'mon everybody move it,
We got the music, so why don't you use it, c'mon and use it,
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon get it right, we're gonna make ya boogie tonight,
If ya feel alright, y'all gonna boogie all night.
