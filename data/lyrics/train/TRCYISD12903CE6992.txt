This is a man's world, this is a man's world
Wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl

You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
And man made them trains to carry the heavy load
It's a man's world, man's world
Wouldn't be nothin' without a woman or a girl

Man made the electric light to take us out of the dark
And man made the boat for the water like Noah made the ark
