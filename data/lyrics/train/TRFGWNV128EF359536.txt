Rhymefest: I think I'm ready to do some type of report
Anthony Hamilton: Tell me what you really want, look at how lovely What they don't know it's 'bout to get ugly
Rhymefest: From the East to the Midwest
Lemme tell ya how we do it here
You know I'm shot till I'm down
And I'm loving the spot
But when I'm in here why they say the clubbin is hot
They say
You could meet a broad
Take her home on the spot
And that broad could get a broad
Bring 'em home with his watch
They say Club Cheetah
That's the place rah niggas getting shot in their face
We get his central fly
Long get his chicks to fly
I need some head no time to waaaste
Who that DJ be
They said Ronson
Step in the club with one hand on mah Johnson
That Midwest attitude get him responding
Talking 'bout oooh Zack Chin is so charming
Yeah, you wanna dance chick, let's go
Glowsticks, Lollipops, right foot, left toe
Looked around the room
I aint see no Negroes
Like ahhh niggas don't listen to techno
Slow it down now
