featuring Destruct Fat Joe 
 
 [Forte' Chorus] 
 
 They Got Me killin with them 
 They Got Me sinnin' with them 
 Smokin' drum holdin' arms bustin' guns with them 
 
 They Got Me fearin' the pen cuz I don't want to go in 
 It's going on and n on and n on again! 
 
 [Forte' Verse One] 
 
 Yo Call my lawyer 
 They ran up on me son ain't nothin' for ya 
 Two shots my allabies I'm with Joe and De La Hoya 
 Fight on ran up in the crib and turned the lights on 
 Yo get this, Mothafucka! I don't leave no witness 
 Like Larry Fishburne, I'll meet in Hawthorne, pushin' lefts 
 With no signal light on, yo word bond, I know the shit's on! 
 Called Don Cartagena from the Pilan 
 Yo be war, lawyers and attorneys trying to hurt me 
 Indeed I, feel stressed 
 Clutched my shorty's chest smokin' C.I.'s 
 Truth or die, shoot the five, uncivilized to B.Y.'s 
 Muffled lives, like a pit bull at will 
 Sit still, or you're shook real, y'all niggas need to get real, or get killed! 
 The 4-fifth, call the men still, alcohol's never distilled 
 A hundred proof vest, bulletproof! 
 
 [Forte- Chorus 2x] 
 
 [ Fat Joe - Verse Two]
