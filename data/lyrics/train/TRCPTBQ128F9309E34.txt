Did you think that I've been foolin' around
As I'm wanderin' from town to town
Asking you to wait, wait for me

Don't you know you can't believe all that you've heard
I know it's rough when all you have is my word
Asking you to wait, wait for me

But I've been waiting, I've been waiting, I've been waiting, yeah
I've been waiting, I've been waiting, wanna know if you'll wait for me too
I wanna know if you'll

Wait for me, wait for me
Wait for me, wait for me
