What will you say when you reach your moment?
Meanings are really hard to find
To look for a way or a reason to be alive
How can you win when all things around you will be gone
I just want to know why
I just want to know how
I just got to know why

[chorus]
So tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reached for the stars?
Tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reached for the perfect sunrise?
They just left their dreams behind...

Guardian angels have been left abandoned
When everything is said and done
(in the land of the of the brightest sun)
Look for new hopes or dreams to conquer
How can you see them while you live for the day
