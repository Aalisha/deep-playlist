I'll try, she said, as he walked away
Try not to lose you
Two vibrant hearts could change
Nothing tears the being more than deception
Unmasked fear
I'll be here waiting tested and secure

Nothing hurts my world
Just affects the ones around me
When sin's deep in my blood
You'll be the one to fall

I wish I could be the one
The one who won't care at all
But being the one on the stand
I know the way to go, no one's guiding me
