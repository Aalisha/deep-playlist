Last night i felt a wind
Of change blow through me
It spoke of a million things
Before i die i should see
Open up your eyes

Life is poetry in motion
Late for the open sky
I'll be ok as soon as i'm on my way
'cause i am a song and dance man
I am a song and dance man
That's what i am
A song and dance man
