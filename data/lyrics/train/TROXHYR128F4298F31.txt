"On The Ropes" - The Wonderstuff
The new single! Finally!
Take these words and stick 'em in your head
Now roll then 'round until you can't forget
What's said
Take this time to lie about everything
About who you are and who you've been
Don't let the world get in
It's happened to me
It won't happen to everyone
