BBQ food is good
You invite me out to eat it, I should...
Go, but I'm feeling kind of nervous
And not quite myself
So I'm running late on purpose
And I know this wont help
How things have become between us
But if I go you'll give me hell
And that I dont know how to fix it
Is making me unwell
Well

I arrive at your house
But you've just got up
And you are wearing a towel
And your eyes look dark
I help to dry your body
And I see your cut
So I give you a plaster
And we cover it up
I say "Have you been crying?"
And you say "Shut Up"
So we sit in the garden
And touch the grass
With our hands

The sun is going down now
And it's been okay
...
