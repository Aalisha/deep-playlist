I'm thinking about other things I heard about today
All this week and tomorrow
And how these hands could create some better things for bettering
But you see for now I got my own things
I can't help it
I got too many issues I own
So I cannot help I'm afraid, yeah
But keep on preaching, preaching and heal the world
Lip service makes us look great

Do you feel
The weight of the world singing sorrow
Or to you is it just not real
Cause you've got your own things
Yeah we all have our things I guess
