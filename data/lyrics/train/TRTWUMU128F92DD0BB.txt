What did close in here?
I can't remember ever shedding tears o'spite
On this ground, cropping up the fatal frontline

Legions delineate an ominous skyline

As lifeless demons without soul
These insentient hosts abide
Engulfing war monger get away from here!

Trod ye the path of vast deceit?
Every piece of evidence was a lie
