Livin' is dyin' 
'Cause love you've left me cryin' 
Now there's no use tryin' to go on 
 
Each night I dream baby, pretendin' 
There'll be a happy endin' 
Burnin' down deep inside 
Got a heartbreak that I can't hide 
(Down inside, deep down inside) 
 
I'm not The Proud One, I need you 
I'm beggin' to you baby, please 
You're The Proud One, believe me 
This poor man is down on his knees 
...
