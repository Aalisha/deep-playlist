Wheels turning for the yearning, the burning that I feel inside
It's turning me around upside down, can't control it though I try

Just one moment away is too far away from lovin´ you girl, uh baby
just one moment away is too far away from lovin´ you girl, hey

Imagination, concentration pure delight all through the night
A world of ecstacy has taken over me, just don´t hurry mornin´ light, hey
