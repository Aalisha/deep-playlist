Two days' double, stayin outta trouble
gather in a huddle, tryin to keep a hold o' your man

Look what your given, nothing forbidden,
who you kiddin, now that's livin it fine

And it's not too late, Let's make up like we were best friends,
Then break up in the bitter end, and I'll throw it all away

Our sweet Jesus, will Heaven save us?
Lifted heart but you'd hardly blame us
Broke the mold when we stole the show,
No regrets if the truth be told
