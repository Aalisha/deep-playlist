I'm all alone
you're far away
Never learned from my mistakes
I should have known
Just what to say
To make you want to stay
You were always the one giving
I was always there to take it
Take your heart and break it
Ohhhh

(Chorus)
And I'll never make it without you
I need a second chance
Cause I want to make it about you
I'm making my last stand
It took a moment to say
It wasn't you it was me
