All these graycoated mornings pass
just like water poured on wax
you watch the sun make another lap
then fall into this gap of nothingness
where everything's prefab and everything's dead
and every little thing get's inside your
head
as you watch these graycoated mornings
pass
and it feels just like you feed on broken
glass
