I rode across the great high plain
Under the scorching sun and through the driving rain
And when I set my sights on the mountains high
I bid my former life goodbye

And so thank you, man, I must decline
For it's on my steed I will rely
And I've learned to need the open sky
I'm subject to the natural forces
Home is where my horse is

We loaded up in Buffalo
Took 90 south down to Ohio
On 80 west, I'm Frisco-bound
And when I get there, I'll turn back around

And so thank you, man, I must decline
For it's on these eighteen wheels I ride
I've learned to need the western sky
...
