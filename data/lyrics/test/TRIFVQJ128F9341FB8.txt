I know a girl with a golden touch
She's got enough, she's got too much
But I know you wouldn't mind
You could have it all if you wanted
You could have it all if it mattered so much

But then all they know is how to put you down
When you're there, they're your friend
But then when you're not around
They say, "Oh, she's changed"
You know what they mean
Well they mean, they're just jealous
Because they never do the things
They wish that they could do so well

The kind of girl, yeah she's never alone
You leave a thousand messages on her phone
But you know you never get through
You could have it all if you wanted, yeah
You could have it all if it matters to you

But then all they know is how to put you down
