I don't leave any room for doubt, when it comes to you and me
You know all about the way I feel inside
You know how hard I tried but that don't mean that I

Can't love a little stronger, dig a little deeper
Go a little farther anything to please you girl
Tonight im gonna start all over
Show you girl what's in my heart
Ohhhhh gonna love a little stronger

You tell me you're the lucky one but I see things differently
I have just begun to show that you mean everything to me
