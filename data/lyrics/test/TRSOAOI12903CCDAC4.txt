Premise to interlude
Wait till all bones pretrude
You're convexed, you're convert
There is a stain on your shirt

Semi-sweet, semicide
The remorse you can't hide
Now we molt, past our skin
And make room to begin

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy
Empathy, empathy, empathy

Symmetry
You must work in symmetry
You must earn their empathy
Empathy, empathy, empathy
...
