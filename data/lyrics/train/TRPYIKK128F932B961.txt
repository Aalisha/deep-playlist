Who killed John Henry, In the battle of sinners and saints
Who killed John Henry, In the battle of sinners and saints

Take this hammer carry it to the Captain, Tell him why i'm gone
Take this hammer carry it to the Captain, Tell him i'm goin' home

I don't want your cold iron shackles around my leg
I don't want your cold iron shackles around my leg

Who killed John Henry, In the battle of sinners and saints
Who killed John Henry, In the battle of sinners and saints
