The sky so blue above while you remain,
i bet every place you go its just the same.
Its gonna turn to black
if you dont come back again soon
Yea I count the nights and days
I cant wait to see you
To light me up just like a flame
and I wont go out again.

The sun burnt down
on your home town i know,
and its shining down
on you where ever you go.
its gonna rain both night and day for way too long,
...
