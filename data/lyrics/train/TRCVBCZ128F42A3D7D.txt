Common baby...
The alarm goes off and I smell the morning coffee
I hear your shower running, here goes another day
So I get up, pull back the shower curtain,
Climb on in baby, let it rain

Yeah, I got a million things to do and I know you do too
Call your boss, I'll call mine, got some lovin' that's overdue
Follow me, take my hand, the bed's still warm
Leave this busy world outside and get lazy with your love
