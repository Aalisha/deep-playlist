And the death of the atmosphere
They all stood and rolled.
Kicking one another
Calling out names
And crying about they don't know
Woahahoah, ohoahoahoh.
I'm alone I know it
I'm alone if I show it.

So army men, pick up your feet
We cannot settle for a quick defeat
Don't dare cry.
So lose some battles but win out of war
...
