What if there's nothing more to me?
I'm just skin and bones, there's no mystery
What if you're just an empty shell?
All your spare parts were used up by somebody else

What if there's no way to explain things
Like d√©ja vu and acid rain?
What if we're all just broken shells
With someone else's thoughts?

Will we be alright left alone tonight?
Will we be alright left alone tonight?

What if there's nothing more to us?
We're just carbon based, we're just pixie dust
What if life is a magic trick?
Some quick slight of hand just to make us think

What if consciousness can expand
And we fool ourselves with absurd demands?
