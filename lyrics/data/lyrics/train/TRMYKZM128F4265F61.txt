Come On Eileen
Come On Eileen

Poor, old Johnnie Ray
sounded sad upon the radio
he moved a million hearts in mono
our mothers used to sing along
who'd blame them?

You've grown, (your grown up)
So grown(so grown up)
now I must say more than ever
(Come on Eileen) Toora Loora Toora Loo-Rye Aye
And we can sing just like our fathers

Come on Eileen, oh I swear (well he means)
At this moment, you mean everything
you in that dress, oh my thoughts I confess
Verge on dirty
Ah, come on Eileen
