I'm breakin' out all over, (breakin out all over)
I'm scratchin' from head to toe
ever since you left me, girl
i just can't take no more

Friends, don't help me like they should
Naw Naw Baby (naw naw, baby)
And every doctor I see, they tell me
can't give me no good

There's no cure, naw, baby
for what you gave to me
Ohhh, you're the only one
who can save me

I've got a prayer place for only you
I've got to get you there
I'm aching and shaking all over
...
