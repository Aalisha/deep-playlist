No man is safe from (pain)

Broken arm, broken heart, shattered dreams
Tongue piercings lost at rates
Punched in the face by the local thug
Bent over, caught the stomach flu bug
While hitting it from the back burnt your knee on the rug
Last hug from the homie
Before he flies out to Pelican for the long stretch
Tattooed sketch takes two days to complete
Father never was around, deadbeat nigga
Tossed in the Hudson with concrete feet
Yoga master hypnotized known to defeat
And remain calm, blisters on the palm
Then only bring home half pay
Need a fix, locked up in the halfway
S&M freaks add a little when they do the nasty
When I die, pray that it's done in a fast way
Don't want no long stroll down pain's pathway
All life long playing the game in order to gain
Taking in the pain

Chorus
