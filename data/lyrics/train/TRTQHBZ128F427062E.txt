When the day is short
And the nights are long
It's a different world
Where the rules are wrong
And I, I will go home with who
Whoever is sure
Are you sure?

And I don't care if you
If you love me tomorrow just
Love me tonight and I
I will be all right
I'll be all right
I'll be all right
Until tomorrow night
...
