If you ain't a man with a lot of guts, a dog-gone woman will drive you nuts
You can't trust one to the corner now a days
You gotta watch your doors or she'll cheat you blind,
a woman ain't got but a one track mind
You'll find out Bud, it's the man who always pays

She'll feed you a line that will turn your head and you'll marry her and when you're in bed
She'll go through all the pockets in your pants
And if you object there'll be a big fight and chances are it will last all night
