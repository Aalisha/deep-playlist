Now, the mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes

We, so tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive to the other side
(Me babe, steppin' out)
Into the night, into the light
You babe, steppin' out
