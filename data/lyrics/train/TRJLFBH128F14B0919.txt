Money money money, money
Some people really need it (oh, well)
Some people got to have it (in vain)
Listen here y'all, do things, do things, do bad things with it
So you will do things, do things, do good things with it
Talk about cash money, no help at all

For the love of money
People will steal from their mother
For the love of money
People will rob their own brother
For the love of money
People can't even walk the street
Because they never know who in the world they gotta beat
For that lean, mean, mean green
