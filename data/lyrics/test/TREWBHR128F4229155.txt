How can we be wrong...

How long can we both go on this way
Why can't you give me tonight, please stay
You tell me I am the one for you
Then do things that make what you say come true
Once there was a time
I knew for sure you were mine, you were mine
Times changing I know
Love comes and it goes, it goes
Where did we go wrong
We used to be strong
Two wrongs don't make a right
No, not tonight

Chorus:
How can we be wrong to be holding on
If we both let go we're gonna fall
...
