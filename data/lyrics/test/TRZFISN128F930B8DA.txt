Hayes Carll
Trouble In Mind
Knockin Over Whiskeys
I keep knockin' over whiskeys
No one's laughing at my jokes
They got me spinnin' 'round in circles
Like a tin can in the spokes
When I left town this mornin'
With a smile upon my face
Oh babe I swear I never knew
I'd end up in this place
Run away little darlin'
You don't need me any more
I've been out here for too long
