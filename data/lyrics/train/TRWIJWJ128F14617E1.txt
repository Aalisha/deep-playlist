Watch out... here i go again, 
 ive been gone too long, remember who i am? 
 hold back... ive got somethin to say, 
 "i never wanted to leave now im back to stay!" 
 never sold me, what i stood for... 
 noone told me what im good for... 
 so watch out... here i go again... 
 
 ...ready to stay! 
 
 i believe it's still in me and i can turn you... 
 up... side and down! 
 if you decide to trust in me then i can really... 
 turn... you... around! 
 
 stand up... and have faith in me, 
...
