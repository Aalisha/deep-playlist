I can't start wishing that I went for something more
but I can dream between my losing faith and now
I've got plans
of stay proud
with every single scream
I'll find my place in every city.
No, never lose my voice

I stood there counting all the days 'til I was free
I can't sleep, I'll drive the 30 miles home
but I can't breathe
but I'm still proud
of every single day
Is something killing me again?
I need to get away

from all the things that made me lose my mind before,
and I know
this time everything (this time everything)
is gonna be alright (is gonna be alright)
take it slow, so you know
that it's real more than just tonight (tonight, tonight)
...
