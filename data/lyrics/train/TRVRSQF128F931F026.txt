Thinking of the words to say,
I'd like to think that this was fate.
Reference to a song you love,
Spell confusion with a K
Like a star without its strings,
I'm hanging here on these two wings.
For that smile and those eyes
I'm falling

If time could stop, how could I make this more poetic?
When there's nothing more pathetic to be said

You bring me out, show me light,
I'm sorry if I hide, I'm too afraid to look inside.
You carry through, you make me smile.
If it were you and me tonight,
I would tame the stars and save the brightest one for you,
For you...
