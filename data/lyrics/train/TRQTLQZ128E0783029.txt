So take the fast road and get goin now
Before you leave no trace
Time in this place was closer than my friends
Remember my eyes not my face
Innocence has no sense it invents
Another man unfolds
Well I'm standing next to myself the sink
Staring into the black hole

I panic at the quiet times
Decisions at the door
...
