It was only the lights and the alcohol
But he looked like a porno star some kind of adonis
And by my side I saw the angel sigh
As the devil won me over I knew

It was gonna be a wild night, it was gonna be a wild night
He would make me feel alright
Make me feel alright, make me feel alright
Make me feel alright

It was only the drugs and an altered mind
I gave myself to the pain, it gave him pleasure
Oh, it gave him pleasure
He made me feel alright
He made me feel alright

Took me to paradise
