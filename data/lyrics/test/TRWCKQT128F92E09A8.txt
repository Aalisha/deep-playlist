A smoke has been driven, so drive them away.
As wax melt before the fire, so shall they melt away.
And if a wicked, a wicked pay.
And if a righteousness, yes, a righteous pay.

Melt away, melt away, melt away.
Like ice cream.

He who sits in the heaven shall laugh.
For Jah shall have them in derision.
Batter them, batter them, batter them to pieces.
Batter them, batter them, batter them tp pieces.
