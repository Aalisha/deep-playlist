Push the envelope further from reality
Banishing the hope, interrogating strategies
Inhumane aggression, isolation jails
Forcing a confession when all else fails

To stand in judgement of a so-called offender
That represents immortal behaviour

Push the envelope from the civilised norm
Push the envelope, catastrophic storm
Stripped of life and limb by this torture germ
Stripped of life and limb just for standing firm
