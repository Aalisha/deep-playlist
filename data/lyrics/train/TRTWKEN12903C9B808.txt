You knew there'd be consequences, 
when I gave you the keys to my heart.
You knew that I had intentions, 
and you knew it right from the start.

Give me one more day. 
I'll give ya reason to stay
I wanna make you see, but you don't listen to me.
I'm trying to find a way.

I feel you inside, while I'm standing on the outside
