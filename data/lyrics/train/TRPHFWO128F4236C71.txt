Freedom train is coming - all around the
world
talking 'bout freedom - yeah bring it
on

drop what you're doing and climb on
board
all it costs you is a song

life
on the outside
life on the
outside

don't worry 'bout the weather -
it's all in your head
we're all here for such
a short time
we got to learn to live together
...
