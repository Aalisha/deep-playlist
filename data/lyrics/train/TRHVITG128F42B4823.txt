Laura, can't you give me some time,
I got to give myself one more chance.
To be the man that I know I am.
To be the man that I know I am.
Won't you just tell Cincinnati,
I'm gonna need your love.
Don't you give me your love.

Don't you give me your,
Come on,
Come on,
Where is your love?
Don't you give me your love,
Don't you give me your,
Come on,
Come on,
Where is your love?
Don't you give me your love.
Don't you give me your.
