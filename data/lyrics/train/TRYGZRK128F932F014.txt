Many African children,
Living in a concrete situation
African children
Living in a concrete situation
African children
I wonder do they know where you're coming from
African children
Down there yes in a concrete situation
African children
I wonder do they know where you're coming from
The whole of the nation
Living in these tenements,
Crying and applying to their council
For assistance every day
Now that their tribulation so sad
Now that their environment so bad
High rise concrete
