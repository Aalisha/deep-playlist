Tempted and tried we're often made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested though in the wrong.

Farther along we'll know all about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up, my brother, come sing in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by.
