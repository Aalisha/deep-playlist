(Keep looking after number one)
He broke your heart, we heard the news
And now you don't know what you're gonna do
He made you cry and now he's gone
So we hear you say can't carry on
And now your heart's get you running for cover
And we believe you can't trust another
That's how it is when the feeling's gone
Take our advice, keep looking after number one.
That's the way it is (Keep looking after number one)
That's just the way it is (Keep looking after number one)
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, love (Keep looking after number one)
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, love (Keep looking after number one)
Yeah, that's the way it is (Keep looking after number one)
