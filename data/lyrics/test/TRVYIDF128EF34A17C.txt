(Sugar)
Oh sugar, I've been missing you
And I've been wondering, where it is you're hiding
I've been a ball of fire in your arms desire
And I've been wondering, where it is you're hiding

(Sugar)
What you get is what you seek
(Sugar)
Desire
(Sugar)
What you get is what you seek
(Sugar)
Desire

Oh honey, I won't be kissing you
And I've been wondering, where it is you're hiding
I've been a ball of fire in your arms desire
And I've been wondering, where it is you're hiding

(Sugar)
