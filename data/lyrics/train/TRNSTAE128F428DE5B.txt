Don't wanna let you go
We just wanna tell you
Just wanna let you know
That we'll stay around
So what else can you do
You've said all you have to
We're coming after you
So don't make a sound

I got this feelin
Could it be there's someone watching over me
Tell me who you are
I close my eyes and count from nine
To try and find some peace of mind
But it's gone too far

You see our faces every time you turn your head around
