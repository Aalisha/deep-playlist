I'm in over my head

They wanna try and build me up
So they can tear me down
I wish that I could be back there
But I'm right here right now

They've taken everything that I've had to give and
They say it's over but man I'm still here livin'
I don't know what to do, I think that maybe

I'm in over my head
Stuck in the red
Somethin' they said
Makes me think that
I'm in over my head
Over my head
Over my head
