[Verse 1]
She is the passion
She is my melody
And I amplify, amplify her sexuality
When the lights go out
My bed is the stage
Her body is the pole
And we just lose control
And let nature take its course
Just like that I'm in the palm of her hand
Like a mike in the stand
Turn us up if yall don't hear me

[Chorus:]
Like the greatest show on earth known to man
Mike check one two
Mike check one two two
Like the whole world inside the palm of her hand
Mike check one two
Mike check one two
Like the perfect song in the key of love
Mike check one two
Mike check one two two
We gone repeat the love cause I can't get enough
