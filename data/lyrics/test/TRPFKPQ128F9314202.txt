The door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust
on us
Footsteps follow, down through the hollow sound,
torn up

And you will go to Mykonos
With a vision of a gentle coast
And a sun to maybe dissipate
Shadows of the mess you made

Pallid animals in the snow tipped pines, I find
Hatching from the seed of your thin mind, all night
