2. "THE MARCH"

Matthew 21: 5-11
The triumphal entry into Jerusalem

It was a march of a revolution
It was a march of a stormy day
It was a cadence of cruel contention
It was a march oh what a march

Oh it was a march for the sweet and gruesome
To bring a light to their darkened place
It was a march for the thirst of freedom
And it was beauty battered and bleeding
And it was a march yeah, yeah

When it all comes down to me and you yeah
Will we walk away or march on with
The One who made the march oh yeah
