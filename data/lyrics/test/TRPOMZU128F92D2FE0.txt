Don't give up on us, baby
don't make the wrong seem right
the future isn't just one night
it's written in the moonlight
painted on the stars
we can't change ours
Don't give up on us, baby
we're still worth one more try
i know we put a last one by
just for a rainy evening
when maybe stars are few
don't give up on us, i know
...
