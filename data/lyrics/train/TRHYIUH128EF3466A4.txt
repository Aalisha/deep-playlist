Flushed chest

I saw you tonight
Through the dim twilight
It was deep deep summer
With that yellow moon
And you were sleeping

I saw you tonight
You were in your ghost
Singing white Christmas
How you know
It's before me

It's your song
So divine
Dying time
Is a part
Of your laughter

I saw you today
Selling all your clothes
You were done with Hollywood
The waterfall was rushing
Through you
