Let me feel
your heat is aside
and take me by your hand
Come and hold me tonight
never let me down
I want your love night
I want to know
so take my by your hand
let me be your storm of love
never let me go
I WANT YOUR LOVE TONIGHT (4mal)
Don't you wanna feel my love tonight,
I want your love, I need your love, uh uh uh
TONIGHT, don't you wanna feel my love tonight?
