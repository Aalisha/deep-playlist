Hold me close don’t let me go, oh no
I, yes I, love you and think you should know
With your love light shining
Every cloud’s got a silver lining
So hold me close don’t let me go

Hold me close don’t let me go, oh no
You and me, yes our love it will stop at the show
Do you know,
With your light shining clearly
Its good to have you near me
So hold me close don’t let me go
