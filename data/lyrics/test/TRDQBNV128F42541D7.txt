Fightin it's such a struggle and I got so far
Got so far to go
Don't want to except no answers
But I ain't got nothing
Got nothing to show

It's such a struggle but I gotta do it
By myself
Can't except no logic so I gotta do it
By myself
It's such a struggle but I gotta do it
By myself
Can't except no logic so I gotta do it
