{Come here baby}
{I got something for you}
{Don't you wanna come with me}
{Hmm, let's go}

Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power?
Do you, do you feel, do you, do you feel?
Ah, do you, do you, do you, do you feel the power?

I'll tell you straight up
When it comes to real love
My arms are open and my heart knows the score
I've lived and learned now
Sometimes got burned out
But every time I pick myself off the floor
You need good loving like a desert needs the rain
Never make your heart complain
You keep on running like a river to the sea
Look no further boy 'coz I've got just what you need

You need the power of a woman
Of a woman
Taking over you, that's what love can do
The power of a woman
Let me take control
Body mind and soul
