Has there ever come a time, when you fell real nice
And you want to let someone know that you really appreciate them?
All you have to do is moan a little bit for me,
It goes something like this
Ooooh, ooooho, oooooh, oooooho.

You see, no time for wasting, baby,
We're gone all through those moves
I'm offering satisfaction, darling,
Girl, I'm giving you all my love,
Anytime is the right time, baby,
Come on and, take my heart
It's all yours if you want it, baby,
My heart is tearing all apart, I say

Ooooh (you can have it)
Yeah (if you want it)
Come and get it, baby,
But if you want it (you can have it)
Come and get it, girl, yeah (if you want it), yeah.
