Gregory Porter - Do You Feel Like I Feel?

Nicola Conte (feat. Gregory Porter)

Hey, little sister,
Have you heard the news today?
We're gonna shape the world away
Hey, little darling,
Have you seen the skies in grey?
Our love has cleared the clouds away
Stop, look and listen to your heart

Do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna make the church bells sing
Do you feel like I feel?
(Do you feel like I feel?)
I wanna let our freedom ring
...
