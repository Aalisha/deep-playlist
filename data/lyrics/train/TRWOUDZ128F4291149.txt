Mother watch your children
The iron fist of fear is ruling our lives
It´s not too late to change the course
We can make this world a better place to be in
How much more do we want until we´re satisfied?
What happens when we have what we want?
Acquiring more, still there´s never enough
We forget those who really are in need
The end is near, or so they say
Selling peace with guns

Infinity - Where do we go from here?
Infinity - Where do we go from here?
Infinity - Where do we go?
