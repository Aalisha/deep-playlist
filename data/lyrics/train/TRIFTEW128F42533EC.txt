You kissed me once
And you kissed me twice
With your mess of slobbering lips
With dribble in my brow (bra?)
I wait until you turned around
And wiped it on my pant leg

Oh now I'll sign this paper for everyone to see
And now I'm up here singing for everyone to hear
Now I'll sign this paper for everyone to see
Now I'm up here singing for everyone to hear

You
Especially you
It's all for you
It's because of you

My lungs are filled with smoke
Eyes light and hazy from too many tears
Red and glossy from too many beers
And my stomach shapes into one big knot
My stomach shapes into one big knot

Oh now let's stop hangin' around this lame town
Take another lookin' at your stupid frown
Looking down, down, down at the ground
Looking down, down, down at the ground
