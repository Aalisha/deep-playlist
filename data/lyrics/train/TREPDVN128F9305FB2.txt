You've been staying out late almost every night
While I sit home and wait for you
Sometimes until it's daylight
You think that I'm a fool
That I don't know what it's all about
But I think that you're out doing
What I'm here doing without

Girl, I wanna tell you that you're
Late hours are bringing me down
You're so tired when you come home at night
That you don't even care that I'm around
If you'd just love me like you used to
You'd make me wanna jump and shout
...
