Set me free
Set me free
I need a little more room to breathe
And the freedom to do what I please
Mama set me free

Set me free
Set me free
Let me see what I can see
Have mercy on a boy like me
Mama set me free

Drop me off on a mountaintop somewhere
Well, I'll point 'em down and say my prayers
No one understands it
Maybe they don't care
We're only here because it's there
...
