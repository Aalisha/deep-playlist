Black or white it seems the answer's cut and clear to you
This misconception of what you want and what it takes to feel free
This kind of shit will steal your sleep and only lead you to a breakdown
A breakdown

No matter what I do, I never seem to feel okay
I'm either trying to fall asleep or stay awake through the day
And for what in return? It's getting harder than it's been in 27 years
It's killing me

Close your eyes and hope for sleep to finally end the day
Open them and force yourself to sort through what's in your head
This kind of shit will steal your sleep and only lead you to a breakdown
A breakdown

It's the world that has to change, not me
