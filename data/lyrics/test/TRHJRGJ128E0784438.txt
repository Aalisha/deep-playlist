You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know...
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know what the sound is darlin'?
It's the sound of my tears falling
Or is it the rain?

You don't know...

You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie
You make me want to cry
You make me want to cry
...
