Cut my skin, it makes me human*
Scorn your mind
Just feel the pain
Cuz it's what makes us human
It keeps us all the same
You lose your head on your chosen trip
The sight of your blood will lose your spit
And a broken heart will turn to sin
But when the wound is open
We're all the same
Cut my skin, it makes me human
Scorn your mind
Just feel the pain
When you're lookin at pain you're lookin at truth
Nothin like pain to make us all the same
I see you each day get up nine-to-five
