I'm standing on a rock
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I'm standing on a rock
And I ain't gonna move
Got me something to live for
Got me something to prove
I'm standing on a rock
And I ain't gonna move

You're a real fine woman
And your heart is strong
You can see right through me
And you laid the law
You don't give me no trouble
And you don't take mine
You ain't the reason I'm livin'
But you're the reason I'm tryin'
