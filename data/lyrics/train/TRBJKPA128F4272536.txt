Diamonds and pearls, black silk stockings
In her own world when she’s rockin’
She don’t hang out with anyone else in the crowd

Stiletto heels on the dance floor
Does what she feels as the crowd roars
She doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of her

My baby only cares for me
We’re a ship in the night all alone on the sea
My baby only cares for me
