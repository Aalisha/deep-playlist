I'm gonna tell you, baby
Something I want you to do
Don't stay out all night, baby
And I want your little heart to be true

Gal, because night time is the right time
To be with the one you love
Oh, with the one you love

Now don't forget, baby
I love you with all my might
If you get home before midnight, baby
I declare everything will be all right
...
