You take sugar and spice
Everything nice
And youve got a little girl, yeah yeah

You take snakes and snails
Some puppy dog tails
And youve got a little boy yeah yeah
That's what love is made of
Said that's what love is made of

Some, snakes, snails, puppy dog tails
Sugar, spice, everything nice
Yeah, yeah, alright

Somethin eles ya do
Ya take a walk by the sea
Two heart on a tree
And youve got a little gladness yeah yeah

Then two eyes cry
...
