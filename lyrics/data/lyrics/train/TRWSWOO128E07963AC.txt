Wine, beer and spirits all the time
Though I have you still she's always on my mind
The rain falls down I'm soaking through
I'm an old man inside a young man's suit
My crocodile shoes are crying too
For they know how much love I have for you

Crocodile shoes, crocodile shoes
Crocodile shoes, crocodile shoes
