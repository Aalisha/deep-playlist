See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we build
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads

See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we build
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads

See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we build
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads

Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
