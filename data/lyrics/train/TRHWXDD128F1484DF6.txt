Friday morning
And all my work is done
I've packed my bags
I'm on the run
I got a feeling that
I'm gonna have some
Fun in the sun
With my friends
And he's got me going

Sorry I can't go
Whoops now
Sorry I can't go
Whoops now
Sorry I can't go
Sorry I can't go
Sorry I can't go now

Friday noon
And my boss is on the phone
He's telling me
That I can't leave home
An extra hand at work
