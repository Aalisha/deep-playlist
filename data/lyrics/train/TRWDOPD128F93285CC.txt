Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love, hey Jamaica
Sitting down see the flower
on the window tops and the mountain
See the rain and the warm lit sun
On the beaches sand
Comes a man with a plan to renew the world
Up in rasta land, hungry boys and girls
