They say that I'm the kind of man who always speaks his mind
To me there's nothing stronger than the truth
You can ask me almost anything and I'll tell you like it is
But darling when they ask me about you

I tell it like it used to be when you were still in love with me
Before you got to used to me and wanted someone new
I tell it like it ought to be 'cause how it is, is killing me
