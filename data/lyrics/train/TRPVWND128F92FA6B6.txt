Goodbye Joe, I got to go, me oh, my oh
I got to go, pull the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, she's the sweetest one, me oh, my oh
Son of a gun, we're gonna have big fun on the bayou

Said, jambalaya, craw fish pie, fillet gumbo
'Coz tonight I'm gonna see my machez amio
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay-oh
Son of a gun, we're gonna have big fun on the bayou
