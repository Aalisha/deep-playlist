Early at mourning I go to the morgue
I have my breakfast on a dismembered corpse
Dissecting it's organs whistling as I work
Beholding my carnage, I delight on gore
I love my profession as mortuary technician
So funny, macabre and sick
I am alone when my workdays ends
Corpses are my only friends
Cemetery at midnight is my favourite place
