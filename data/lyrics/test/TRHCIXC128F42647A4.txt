Threw a stone
You're surrounded by glass
You need to get out of this place
'Cause it's holding you back

So, baby run
Run like the wind
Looking what you're leaving behind
It's nothing more than a hole in the ground

It's too late
There's nothing to hold on to
It's so sad
'Cause everything's shut down
It's so hard
...
