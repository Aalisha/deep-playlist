Verse 1:

Once I thought I was more right than wrong,
Painting myself in the corner.
What I bought and why it takes so long,
Something inside of her warned her.

Chorus:

I know that it doesn't matter much
But I hope we'll, keep in touch.
I know that we won't go on as such
But I hope we'll, keep in touch.
Could it be that hard,
To send you a postcard?
