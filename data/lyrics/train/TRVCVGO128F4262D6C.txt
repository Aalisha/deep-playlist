Jessica, you are never going to believe
What I am looking at right now
What are you talking about?
You know your man
Mr. Wonderful
The guy you're always talking about

I know he's so hot, right?
Yeah, hot, whatever, okay, anyways
He is all up on that girl, Coop
Coop?
What are you talking about?
Yes, I'm telling you girl he's playing you

Jessica, I'm serious, he is all over her believe
Whatever, I don't believe you
Jess, I swear it's true
I was watching 'em
I can see 'em right now
It's so disgusting
You guys

I'm serious, you better call him up right now
What do I do? What do I say?
I don't know but I'm looking at him
I mean you gotta tell him the truth
You gotta tell him how it is
He's playing me?
He's playing you so bad

You told me that you would always
Be the only thing that I'd ever need
And all my friends that they were never good enough
Be with me

You want me to stay at home
And like a fool, I did for you
Now I see the game that you playin' on me
Oh

You go out with your friends at night
Like it's alright
'Cause you're hot like fire
Other girls call your cell phone, boy
You can't help yourself
