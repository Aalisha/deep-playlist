Two figures ride towards the sunset.
Searching for truth, only one shall return.
Bring it down, tonight.
Reprisal for our loss.
We are the nightmare, the chosen silence.
We are the night.

Three words to praise the reached.
Those wretched eyes of the drowning man.
This timeless lie won't stand.
This timeless lie won't stand.
Caught in the dream of this midnight stare.
These are our past sins, we are the nightmare.
When shame and deceit lay too close to me...
This was your worse sin, now it's my nightmare.
