money, hoes, cars and clothes, thats how all my niggas know
blowin dro, 24, thats how all my niggas roll
money, hoes, cars and clothes, thats how all my niggas know
blowin dro, 24, thats how all my niggas roll

[T.I.]
in a drop top chevy with the roof wide open
my partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
cause I've been drank, and I've been smoke
flying down 285 but I'm focused
its a four fifty four, where it says I raise comotion
white leather seats, as fresh as air forces
doing bout a hundred but the track still bumping
number 8 on nwa straight out of compton
pull up at your apartment sitting on 24s
and the dope boys, saying the kids running in
the clicks start dealing and the broads start choosing
and the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
sign pictures by the hundred, to the youngins in the hood
cause I ain't hollywood, I come from the hood
I'm use to it, if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch jays got the chevrolet shaking

[Chorus]
money, hoes, cars and clothes, thats how all my niggas know
...
