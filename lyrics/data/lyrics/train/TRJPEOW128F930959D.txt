I should laugh, but I cry
Because your love has passed me by
You took me by surprise
You didn't realize but I was waiting

Time goes slowly, but carries on
And now the best years have come and gone
You took me by surprise
I didn't realize that you were laughing

Laughing, 'cause you're doin' it to me
Laughing, it ain't the way it should be
You took away everything I had
You put the hurt on me

Laughing, 'cause you're doin' it to me
Laughing, it ain't the way it should be
...
