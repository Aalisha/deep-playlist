(Tash)
So exotic, so melodic
E-Swift - so motherfuckin, Alkaholik

If you see me and you know me, come and holla at'cha homey
and show me some lo-oooooooooooo-ve
If you see me and you know me, come and holla at'cha homey
and roll me some bu-uuuuuuuuuuuu-ud

(girl sings to flute melody in background - 2X)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Laahhh-ahhhhhhhhhhhhh-ahhhhh

(Tash over girl)
At least buy a nigga a drink or somethin, party people!
Woo! Let me explain it

(Tash)
Aiyyo guns don't kill people, people kill people
Tash he cracks hoes cause Rico's still Rico
Swift is still Sweezy, Grams is still J-Ro
We still don't give a fuck, so don't move until we say so
{*click*} Aight, do yo' dance
While I bust like Christian Slater in _True Romance_
Let's get it on motherfuckers, time is tickin in here
I'm on the same shit as Luda, strictly "Chicken and Beer"
What a diet, you should try it, Tash rock like Quiet Riot
If I'm buyin out the bar, that means I'm really tryin to buy it
If I'm lyin I'm flyin, half y'all niggaz don't deserve me
Holla if you heard me, holla if you niggaz can't serve me
(OHHH-ohhh!) From the pit to the booth
