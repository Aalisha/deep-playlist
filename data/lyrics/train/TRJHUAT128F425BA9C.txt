Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling, can you picture this?

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike [Incomprehensible] poses
They feel the heat, the heat between me

How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
And maybe I'm just like my father, too bold
