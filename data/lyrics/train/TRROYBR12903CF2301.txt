Teeth ripped out of gums hit
Sparkling gray squares of concrete
Screams in technicolor pain
Doubled over spitting blood
The freezing rain
Never felt so good
To wake up in some town
On some floor to some sound
Voices rattle through my veins
You're slowly imploding
Your worlds are corroding

Please let it work itself out
We've got time to melt
