It was Sunday afternoon
I was sunk in my recliner
Football game was on
Tampa Bay and Carolina
I wasn't payin much attention
The volume down not watchin it at all
This house was like an ice box
Had all the curtains drawn
I had it more like a hotel room and less like a home
It's been so quiet around here lately
I wasnt thinkin anyone would call

Let alone you
All the way from Dallas
Out of the blue
Sayin that you missed us
...
