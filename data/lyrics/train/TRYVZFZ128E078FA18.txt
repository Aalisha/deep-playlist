For everything you do
I'd like to swallow you
And everyday I'm gonna blame you
And even if you justify

Every fucking bullshit lie
It only makes me want to break you
You pull me down
And you crucify my name

You make me insane
It's broken now

Don't ever look my way
Don't even think I'm playing
'Cause I fucking hate you
You're such a liar

And I love to hate you
You're all the same to me
When you repeated me
Take advantage of me
