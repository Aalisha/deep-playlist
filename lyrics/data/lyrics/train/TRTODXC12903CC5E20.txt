The city hides the secrets of the liars in the streets
The phone calls and assurances all for nothing (but looking good)
Every time the truth comes out its pushed away and pushed aside
But I won't stand and watch it all
It all go unsaid

How many times will I fall victim to this It's normal by now
No one helps each other up we push one another back down
It's sad to see these people
And the apathy they have
I hope one day they lose it all for the choices they made

Out in the open there's the air of brotherhood
And spoken truth yet everyone knows what goes on behind these closed doors
Do tell no one cares about the heart no one cares about the past
