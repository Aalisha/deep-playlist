Yeah, I am the astro creep
A demolition style
Hell american freak, yeah
I am the crawling dead
A phantom in a box
Shadow in your head say
Acid, suicide freedom of the blast
Read the fucker lies, yeah
Scratch off the broken skin
Tear into my heart make
Me do it again yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

More Human Than Human
More Human Than Human
More Human Than Human
More Human Than Human
More Human Than Human
More Human Than Human
