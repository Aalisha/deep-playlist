Shuffle can to can nobody really gives a damn
For every living day I give myself a hand
Now I'm scroungy as can be
I got all you normals looking at me
I'll scratch a hole in my life
So everyone can see


My mind is a mind that I have come to know
And my eyes can't conceive a world that can not grow
...
