stars shining bright above you
night breezes seem to whisper "i love you"

birds singing in the sycamore tree
dream a little dream of me
say "nighty-night" and kiss me

just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
while i'm alone and blue as can be
dream a little dream of me

stars fading but i linger on dear
oh how you linger on

still craving your kiss
...
