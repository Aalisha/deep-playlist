The further you go
The farther you've gone
It doesn't mean you were made to hang on
And you're falling falling falling
But you can't let go

Whether you're cold, hot, bottled or not
This is the day for which you have fought
And you're calling calling calling
But you can't get home

And every day takes something away
Until there's nothing left to say
No single world can deliver you love
No understanding no sound from above
And nothing to do
It's nothing to you
