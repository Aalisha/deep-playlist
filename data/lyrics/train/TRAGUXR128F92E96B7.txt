How could we get away
And lose the blues of yesterday
Boy, don't you think I'm the one for you, yeah
I know a paradise
Where we could go and dance all night

'Cause my mind's made up
I knew it from the start
Better lock it up
I'm out to get your heart

Tonight gonna make you mine
Gonna love you right, baby, forever, oh, yeah
Tonight gonna hold you tight
Gonna love you right, baby, forever, oh, yeah

Don't you think we could be
Like all the others down in history
Loving the way we do tonight, ooh
