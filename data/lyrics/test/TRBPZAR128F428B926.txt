Stay, please stay with me tonight
And all the stars up in my Heaven
They're shinin' bright

Oh, anything is possible
I know it, if you stay
Oh, I will catch you if you fall
Oh baby, baby

I know it hurts but it hurts me more and more
I hear your heartbeat, baby louder than before
And when I cry, I cry for you
'Cause I know you are the only
And when I die, I die for you
'Cause I know your heart is lonely

Oh, anything is possible
...
