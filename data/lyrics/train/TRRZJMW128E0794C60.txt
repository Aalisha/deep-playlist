(Intro)
What the f**k is the deal its the talk of New York Tony Yayo (G-G-G Unit)
Yeah, Yo word up man, its f**king cold out here man, my f**king toes is killin me man (its f**king brick) i f**king been on the block all day man but u know i mean i gotta get this money run sleek snow...

(Verse 1)
Yo we project living
With plastic on the furniture,
Little niggaz coming up will
F**king try to murda ya
The D's not out so the coast is clear
But its getting hard to sleep with this roach in my ear
Everybody got a nena everybody got a vest
New York City is the arena of death
Yo the strip moving slow but everybody going hard
Seeing more d's than a damn report card
Everybody rap now
Follow they dreams im a call my clientele man and
Sign all my fiends same gear for a week wearing dirty clothes
All day in the spot by a dirty stove trials keep me strong
