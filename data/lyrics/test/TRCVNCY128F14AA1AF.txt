There's something in your eyes
Is everything alright
You look up to the sky
You long for something more, darling
Give me your right hand
I think I understand
Follow me and you will never have to wish again

I know that after tonight
You don't have to look up at the stars, no no no no
I know by the end of tonight
You don't have to look about the stars
And I know that if the love is alright
You don't have to look up at the stars, no no no no
I know by the end of the tonight you wont have to look up at the stars

Tell me how you feel
And if I'm getting near
I'll tell you where to steer
You tell me where to steer, da-da-da-darling
