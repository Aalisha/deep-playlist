Hey boy, you know sometimes when two people are in love
They just can't seem to get it together
And that's how I feel about you

He already knew I was down for the cause
But hard to get is much more fun
What's better than that really
Son was like feel me
I was all nah
Catching feelings, truly upset when he had to go
School me on the ways of catching a mate, god
I'm matching a date cause I'm lacking skills
I'm mackin' smaller than an iPod
I'm kidding I know the mackin' is rules
Was tacking on the wifey latch since backpacking in school
But he's different though I feel him mo
Can't play it simple, no
Can't fuck up the friendship for them dimples, nope
I need to enter his space and probe his INTERSCOPE
Just like I'm vanity looking for his inner glow
He's not a BAD BOY
I've never sampled his type before
Moved to New York from Los Angeles
Cali Swagger ain't attached to nothing
We puffing, analyzing the city after he's rolling something
I wanna ROCK-A-FELLA so bad, oh man
Note pad's filled with all the ink his soul had
Visions of us
Kissing the whole nine
No JIVE could picture his whole profile
But I can't step
I risk the chance of losin everything
A friendship is more important than a wedding ring
Now when he's calling me I keep actin SHADY
