You see things in me
that nobody else could see
Or had looked quite
deep enough to find
You passed over all my faults
and you came through it all
When no one else
would have taken the time

And without as much
as a word or a touch
You had me wanting you

Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder?
Is it any wonder
I love you like I do
...
