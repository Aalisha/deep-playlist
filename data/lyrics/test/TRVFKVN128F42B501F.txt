From the inside lookin' out
You're the one that I've been thinkin' about
I'm a lonely little fool over you babe

Got me dazed and confused
Got my body cryin' the blues
Come and see me
Got a line I'm throwing to you

You're the mountain that I want to climb
I won't stop till I reach it this time
I just can't get you outta my mind

I'm all fired up with no where to burn
Gotta hold myself steady
I'm all fired up with nowhere to burn
