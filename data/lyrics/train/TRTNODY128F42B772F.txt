I saw your face
Whiter than purity
Then I saw savages
Standing before me

(Poison, poison, poison)
Bows and arrows
(Poison, poison, poison)
Tipped with poison

(Poison, poison, poison)
Make tenderness please
(Poison, poison, poison)
Stand by my pillow

I see evil
Every time I dream
I see earth's poison
(Poison, poison, poison)
...
