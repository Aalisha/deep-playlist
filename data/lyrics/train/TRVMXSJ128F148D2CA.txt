Featuring nate dogg

Warren g-
1, 2 buckle my shoe,
3, 4 we gotta hit the store,
5, 6 back in the mix,
7, 8 warren g and nate,

Nate dogg-
Bang to the boogy say up jump the boogy
To the rhythm of the boogidy beat
I dont love no hoes they know so they don't be fuckin wit me

Warren g-
A long time ago i met annie mae
She was killing me softly like everyday
Penetentiary steel, was stickin for real
Blockbustin through the walls
Now i'm makin housecalls

Nate dogg-
I thought i'd met a lot of scandalous women, and then i met annie mae
Got a thin big butt like steel
But she didn't have a place to stay
