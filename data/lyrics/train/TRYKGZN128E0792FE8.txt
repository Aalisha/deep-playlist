Let's take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Just wear your shorts and your long hair
Don't forget the lawn chair

Everybody's gone to the movies
Everybody's gone and it's groovy
They went to the one about the big war
I didn't, I'd seen it before

And I guess I'm taking my chances
Giving up the ring, throwing in the gloves
And then I guess I'm taking my chances
Trading in my things for a couple wings on a little white dove
And one big love, one big love

Everybody do like a monkey, if you want to go on and be funky
No need to talk like a hero, talk a walk, count down to zero
No sense defending your honor, just go on and kiss him if you wanna
Everything before is gone or going somewhere
