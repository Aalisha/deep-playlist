Here we come on a cloud, stars in our eyes,
Standing up proud, it's a perfect disguise,
We've got so much to give, so much to gain,
Just give me your money and I'll give you my pain,
It's a fair exchange . . . (fair exchange)
Now Tia Maria, she leans on the wall
Looks in the mirror and pukes on the floor,
Tries to remember the cause of it all . . .
He just gave her a drink and she gave him a ball,
it's a fair exchange . . .
But I expect you expect a lot from me,
I can feel your burning need . . .
Your greedy, seedy,
fantasies are guaranteed to make my young heart bleed
...
