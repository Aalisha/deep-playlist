Implement Fear
Deprive them of their sacred pride
In a murderous frenzy
As if possessed and justified

Straw man, figurehead, renegade... warlord
Kill and mass, first in front
Sudden decline
A dying of archaic hopes
This must be obeyed
It's Vexing to admit you're wrong

Ruminate, precipitate, chaos run amuck
Incinerate, eradicate, intellect absorbed
...
