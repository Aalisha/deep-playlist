* I assume this also appears on a Natural Elements 12", I don't know which

Yeah yeah, this the group, this the group
You're listening to the sounds of Natural Elements, know what I mean?
We gonna do it like this, check it out

B-E-E, Double-Oh, so easily
will I eat M-C-E-E
N-Y-C be the locality... tryin to inflate this low salary
My sets is fat and yours is low calorie
You're too full of carbohydrates, to flow my rate
I shake and vibrate, the lightweight, and make foes migrate
Plant seed and let it germinate, vermin I terminate
Verbally I offend more *niggaz* that the Mark Fuhrman tapes...

Yeah yeah, this the group, this the group
You're listening to

Yeah yeah, this the group, this the group

Yeah yeah, this the group
Yeah yeah, this the group
Yeah yeah, this the group
This the group...

Yeah yeah, this the group, this the group
You're listening to the sounds of Natural Elements, know what I mean?
We gonna do it like this, check it out

B-E-E, Double-Oh, so easily
will I eat M-C-E...

B-E-E, Double-Oh, so easily
will I eat M-C...

B-E-E, Double-Oh, so easily
will I eat M-C-E...

B-E-E, Double-Oh, so easily
will I eat M-C...

B-E-E, Double-Oh, so easily
