I know
Oh, Oh Yeah

Hey baby
Why are you rushing?
Let's sit back and watch the flowers grow
Why you want
To swim against the tide?
Let's lay and watch the river flow

Here in God's creation
There is always a reason
I know that love is there for us

Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show
Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show

I don't wanna watch no movie
Let's sit and watch the stars put on a show
