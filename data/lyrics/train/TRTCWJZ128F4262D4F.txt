Hope you like the way I talk
The way I smile, the way I walk
Hope you're in to how I dress
The way I think and all the rest

'Cause, I'm gonna get you
You're gonna love me
No doubt about it
I'm gonna get you

When you're driftin' off to sleep
Close your eyes and think of me
Make it easy on yourself
