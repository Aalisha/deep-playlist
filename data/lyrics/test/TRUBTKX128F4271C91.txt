"You know I'm really gonna miss you, sugar britches"
"I'm gonna miss you too, Bub"
"Now I'm only gonna be gone a few days
But now there is a few things I need you to do while I'm gone"
"Oh, I figured there's somethin'!"
"Oh, quit complainin'"

"All you gotta do is cut the grass, wash the car, trim the hedges
Paint the fence, clean the pool, give the dog a bath
Defrost the fridge, clean out the garage"
"Right"
"Sweep the chimney, and I'll see you on Monday
I love you boogie, boogie"
"I love you too an' you, you don't you worry 'bout me, I'll be just fine"

I've got my socks dryin' in the microwave
Hair on my back I don't plan to shave
I've got the house to myself while the wife's away
I'll be rockin' all night

Yeah, I think I'll drink me an ice cold brew
Lounge in my boxers like I used to do
