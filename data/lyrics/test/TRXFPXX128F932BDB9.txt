When my lover boy comes rollin' in
Bottle of rum in his hand thanks to Sailor Jim, yeah
Sleeves rolled up and he’s wringin' wet
The boy is all man covered in blood and sweat

An arrow through your heart sayin' "I Love You"
A name on your arm sayin' you’ll always be true
Declaration of love in red white and blue
You got a love tattoo, you got a love tattoo

Well he’s mean and rude when he wakes and starts
Yeah one of his moods could just break my heart
But it pounds and it thumps when he grabs me tight
I love my rough lover every inch every night

An arrow through your heart sayin' "I Love You"
A name on your arm sayin' you’ll always be true
Declaration of love in red white and blue
