If your right hand is causing you pain
Cut it off, cut it off
If your colours have started to run
Let them all run, run away from you
There is lightning in this room
Above our heads, waiting to strike
I'm a thinker not a talker
Put your faith, your faith in God

We were hoping for some romance
All we found was more despair
