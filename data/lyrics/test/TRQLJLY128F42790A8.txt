Save me
The earth was young
When I was sown
Deep inside this land

Save me
Helpless I stand here alone
Waiting for my end

Save me
Centuries have flown away
But I know my time has come
Save me
No escape - I cannot stay
Do they know what they have done?

Save me
If you save me you'll save yourself
Why don't you understand?
