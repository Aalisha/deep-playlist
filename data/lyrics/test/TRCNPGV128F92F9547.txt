This is my allegiance
This is my declaration for where I stand
This is my solemn vow of everything I'll fight to uphold
It's a call to war against all those who build to destroy and live to abhor
There's no room for you anymore
I will not stand by and watch as you
Tear down my world before my eyes

I won't bow down to the things you praise or hate those you despise today
I won't be deceived by the lies
The promise of wealth you can't provide
I am my own man
I fight the good fight
