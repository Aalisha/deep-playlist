I crept up on my baby, I laid down on my town
I found a shrinking violet, I crushed it into the ground
I felt the heart of forever, I held it over my head
I said, "Fuck you on Christmas" and then they put me to bed
And I'm never gonna tell you why

I got my face in the furnace, I got my snake in a sleeve
God's drowned in a bowl of cereal, I have to ask you to leave
Roll up your expectations and feed them into my sleep
I'll ask the master cylinder what kind of cookies he eats
And I'm never gonna tell you why

Sometimes my soul just moves so slow
