Hey sister, have you heard?
Some people stand like trees, without a word
And what that means is that some people don't talk

Oh, please pardon me, Mister
Yeah, know I just didn't hear you the first time that you said that
But now that you repeat for me, I'll be sure to do what I can
Ya, know I'm going to do what I can

Do what I can, do, do, do, do what I can
Gonna do what I can
Do what I can, do, do, do, do what I can
But no more, you understand?

Oh, please pardon me, father
Ya know I just didn't hear you that, that, that
That first time that you said that
Help me, help me, help me, help me

Repeat it, repeat it, repeat it
I'll be sure do, do, do what I can

Do what I can, do what I can
Do, do, do, do what I can
Gotta do what I can, do what I can
Do, do, do, do what I can
But no more, you understand?

It's of utmost importance
We're dealing with volatile substance
It's of utmost importance
We're dealing with volatile substance

It's of utmost importance
We're dealing with volatile substance
It's of utmost importance
We're dealing with volatile substance

I had so much on my mind
I was so glad when I died, oh
