It's when my world comes down
You wanna change your little ways
Tomorrow's another start
But it looks like everyday

You can't imagine how I wished that
You could be the one
Inside you were not the same
But you look like everyone

It's like a tidal wave that rose to take the stars
A hurricane that wrapped around my heart
...
