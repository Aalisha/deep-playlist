He Said, She Said
I've had it up to here
Somebody gon' make me lose mind up in here
Going around gossiping, spreading lies
And rumors that i'm seeing someone on the side

He said, She said 'cause you know me better than that
Teust your heart instead, never mind that
He said, She said 'cause you know me better than that

Some people run there mouth
