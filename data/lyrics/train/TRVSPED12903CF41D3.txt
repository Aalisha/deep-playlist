What is wrong, what is right?
I worship the night
Into the darkness I wander
Bathing my skin the full moon light
In this my final hour, in this my final rite

I hunger for the eternal silence
To drown in the perpetual sleep
To take control and to finally seal my fate
All living fills me with hate, so deep...

[Chorus]
I walk alone - the darkest road
