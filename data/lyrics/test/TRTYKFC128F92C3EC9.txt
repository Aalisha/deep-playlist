I once touched a girl in seventeen places
She was quite the girl, she’s in my head
She felt soft like liquorice, smooth like a criminal
I can’t get that girl out of my head
She’s been making a home inside my head

How long until I win this battle?
I’ve played the game for so long
Should I wait and how long should I play the game for?
How long until I win this battle?
I’ve played the game for so long
Should I wait and how long should I play the game for?

She’s the type of girl who’d eat you for breakfast
She’s the type of girl who’d take you to town
She moves like a cyclone
She talks like a angel
