In my arms you lay
You're sleeping and you're still
I'm wide awake because I can't take it
And this is how I feel

Set my mind at easy
I'm worried and upset
My front door isn't on anymore
I'll be living with regret

So listen up And just let the music play
If you listen hard enough
You can hear me say

This is the sound of desperation
This is the sound of me wearing thin
This is the sound of desperation
This is the sound of me wearing thin
