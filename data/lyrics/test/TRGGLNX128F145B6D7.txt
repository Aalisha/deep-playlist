Yes Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha ...
Hey man (hey man), Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, Hey man (hey man)

Tay, tay, tay, tay, t-t-t-tay-tay, tay, tay
It's our occupation, we're a dancin' natio-ion
We keep the pressure on every night
Explanations are complicatio-ions
We don't need to know the where or why
Tay, tay, tay, tay, t-t-t-tay-tay, tay, tay

Takin' chances, bold advance-e-es,
Don't care if you think we're out of line
Conversation is interrigatio-ion,
Get out of here, we just don't have the time

Tay, tay, tay, tay, t-t-t-tay-tay, tay, tay
...
