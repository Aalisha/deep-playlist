There's a new love in your life
I see it in your smile
There's a new love in your life
I've known it for a while

You should have told me from the start
But, oh no, you had to leave me in the dark

And now you better watch out
You better watch out for me
So now you better watch out
You better watch out for me, yeah

Now there's a new love in my life
Two can play that game
There's a new love in my life
...
