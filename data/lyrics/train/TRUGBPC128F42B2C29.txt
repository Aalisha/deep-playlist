Nothing so blue as a heart in pain
Nothing so sad as a tear in vain

Ooh ooh

Let him walk on out if he wants to
He really doesn't deserve you
His loss is our gain so don't be blue
'cause stone blind and out of his mind
Is what he has to be yeah

So baby straighten up come on and fly right
It's no catastrophe yeah
I said now baby baby don't cry
Baby baby here's why
Love is here standin' by
Love is here standin' by
