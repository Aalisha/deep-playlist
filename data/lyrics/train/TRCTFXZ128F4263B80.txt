Centipede
Centipede

Your love
Is like a ragin' fire, oh
You're a snake
That's on the loose
The strike is your desire

But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire, huh
And when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire

I feel, oh, yeah
A longin' for your touch
Like you crawled
Into the bathroom window
To give him all your love, ho

Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Just like a centipede you've got
A lot of lovin' to touch

Don't you know
In the quiet of the night
Is when the snake
Is in the crawlin'
And the moon
Starts to glow then disappear
...
