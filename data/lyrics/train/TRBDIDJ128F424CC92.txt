Morning oh dreadful dawn, spread your pale dim light
Reign for your last time over lands once so bright
But your energy shall be weak, and soon to die
So die in pain my dear, expire, goodbye...
Ages has past since your eyes enlightened the earth
from a source of light that gave all godness birth
But your energy is weak and soon to die
The ground is sour from the evil that here lie

I have come to challenge your ways
Light's bane - The Last of your days
Oh broken wings - My darkness enslaves
...
