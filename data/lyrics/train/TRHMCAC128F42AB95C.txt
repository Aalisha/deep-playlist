We all... tried to touch the sky,
Every body attempted to touch the sun
To touch material without spirit
But all the time bitterness
Remained in their souls!
 
Through the ancient books
Of the lost kingdoms,
Through the golden book of the deads,
Through the obscure sight of hecate,
The insuperable goddess.
 
The god you believe in, the god you expected
The god you hoped for, the god you dream of.
 
Nightmares always to wake you up,
To remind you, you are alive,
A living dead who remembers
Would remember life beyond death!
An ungraceful body with a rotten soul
Which howls through it's leprous
Flesh that... there is no god!
Your god is dead,
Your god a abandoned you,
Because you never trusted yourself
You always wanted everything,
Simply without pain, blood and pleasure!
 
The god you believe in, the god you expected,
The god you hoped for, the god you dream of.
