Get up from your chair
Darling, may I have
(Get up from your chair)

This next twist with you
(Get up from your chair)

You don't know how to twist
(Get up from your chair)
Well, let me tell you

Well, now, there's a new dance
That's known as the twist
It's really not new
It's something you`ve missed
But there's a new dance
That's known as the twist
It's really not new
It's something you've missed
Dear lady
(Get up from your chair)
Dear, dear lady
