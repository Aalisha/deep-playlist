[Lee]
{Whispered: Achooooo Braaaaancafest}
I can't see anything at all
All I see is me
That's clear enough, that's what's important
To see me
My eyes can focus, my brain is talking
It looks pretty good to me
My head's on straight, my girlfriend's beautiful
It looks pretty good to me
Sometimes I speak
Tonight there's nothing to say
Sometimes we freak
And laugh all day
Hold these pages up to the light
See the jackknife inside of the dream
A railroad runs through the record stores at night
Coming in for the deep freeze
...
