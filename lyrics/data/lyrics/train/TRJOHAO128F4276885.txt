oh i'd like to find myself
trapped in some desert town with you
just me and you

my long black hair waving in the drive-in
me waving at you, my lover
from some ancient balcony

but like a
first division i see you
and your gone
way out could id run to

come back
come back
come back

but you're
gone california
and it's just my fate
making me blue
why else would i see you
today

but im not in some desert town
and you're not there with me
im underground in NYC

the city of perpetual motion
the city that never sleeps
thats alright, i wasn't tired anyways
