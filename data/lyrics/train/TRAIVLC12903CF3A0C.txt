Walking along just kicking stones
Minding my own business
I come face to face, with my foe
Disguised In violence from head to toe.
I holla and I bawl (Ku Klux Klan)
But dem naw let me go now
To let me go was not dem intention
Dem seh one nigger the less
The better for the show
Stand strong black skin and take your blow
It's the Ku, the Ku Klux Klan
Here to stamp out blackman yah
The Ku, the Ku Klux Klan heh!
