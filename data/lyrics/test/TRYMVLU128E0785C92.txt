That summer I did nothing
Just sleeping, thinking and hanging around
Left the dark streets of September
As the air was cooling down
Woah yeah it was cooling down

I need the sunshine in the morning
I'm heading for the open road
Sunshine in the morning
Lord you gotta let it flow

Ever since I lost her
Seems the more I learn, the less I know
Everyday I think about her
But if I look back I'll turn to stone
To stone, woah yeah gonna turn to stone
