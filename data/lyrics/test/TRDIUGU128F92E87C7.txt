I'm walking unknown territory
Where the sun's not shining
There's nothing golden about Golden Lane
The smoke is heavy in my lungs and the adverts are working
I just can't sell for who or what I am

Should I give my money to a good cause
Or save for a holiday
In a couple of months I could be in paradise
But the girl at the bar is well nice and she's looking over
