Oh, this is the start of something good
Don't you agree?
I haven't felt like this in so many moons
You know what I mean?

And we can build through this destruction
As we are standing on our feet

So since you want to be with me
You'll have to follow through with every word you say
And I, all I really want is you
You to stick around I'll see you everyday
But you have to follow through
You have to follow through

These reeling emotions they just keep me alive
They keep me in tune
Oh, look what I'm holding here in my fire
