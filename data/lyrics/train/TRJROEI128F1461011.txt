Funtime strolling in the sunshine
In your lifetime get a little funtime funtime

You and your baby together on
A picnic in the park
Under a tree
Where you promise to be
Very careful with you heart

So let the spirit inside
Spread its wings and fly
Uphard to the sky higher

()
Funtime strolling in the sunshine
In your lifetime get a little funtime funtime

Sounds of music in the air
