Jimmy dreams
He's a child to the end
What a joy
When you are you're best friend
And the world's such a toy
If you just stay a boy
You can spin it again and again
Jimmy flies
With no use for disguise
Just escapes
Using mirrors and capes
And the words do the trick
There is no bigger kick
Than just rhyming again and again
