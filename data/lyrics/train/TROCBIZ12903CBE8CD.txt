Oh Superball
I'm trying to get you to to show you how to laugh
How I'm hurting from throwing you too hard
And now you're all alone in the big world
When we were young
I used to play with you for hours in the sun
And I controlled your superpowers
Yeah you
Were always on my mind
And you stayed in my pocket all the time
You say you dream of things
You never lacked before
Could I be in your dreams
They're sleeping on the floor
Please hurry babe
