I can't believe it's happening
One more step away from being
What I never thought I'd be
So tell me
It's funny how the pieces came unglued
It's funny you think you have a clue
As to the nature of this game.
We play.

I'm beneath you
You're beneath me
Scrape it all away
Until I'm hollow.

I can't believe it came to be
One more step away from losing
Everything inside of me
...
