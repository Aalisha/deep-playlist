(Sounds of a car... tires squealing...)

Mmmmm red light, green light
Speedin' through the dark night
Drivin' through the poundin' rain
I gotta see Jane

Windshield wipers splishin' splashin'
Callin' out her name
Just gotta see Jane

I left her arms to find my way
To find a place for me
In the world outside
I wasn't alive
I could not survive

The frantic pace, the constant chase
To win the race
Turned my heart cold inside
I've gotta find
What I left behind
...
