DORIS: Powder your face with sunshine
BUDDY: (Spoken) It always is shiny, Doris
DORIS: Put on a great big smile
BUDDY: (Spoken) You mean like this?
DORIS: Yeah, make up your eyes with laughter
Folks will be laughing with you in a little while

Whistle a tune of gladness
Gloom never was in style
The future's brighter
