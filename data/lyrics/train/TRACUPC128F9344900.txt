If I could slow you down, down for an hour
I'd show you that tonight the world, the world is so small
Here is me and you, here is the mission
The distance, the race, the miles to crawl

They got us cornered in
You're afraid to leave the house
The whole place is surrounded now

This is the way, this is the way out, the way out
This is everything that's right
If they want a war, this is the struggle, the struggle
This is more then justified
