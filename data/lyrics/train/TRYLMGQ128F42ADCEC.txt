Feel your power
Feel your fury
Feel your glory
It's all over me

Your invitations got me prisoned,
Got me chained, I don't want to ever leave.

You're my end, Yeah, you're my beginning!
You're my everything
You will be the death and life
You're my end, Yeah, you're my beginning!
You're my everything,
You will be the death of life and me!

Seems you're jealous
Seems you're longing
Seems you're zealous to own all of me...
