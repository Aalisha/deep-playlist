Breathing in, breathing out
I can sit and watch for hours
You're my TV, you're my book
Knowing, learning when I look

I'm just hanging biding my time, there's no other by my side
I go down and down and down the river rages
And I see you in the mornin' then you're gone

I'm waiting around for the evenin' 'til you're home
If I could change the way this is I'd stay with you
But if you don't know what I feel now what can I do?
