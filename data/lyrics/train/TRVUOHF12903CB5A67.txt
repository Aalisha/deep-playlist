Little girl little girl
Are you out of your mind? whoa
You can't turn all your corners then act blind, whoa
Well I seen that girl at the show was bobbin her head
You're in the crowd spinning your drinks instead, whoa
Well I'm fine with being alone
I know it's all my fault
Why couldn't you figure it out?
Well you've got a nice body
But it's how you act that's ugly
Why couldn't you figure it out?
So don't call me today
I got nothin to say
I'm gonna screen my calls anyway
So don't leave a message
