Thought I knew what's best for me.
 I took a hold of my destiny.
 Ran away... to find it.
 What I didn't realize,
 Just what you meant to me inside,
 Now I know... you're gone.
 
 Chorus:
 Na na na na na na na na na na na
 Do you wanna be loved?
 Do you wanna be loved?
 Na na na na na na na na na na na
 Do you wanna be loved?
 Do you wanna be loved?
