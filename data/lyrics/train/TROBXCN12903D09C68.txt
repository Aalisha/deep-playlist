I see through your clothes
Your nerve damage shows
Trying not to feel
Anything that's real
You're losing control

Meltdown's looking for a new clown
Living in a world that's make believe
Used up burned out always got a hand out
Ain't nothing here for free
Now you're hanging on the edge of tomorrow
Let go let it be

New circus freak
With black eyes that speak
