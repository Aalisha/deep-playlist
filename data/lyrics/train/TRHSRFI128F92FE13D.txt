Clean yourself out of dust from a broken world
Set free to adore
Your love tastes like mine
Empty inside but with nothing to hide

Your throat cries what used to be my name
Before the guilt drove you insane
Give in, give up

'Cause in the end you'll follow me
I'll reveal the truth and all of my needs
...
