Oh, mighty lord of the evil realm
Open the gates to your dominion
Save me from this holy light
That makes me suffer like a pig
Satan lead me to your throne
And make me one with hell
I kneel before you dark lord
And swear the unholy oath
Unholy master satan - make my wish come true
Open wide your kingdom - where all the evil rule
Lord of hell possess my soul
