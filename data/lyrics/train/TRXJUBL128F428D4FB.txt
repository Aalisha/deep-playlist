Yes more to me than anything else I've ever known
More to me than anything else I'm ever gonna see
Just your love is all that I need to depend upon
And each day that passes by you're more to me

When I'm gone away thoughts of you keep a runnin' through my mind
Like a sunny day I can feel your warm sweet love light shinin'
All over me till I'm back in your arms again
