Inside a heart of summer soul
Don't let them take it away

Cause inside's something solid gold
So don't let them throw it away

Words, they mean nothing
So you can't hurt me
I said words, they mean nothing
So you can't stop me

I said your eyes, they say nothing
So you can't hurt me
(On summer days like these)
I said words they mean nothing
So you can't hurt me

Follow your own path from here
