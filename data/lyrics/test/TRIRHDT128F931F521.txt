I will have no truck with you
I will not venture from this room
Or burn myself with fevered light
Or wound myself with all that sight will bring
I will not sing for you
(The urchin rags that once you wore

lie scattered on the road and more)
The holy grail all wondrous woken
Lies still neath ground all softly spoken
...
