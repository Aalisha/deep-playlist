I. Within these walls

Alone' afraid'
In the dark of the corner he will try to hide his shame'
Where it shows to no one
Nothing wrong in being scared, it will all fall into place
According to his dad
'But son, you just can't tell anyone

And there, deep in the night
He gets to kiss the floor once again
And though he fears his father's eyes
That is nothing compared to
The cold touch of his hands'
Of his hands'
His cold touch'

'Wipe those silly tears from your eyes
That show when you look at me
Can't you see that I love you?
I always have and I always will'
