The ahses flew by the winds
In a cold diabolic universe
Two worlds collide
Infernal destruction, armageddon reign!

The gateways opens before me
I'll transcend into the dark
Where time and apce
Transforms into nothingness

Behold the sulphur seas
Flesh torned from within
Kill the vermin of the light
Was the force of damnation

I am the one the keeper of the throne
I am the one who was the fire born
...
