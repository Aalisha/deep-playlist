We all travel light and space
To find the answer to the question
Save the human race.
Far out to galaxies unknown
We'll never give up searching
Always thinking of our home.

The sands of our existence running low (running low)
There's only one direction for us all to go.

Into the sky, high above where the eagle flies
journey to find a new home (journey to find a new home)
Beyond the stars where a new life will wait for us
Somewhere we all can belong.

Our world is dying as we speak
From policy and government
