I know the darkness blinds you can you see without your eyes
If you take one step closer, can you speak without lies

You make the sound of laughter, burn my knees and pray
All sharepened nails seem softer, as you walk away

I know there's something inside taht you would never believe
I wish i was able to finally rule your dream

Holdin' my hate against you
You'll never keep my breath
