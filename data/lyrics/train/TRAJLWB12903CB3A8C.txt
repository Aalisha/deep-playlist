He's tall dark and dangerous
He's a love thief on the run
He's a moonlight bandit
Brother to the devil's son

He'll comfort you with sweet talk
Tell you what you want to hear
Then he'll take your smilin' face
And he'll cover it with tears

Oh, they call him Poison Sugar
'Cause there's poison in his kiss
Oh, you ladies warn your daughters
About the stranger with the poison lips

His hands warm your body
Like the mornin' Georgia sun
...
