I'm a work in progress
I'm a seed grown into a flower
I'm a storm that's rising
Getting stronger with every hour
And god knows I ain't perfect
Tell me who in the world is
All I know is that I'm searching
For somebody to love me with

These flaws I've got
There all apart of who I am
Take me, all night
That I finally understand
I'm so done trying to be everything you want
When I have to stop
Because baby you ain't worth it
I've got to Camouflage
For love, for love
No I won't Camouflage
For love, for love

I won't Camouflage

I need a lot of improvement
Not even half way to destiny
But I'm a train that's moving
And everyday I'm picking up speed
And god knows you ain't perfect
...
