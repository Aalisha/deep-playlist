Think of what you're losing by constantly refusing to dance with me
You'd be the idol of France with me
And yet you stand there and shake your foolish head dramatically
While I wait here so ecstatically, you just look and say emphatically
Not this season, yes, that's the reason

I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, don't ask me
I won't dance, madame, with you
My heart won't let my feet do things they should do, yes

You know what, you're lovely
So what, you're still lovely
But oh, what you do to me
I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore
I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor

Yes, when you dance you're charming and you're gentle
Especially when you do the Continental
But this feelin' isn't purely mental
For heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos

And that's why
I won't dance, why should I?
I won't dance, how could I?
