I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet
Dry your eyes, Sunday Girl

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide, Sunday Girl

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your lovin' means to me

She can't catch up with the working crowd
