We'll say a friend of mine, a fella I know real well,
came to me on Friday and he had a story to tell
I've heard it a thousand times, but this one hits close to home
The woman who left him I've taken for my own
Love leaves you no choice in the matter
and there ain't a damn thing sadder than a man
in the throes of something real
The woman that lays down beside you,
she can't help or hide you
It don't matter how she wants to feel
...
