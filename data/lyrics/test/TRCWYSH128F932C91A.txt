It's happy hour again I think
I might be happy if I wasn't out with them
And they're happy it's a lovely place to be
Happy that the fire is real the barman is a she

Where the haircuts smile and the meaning of style
Is a night out with the boss where you win or you lose
And it's them who choose and if you don't win then you've lost

What a good place to be don't believe her
'Cause they speak a different language
And it's never really happened to me

(It's happy hour again)
Don't believe her oh no
'Cause it's never really happened to me
(It's happy hour again)
