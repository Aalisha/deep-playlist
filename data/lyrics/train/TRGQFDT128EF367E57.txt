[Verse One: Damien]

With this mic in my right hand
I can reshape the face of the world
And shift sands
Child, woman, and man stand on command
Communicating with others across foreign lands
Understand
The Word can bring wisdom to a fool
A destructive weapon
Or constructive tool
The Words that I speak
Can give power to the weak
Courage to the meek
Hope to the bleak
The power
To combine with minds of many kinds
Whether written or recited
Or spoken within a rhyme
In time
The way my very life is defined
Crossing over cultural and economical lines
The ability to break barriers
Break bread
Break ground
Break it up
Break it down
Words can contact
And impact with sound
Make contracts with verbs
And attack with nouns

[Chorus]

What's The Word
People all around stay bound
By The Word
Spoken in tongues
Or even sung
What's The Word
...
