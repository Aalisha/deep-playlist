Tank fly boss walk jam nitty-gritty
You're listening to the boy from the big bad city
This is jam hot
This is jam hot

Friends tell me I am crazy
That I'm wasting time with you
You'll never be mine
That's not the way I see it
Coz I feel you're already mine
whenever you're with me

People always talk about reputation
I don't care about your other girls
Just be good to me

Friends are always telling me
You're a user
I don't care what you do to them
