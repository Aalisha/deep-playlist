I'm tired of this shit
I'm tired of these silly ass games
I can't even look at you no more
And I don't think you'll ever understand
Until you get a dose of your own
It's your turn now

Crazy how I never use to say a single word
I just held in all the hurt, all this hurt
And I was so afraid you might flip out
And leave me in the cold
Then my mind ran out of space
So many stories untold

How would you feel
If I put my girls before the one I love
How would it feel
If every time you wanna talk
I turn the TV on
How would you feel
If when we're making love
I don't go down no more
So you know how I feel
Get ready cause a 3-6-0's about to go down

Taste this
And let's see if you can handle it
Just one sip
You probably choke on your own medicine
Taste that
Once you swallow then I got you trapped

No more running
No more hiding
And if you try
I'm still gon find ya
And get you back
Get you back

Listenin' to my conversations
On the other phone
Got somebody followin' me
