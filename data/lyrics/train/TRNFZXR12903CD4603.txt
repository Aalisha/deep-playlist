I know, I know, I know you want to see me fall
I hope, I hope, I hope you know I'm not that small
I'm big, I'm big, I'm bigger than you wanted to believe
For that you'll keep coming back to haunt me

Congratulations, they are in order
Is that enough for you
If looks could kill they have to kill you

How do you sleep at night?
With all your demons at your side
And every time you use your name
There's a girl like me going down in vein
