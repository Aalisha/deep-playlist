She was soft
She was unbroken
Dressed in the pink
That she wore as a token
To the summer
To the summer

Always clean
Always precautious
She was the devil
And she danced with the roses
In the summer...

She was rhyme
She was the reason
I left my life
For a sole that was freezing
In the summer...

Always cold, always in endearing
Sweet in the woods
She was naked and kneeling
In the summer...
...
