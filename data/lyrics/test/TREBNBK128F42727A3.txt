Willing to sacrifice a love once given but not shared living in remorse
On better days she threw stones
Emotions hardly breathe
These love birds don’t share the sky

Two eyes were not enough
But just enough to say you’re not alone
It’s where true beauty lies
There was no sympathy for you just a heart ache
