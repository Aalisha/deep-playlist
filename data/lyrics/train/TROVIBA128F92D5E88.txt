We shared a bed but never touched
Next time we compensated in a rush
We're showing no signs of fatigue
I've Got a friend to act as a go-between
There's a distant drawl to your delivery
You deliver me.
And when I'm dry you resuscitate me
You resuscitate me.

This bed's too tight
Stepped upon your records in the night.
Put on your favourite skirt
've got a plan that will never work.
This isn't the first time but it still feels innocent
I just want to kiss you.
There won't be a time when my mind strays to you
...
