Yes, I live in the black woods, where you dare not
even speak my name.
If there is evil in your heart and you come near me
you will lose your sane.
My form is mystic, but my heart is pure,
you'd better believe what I say:
I am the Necromancer.

I cast deep spells and potent:
I am a Seer of the Real.
