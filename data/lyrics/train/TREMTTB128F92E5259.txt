Death feels like the butterfly
Can't escape the scarred lie
Real relationships must die
Underneath a scarred lie

We globalize the others lies
We sanctify the great disguise

What if change gate
Don't watch it show your shape

Desperate in death
Death will tell them
Death will kill them
Death will tell
