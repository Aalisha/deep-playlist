[Baby, baby, sign my contract on loveBaby, baby, sign my contract on loveBaby, baby, sign my contract on love]
Baby, baby, sign it
Sign it
Sign it
Sign it

You say you love me
And I believe it's true
But before I let myself go
Here's what you've got to do

[(Sign it)(Sign it)(Sign it)(Sign it)]
You've got to sign
[(You, you, you'd better sign it)]
My contract on love
[(You, you, you'd better sign it)]
Write it in your heart
[(You, you, you'd better sign it)]
