Wooden Jesus, where are you from?
Korea or Canada or maybe Taiwan
But I didn't know it was the Holy Land
But I believed from the minute the check left my hand

And I pray, can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in
