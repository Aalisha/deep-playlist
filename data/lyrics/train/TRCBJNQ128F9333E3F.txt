Intoxicating pleasure
nothing is so sweet
honey, than the blood in my veins.
Now the way im feelin
I'm not as sure im heat
I can't wait to go down in flames.
Ow

I'm closing on you'r body
you shiver at my touch
tell me baby, what can i do?
Wiggin' like a junkie
need a sugar rush
lemmie love the hell out of you.
You gotta gimmie something
Oh yeah
you gotta give it now.
Oooh, well it feels good
take it all the way
come on honey, jump all around
Feels good
take it all the way
