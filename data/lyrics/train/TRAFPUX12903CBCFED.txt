I've been hiding my sins in the ground
All the while without making a single sound
This in spite of the fact I know you're all around

Oh my God, don't show me heaven
I don't want to have to tell 'em ... there's more

Train of thought slips my tracks once again
And I'm holding the hand of a long lost friend
...
