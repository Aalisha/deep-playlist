It' a hard life but you play it for laughs
It's a cold-hearted business keep away from the draft
And your fingers and your throat get sore
But they're out there callin' for some more

So play on
(While the lights shine around your head)
Play on
(Every night in a different bed)
And the nights go on and on

Get a break and find a place you can hide
'Cause tonight you've got to be a star personified
You're rushing round to get your plane
And it's back in the bubble again
...
