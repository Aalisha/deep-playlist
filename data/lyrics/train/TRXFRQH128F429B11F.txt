Give me everything give me everything you want
I'm sure that It's lovely
Give me everything when I reach the top
I remember to forget

Show me everything give me everything you love
So I can ignore It
Show me everything when I reach the top
I don't want you beside me

I feel like being alone I feel like being alone

Sell me everything everything you have
