I've got to find my baby
Now, I'll search this town
I declare, I wouldn't lie
From do' to do'
I've got to find my baby
And the love that I crave
I declare, I wouldn't lie
I can't find no mo'
I ain't had no real good lovin'

Since that girl said, 'Good-bye'
I got to find my baby

I declare, I wouldn't lie
Now, if I was the Good Lord
I ain't had no real good lovin'
Pretty woman would never die
Since that gal said, 'Good-bye'
You may look good, baby

But you got to hang yo' head an cry
If I was the, Good Lord

Pretty women's would never die
I got to find my baby
You may be good lookin', baby
I declare, I wouldn't lie
But it's hang yo' head an cry
I ain't had no real good lovin'

Since that girl said, 'Good-bye'
I got to find my baby

I declare, I wouldn't lie
