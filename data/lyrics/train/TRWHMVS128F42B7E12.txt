Through the clouds
A nice surprise
To see that twinkle returing to your eyes
I've searched my head
For some old spark
We fell around this place
Stumbling in the dark

And when I feel the skies will never clear
You remind me spring is near

How you sparkle
How you shine
How you rise above the sky
And you rise, and you rise
