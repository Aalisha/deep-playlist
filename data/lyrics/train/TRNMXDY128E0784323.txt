When they try to tell you knowledge is a dangerous thing
"It's such a dangerous thing"
The people that have it are the people that sin
And the people that need it are the people that can never win
"They can never win"
Let me get you out of here Little Broken Wing

There are people round here that are right
There are people round here that like to sleep at night
There are people round here that go slow
There are people round here that don't kindly to the killing of the buffalo

When they tear up all the treaties and break up all the plans
"They break up all the plans"
Did you do your duty and kill on command?
Did you know the redman used to roam this land?
"He used to roam this land"
Now the souls of lost warriors blow across the sands

People round here they get it right
People round here we like to sleep at night
There are people round here that go slow
People round here that don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo, oh no

So listen to my story and listen to it well
"You better listen well"
Listen to the glory of the gory details of the tale I tell
Did you know the redman very well?
"I used to know him well"
