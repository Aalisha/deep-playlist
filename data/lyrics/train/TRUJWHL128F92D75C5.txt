Carbon copy aftertaste
The taste of lips so delicate
Stop the click and watch the room
Sitting pretty in full bloom

Your stain on my fingers
Like a headache that the pills won't kill
Your stain on my fingers
Like a headache that the pills won't kill

Hold your breath this is the part
That I've been waiting for
Words spill out in front of you
...
