Don't tell me I'm dying... got no time for grief
Don't open that door – now let me go back to sleep.
I'm just in a phase of fading, I´m left here trading my soul
I'm spinning that big black hole
On borrowed wings; nor flesh, nor skin
We drift like feathers in wind

Not the end, but I sense it is near
