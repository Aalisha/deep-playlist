She asked me to work on that knot
Now I've been at that
Coalface some time
I've been trying to untie that knot
I'm trying to work it to a soft spot
And lie there a while
Just south of her shoulder
And west of her spine

Now you'd think that I could
Untie that knot
I'm the one who put it there in
The first place
But it's like trying to remember
Where you've buried treasure
