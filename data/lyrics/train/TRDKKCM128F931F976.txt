If only time could take away,
the truth that lies beneath this pain
It brings me back to what I'd hope for this to be
But here and now, I'm on my own
I've lost the will to carry on,
please shine a light to guide me home

Will you take me from this place I call,
my home's forever broken
I have nothing in this heart at all,
this life seems meaningless, unspoken
Words can't convey,
I'll move on anyway,
I can't hide behind what I don't know
Have I lost it all?
