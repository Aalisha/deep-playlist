Sunlight goes down, as you pack up your things
Feelings amount, we can work out the kinks
Your eyes on fire, as you drag him towards the door
Your bags so heavy, leavin marks across the floor

I guess, I win, Goodbye Again
Go spread the news, Oh and don't forget your shoes
It's going to be a long walk
And you know what you could lose
Oh, when you've got mountains to move

I suppose you cant leave the mark of all your saints
You aim too high, and I'm just trying to keep it straight
