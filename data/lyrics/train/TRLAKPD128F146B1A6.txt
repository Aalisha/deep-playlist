I wait for sundown on the fire escape
And watch the passing cars downstairs
I'm high above Korean groceries
A sublet castle in the air
It's down to cigarettes and rosaries
Christ, I wish someone would call me
Johnny Thunders on the radio
Ah but "you can't put your arms
Around a memory"
Maybe I could find a better way
But all I need is to feel connected now
Do you remember me
I sang that song you like
I sang that song for free
Now someone else sounds like me
As I make my way downtown
Downtown
Oh yeah
Downtown
...
