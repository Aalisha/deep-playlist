I hope you creep, I hope you crawl, hope you're feeling weak
So now you're lost like never before, I am the end, the end of it all
I feed on the weak, cause they're the easiest prey
I lead them astray, mankind has always functioned this way
Somethings you won't ever understand, still you want to be dead as I am
Allthings are not to be understood, so you imitate as much as you can
Somethings you won't ever understand, still you want to be dead
Blocked all the roads that lead you, so you imitate as much as you can
