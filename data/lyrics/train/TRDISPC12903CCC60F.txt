Court is in session
A verdict is in
No appeal on the docket today

Just my own sin
The walls, cold and pale

The cage made of steel
Screams fill the room
Alone, I drop and kneel
Silence now the sound

My breath the only motion around
Demons cluttering around
My face showing no emotion

Shackled by my sentence
Expecting no return
Here there is no penance
My skin begins to burn

(And I said, ohh)
So I held my head up high
Hiding hate that burns inside

Which only fuels their selfish pride
(And I said, ohh)
All held captive out from the sun

A sun that shines on only some
We, the meek are all in one
