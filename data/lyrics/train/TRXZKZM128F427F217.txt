I know you can change if you want
Your change is right here & now
If you want

I know you can change if you want
Your change is right here & now
If you want

There's is no problem to hard
That Jesus can't fix
There's no habit so strong
That Jesus can't brake

There's is no problem to hard
That Jesus can't fix
There's no habit so strong
That Jesus can't brake

I know you can change if you want
Your change is right here & now
If you want
