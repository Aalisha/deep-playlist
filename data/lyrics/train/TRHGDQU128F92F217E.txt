Well I've got a gut, gut feelin that you 
Have made plans to take me home tonight 
Well come on baby, come on let's ride 
I'm down if you can take me 

Well it's a sad way to make it right 
But it's a good way to break the ice 
I've never looked at you the same way ever again, no 
And you're so crazy 

You keep me on my feet you're so, Rock n' roll, whoa 
You're the captain when we're lost at sea 
Drop the anchor down, make sure no ones around 
We'll ride this boat baby you and me 
Baby you and me, whoa baby you and me 
...
