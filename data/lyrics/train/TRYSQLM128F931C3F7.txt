"Where am I? I smell fire..."
"Burn... burn... burn..."
"Fire... fire... fire..."
"What have I become?"
"Why do you think they call it dope, dope?"
"It's gettin' hot..."
"Oh... no..."

Satan is his name from hell he came
Some call him Lucifer
But he hides his horns in many different forms
But still is Lucifer
