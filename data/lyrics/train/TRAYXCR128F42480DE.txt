Oh dear mother why did you give me a birth
I didn't ask to be born
Oh dear father can't you see what you've done
I'm not the one you wanted me to become

A coward I am and a good-for-nothing
Still I can walk over you
When my head is down and I'm in distress
Moonshine is my gentle mistress

A drunkard I am and a yokel, too
...
