We drew a crowd. The crowd drew the blood. Fawning swindlers.
There's a shark in the stream where the newborns are baptized.

Who let the flatterer into the gallery on our sweet sixteen?
Take him away. Get him against the wall for the witnesses.
This is doom in a borrowed suit. It's a pickup line at a funeral.
Cannibals along side the catwalk.

But it's ok we've got old blood and our veins are rooted to the hornets nest again.
New love is tasteless.
We're wearing down.
This is the year of the party crasher.
