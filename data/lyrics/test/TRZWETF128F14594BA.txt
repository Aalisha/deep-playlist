Now is the glimmering spinning beginning
Of something I've prayed for and counted the minutes
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows
Of night here with you in my arms

Nothing is breathing as sunset is leaving
Except you and I in the stillness of moonlight
We're tenderly touching in silent caresses
Counting on time to slow down

This is the moment that pauses to hold us
As you and I move in a background of wonder
Surrounded by countless enclosures
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy
...
