Love turned my head today
I, I turned away
Your smile for all to see
It used to be for me

But you know
You made your bed now you lie in it
And don't come to me
No, don't come to me

Thank you for goodbye
The best thing you ever did for me
Thank you for goodbye
You set me free from my misery

Thank you for goodbye
