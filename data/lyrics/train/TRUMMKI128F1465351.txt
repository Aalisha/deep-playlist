The hands of time have spoken for the chosen ones
cold steel glistens in the dawning sun;
(It's) destiny and claidemaugh that embraces me
All here to sacrifice for victory,
Hidden in the shadows when the cold wind comes
.A mist queen dances for her fallen sons.
Over and over, her shadow falls over me.
Remember no retreat, from here you
die where you stand.
