Too much thinking's a dangerous thing
You left me standing waiting on my own
All I want is a passionate relationship
You just wanna stay at home
To save money you've got to pay the price
Cos nothing's never ever really free

"stay tuned for details", was all I heard him say
I wonder what I should try and do
The phones are tapped and the television's looking at me
So how on earth can I get through
Hide in a corner wait 'til it's all over
Hold my breath until I turn blue

They're coming for you
They're coming for you
You say you care but I don't believe you do
Even though I know how hard you try
Didn't I tell you long ago
Didn't I tell you long ago
