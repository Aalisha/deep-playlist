It's hard, can't afford to stop
Keep on working till you're fit to drop
Then comes the weekend and my troubles go away
Monday morning brings them back again

No, no, no, I'm not satisfied
Can't there be more to life
No, no, no, I'm not satisfied
I can't see reasons why

Going steady have been a while
Ain't ready, not by a mile
I try to tell her that I'm not the marrying kind
...
