All I have is gone
Let me in and I'll take you away
Tonight I'm all alone
I know the chance is gone with the day
I know the chance is gone with the day
I cry, help me, I'm afraid
Help me, I'm afraid, she's gone
I try to hold the love with me
To hold the love with me, she's gone
She's gone, she's gone
I'm alone
