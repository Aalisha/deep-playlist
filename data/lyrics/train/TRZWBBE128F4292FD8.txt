Intro: Grand Puba

Brand Nubian baby, here to flip it again
And you know it don't stop until the party ends
So get your hands up high, if you feel me reply
Cos you know these brothers here we keep it extra tight

Verse One: Lord Jamar

Look, listen and observe, it took precision to connect
The words of dialect within a rhythm you never heard
Forbidden fruit, take a bite, you could lose your life
like how they crucified Christ Musa's hair was white
Lord Jamar, Sadat X and Puba's here tonight
We got next on the court, I don't know what you thought
This flow can't be bought, only sold in exchange
for platinum ang gold, you've been told, open up the manifold
Only to reveal scrolls and scrolls
Premeditated to be dedicated to lost souls
Properly educated, never sloppily operated
Playing the beats for all my people incarcerated
We stay in the streets and find new ways to eat
Crime wave, I remember wetting my feet
in my blind days, now these niggas getting they heat
from under they seat, I wonder when the guns'll deplete

Chorus: Grand Puba
