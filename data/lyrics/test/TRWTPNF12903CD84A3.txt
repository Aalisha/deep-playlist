My heart is just so big
And just a bit sick
I'm just a little monster

I just think i love you
But you think you are too cruel
So you're just a little monster

I love my little monster
and their owner
I scream once in a while
and then i realise
That they are all my life

I love my Little Monsters 
and their owner
I scream once in a while
and then i realise
That i need them to be alive

I said one day, i'll fly
They said we'll breack your
 wings at night
So they are just Little Monsters
...
