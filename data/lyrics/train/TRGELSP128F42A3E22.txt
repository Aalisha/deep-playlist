Something just isn't right
I can feel it inside
The truth isn't far behind me
You can't deny
When I turn the lights out
When I close my eyes
Reality overcomes me
I'm living a lie

When I'm alone
I feel so much better
And when I'm around you
I don't feel...
Together
It doesn't feel right at all
Together
Together we've built a wall
Together
Holding hands we'll fall

Hands we'll fall
This has gone on so long
I realize that I need
Something good to rely on
...
