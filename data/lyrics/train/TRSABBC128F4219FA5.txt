Still awake on a winters day
Skies are gray and they're cold
Smoke signals from my last cigarette
Lets me know that it's finally getting old
Everybody hates me for the night before
The man you saw wasn't me
And now there's blood upon the bathroom floor
I've got a disease

Wait a while
All I need is a friend
Come on, stay a while 
Won't you please understand
Understand?

I'm fucked up with nothing ahead but the end
