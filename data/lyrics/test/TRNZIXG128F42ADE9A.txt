My life is over, at least for 94 weeks
I look like some metal mouth freak
And that's a long time

I wanna go to the party
But I don't wanna be seen
I wish it was Halloween
And I could wear a mask

Woe is me, life will have to wait,
Until my teeth are straight and that's a long time
Can't you see life will have to wait,
...
