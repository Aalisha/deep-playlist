City to city we travel in vans from
The east to the west coast
To places abandoned
We'll stalk through a small town
For traitors and strangers
The road is not salted
But we'll take our chances

We drive and take in this world from the window
We roll and move to the beat of an engine
We stop, another day spent by the side of the road
Pick yourself up and continue to run

This life is not for everyone
