As a kid my nose would be
Inside a book of poetry
I memorized the movies where
Into each other's eyes the lovers stare
I.e. Zhivago with his Lara in their cottage
In the snow

Ten below with only love to keep the warm
I soon discovered with alarm
Real life could not compete
With fiction or widescreen love, on the street
No face was shining there to meet me
In soft focus... guess my heart
Blew the part
...
