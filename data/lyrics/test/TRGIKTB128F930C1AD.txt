uh, V to the Izza
Chicago, we on the map now
A lot of new faces in the game
Looks like it's about our time
Some of y'all getting ahead of y'all selves
Fronting like y'all kings
I respect what y'all doing but
I air all y'all the fuck out

From the eye(?) of the violent storm, darkest cloud on a funnel mission
With slugs that travel through barrels with tunnel vision (whoa)
Clips too extensive, spit too offensive
From the Chi, love don't live here no more, rent too expensive
Push weight in a sentence, tell them not to wait on my sentence
Am I God's personally weapon of mass destruction or Satan's apprentice?
Nice, but I'm hating repentance
Coca-Cola killer; twist your shit, leave a prize under every cap, no blatant resentments
Look, let the drama come, I'm bent on having it
The crowd don't move, whoever intends on grabbing it
Is fighting off full blown AIDS with Flintstone tablets
Whether niggas feel me or not, regardless (bow)
Heartless (bow), spit in front of the hardest (crowd)
If they start booing, I'm sticking fans Artest style
Recognize bitch, the darkest cloud
Motherfuckers, I'm back

Guess who's back in this bitch again, full term
Yup, your worst fears confirmed
You better learn
The crowd don't move, wait your turn
What else can I si-say?
(V to the Izza)
Guess who's back in this bitch again, full term
...
