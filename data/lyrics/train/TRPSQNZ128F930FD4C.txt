Chorus:
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me
This is my heart
Loving and kissing and holding you tight
Letting you know everything is all right
Do you love me
Do you love me

We belong together
The love I feel is strong
And I wouldn't take the world for exchange for this feeling I have inside of me
...
