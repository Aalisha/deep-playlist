When you need some lovin'
Pick up on the loveline
Dial person to person
To my love
Plenty midnight touchin'
Pick up on the loveline
Dial person to person to my love

Girl, I've seen you hurt so many times
Feel mistreated, heart broken in two, yeah
I got to wipe those tears from your eyes
And I'll be satisfied with a woman like you

If you let me take you
Through the night
Guaranteed you're gonna
Feel alright
All you got to do is
Drop a dime
You can bet your bottom dollar
I'll be on time

When you need some lovin'
Pick up on the loveline
Dial person to person
To my love
Plenty midnight touchin'
Pick up on the loveline
