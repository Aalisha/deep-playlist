Emptiness hold my hand and join me here tonight
Let me be your friend
Let's look at girls in fights
Let's get drunk
we've got nothing to lose tonight
Give it away
It's ours so give it away its alright

Could it be that my situation does that it suddenly seems like the worldis coming down on me
I must try and find substance or sense and stability
