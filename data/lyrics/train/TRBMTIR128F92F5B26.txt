this drowning sorrow is shaking me
more than it ever has before
the road signs reading bitter end
leave me suspect of a crime

the city air chokes me today
more than it ever has before
i'm nervous to feel deserved
by these street signs anymore

are you
going to
be waiting up when i get home
we'll stay up all night
getting drunk and watching sunsets on our porch
...
