Strike the ground
There's not a message in the sound
Hold out your hands
When your God's not listening.
Best believe, best believe
You'll be systematically
Placed to die tomorrow
With a taste, so sweet
It could drain the sorrow, the sorrow.
We're living through your eyes
But inside we start to die
We count our losses.
Strike the ground
There's not a message in the sound
Hold out your hands
When your God's not listening
The common ground of a modern day escape
Is calling for the listening.
You can't pull your way
