MC am I people call me Uff
When I rock the party you bust a nut
Feadz is breaking out the beat
Shit be hotter than me
Me and he our crew's a militia
Better watch out my clan gets vicious
Bad ass bitch I'm rated-X
I'm gifted ain't gotta sell sex

Cross the beach onto the street
Gotta work hard no room to cheat
Crunk and grime that's my bloodline
Feadz is mixing, Uffie's shouting
Uff is banging, Feadz is banging
Time to get low
Do the tootsie roll
That's how we do
Do it hot

And if you understood would you
Stop hating and playing hard
I got a loaded bodyguard
Don't make him pull out the Glock and pop
Uffie's gonna make this shit rock

Like doe, doe I like
Boys call on me when they feel freaky hot
I run this show you got too slow
Pick-up the pace with you cracked out face
Uffie is banging, Feadz is banging
Time to get low
Do the tootsie roll
That's how we do
