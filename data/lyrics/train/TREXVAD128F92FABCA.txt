Got a four leaf clover and my lucky charms
A piece of the rainbow too
Got a dream in my arms and I know now
That dreams can come true

You're an angel from heaven
Your smile's like the sunshine in a sky of blue
Oh, I, oh, I've got a heart full of love
A heart full of love, got a heart full of love just for you
