I'm listenin'
Caught up in a web of deception
From this shit I done learned new lesson
So what cha do, you keep on playing, you play on, playa

From love to confusion
You keep getting but you keep losin'
So whatcha find comforting, your boozin', bosom
Heart brusin', I'm the one

From the high note to the low pains
You see destruction but no aftermath
Only voices you hear in your head
They all laugh, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha, yeah

From your denials to your delusions
Everything you gain you keep loson'
What you not know, this is an illusion
So what the hell you're doin'

He's looking and looking
He's looking and looking
He's looking and looking
He's looking at you, he's looking at me

He's looking and looking
He's looking and looking
He's looking at you, he's looking at me
He's looking at us, he's looking at we
Ah shit, he's lookin' at me

You wake up, baby boy, but you're not sleep
You test full but you're not it
You're running fast but you're not on your feet
And your speed is dead

You run along but you not know
You climb inside but you can't grow
Faster and faster until you fall to them floor
You screamed on but don't sing along

You work and work with no pay
You punch a clock but never end your day
You take vacation but your not playing
What we say by this time, here my friends, drink three
You cry, cry, revolution, but what you want is a solution
But you're more content with being a pollution
Jump in the motion, and ask the notion

He's looking and looking
He's looking and looking
He's looking at you, he's looking at me
