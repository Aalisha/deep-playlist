Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the rivers run
His wife would cook his meals,
As he would check the wheels.

Singin' poor Tom, Seventh Son,
Always knew what's goin on.

Ain't a thing that you can hide from Tom
And there ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom.

He worked for thirty years
Sharin' hopes 'n' fears
Dreamin' of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work's gone,
Lazin' out in the noonday sun.
