Written by D. Minogue / A. Moody.

Let's do it
C'mon
Hype it up

Come on and Jump to the beat (jump)
Come on and dance with me
Come on and Jump to the beat (jump)
Come on and dance with me

Your life's a passing star
The price you paid was dear
You make the most of my life
Yet movements dance with fear
Your speciality's only nights
As you and pride compete
Neglect the pain in your heart
Come on and dance with me

Come on and Jump to the beat (jump)
Come on and dance with me. Yeah
Come on and Jump to the beat (jump)
Come on and dance with me oh
