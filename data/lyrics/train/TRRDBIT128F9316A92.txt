Whenever I step outside
Somebody claims to see the light
It seems to me that all of us have lost our patience

'Cause everyone thinks they're right
And nobody thinks that there just might
Be more than one road to our final destination

But I'm not ever going to know
If I'm right or wrong
'Cause we're all going in the same direction

And I'm not sure which way to go
Because all along
We've been going in the same direction

I'm tired of playing games
Of looking for someone else to blame
For all the holes in answers that are clearly showing
