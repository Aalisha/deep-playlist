Evil rising from the ground
Tumbling walls a piercing sound
They're looking for your trembling soul
His evil eyes burn through your soul
Not a man but yes a foe
Its judgment day taking it's toll
Judgment day from the unferground
Burning hell hounds coming for your town

Chorus
Figth, for your right, to live
So fight!
Fighting death, till your end
striking death!
