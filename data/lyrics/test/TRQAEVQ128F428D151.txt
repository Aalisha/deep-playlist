In the name of...
In the name of...
In the name of...

Hey you,
I've seen your face before
It's you in the picture which hangs on my bedroom wall
Is it true? All of those things that they say about you
So tell me, tell me, tell me what am I supposed to do
(chorus)
In the name of love, yeah
In the name of love
...
