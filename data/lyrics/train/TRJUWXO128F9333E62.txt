Everytime I walk away
It feels so wrong
Tell me why I never stay
Where I belong
Uh, take me home
I dream of a dawn
in a blue holding eyes, yeah

What keeps me loving you
It's easy to know when we touch
What keeps me loving you
It's easy to know
When it's love
When it's love

Everytime I say goodbye
