Feel like a broke down engine, mama
Ain't got no drivin' wheel, lord have mercy
Feel like a broke down engine, mama
Ain't got no drivin' wheel
You all been down and lonley
You know just how Willie McTell feels

But it's, Lordy Lord, Lordy, Lordy Lord
Lordy Lord, Lordy, Lordy Lord

I've been shooting craps and gambling
Good God, and I done got broke
I've been shooting craps and gambling
Sweet mama, and I done got broke
I done pawned my 33 special, good gal
