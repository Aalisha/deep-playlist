I need somethin' like morphine only better
I need somethin' like a kiss that lasts forever
I need somethin' like money that will not burn
I need somethin' and I need more, more than I can earn

I need somethin' like a cure for my soul
I need somethin' like amnesia, for things I know
I need somethin' like a mother, 'cause I'm just a child
I need somethin' like an asylum, 'cause I go wild

I need somethin', what can I do?
