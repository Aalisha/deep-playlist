Of every moment I can't stop movin' on now
I leavin' town so, the reason I won't give you
I have no memory of everything we've done now
If you don't carry me then I might fall


Refrain:
In your sweet religion
And by my side you would always be
And then we'll be forever
And by my side you would always be

There's nothing I can't tell you
...
