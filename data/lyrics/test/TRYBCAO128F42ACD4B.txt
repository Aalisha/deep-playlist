Funky Ceili (Kay-Lee) Bridie's Song
Bridie was teachin' out in Carysfort
I was workin' in the bank
2 pay checks every friday
And a Morris Minor out in the back
But I was mad for jigs and reels
Drinkin' dirty big pints of stout
When the Bank of Ireland gave me the boot
They said "Don't let the door hit your arse
on the way out."

Fiddleeee diddleeee deidelydee
I was born to play the funky ceili
Over the seas and far away - off to Amerikay
Fiddleeee diddleeee deidelydee
