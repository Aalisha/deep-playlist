I could stay here in darkness to dream all alone
But the daylight follows wherever you go
I could fade out and back down like I always do
I can't take the chance of losing you, no
Now I couldn't lose you
Chorus: I don't wanna wait for something I want
A minute too late, the moment is gone
I don't wanna be stuck in my head
With nothing to show
And I don't wanna wait for something I need
And maybe I don't know what I'm doin'But it's the sweetest confusion
It could be I'm crazy, got lost in your eyes
