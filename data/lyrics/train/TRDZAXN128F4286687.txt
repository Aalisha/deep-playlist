Rise above the ground, where you lay,
you've been laying there so long.
You've just about, forgotten how,
to live your life.
Well, you can't find where you belong,
no, you can't find where you fit in.
Don't you think it's time you gave your life a chance again.

You're ready to rise,
You're ready to rise,
You're ready to rise,
You're ready to rise.

You're ready to rise,
You're ready to rise,
You're ready to rise,
You're ready to rise.

Tear down all the walls, that surround you.
The walls that are outta your mind.
Turn reality into from what you see,
and what's really going on.
Break away, yeah leave today,
...
