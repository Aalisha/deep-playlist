==================
 Mesh - Trust You
 ==================
 They wait for you with open arms
 They testify your charms 
 And lovers understand 
 The future that you've planned 
 
 But all the people you took advantage of 
 (They were less than nothing to you) 
 And all the faces 
 That tried to give you love 
 
 I was just beginning to trust you 
 But you let me down again 
...
