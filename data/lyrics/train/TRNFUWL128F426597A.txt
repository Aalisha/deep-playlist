As I look out into the night
And count the stars all shining bright
I wonder where I am and where I'm going?
Sometimes I think I've lived before
I seem to see beyond a door
But it's just a crazy notion I leave showing

I live my life as sensitive as possible, then one day
Maybe I'll wake up young again with feelings of a new way

But what we feel I know we'll miss
And someday I'll look back at this
And know by then the life that we were meant for
But I see you leaving
Leaving by my back door
