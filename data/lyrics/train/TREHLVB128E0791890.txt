I close my eyes
Thought I was lost but I was stranded
I go outside
To my surprise the sky had landed
I thought it made more sense
If I could only keep you guessing
I was a fool to think
That I should stop you from undressing
Now I'm believing all the words you say
That I can't say back to you
To you

So I fall
I don't want to feel this small
You know I just can't handle this
Handle this at all
And I'll just fall
I let my heartbeat drop
I falter as the music stops
