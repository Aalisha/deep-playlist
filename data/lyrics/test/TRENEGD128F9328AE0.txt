One, Two, Three, Four

As I look at the moon (As I look at the moon)
My eyes are closed
You have gone so soon
Like the moon (Like the moon)
You know what I miss?
The old you
You're a cold hearted fool (Fool)
You swore to me that things were still cool
How untrue (How untrue)
The cards have been delt
And my hand doesnt exactly rule

As I look at the sky
I was glad I didn't cry
I lost that feeling

Love- thrown away (Away)
I'm happy that you are undauntedly mistreating me
But you see
I won't acquiesce to your charms so the choice isn't me
