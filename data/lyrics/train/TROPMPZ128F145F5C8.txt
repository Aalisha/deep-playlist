(Adams/Kennedy)


I'm tossing and turning and I can't get to sleep
Got something on my mind I just can't release
Then she whispers so softly that she believes in me

If I let her down and tried to disguise it
She always see's through it always replies that
No matter what I do she believes in me

All the times I failed gone slightly off the rails
She's there to remind me she believes in me
When it all goes wrong and I feel I'm on my own
