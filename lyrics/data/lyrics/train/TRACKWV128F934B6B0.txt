Imperfection inherent
This disorder in creation of life
Within this endless reign
Vision of lost words rise

Black god to raise hate in veins of the apocalypse
Holocaust of this testament in perceived idea of doom

The left hand of darkness shall bring this final redemption

Held in this testimony for the opening of revelation
Unleash the revenge
Bound in the inverted rites

Raise the great wargate in promise of the fallen ones
Adorned in rank through dark incantations, marching forth
