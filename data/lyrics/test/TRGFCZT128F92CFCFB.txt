Oooohhh
oh babe
oohh

Why do people smile when no one's smiling?
Its coz their thinking of someone they're loving
Keep on believing we are meant to me and
Nothing's stopping you and me from going to heaven
Sweetest love

I got the sweetest love there ain't nothing sweeter
I got the sweetest love ain't nothing beat it
There ain't nothing sweeter

Now we're clever is about to inch just one ladder
It gets better every second we're together
Oooh baby it feels so right
A new beginning starts tonight
The reason for when it's on
Is because of you and me and
Sweetest love
