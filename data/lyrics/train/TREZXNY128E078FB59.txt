Rollin' down the highway
With a trunkful of work
I just lost my job
Didn't wanna be a mailroom clerk

Besides it didn't pay but dimes
And the boss had a disrespectful mouth
If I wasn't on parole
I would've knocked the motherfucker out

So I'm drivin', gotta get me some fast cash
Ain't tryin' to hurt nobody
Mama, maybe it's wrong
But I gotta get the money, it's a must have

If I get caught, I go back to jail with no bail
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I'm convinced so, ain't fakin'
It's the life I choose

Win or lose, that's the way you play life's game
If you play it wrong then you're the one to blame
If I can choose I would make a change
But it's the same old song that everybody shame

Now, I'm my own boss
And I ain't got no friction
'Coz I'm a bootleg pharmacist
You don't need no prescription
