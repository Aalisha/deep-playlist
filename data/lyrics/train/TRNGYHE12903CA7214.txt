What do you say when you're stuck?
When everything is messed up?
When you're so used to running away?
You know what I'm talking about
They're right suddenly you're left out
It's not so easy this time is it?

How far do we go?
How long must I wait?

I'm waiting and waiting
For what I don't know
I don't need approval
Your love or your home
If you won't accept me
