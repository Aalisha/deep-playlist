I really don't feel like talking on the phone
And I really don't feel like company at home
Lately I don't wanna do the things I used to do
Baby since I lost you

And I don't want to sing another love song babe
I don't want to hum another melody
I don't want to live my life without you babe
It's drivin' me crazy

I really don't feel like smiling anymore
And I haven't had the peace to sleep at all
...
