by the school
on the street
you were dropped off with a sign,
"this piano is free"
you didn't look free to me

cast aside
obsolete
since they cancelled music class
you've been a refugee

but now I'll give you a home
corazon

so I pushed
and I heaved
but your weight bore down like I could not believe
had you accepted defeat?

till the crowd
gathered round
put away their goings on and hunkered down

and they were cheering you on
corazon
...
