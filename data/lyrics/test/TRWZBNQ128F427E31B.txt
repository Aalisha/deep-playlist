I think I've found myself an angel
A pretty girl who makes my life complete

Ever since the day I found her
She's all that I dream
No other so lovely
I've never seen such a face

There are no words that can explain
The feeling she gives me
And every time that she smiles
And I look in her eyes

I fell in love with a beautiful girl
There's no one that compares to her
Never thought Id be so lucky
