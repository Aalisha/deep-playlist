I see you here, night after night
All by yourself in the blue neon light
A drink in your hand, a tear on your face
A beautiful woman so out of place

I guess somebody told you goodbye
In a million years I couldn't understand why

What kind of fool
Didn't want you
What kind of fool
Tore your heart in two

What kind of fool
Didn't do everything he could do
To hold on to you
What kind of fool
...
