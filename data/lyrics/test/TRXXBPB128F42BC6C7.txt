I hate to be, to be the one
Who's given up
And feels that all our hope is gone
But what I thought was a miracle
Just turned into the same old
Problem that it was

She longs for better days
She's always been afraid

And it's a shame, oh, it's a shame
That you are throwing your whole life away
And it's a shame, oh, it's a shame
I wonder if you're ever goin' to change
Oh, it's a shame, yeah
