Realize the pain envision the fear
That goes on every year
Devour your pride acknowledge the hate
That we see everyday
Decide weather to fight for your rights or let life pass you by
Confide within the strength of yourself do not ever lay down and die

We're at the edge
We're closer to death
The beginning of the end

We are the ones who pay
