Yes boss, yes boss, yes boss, yes boss! 

Police In Helicopter are searching for marijuana. 
Policemen in the streets are searching for cali-weed. 
Soldiers in the field, burning the cali-weed. 

[Chorus:] 
But if you continue to burn up the herbs, 
we gonna burn down the cane fields. 
If you continue to burn up the herbs, 
we gonna burn down the cane fields. 
soldiers in the herb field burning the cali-weed. 

Police In Helicopter are searching for marijuana. 
Policemen in the streets are searching for cali-weed. 

[Chorus:] 
But if you continue to burn up the herbs, 
we gonna burn down the cane fields.
