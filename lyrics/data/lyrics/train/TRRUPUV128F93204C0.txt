I need to tell this secret be sure to keep it down
If this gets out I don't know what I'll do
I've held it in through many heartaches and all you did was smile
Can't you see I've fallen in love with you, with you
Apology accepted, erase what's in the past
You need me you don't need them
And in spite of my mistakes, I've learned there's so much I can take
I can't believe what I'm saying
Don't walk away so quickly I haven't lost it yet
