Girl smile, take a picture if you can
Girl smile, take a picture if you can
Girl smile, take a picture if you can
Girl smile, take a picture if you can

Oh snap she done posed for me
That flash run off and she did it on the toe for me, put on a whole show for me
Like boom boom snap, boom boom snap, to my boom boom clap, boom boom ooohh
Lable told her to shake that laffy taffy and she did exactly what they do in Georgia so I brought her across the border
'cause she said she never saw that arch before, so I showed her how to pose with that 6.0

Yeah that's that new dance that new dance that'll make your whole crew dance
Funny thing about it she don't even have to move and
Jump left jump right show that moment
When you boom boom snap in that Kodak moment
