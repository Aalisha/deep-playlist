He's an innovator
Don't care what you give up
He's one of the ones
You hate that you love but you can't get enough.
So Get your head out your ass now,
Quit wasting my time.

So make up your mind

Soulcrusher, no other.
Soulcrusher don't give a fuck about you

He's the old unforgiver
The cold shoulder giver
He's one of the ones
