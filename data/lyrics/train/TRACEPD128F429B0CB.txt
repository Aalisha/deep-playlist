Subject A wants to throw it all away
He's sick of all the pain
Wants to turn it into rage
Learn how the barrel tastes
Before its too late

I just want to get through the day
We're all just shades of gray
In a long and frantic race
To catch a dying day
(I just want to get through the day)
For one second I'd slit your throat
Spill blood across the floor
Put an end to this game

They thought you would have learned by now
But you're still questioning (God would this be a better place without me?)
