they say love finds its own way home
around the snakes inside your heart and underneath all the bones
and though the world may fold you in its pocket you wont ever bend
your not the type my only love my only real friend

and what about the girl who ran
she ran so far away she could never find her way back home again
she slipped and fell and broke her heart
and now all she does well is fall apart
so c'mon c'mon baby c'mon yeah

and what about this starry sky
