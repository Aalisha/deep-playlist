So ya love your money, honey, love the dope
Fill your dreams with a thousand hopes
You know I just don't know
What you're looking for, oh
And now's the time, but its' just a little too late

Shy, she was shy
She took a one way ticket on an endless ride
Well it's on and on
She ain't never coming down
Right, it's alright
Being hungry child
You know it ain't no crime
Her burning fire, just looking for a better way
