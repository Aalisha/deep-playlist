Well in comes di ting dem call di broken heart
This blessed love will never part
Yuh dun know it's from the start mi tell dem seh a Dutty Yeah!
A Sean Paul and Sasha, come sing for dem baby

Boy you make me holler
Boy you make me sweat and
I can't get your tenderness
Still I can't get you off my mind
What is it about you baby?

It's the dutty dutty love

I'm still in love with you boy'
Well I'm a hustler and a player and you I'm not a stayer
That's the dutty dutty love

Say girl, try to understand that a man is just a man

Blessings loving from the start but you know we had to part
