I lost my girl and I lost my world
And I know I fell 'cause this is over
Only time will tell
'Cause I lost my girl and I lost my world
And I know I fell 'cause this is over, over

I said things I shouldn't have said
But I know all feelings aren't dead
So forgive me is all I can say
And maybe you might one day

I tripped us up and fell right over you
So how can I turn one back to two?
Or have I just left you much too long
For me to right so many wrongs?

When I lost my girl and I lost my world
And I know I fell 'cause this is over
Only time will tell
...
