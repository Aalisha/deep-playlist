*mike and wanya talk in the beginning:*
Mike: hey, what's wrong squirt?
Wanya: I don't know man. sometimes around this time of year I just get depressed.
Mike: man, this isn't the time of year to be depressed. it's the time to be happy and
Giving, man.
Wanya: you know, sometimes I think about things that are happening in the world today,
Things I didn't have. I just feel like crying.
Mike: we all feel that way sometimes. but, it'll be alright.
Wanya: I just, I just wonder why.

Every day at this time of year
I wonder time and time again
Why are kids suffering?
All of the tears 'cause being caught in the crossfire (why? )
Somebody tell me why
As the joyous day comes along
The eldest feel there's something wrong
He's looking for mom but she's not there
