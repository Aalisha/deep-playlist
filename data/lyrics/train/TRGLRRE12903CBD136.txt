Whoa, oh
Oh, yes

You're my super hero, ooh, you rock my world
If you show me how I can be your super girl
Give you super, super love 'cause you're super, super hot
Give you more than little bit, give you everything I've got

Do you think of me like I think of you?
Hoping that what I feel is what you're feeling too
And I wanna go through a few things to describe
Just what's in my heart

There is no height that I won't climb
There is no light that I won't shine
There is no time that I won't find
And I'm so glad I found the time tonight

There is no other place that I'd rather be
There is no other face that I'd rather see
The way that you do me is somethin' like a movie
Waking up to you is just like waking up to Superman

It's a bird, it's a plane
It's Superman
I can be your Lois Lane
Superman

There ain't nothing you can't do
I just wanna be with you
And I hope you feel it too
You're my Superman
