I want you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better than what you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
...
