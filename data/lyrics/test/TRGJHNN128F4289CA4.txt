I'm goin' to Kansas City Kansas City here I come
I'm goin' to Kansas City Kansas City here I come
Got some crazy little fellows and I'm a gonna get me one
I'm gonna be standin' in the corner 12th street in line
I'm gonna be standin' in the corner 12th street in line
With my Kansas City baby and my bottle of Kansas City wine
