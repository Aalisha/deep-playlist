There's a place where a kid without a cent
He can grow up to be president.
A magic kingdom filled with barbie dolls

If you've got the time we can make it a good time.

Americanos - blue jeans and chinos

Coke
Pepsi and oreos - americanos.
Movies and heroes in the land of the free
You can be what you wanna be.

They know how to advertise

Sell you anything at any price
