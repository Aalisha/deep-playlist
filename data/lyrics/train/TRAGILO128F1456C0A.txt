New York City, look at me now
Being stared at from behind the plow
Mississippi, don't get annoyed
I ain't no hippie, just a New York Boy

Didn't want the mayor to come
Or a big brass band to greet me
But then the reception I got
Well it wasn't what I had in mind
People gawkin' at me
Like I'm talkin' strange
Me, I ain't much better
'Cause I'm thinkin' the same
Hey boy
