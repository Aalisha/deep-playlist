Look at me now, I'm losing control.
I don't know what to call myself.
I know that I'm sick of playing a role.
All along I've been kidding myself seeking out a set reality.

That means I'm okay, and everything is okay.

All along I've been kidding myself.
Life is falling apart at the seams.
Somehow I'm doomed to go over the same ground in these
