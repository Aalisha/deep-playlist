I wake up, wake up in the morning
'Cause them boys come knocking in the morning
Then I have me girl go flush it in the toilet
Them say did someone get murdered on the corner

Them say did someone see me, seen someone get shot
Them say they saw me there
My *** they won't break me
Man, I'll go crazy before they make me tell

There was a murder by the corner house
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Them boys asking questions now
No, no, no, no, no

Now everybody seen it but don't nobody know
What happened to the boy down the street a week ago
Ain't nobody talking, they keep it on the low
Don't open your mouth when they knocking at your do'

'Cause *** die out here for snitching
They die for snitching, okay
These *** die out here for snitching
They die for snitching, okay

Those who break the code we dig them hole
What's worse than a street *** that sells his soul?
Via the life we chose, we picked our roles
