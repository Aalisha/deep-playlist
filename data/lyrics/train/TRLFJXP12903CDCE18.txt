This hunger
I'd sooner fall to death than taste the bitterness of your demands
You must remember 
That you can't be cleaned, cleaned by filthy hands
I am eternal
I can't be broken down
I can't be hurdled
You'll have to take the crown
(2x)
I won't be silenced by you
I won't be silenced by you
I won't be silenced by you (this isn't over)
