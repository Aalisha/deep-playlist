Up here in the land of the hot dog stand
The atom bomb and the Good Humor Man
We think our South American neighbors are grand
We love 'em to beat the band

South America, babaloo, babaloo, ayyiyi, babaloo
One favor you can do, ayyiyi, you can do
You beautiful lands below, don't know what you began
To put it plainly, I'm tired of shakin'
To that Pan American plan

Take back your Samba, ay, your Rumba, ay, your Conga, ayyiyi
I can't keep movin', ay, my chassis, ay, any longer, ayyiyi
Now maybe Latins, ay, in their middles, ay, are built stronger, ayyiyi
But all this takin' to the quakin' and this makin' with the shakin'
