Everyday feels like a Monday
There is no escaping from the heartache
Now I wanna put it back together
'Cause it's always better late then never

Wishin' I could be in California
I wanna tell you when I call you
I could've fallen in love
I wish I'd fallen in love

Out of our minds and out of time
Wishin' I could be with you
And to share the view
We could've fallen in love
