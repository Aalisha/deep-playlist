I'm feeling all messed up
I have a voice inside my head it says
Turn to the left then it says turn to the right
Don't want to bring you down
But I am really needing guidance now
What would you do within my shoes

(Don't cry)
I'm going crazy
(Stay high)
I've never felt so low
(Don't hide)
I want to turn and run
