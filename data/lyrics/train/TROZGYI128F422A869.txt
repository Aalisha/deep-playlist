My heart in so full of sorrow, so full of revenge
I can't sleep, the night is like horror
Feels like I'm losing my mind

Pre-Chorus 1

Can't eat, I can't sleep
I feel like a creep, living inside me
I'm fading away

Chorus 1

I'm haunted by dreams of desire
In the night I'm on fire
I am down where it's hot
