I've got no idea when it first began 
Some said it's four hundred years since we've been down here in slaves 
Some said it's from creation we have been trampled on
History said it's true, a man practise what he preach

But I will not stick to that and live on - a next man idea, a next man idea (cause) Everyday you are one day older -
who can stop that - which man can change that
So I will not mix up my brain with no wrong idea with no hearsay 
...
