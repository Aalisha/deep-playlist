She was standing at the station
small town suitcase in her hand
there were dreams she found inside her
that no one cared to understand
she never talks about her childhood
so much past to leave behind
she's so scared to go
but still she says goodbye.
When you walk that road
you walk alone
just an undiscovered soul
in the great unknown
when you only hope
is to find a home
just an undiscovered soul
in the great unknown
in the great unknown.
Born and raised in poverty
daddy died when he was young
all the fears that raged inside him
his spirit need to overcome
each day he tears down the reflection
