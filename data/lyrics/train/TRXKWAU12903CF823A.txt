Hold Strong, come from behind. Take them down.
Replace fear with pride, hold your ground.
As I run from all that’s left, I can feel I’ve reached the end.
As my feet sink into the floor, my arms won’t fail me now.
And my tongue won’t taste the sand.
The winds won’t hold me down.
I will stay alive, now we are reaching the end.
