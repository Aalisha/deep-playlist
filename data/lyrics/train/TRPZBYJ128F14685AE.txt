Words and music by roddy frame

Chorus:
I put all the love and beauty
In the spirit of the night
And I'm holding my ticket tight.
Stupidity and suffering
Are on that ticket, too
And I'm going down the dip with you.

I swear I'm touched but then I'm tired
Everyone who tries to tie me.
'cause I seem to realize
That my cup overflows.
