There is nothing
You can do
That I have not
Already done to myself
There is nothing
You can do
That I have not
Already done to myself

There is nothing
You can do
That I have not
Already done to myself
No there is nothing
You can do
That I have not

Already done to myself
Never wanted to dance with nobody not you
(do do do, do do do, do do do, do do, do do)
Never wanted to dance with nobody but you
(do do do, do do do, do do do, do do, do do)

Never wanted to dance with nobody but you
wouldn't take no for an answer you focking bitch
...
Be nice
Be nice to me
Don't let me
Be-- be nice
Be nice to me
Don't let me go
(don't let me go)
I'm too cool

For the second grade
I'm amazed
