Hush now, let's not end before we start
Hush now, lay a whisper on my heart

Time flies, when you're lying next to me
Your eyes, are the only thing I see
Let's make this moment last
Try not to move too fast
Just bring your lips to my ear

Don't say you love me,
Don't say you love me yet
Don't say you need me,
Some things are better left unsaid
...
