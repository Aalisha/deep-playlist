Well, I went into a home one day to see some friends of mine
Of all the books and magazines, not a bible could I find
I asked them for the bible when they brought it, what a shame
For the dust was covered over it, not a finger-print was plain

Dust on the bible, dust on the holy word
The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find, there's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the bible and redeem your poor soul
