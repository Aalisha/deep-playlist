Here With Me

Wet sand on a foggy beach, the sky is gray
You would call it a perfect day
And naturally I'd have to agree
If you were here with me

When I'm hanging out with all my friends
Something still holds back my smile
Something tells me they're the enemy - the enemy
'cause you're not here with me
No, you're not here with me
