Confusion, I trashed me life
Confusion, get me out of my site
Confusion, she just annoys ya
Confusion, do I love her or do I just destroy her, yeah

No matter what I do, I can't seem to kick it, and bustin' through
My confusion, thats what I've got

I want you out, out, out, out, out of my head
I want you out, out, out, out, out of my head
I want you out, out, out, out, out of my head
I want you out, out, out, out, out of my head
Right now

Confusion, rotting from the inside out
Confusion, shocked from the brain drain out
Confusion, how do I feel
...
