Tell me!
How will I ever forget this
24 years of isolation?
24 years of black.
I will never forget this
24 years of seperation
24 years of pain?

I will never forget this
24 years of ignorance
24 years of hate.
How will I ever forget?
Raped and used with my own blood
You stole my life and dreams.

You are my darkest fear.
I will never be the same
I will never smile again
