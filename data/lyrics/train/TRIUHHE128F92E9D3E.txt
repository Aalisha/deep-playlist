I've got a secrect to tell,
A midnight confession.
I love the life that I lead,
But it's no obsession,

Because I'm waiting, anticipating
watching for your return
you'll come and get me
you know I'm ready
enjoy my stay, but you'll take me away

Like a thief in the night
like a runaway train
like a first class lightning fast hurricane
...
