Love, life, one speaks for the other one here
And love, life, one speaks for the other one now
We'll try to get by

Did anyone try too hard? Well I guess I did
I guess I did, alright, she'll break my heart
Did anyone try too hard? Well I guess I did
I guess I did, alright, she'll break my heart
She'll break my heart
