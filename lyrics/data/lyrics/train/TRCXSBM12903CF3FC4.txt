Endless suffering
Enduring the pain
Cast aside tolerance
This torture remains the same

This endless torture remains the same
Eclipse and masking all that you ever were
Shards of reality slicing through your mind
Escaping this grieving nightmare

And I fall into nothing
Forever jaded
And I hold onto nothingness
Dissolving my senses
