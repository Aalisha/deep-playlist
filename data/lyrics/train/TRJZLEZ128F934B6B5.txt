Escape the lethal teeth of faith
This snarling mouth that bleeds words of this darkness
A binding obsession for the last grasp of air
Procession in plagued blood below this horizon

Embrace this stain of un-divine
Torture of sickness in consumed
Helpless in offering of this confession
Kiss of this lifeless transfer

Escape these rites of the sky
These torn wings of the defied
Force this silent murder of spoken praise
Beneath the regions of cold and flame

Birthed from cold blood

Symbolism of tainted thought in blood filled eyes
Sinister laugh of disfigured ideals, these hands were bound by nails
