So many have lost their way
So many have fallen to their grip of faith
Controlled by their words of hate
Divided, we ravage our homelands

The abundance of of numbness can claim self-rule
Diseased transmission can claim us all

A system of panic enslaves
The binding obtainment brings darker days
A stand must be taken to save
No cries for us, the war is waged
It's done
