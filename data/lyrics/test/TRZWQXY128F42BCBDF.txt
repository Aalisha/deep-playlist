Freeze, I'm Ma Baker
Put your hands in the air
And give me all your money
This is the story of Ma Baker
The meanest cat
From old Chicago town


She was the meanest cat
In old Chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really mowed them down
She had no heart at all
No no no, heart at all

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was really tough
She left her husband flat
He wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along
'Cause they were mean and strong

Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, she taught her four sons
Ma Ma Ma Ma, Ma Baker, to handle their guns
