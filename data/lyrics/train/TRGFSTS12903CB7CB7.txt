Moon, I'll get it!
You be the earth, and I'll be the sky,
And we could sail to the top of the world.
Be my love, won't you be my life, And we could fly to the top of the world.
Now, won't you think about it now?
Now, make it realer now you seem to feel her now,
And let it roll.
Moon, I'll get it!
Moon, I'll get it!
There's a curtain high
In the corner of the sky;
Someone's behind it, I don't know who.
It might be love, but I'm not quite certain
The lady isn't certain, too.
Don't let it rain on me tonight.
Don't let it rain,
I need to feel the sun again.
Oh baby, please don't let it rain.
