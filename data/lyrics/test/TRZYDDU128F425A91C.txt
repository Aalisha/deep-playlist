Well the first time that I saw you
You were standing in the rain
You were waiting at the station
For the last connecting train

Well, who will you go to
When there's no one to betray?
And I said, who will you go to
When your best friend turns away? Hey hey

Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me

Last time you're gonna let me down
Last time you're gonna fool around with me
