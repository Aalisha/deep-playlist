No, No, No, No, No, No
I don't want you to go
No, No, No, No, No, No
I don't want to lose your love
Lose your love
Don't throw our love away

Maybe it's over
And if it is don't mind me
Saying, it's been a strange love
That's carried us there

And if it hurts you
And if it makes you cry
We've had a love, a love to last years
Should've pulled us through all of these tears
Don't throw our love away
...
