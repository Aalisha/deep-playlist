I See a Shattered Nation
I See a Life of Crime
I See a Brilliant Future Going Down, Down, Down
I Feel These Walls Are Closing
I Think This Is the End
Undaunted, Falling, Falling, Descending Like a Cigarette Unwanted

Would It Make You Happy If
Everyone Around You Smiled
Then You Wouldn't Have to Hide
The World'd Be Yours
And You Would Be Mine
I'd Be Your Rasputin in Blue Jeans
