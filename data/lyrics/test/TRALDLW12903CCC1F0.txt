Ain't it fascinating the difference between those who have
You know there's those who make it and there's those who never may
And it's fascinating because it's really very clear
You've either got it honey
Or you ain't...

Well you go and you tell me your ambitions
But then you say Rome wasn't built in a day
But Thomas the Imposter he lived a lie
It didn't matter at all that was his way...

Ghosts of Princes in Towers
They're the soft boys and how
...
