It's late, it's late
We gotta get on home
It's late, it's late
We've been gone too long

Too bad, too bad
We shoulda checked our time
Can't phone, can't phone
We done spent every dime

It's late, it's late
We're 'bout to run outta gas
It's late, it's late
We gotta get home fast

Can't speed, can't speed
We're in a slow-down zone
Baby, look at that clock
Why can't it be wrong

If we coulda left home at a quarter to nine
Woulda had fun and plenty of time
We got started just a little bit late
Hope this won't be our last date
...
