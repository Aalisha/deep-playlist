That's what she said last night
That's what she said last night
You're about to get it alright alright
That's what she said last night

I went down to Kinkos
To get some faxin' done
My ex girlfriend works down there
She was my number one

She said Billy I'm busy
Why don't ya come around back
I'll clear the store and lock the doors
We can fax all night

That's what she said last night
That's what she said last night
