Whenever I get lonely
I have a vision of you
You made me feel so warm and cozy
I don't know what to do
So I call you every morning
Just to hear you when you wake up
And hope that we together be
For all eternity Let me take you somewhere
Far from all your troubles
So I can hug you kiss you comfort you
And hold you through night
We can start a new beginning
One that never has an ending
...
