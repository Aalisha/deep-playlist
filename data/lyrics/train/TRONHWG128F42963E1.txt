I'm not waiting for a king
to rule my mind or anything
I don't need your band of gold
to take me where I need to go

There's an edge to life
that will cut you like a knife
when you lay your head down.
There's a castle of sand
that gets kicked in your face
to see how easily you'd fall from grace.
There's a piece of dust
that crumbles in your hand
if you decide to lose control.
No one can escape
