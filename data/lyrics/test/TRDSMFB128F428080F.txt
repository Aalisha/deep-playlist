[Hook - 2x]
If you a person, and that's hiding
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide, be careful how you live
Cause once you lay it down, baby ain't coming back
So when you come through this bitch, hell yeah we coming strapped

[Z-Ro]
Motherfuck I heard a trumpet blow, what happened to the sun my nigga
First on and five coming out the sky, nowhere to run my nigga
Could it be the final call, prepare to be judged
But if it's Armageddon and you weaponless, prepare to be slugged
Ducking and dodging, the soul snatchers
Refusing the mark of the beast, on my head and my wrist
Leaving demons dead in they own piss, until I lay me down
Motherfuckers looking for no one but the harmed, gon stay underground
Up in the Rocky Mountains laughing at us, when we try to run
And ain't no fearing beef on God liers, speak the truth or ton
One foot on the water, one on the land, there's no more time
Ain't no more struggling, no more poverty and no more dying
Nigga get your life right, by living your life right
Cause going against the grain, gains prison in your life right
One hundred and forty-four thousand, are gon make it
