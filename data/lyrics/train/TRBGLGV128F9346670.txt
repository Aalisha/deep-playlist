We can make our dreams come true
So I will watch you think it through
You know I'm right

I heard you crying for the second time tonight
We can build it up our way
We can shape the world our way

If we stay here we die here
We'll never get away
If we stay here we die here
With nothing left to say
(repeat)

We can take this world apart
And make ourselves a brand new start
You know I'm right
...
