She's assigned a witch to spell my heart
And now I'm drawn to her
And my feigning resistance is waning
Light as gossamer
And I mind

In this dark, flint a spark
Shady lady, it glows out of you
Through this complex of cobwebs
Revealing a heart for open view
And I mind, I mind, I mind, I mind

Follow the lady, go far
Follow the lady, go far
...
