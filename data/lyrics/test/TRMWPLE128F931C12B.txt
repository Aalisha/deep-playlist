Anything is possible, anything is possible
Anything is possible, anything is possible for You
Kingdom
Kingdom
Kingdom
I know that you've been thinking, I see it in your eyes
You're holding on to something, still you don't know why
So walk by faith and not by what you see
Trust your heart and let yourself believe, believe
I can do things, things you never knew
Change your world, make it all brand new
I can do miracles if you want Me to
Anything is possible for You
Anything, anything, anything
