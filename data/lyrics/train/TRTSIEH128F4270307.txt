I've seen your face before
Somewhere, somehow, I know
Of that I'm sure
You turned and smiled at me
And started something I
Never thought would be

I wish that you and I
Could meet again, someday
I've never felt this way
For anyone else
No baby

This is love, this is love
Oh I think I'm falling for you
This is love only love
No one makes me feel like you do
No one but you
