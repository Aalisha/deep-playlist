If i could make my livin'
Goin' fishing
then i would make my livin'
with a line and pole
put food on the table
give the money to the landlord
buy some workin' clothes
cause i ain't
making money goin' fishing
like i'm paid in the factory

if i could pay these bills
with my guitar
then i would pay these bills
with some rock 'n' roll
put food on the table
pay the money to the landlord
buy some workin' clothes
'cause i ain't
makin' money goin' fishing
like i'm paid in the factory

well if i could (if i could)
then i would (then i would)
make money doin' something
that i love
...
