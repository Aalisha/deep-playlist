And you're tired of your mum
And you're tired of your dad
Got you jumping through hoops
Got you shaving your legs
Let it pass, let it pass, let it pass
Over to you

And you're tired of your face
And you're tired of your nose
Got you jumping through hoops
Got you shaving your legs
Let it pass, let it pass, let it pass
Through to you

And your nose is bleeding
And your nose is bleeding
You've been lying to me

There will be no hesitation
...
