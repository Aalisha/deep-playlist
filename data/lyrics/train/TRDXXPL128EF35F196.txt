I didn't say, we wouldn't hurt anymore
That's how you learn, you just get burned
We don't have to feel like dirt anymore
Though love's not learned, baby it's our turn

We were always lookin' for true love
With our heads in the clouds
Just a little off course
But I left that motor runnin'
Now if you're feelin' down and out

Come on baby drive South
With the one you love
Come on baby drive South

I'm not talkin' about retreatin', no sir
Gonna take our stand in this Chevy van
Windows open on the rest of the world
...
