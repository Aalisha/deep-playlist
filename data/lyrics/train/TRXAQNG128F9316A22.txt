Take me away from this cold alley, recall these words before I'll die.
This is my end you need to carry, no turning back, it's my last time.

I know this night will be the last one for me, I feel so cold and I'm alone.
Save this land from that evil we've sown.
So, I can live free as a spirit in the sky.
Fading away, it's sealed in this stone wall.
Fading away, can you hear my last call.
