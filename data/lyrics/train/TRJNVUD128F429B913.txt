Birth me of blood oil
salt sugar water pales
build me black jesus
cause jesus can't save me
shackles pulling at your hair
shine me from roots out
wash me form the neck down
cut me fat stores
take me to the tree line
I'm a headin down down down
down to the river cause I don't believe in medicine
I'll crawl out shakin pale
always got the answer I got ears all around me
...
