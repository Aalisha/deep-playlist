Ain't No Way
To get you out of me
Baby, there Ain't No Way
In the whole wide world
I'm about to see
By and by
You're all I ever need
Baby, when I forget how good life is
You bring it home to me

And I say hey
Come on, hey
Come on, hey
Come on, hey
Come on, hey
Come on, hey
Come on, hey
Come on, hey
Come on, hey
Come on, hey
Hey Hey
Ain't No Way
