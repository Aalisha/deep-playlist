You said you'd marry me if I was 23
But I'm one that you can't see if I'm only 18
Tell me who makes these rules
Obviously not you, who are you answering to?

Oh, Jenny don't be hasty
No, don't treat me like a baby
Let me take you where you'll let me
Because leaving just upsets me

And I'll be around again to see these other men
That are more adequate in the age department
And I did not think you'd care, there'd be no problems here
But now you're looking at me like you're disgusted
...
