Nothing was saving our day 
There was nothing to say, 
But you said something anyway 
Claiming I stepped out of line 
Which forced you to leave me, 
As if that idea was mine. 

Oh, you stupid thing 
Speaking of course as your dear departed 
Oh, you stupid thing 
It wasn't me that you outsmarted, 
You stupid thing 
Stopping it all before it even started 

I bet you knew it would come 
That's just like you, to sit back 
...
