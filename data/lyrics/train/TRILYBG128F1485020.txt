All that I have is all that you've given me
(Ooh)
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you
(Ooh)
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you lied and I can't believe it's true
Ooh, whoa, oh

You better stop
(Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop
(Stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooh, ooh, ooh, you better stop
