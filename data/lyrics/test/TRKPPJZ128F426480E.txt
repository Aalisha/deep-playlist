What is the point of suffering?
What is the purpose of joy?
Is it true that the winner dies
With the most toys?

A lifetime spent for a dollar
A lifetime twisting in pain
A lifetime gone in an hour
A lifetime playing the game

I see the starving Africans on TV
I feel it has nothing to do with me
I sent my twenty dollars to Liveaid
I've aided my guilty conscience to go away

Now go Away
Now go away
Now go away
...
