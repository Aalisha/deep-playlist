Just give me a steel guitar, a glass of wine
And let me drink to a love I thought was mine
A love I thought was true to me
But now I'm drinkin' to her memory
A Steel Guitar And A Glass Of Wine
While my tears they glisten and the candles shine
Oh cadnle-glow, oh candle bright
Tell me who she holds tonight

And bring me wine
And make the music mine
Play another set
