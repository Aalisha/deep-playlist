You're so good to me
And your love's the inspiration that I need
Writing songs for you
Is the way I find to thank you for this

Face the music, dance to the music
Now I hear the sound of music
And your kisses take it closer to perfection

You're beyond imagination
We're the dream team
You're so good to me
