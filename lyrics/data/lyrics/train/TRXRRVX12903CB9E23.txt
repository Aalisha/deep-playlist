I hear the call when the sirens scream
Into the night where an angel waits for me
She's lookin' bad she's a killer machine
I say the word and she explodes into light
Blinding power and rage
Players run to the stage
Screaming wings fill the slivery sky
Rising on pillers of flame

And we ride thundering into the sky
And we ride
On wings of eagles we fly

Full alert she is hot for the game
I sense my enemy and fire is the warning I send
A dance of death swirling miles above the rain
...
