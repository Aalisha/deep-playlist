If you get out in the drivin' rain
Stand in the eye of a hurricane
And never think twice

If you turn your back on selfishness
And your thoughts are for someone else
'Cause they changed your life

That's how you know it's love
That's how you know it's meant to be
When the span of forever
Just never seems long enough
That's how you know it's love
