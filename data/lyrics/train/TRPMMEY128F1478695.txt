La la la la la la la la la
La la for me

[Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la!

La la la la la la la
Fool for forty na fool forever
Na so the book people dey talk
Fool for forty na fool forever
Na so the book people dey talk
I no go tell my brother like that
You tell am realize you be fool at twenty
I no go tell my brother like that
You tell am realize you be fool at twenty
Book sense different from belly sense
Fool na fool no matter for age
Fifteen to thirty, forty to hundred
Fool na fool no matter for age
