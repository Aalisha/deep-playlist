Yeah, you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy
Oh oh, yeah, you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy

Wishin' on a star's no good
Would it be said that we really could
Live out everything our hearts have dreamed of
Waiting here's never gonna be enough

You know that we could be so much more
'Cos we've only got one chance in this life
Don't you wanna do it right, baby

All my life, I wonder where you take me too
So I should take this chance, baby
All my love, I'd do anything for you
C'mon and we'll do something crazy

Let's run away, we've got nothin' to lose
We'll go anywhere, any place we choose
If you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy

Leave everything, start a life with me
We'll be anything that we wanna be
If you got the time, I got the money
We'll have it all and just be happy

Yeah, yeah, you should never be afraid to fall
