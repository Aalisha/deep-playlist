She got a frosted flake face
A Raisin Bran Brain
She's tryin' to tell me that I'm insane
(She's tryin' to tell me that I'm insane)

Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe she's right
But I ain't sleeping with her tonight
(I ain't sleeping with you tonight)

There's just one thing that I think you should know
So Baby, baby, don't touch my arpeggio

And while you're at it - get off of my planet
(get off of my planet!)
