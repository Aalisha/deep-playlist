It was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seems so useless to remain
You're the one who always tried to change me
And that is why I'll always stay the same

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
I never minded standin' in the rain
You don't have to call me "darlin'", darlin'
But you never even call me by name

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
No you don't have to call me Charlie Pride
