I was only a kid
When I said goodbye to you
Ten summers ago
But it feels like yesterday

Lost, scared and alone
Nothin' I could give to you
I tried, I really did
But I couldn't find another way

And I want, I need
Somehow to believe
In the choice I've made
Am I better off this way?

I can hear the voice inside my head
Sayin' you should be with me instead
