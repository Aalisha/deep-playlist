Don't take your love from me 
Don't take your loving baby
Don't take you ever take it away baby
Don't take your love from me

I really don't think I can make it baby
Girl I build my whole life around you 
Baby our life is life in you (me and you, me and you)

Don't take your love from me 
I got to have your love by my side
