I wish that I could stay
But stayin' here confuses me more, so I'll go
'Cause there's someone else who cares for me like you do

You are my friend, and I don't wanna cross the line
It's so easy to make you mine
I keep pushin' you away
'Cause you give me what I miss at home

I'm goin' through changes
And how do I let you go?
My mind is goin' through changes, goin' through some changes, yeah
And I can't let him go

Please don't touch me there
Temptation wants to rule me
I can't do what my body is callin' out for
I'm so confused
