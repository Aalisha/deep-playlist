The blonde lead the blind, but now I begin to see
All the things you missed when you were dismissed
Because learning always ended at three
And time after time, you pass along liability
And all the things you say, they only give you away
Because you're on the same level that you were that day

Oh! Friend! You look too deep at the cover of the magazine
But the words inside they come across deprived
And they force feed shit, but you still subscribe

And you watch, but you don't see
You touch, but you don't feel
And you'll rue the day they'll try to take it away
...
