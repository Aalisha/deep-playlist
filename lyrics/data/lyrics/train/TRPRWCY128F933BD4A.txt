Abbadon, by craft of extinction draping the altruist light
Ever- burning the splintered conscious
Cleansing the sickened and the trite
Azazel, by craft of contention forging our dread medium
Ever- killing all the slaving dogma
Rousing the timeless Elysium
Human abasement a viral sacrament
A world in ruin, diseases heaven sent
...
