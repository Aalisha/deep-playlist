Five miles tall,
And everything is small,
Everything is small...
Five miles down,
You see your patch of ground
It's not so bad at all

Breathe in, out,
And don't stop breathing!

'cause this, this is your life,
This is your world,
And everything that you've been trusted with,
It's small in your eyes,
But great is your worth,
And you can do this right
This is your life!
