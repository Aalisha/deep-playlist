I love you and I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do
Need you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you

I met this chick and she just moved right up the block
From me
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing I need
To see
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son, oh-oh, but
That's okay
Cause I wait for my cue and just listen, play my
Position
Like a shortstop, pick up everything mami hittin'
And in no time I better make this friend mine and
That's for sure
Cause I-I never been the type to break up a happy
Home
But there's something 'bout baby girl, I just cant
Leave her lone
So tell me, ma, what's it gonna be
She said, you don't know what you mean to me, come
On

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you

I see a lot in your look and I never say a word
...
