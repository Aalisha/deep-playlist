Well, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, little darlin'
Tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, let's go again
And again and again

Well, now swing me, swing me
Swing me way down there, darling
Come on, let's go, little darling
Let's go, let's go again once more

Well, I love you so, yeah
And I'll never let you go
