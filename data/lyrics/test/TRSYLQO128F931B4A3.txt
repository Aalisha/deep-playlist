I lit my love and watched it burn
Asking nothing in return
Except the lessons I will learn
By holding crazy faith

I've been touched by that bright fire
Down to the root of my desire
While the smoke it rises higher
On crazy faith

You're not asking if I love this man
I know you don't, you don't believe you can
Yet I've seen love open like a dancer's fan
It's crazy I know
But my faith says so, it tells me
