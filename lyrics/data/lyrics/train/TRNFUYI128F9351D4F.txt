You hold your head up to the sky
You say what kind of blue
are you? Are you?
Then you ride your pony round and round
It’s diggin’ a hole, right through, right through

You stumble down a yellow brick road,
Spinning your shoes in the air, the air.

Then you, hold your breath, and count to nine,
Hoping that soon somebody will find you, find you,

Go on, go on, go on, the stars are watching,
Just say, just say, just say, what you’re feeling,
You know, you know, you know, you gotta take a bow and do it your way,
