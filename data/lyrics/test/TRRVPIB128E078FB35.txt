Baby girl, I salute I salute you
For always bein' truthful
It may sound lame but I truly adore you
And listen I will always go out for you
There's nothin' in the world a cat won't do
To show that his love is true for you
We'll take walks through the park at night
Spread love in the dark that's right
Once I had mad women on my list
On the real none ever made me feel like this
I wasn't frontin' when I said that I want you
Even though it took some time to confront you
We at home in the zone elaboratin'
I'm lovin' you, you lovin' me we be marinatin'
As long as we keep it tight and build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation

chorus: (Sam Jones: I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't
