The plan of invasion
an Evil deception
Was made in the halls of the dark kingdom
To steal their riches
To slave them all
To make them kneel for a new God
The Guard woke up the sleeping men
With the sound of a bronze horn

The enemy is getting closer
So brace yourselves for assault!
Swords in their hands they killed each and every man
Who dared to invade their sacred land

Victory songs are raising in the night
Telling all of their undying strength and might
Arrows are raining from the sky
As brothers fight side by side

We're outnumbered
