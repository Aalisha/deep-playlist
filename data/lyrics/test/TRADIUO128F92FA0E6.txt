written by David Crosby and James Raymond



I feel as if i've fallen
into someone elses dream
loud voices calling and the smell of steam
the king's amongst the commoners
but someone has to steer
streamers and cannon fire distant to the ear

angels, scoundrels, faithless fools
the drivers leave their wheels
the workmen leave their tools
and the white ball hangs
...
