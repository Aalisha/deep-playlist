Got me a baby she's hard as nails
She's my, heavy metal love

She plays guitar like the ring of a bell
She's my, heavy metal love

Leather and lace you know what i found
She's my, heavy metal love

When the lights go up, she gets down
She's my, heavy metal love

I like the caress of steel
It's the hard edge that i feel
