Drawing water from the well
And spilling over on the grass.
Walking home my heart is filled with pain.
You go your way, my love,
You go your way, my love,
You go your way, my love.

And as I wander through the trees
I'm picking up the windy leaves,
I wonder where you may be sleeping now.
You go your way, my love,
You go your way, my love,
You go your way, my love.
