You once had a home, a job, a family and pride
But we all have a price we'll pay when things go wrong inside
Don't wear diamonds, and now you don't wear gold
And in the bruises on your face, there's stories to be told
In the shadow of cold stone, freezing to the bone

'Cause you're gonna spend a black night, console a sad man
In a hungry city with a million hungry hearts

When you stand in Sackville
It's a different world from the one
You knew where little boys meet little girls

As you tread your path through a jaundiced corridor
Where each day has no beginning and no end
