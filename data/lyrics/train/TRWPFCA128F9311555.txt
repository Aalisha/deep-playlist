The cold war's over
The hot one's just begun
From the shivers to the fever
Could be too much sun

If a thing's worth doing
It's worth doing well
But if we don't get moving
We'll be roasting in hell

I've got to change my ways

In the house of dereliction
In the world of neglect
No one gives a bit about
What happens next
...
