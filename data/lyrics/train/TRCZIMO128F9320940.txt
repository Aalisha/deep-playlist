Though the hammer's blind
Though the weapon's primed
Though the water's mined
You are not the last
You're not iron cast
Not a broken mast
The way that a crude anxiety knocks around underneath the crosswalk
The way that the roar of unsaid things drowns out all the small talk
Yeah, ghost walk, till the dead grow tired of the night

Though you are alone
You have never been the only one
We will reach from our points in the dark
And see where luck comes from

The god of increase
...
