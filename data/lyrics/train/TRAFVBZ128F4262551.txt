It started in a movie
Where he, he sailed around the world
And the dream became and she called it love
She dreamed that she'd be rescued
Yeah she, she wanted to be saved
But she settled there for what we call the game

It's a game
It's a game we play
In a world
In a world
In a world we heard about today
