If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby

Now if I give you me
This is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheating on me
Tell me who can I trust
If I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we
Could possibly
Spend eternity
See that's what you told me
That's what you said
But if you want me
You have to be
Fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, babe

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
...
