So you think there's someone missing
Somebody to hug and kiss and then still be friends
So you think there's more than singing
Reading magazines about the scream
I know what you mean

Now you know how it feels
know how it feels
and how does it feel?
Now you know how it feels
know how it feels
and how does it feel?
