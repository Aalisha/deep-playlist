(Master P)
Keep your head up boo,
Girl feel me, and if you love me, you gon' love me till they kill me
Girl feel me, girl feel me, I'm a thug, but love me till they kill me
Girl feel me, feel me, I'm a thug, but girl, love me till they kill me
Feel me, girl feel me, and if you real, you gon' love me till they kill me

Your friends try to tell you bout the things I do,
They say I'm just too damn hard for you,
All your friends think I'm just too thuggish for you,
But I can do what no other man can do

(Silkk)
Look
See
Wanna let this thuggish nigga in?
Scared of the life, that I lead
Can't change addicted to smokin' weed,
Can't change addicted to havin' g's,
See, you wait patient knowin' you could be draped in gold
I can't deny, me an' you go together, like daytons, and vogues
It's hard to find a true girl, that's a soldier
See when I was in jail, you come see me
When I was at home, you come over
