I don't feel like I'm at home
In the morning all alone
Trying hard to do the things I know I should
When the night time closes in
And the loneliness begins
I believe you'd want to be here if you could

Blaze a trail back to your heart
And you'll know that from the start
We've been together long enough to see
All the hard times take their toll
...
