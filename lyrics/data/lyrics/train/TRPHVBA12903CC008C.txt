Uhh, I got it good (Neo)

I put product in the street
It sell quicker than weed
I spit it raw like I'm flipping a key
I got what ya'll need (I got what ya'll need)
I got pure for the fiends
Give you more than a freeze
Through your blood stream quicker than D
I got what ya'll need (Satisfaction guaranteed)
(I got what ya'll need)
It's what niggas waiting for (Satisfaction guaranteed)

I put the whole world in a dope fiend
It's still leaning
How many years away from the game
They still fiending
My hustle and flow sound like C-notes
Smoke like a pound hit the town like kilos
I bag it up and get it cracking in clubs
Go on tours like I'm trafficking drugs
(I got what ya'll need)
Who want musical narcotics that all got it
Bomb product, it's all profit when ya'll cop it
Any hood or any city I'm pumping in
Any slum I'm in my customers come again
Spit flow by the boat load like I'm Colombian
My shipments go out to bring the money in
Like supplies that fly to Peru to buy bricks
Go out my way so biters can't do what I spit
Like Freddy told priest in that superfly flick
Player you always got some superfly shhhhh

I put product in the street
