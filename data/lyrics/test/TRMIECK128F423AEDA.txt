Long Beach Shortbus - Girl Next Door


She don't need no Maseratti
I don't even own my car
And when I feel like I'm nobody
She make me feel like I'm a star

So let me get upon her heart
Let me get upon her mind
Let me get upon her body
Let me get upon her soul

Little girl next door

Let me get a nickel, let me get a dime
Take a nickel in my pocket and we'll spend some time
