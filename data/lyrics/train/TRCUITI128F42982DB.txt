There's no place I call the height (ahh-aahh)
There's no way in a mean street (ahh-aahh)
There's no happy medium(ahh-aahh)
There's no in between(ahh-aahh)
So do your searching, until you're down (ahh-aahh)
Then realise, you're on you're home ground(ahh-aahh)

Sittin' in a white room dreaming of a life
You have got me thinking, what is paradise?

Should I take an ocean drive, coolin' from the sun
Silver screen got me thinking this is how it should be done

Take me home (ahh-aahh)
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)
Take me home (ahh-aahh)
There's no place I'd rather be now, yeah (ahh-aahh)

Stand together alone, not knowing who you are
Friendly strangely, strangely friendly
Would you keep me warm?
