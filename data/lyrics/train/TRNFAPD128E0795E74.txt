Feel what you can't see
Feel what you can't see
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sitting on your bed
Tears roll alone
I hear your tears
They tell your heart needs a home
Someone to love
Who loves to hug
Someone gentle and warm like a rug
Like a rug I'll hug your heart
Tight close to mine
They'll sentance me to death
If stimulation's a crime
I'm gonna love you
Grind and hug you
Real slow and deep
Take you to the world my girl
Where fantasies meet
So before your next tear falls
And love seems far
Rest upon my chest
And I'll divide my heart
...
