It's time to worship Jesus 
It's time to honor Him 
It's time to bless the Lord right now 

Stand up and worship Jesus 
Stand up and honor Him 
Stand up and bless the Lord right now 

(Chorus:) 
I will bless the Lord at all times 
And His praises shall continually be in my mouth 
Yes it's time 
It's time 
Right now it's time 
It's time to praise the Lord 
Right now
