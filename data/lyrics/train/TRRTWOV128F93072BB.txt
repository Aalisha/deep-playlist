Can't you see I need to find, my love, my love
Where, where is, my love
See, I've got to know
I've looked all around the world to find, my love, my love
Where, where is, my love
You can have a life with me
Every wifey's dream
With the priceless things like bling
You can have it all if I called you my love
(My love, my love)
You can have your name on a yacht
All the fame that I got
Drop the Range off the lot like free
You can have it all if I called you my love
(My love, my love)
I got the child place, the hot wheels
I got the pay, got the record deal
I got the streets, I got the crowds
I got my peeps who come to turn the party out
I got the clothes, I got the ends
I got my dukes and bubble odd Benze
I got the crib with the seashell pool
I got the hits, but all I need is you
...
