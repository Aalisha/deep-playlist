It's a call to love
Love and mercy
It's a call to give
And ask for nothing in return
It's a call to give your love away
It's a call to hope
For the hope of glory
It's a call to live
To grow in grace and try and learn
What it means to give your life away
A house divided will never stand
Let's join together
We're stronger hand in hand
