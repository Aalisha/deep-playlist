Well it struck me just this morning,
I haven't got a single thing to do.
And you know that got me thinking,
Even though I never thank it through.
Uh huh, make it real.
Uh huh.

Gimme some new religion,
Something that I can feel.
Gimme some new tomorrow,
Bring it on and make it real.
I'm drowning in sweet forgiveness,
Come on baby turn my life, yeah.
