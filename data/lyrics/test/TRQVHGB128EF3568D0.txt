Don't Stop, don't stop, no
Just keep on goin'
Until I come, until I come in

Don't Stop, don't stop, no
Just keep on goin'
Until I come, until I come in

Playing hard to get when we're together
Hard to get there on your own
When will you ever come to conscience
I'll let you be alone

You never had it better
Than when I was with you, baby
Scum back to earth
...
