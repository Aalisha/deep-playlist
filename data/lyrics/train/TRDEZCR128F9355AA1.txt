Here we go again
here we go-go-go to the temple of consumption
get your gear and start to spend
here we go-go-go with a total dedication

Here we go again
here we go-go-go to the temple of consumption
get your gear and start to spend
here we go, here we go, here we go

As some sort of prototype I serve to be
you see tomorrow's dream has never been part of me
consume today and leave the rest behind you
tomorrow's a surprise party buy a ticket too (too)
faster livin', faster, live as fast as you're able
eat the food while it's still hot on the table (table)
now spend if you can, the greens are burning in your pocket
if you spend it right now you'll get as high as a rocket

Everything you don't use will loose it's value tomorrow
consumed too much today, you can always borrow
this paradigm's the best one since the day of creation
get your gear and shape up, this is the revelation
shop till you drop has built this civilization
don't believe what you hear 'bout the next generation
if you go with a lot of toys you'll slip away a happy man
the greens are burning in you pocket, spend it while you can

Here we go again
here we go-go-go to the temple of consumption
get your gear and start to spend
here we go-go-go with a total dedication
