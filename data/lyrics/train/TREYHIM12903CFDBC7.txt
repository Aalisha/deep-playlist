Let Me Go Home 

Hurry up, baby, 'cause we're going somewhere tonight
One glass of wine and you're mine and you know i just might...
You know i just might
You know i just might

Well the room goes boom to the sound of temptations and more
Twisting and turning that girl's looking good on the floor
Good on the floor
Good on the floor
