Please forgive me for not smiling
Please excuse the tear in my eye
You were out late, you were playin'
I was alone late last night

It's gettin' too late, it can't be true
Has this lovin' world turned it's back on you?
Out spendin' your time, baby, diggin' for gold
Dig inside yourself, it's inside your soul

Sometimes love gets so hard and only Lord knows
Just to win the fight, we gotta take the scars
