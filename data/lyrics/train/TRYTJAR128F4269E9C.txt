Seems this world's gotch you down
Your feelin' bad vibrations round
Well, open your eyes girl, look at me
I'm gonna show you how it ought to be

We're gonna have a good thing
Such a good thing baby
And when your world don't seem just right
And life's gettin' you uptight

You can change that wrong to right
(Wrong to right)
'Cause I was there myself last night
(There last night)
Girl, I really had a good thing
Such a good thing baby

I, I, I won't have no one now
No one around, to bring you down
...
