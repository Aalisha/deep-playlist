I'm trapped in a world that I can't take
Where everything's unrealistic and fake
I'm hiding out and planning my escape
I hope I'm not the only one
Please come and rescue me tonight

I just wish that I could disappear
Someone take me far away from here
Do you suppose there's more to life out there? 

There's no happiness surrounding me
