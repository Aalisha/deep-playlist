You're holding bits of Styrofoam
With your face painted on to your friends
You listen to them whine and moan
About everything you can't understand

Can I just say I don't fear the light?
But darkness descends once more into my life

And suddenly we're all alone in silence
So I take a step away
I look up to the falling snow
As it makes its home upon my face

Well, I wouldn't want to ruin
Something I couldn't save
The gap will keep us safe, the gap will keep us safe
...
