(Boudleaux Bryant)
Hey Joe
Where'd you find that purdy girlie where'd you get that jolly dolly
How'd you rate that dish I wish was mine
Hey Moe
She's got skin that's creamy dreamy eyes that look so lovey dovey
Lips as red as cherry berry wine
Now listen Joe I'm not a heel but ole Buddy let me tell you how I feel
She's a honey she's a sugar pie I'm warnin' you I'm gonna try
