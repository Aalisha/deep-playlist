Before the hammers
could ring
His Blood
touched the cross
for me.

Before the hammers
could strike the nails
that pinned Him to the tree.

Before the spear
ever pierced His side
letting blood and water
run free.

Before the hammers
could ring
His blood
touched the cross for me.

When sin was nailed
thunder rolled,
the earth shook
with fright.
