Now I lay me down to cheat
On the woman I love so
And if I die between these sheets
I pray to God she'll never know

She's the best thing in this life
Why she worships the ground that he walks on
She waits up for him at night and worries
Until he's safely home
And she always believes his stories about overtime
And in 20 years beside him cheatins never crossed her mind

Aw but it crossed his
...
