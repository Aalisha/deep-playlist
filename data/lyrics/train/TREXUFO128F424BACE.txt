The love light's gone from your eyes
You're telling me little white lies
It seems you're not at home
Each time I call
(Each time you call)

I guess that I'd be a fool
Not to know your heart's grown cruel
I see the writing on
The wall (on the wall)

It's not too hard to
Read between the lines, dear
So plain to see love
...
