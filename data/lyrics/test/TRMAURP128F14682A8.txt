I realize the state of mind where you have found me
I've turned the page and rearranged the cards that life has dealt me
I've played the game and felt the pain but I am stronger now
Like the sun breaks through the clouds
Scream and shout, the last one's out, but it's not over
I know the mysteries make a wish and kiss a clover
I've played the game and felt the pain but I am stronger now
Like the sun breaks through

I feel warm rain runnin' down my face
I embrace all the love that lies around me
I feel no shame, nothing to erase
...
