We have forgotten so much since then
The scent of your breath again
Or maybe it's the way we fell
don't fall
Stop looking out to pretend
Everything is still there

We have forgotten so much since then
The scent of your breath again
Or maybe it's the way that we fell
Don't fall
Stop looking up

Pretending this is not
What it might have come from
The tide or your luck

She'd have said it's cruel
I only cared about the
Things that you don't

Anything that's right
We had much more
Anything worth losing
Pleasing you
...
