I'm back to chasing light
must be sure I keep in sight
how to change my lows to highs
and how to make my sunsets rise
you help that spark to glow
but if it fades well you just know
when to bide your time and when
to breathe it back to life again
folow
those dreams forgotten and so far
still a lot of good ones in the jar
we were always dreamers at heart
...
