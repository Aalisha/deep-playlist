(It's only one more day)

Can you wait
My plane will be arriving shortly
Right there at the gate
I pray that you'll be waiting right there for me

This time could be what
We've both been searching for
Our whole lives waking up
I'm coming back for more

(Leave your baggage behind, you won't need it tonight, enjoy your flight)

J-E-T (J-E-T)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are my jetstream lover
You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)

J-E-T (J-E-T)
You are so good for me (You are so good for me)
You are my jetstream lover
You're how I wanna be (Just how I wanna be baby)

We're so high
