(Lawrence Gowan)
On their street, on their strip
No one's ever free from their grip
You were weak, they were strong
An offer of security, a place to belong
Every now and then you'd hear a siren scream
Not exactly something from your mother's dream
They made plans, they made deals
Marked with their indelible seal
Every day, every night
You fell their mission about to ignite
Never could convince yourself there's nothing there
Now the holy face of terror is the one you wear
Another member of the lost brotherhood
