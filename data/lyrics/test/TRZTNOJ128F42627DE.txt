The sun is comin' up and I'm just goin' down
Everywhere I look the world keeps turnin' 'round
Though I said, I never would be satisfied
Oh baby, I lied, I couldn't leave you if I tried

Sometimes I get lost out on this sad old town
And every bridge I cross just turns me upside down
And every stumbling step I take back to your side
It hurts my pride I couldn't leave you if I tried
...
