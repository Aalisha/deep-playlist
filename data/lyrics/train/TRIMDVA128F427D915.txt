Laid back, laid back
Laid back, we'll give you laid back
Laid back, laid back
Laid back, I'll give you laid back

Over and over, and over, and over, and over
Like a monkey with a miniature symbol
The joy of repetition really is in you

Under and under, and under, and under, and under
The smell of repetition really is on you
And when you leave it this way, I really am with you

Laid back, laid back
Laid back, I'll give you laid back

Over and over, and over, and over, and over
Like a monkey with a miniature symbol
...
