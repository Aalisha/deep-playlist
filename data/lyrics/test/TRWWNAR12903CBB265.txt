We started dancing and love put us into a groove
As soon as we started to move.
The music played while our bodies displayed through the dance,
Then love picked us out for romance.
I thought it was clear the plan was we would share,
This feeling just between ourselves.
But when the music changed, the plan was re-arranged
He went to dance with someone else.

We started dancing and love put us into a groove
But now he's with somebody new - what does love want me to do?

Love said:

Let the music play he won't get away,
Just keep the groove and then he'll come back to you again, let it play.
