this is what i call a new day
i'll miss the worlds before the dawn
fallen or gone, i am your angel
make my wings strong, i'll keep you warm
i was sitting, tired but breathing
hoping the sun would touch my skin

come fly with me, anytime you want
my wings are made of our dreams
come make me feel anything you want
and nobody will show you we're not real
