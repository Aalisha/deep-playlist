It feels so good, you lying here next to me
Oh, what a groove
You have no idea how it feels
My hands just won't keep still

I love you, baby, oh, I love you
I love you, I love you
I just wanna hold you
Run my fingers through your hair

Oh, outta sight
Uh, right there, you like it like that
Closer, come here closer, close
Oh baby, oh baby

Give it up, ain't no use
I can help myself if I wanted to
I'm hung up, no doubt
I'm so in love with you for me there's no way out
