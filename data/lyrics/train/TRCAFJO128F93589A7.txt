You look just like an Elvis from HELL
My heart is broken, so I'm gong to HELL
Bury me way down deep in HELL
I'm a steel drivin' man, I want to go to HELL!

Then go tell Ivy oh-oh!
For the love of Ivy yeah-yeah!
I did it for Ivy oh-oh!

You're the one

Gonna buy me a graveyard of my own
Kill everyone who ever done me wrong
