I was watching Demolition Man
And talking dirty to a fan who likes my band
When I took a chance and called you up
You said you'd visit but you just don't give a fuck
So I had to put you in your place
And leave a look of shame upon your face
Stood accused for the last two years
I got off, I got off, I got off

But I
Still miss you more, I miss you more than I
Ever did before you left your spores inside
Of my empty core, a baby's got your eyes
