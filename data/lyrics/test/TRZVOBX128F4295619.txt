Choosing BPM
Is a big problem
Choosing BPM
Is a big problem
A lot of people get hurt
Just for nothing
Due to inability
To make their mind
Make up your mind
Before it gets too late
Action speaks just louder that voice
If you haven't got one
Then ask the doctor
Just ring ring ring
Call I on the phone
Self-confidence
