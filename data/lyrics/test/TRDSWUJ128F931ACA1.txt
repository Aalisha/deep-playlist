I heard you talking in your sleep
Calling out another man's name
My suspicion's killing me
Are you playing the cheating game?

Once a week got with your friends
Well, it's turning into three
Can't help but wonder where you've been
It's all become a mystery

I wanna know where I stand
Am I in, am I out of your plan?
I wanna know what to do
Am I losing you?
