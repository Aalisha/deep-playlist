I would hire the A-Team
And I'd crash the General Lee
I'd make cocktails like Tom Cruise
And I'd rollerblade with Corey Feldman for you
I'd do anything for you
Just about anything for you
I'd do anything for you, for you

I'd sing the whole soundtrack to Xanadu
I'd dance like Kevin Bacon in Footloose
