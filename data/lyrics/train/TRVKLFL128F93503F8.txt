One foot standing in the grave
One more shot is all you need you say
Poison running through your veins
That dirty needle driving you insane

Addiction hides you from the truth
Can't you see the things it
makes you do
No one wants to see your face
Now live in shame with your cold disgrace

Falling to the ground
screaming without a sound
...
