This is not a good day to call me
Because I cannot spare some sympathy
My own feeling is mostly unclear
And when I'm talking to you I'm not here
I don't think I'll ever be ready for you
But I'll be trying to help you out too
So I went downstairs for a walk
But I had no strength to not talk

Yes you were the flatulent one
And I am the boy who has a gun
