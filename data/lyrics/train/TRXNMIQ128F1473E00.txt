It was long ago
You remember though
Like it's yesterday
How you look my innocence and then you stole away
Never to return
Glad it's over now
I can laugh at now
You said I'm the one
Then you lit the fuse and so amused you turned and run
And it's me who got burned
But you'll always stay in love they say
(With the first love, it's your last love)
And you'll always be a part of me
Wouldn't want it any other way
