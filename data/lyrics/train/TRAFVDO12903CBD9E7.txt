When the night is coming down
Getting dark all over town
Everybody's gonna sleep
Not a soul upon the street
When the night is coming down
Evil people get to town.
People walk along the streets
Ugly mugs with bloody lips
Skinny hands with awful knives
Rotting teeth and spiteful eyes
Penetraiting through the windows
...
