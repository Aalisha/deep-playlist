So our open wounds will bleed
Until our veins run dry
Now we have to take this thorn
And tear it from our side

Agitated at the fault line
Still agree to disagree
You're connected to the heart
But tonight we'll set you free

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night to start over again
