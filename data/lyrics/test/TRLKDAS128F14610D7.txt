You know I live a charmed, charmed life
I look out to my left and I look to my right
It's simple but in front of me, in back of me,
It's nothing more than ecstasy,
A charmed, charmed life.
You know we live a charmed, charmed life,
A little breath of magic and we roll the dice.
Now, my darling, I'm for you and you're for me,
We are each other's luxury,
A charmed, charmed life.
Come on over, baby,
