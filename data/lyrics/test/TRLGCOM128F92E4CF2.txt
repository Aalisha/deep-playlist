The siren's sounding, the screech is warning
all is ending
Night of nights, I'm a child of the world
now derailed
They found me crying in the dark
I'm not accepting
If I sleep I am there, yet I'm always too late

Seems to me I can do in a dream
almost anything
If only dreams were real

Losing my insanity
Would mean I'm losing everything
The dream where I can fly
I'm losing my insanity
...
