Well, I looked at her face and then I knew she changed,
My heart turned black and then the sky turned gray!
My heart turned black and then the sky turned gray!

So I sat in my room for 27 days,
No she never called, I had something to say!
No she never called, I had something to say!

I don't know much and I don't know how...

Why would she put me through such torture,
I would have given my life for her,
She was the one that knocked me over,
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner
