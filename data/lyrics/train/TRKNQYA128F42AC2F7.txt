No junk food, just earthly goods
I ate weird berries in the woods
Now I'm seeing colors
I'm getting higher
I think I'll start a forest fire

There's a forest fire climbin' the hill
Burnin' wealthy California homes
Better run run run run run
From the fire

But some of us stay and watch
And we think of your insurance cost
And we laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh
At your lives

Windows covered with bars
Security guards
Is that a house or a fortress
Against the world
...
