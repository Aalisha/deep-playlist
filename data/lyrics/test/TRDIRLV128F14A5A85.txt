Just breathe

Not now, but sooner
I'm lost without her.
My trembling finger reached out to the
picture of her
nice and neat.
I'd spend the day remembering
my first encounter.
Last chance to ask her
if she'd dance alone with me
I held her near me
could feel her breathing
and told myself

To just breathe
His knees
bled begging
he believed
she'd be there forever
but he'd lost her
they had broken it off

I don't think that I could tell you
...
