The King of Broken Hearts doesn't
ask much from his friends
And he has quite a few of them
They know he will understand
That's just the way it goes

The King of Broken Hearts doesn't know he's a king
He's tryin' to forget other things
Like some old ship at sea
He's walkin' through alone

He talks to angels
