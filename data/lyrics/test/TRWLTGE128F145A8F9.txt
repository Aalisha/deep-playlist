My friends it's not what you were famous for
But now the whole world's watching you
If we could help you then you know we would
But we don't know just what to do
Eye to eye our ways are not the same
We never tried to understand
But it could pass to each of us you name
Then who's the one to take the blame

Kiev, a candle with a flame
You'll never be the same
Our hearts go out to you
...
