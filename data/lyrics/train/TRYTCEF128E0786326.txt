This European air
It always warms my face
I wish I could pass on
I will bring you stories
And bleary-eyed photos
Like a regular tourist
We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing ever will
We don't go breaking down
I feel like nothing
Suitcases down our street
Are rolling once again
I roll away with them
Five days inside Zoo York
