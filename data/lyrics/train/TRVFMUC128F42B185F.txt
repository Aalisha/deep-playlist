Get down
Get down
Get down

You need to get down
You need to get down
You need to get down
He need to get down

Yeah, I aim to spit, and maim your clique
I bang your bitch, bitch, I'm dangerous
Down I came to get, up to claim my shit
Raw like 'caine and gettin' brain from brainless chicks

It's, yo', party, do wutch ya like
Dis, my, mission, gon' fuck tonight
Up in the club and like see what the buzz is like
Niggaz who pop shit gon' feel what crutches like

The slugs is like, I keep the whole hood fiendin'
I don't smoke but I know what drugs they like
I'm the man to see, livin' the fantasy
Pocket full of Stones like Sly and the Family

Lift your shirt girl, show me the mammaries
Next week, I'll still have good memories
All I Do, the clique with me
Sign the check, nigga don't say shit to me

This is history, what rapper you know
