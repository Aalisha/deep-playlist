Aaaaah, haaa
I know a place
Ain't nobody cryin'
Ain't nobody worried
Ain't no smilin' faces
Mmm-mmm, no, no
Lyin' to the races
Help me, come on, come on
Somebody, help me, now
(I'll take you there)
Help me, y'all
(I'll take you there)
Help me now
(I'll take you there)
Oh, mmm-mmm (I'll take you there)
Oh, oh, mercy
(I'll take you there)
Oh, let me take you there
(I'll take you there)

Oh-oh-hoooo, let me take you there
(I'll take you there)
