(tim johnson/gayle mccready/david malloy)

When I gave you my number
I thought you would use it
It's just a little slip of paper
Darlin' did you lose it?
I've been here alone waiting by this phone
But it ain't rang at all
Oh, baby, for a good time call

Oh, reach out and touch me
Don't you really wanna love me?
Seven numbers away
