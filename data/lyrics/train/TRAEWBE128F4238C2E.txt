To all the ladies Ladies
who's this daddy yankee (To all the ladies ladies)
Rupee better remix dimelo mai (To all the ladies ladies)
Ven Pegate llevo tiempo velandote suelta miedo
y atrevete no te quedes tentandome yankee.

I lose all control when I see you
Standing there in front of me
Your style, your clothes, your hair
You fair woman, you look so sexy
De way you wine and, de way you dance
And de way that you twist and turn your waist
Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning
Leaves me feelin for a taste

Before the end of the night (end of the night)
I wanna hold you so tight (hold you so tight)
You know I want you so much (want you so much)
And I'm so tempted to touch (I'm tempted)

Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much

Ganas me dan ganas me dan de acarisiarla
por lo buena que esta

Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
Little woman, man I need you so much

Ganas me dan ganas me dan de acarisiarla por lo buena que esta
