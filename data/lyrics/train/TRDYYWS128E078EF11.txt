Reflecting on what's been
Though past will be future
When again yesterday to be made

For me hazy times fume all around
Burning grass in a field of endless supplies
Tall people casting shadows on the short
Little people running circles round the wide

Lazy times waste it well
What better to do with my mind!
Crazy times no rhythm too hard
...
