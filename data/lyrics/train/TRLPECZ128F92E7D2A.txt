No more words
 
Rise
And take your place beside me in all that I've built in disgrace
Grace the halls with curdling calls and watch the sky
The kingdom falls
Blight
Make haste your retreat
Make it with tact, make it discreet
Flood the world, drown the strife, and wash away this tainted life
 
Taunt the sane
Pinch the vein
Strike the night and scream at the rain
The more I know, the more I hate
Thus begins the Inside
 
Brick by brick
I begin to rebuild my temple of mourning instilled
Sing us a song for those who have passed
...
