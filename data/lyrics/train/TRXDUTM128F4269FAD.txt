Surely you can sit down for a while
Maybe you can even smile
And I'll try to pretend that you love me again
But it might take me a little while
I know you'll be holding me tight
You'll know when the moment is right
When I was broken in two it was all because of you
But baby I need you tonight

It ain't easy being easy
