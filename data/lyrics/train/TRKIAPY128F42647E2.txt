[Chorus:]
Why, why would you make me feel this way
Make me feel like we would never separate
Make me feel like you wanted to be my girl
But knowing you only wanted to be friends

"Like best friends" were the words you said to me
Got me wondering to myself how could this be
They way we touched was more than a fantasy
Just knew that what we had was more reality
My wifey is who I thought you'd be
Maybe one day raise a C-H-I-L-D
Broke my heart when you didn't wanna be with me
And all this time I was a fool in L-O-V-E

[Chorus: 2x]
Why, why would you make me feel this way
