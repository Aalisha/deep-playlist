Sometimes I wanna take you down
Sometimes I wanna get you low
Brush your hair back from your eyes
Take you down, let the river flow
Sometimes I go and walk the street
Behind the green sheet of glass
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles
I'll be with you girl, like being low
hey, hey, hey like being stoned
I'll be with you girl, like being low
hey, hey, hey like being stoned
A million poppies gonna make me sleep
