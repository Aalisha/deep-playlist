When you need a good friend well here I am
And if you have a problem I'll be your helping hand
If you have a bad day I'll make you a good night
And if you ever lose your way you know I'll be your guiding light.

Just let my love be your pillow
Lay your worries down and rest your head on me
Just let my love be your pillow
