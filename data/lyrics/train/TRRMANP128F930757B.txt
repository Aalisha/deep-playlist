Are you a gun busting nigga?
(Buh-buh-buh-buh)
Are you a bitch baggin' nigga?
(Whu-whu-whu-whu)
You got ice and ya chain and ya chong wit your rolly on
Not just any rolly but you bought the most expensive one
Hey take ya car keys to ya class E
Big body be for your CD on ya DVD
For ya T.V in ya head beats
In ya back seat
Y'all think I'm mean

Runnin' round talking 'bout the shit that you talking 'bout
How you the drug game sewed up and locked down
John Gotti got life and I'm sure he never told nobody
Boy lets put on an album so the fuckin' feds could buy it

You should be shouting out them bodies you buried
Nine millimeters in tex and Dem AK47's
Illegal weapon you talking 'bout you suck in the club
You got so many guns
Tell me why you rapping stead of getting robbed
I got two more verses for you
This ain't just to an individual person
These questions here for all of ya

I can write a song with out ice, bitches, and cars
Can you mutha fuckas do dat
(Do dat)
I can blaze a track with out bustin' a gat at a cat
Can you mutha fuckas do dat
(Do dat)

Yoouu gonna have to change up all yo shit in a little bit
When the radios in the club get to pumpin' dis
And they start to finding out what what rappin' really is
