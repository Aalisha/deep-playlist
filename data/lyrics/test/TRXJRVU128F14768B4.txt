Peddle light, I see it's on.
I'm driving by in my fat mobile.
Now I know what it's like to be a germ.
It's shot down, dear, oh, buy again, it's buy again.
Fun is me, yeah, it never ends.
Pick it up and push it in.
Rub it out, it's a soldier.

Cinema goes down again.
Clint does not move an inch.
ESP will work it out.
Open your windows, give Cindy a shout to me.

Rock and roll, it's a shame that you did,
All you did bored plain (?)
