(Chorus)
If you take me out rollerskatin'
I know everything will be fine
Hungry girls are so fascinatin'
Kiss me once and I'll show you mine
...
If you take me out rollerskatin'
I'll forget what I came here for
Rainy days are so devastatin'
Baby make me go rollerskatin'

Chorus

If you take me out rollerskatin'
...
