That girl is just a cool good looker
That baby's sweeter than raw brown sugar
Never mind 'cause the fancy took her
She says she wants to have the small head rock her

What a smile, don't it drive you insane, my baby
Drive a mile, just to ride back again, baby, won't you rock it tonight?

And when she's in the mood
When she needs that loving groove
When she wants it rude
She grooves with mista bone
If she's in the mood
If she hits that loving groove
...
