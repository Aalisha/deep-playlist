Where Rock at?
Is Rock here yet?
It's all good

I done came too far, can't turn back now
Pull it out, get it up, can't put shit down
Best believe to achieve, gotta struggle to get it but peep it
It's like you gotta body somebody just to keep it

Ain't no secret how the West coast do it
Stick a fork in it, nigga, done deal disputed
Holdin' two black aces for the smilin' faces
It's a chess game, nigga, better count yo' spaces

We gon' find the weakest link, fuck what you niggaz think
Pump gon' repeat an' grind y'all to mince meat
I can't retreat, refusin' to lose
Walk one day in the X man's shoes

Make shit happen, stomp an' smashin'
On an' crackin', who want action?
Pistol packin', fuck relaxin'
Hit u where it hurts

Make you feel it, can't conceal it
If it breathes then I can kill it
Come an' get it, custom-fitted
Hit u where it hurts

I might as well buy a suit right now
Put money on my books downtown to get ready for trial
