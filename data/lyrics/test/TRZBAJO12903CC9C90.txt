Don't be alarmed this happens all the time it happens all the time, im sure so just stay calm just stay
asking around you'll find it's not a big thing find its not a big thing
how it all goes down it all goes
'Cause on the outside im sure you're faking the first time the first impression ain't right
and on the inside you're pretty vacant your eyes are open but your mouth ain't making a sound
