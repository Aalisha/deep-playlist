Goodbye the future's sold out
There's no use screaming
Who thought we'd ever get this far?

Oooo

Tonight your faith has come down to money and a tv
Psychics who've never been to mars and nazi breast feeding
I know you must be upset
I can't find meaning
Im sorry, we're sorry
We're all scared, all scared

Hey, is anybody home?
