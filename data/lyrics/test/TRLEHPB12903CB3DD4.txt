Doo da doo doo doo doo doo da doo doo doo

There's a Southern Bell Telephone Company in our town
And every afternoon I'm right there hangin' around
Bound telephone operators walkin' up and down the street
And any fool could figure out what I'm glared to see

I'm watchin' the belles of the Southern Bell go by
They're swingin' their hips and rollin' their pretty eyes
Fine high heels stickin' make me start to kickin' my heels up to the sky
...
