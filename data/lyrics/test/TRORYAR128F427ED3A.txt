You're fractured and cold but your heart is unbroken
My favourite foremost coastal Antarctic shelf
Oh Larsen B, oh you can fall on me
Oh Larsen B, desalinate the barren sea

Oh I, I think it's over again
Like sawblades through the air
Your winter overture
Cut through everything, and now we're not so sure
...
