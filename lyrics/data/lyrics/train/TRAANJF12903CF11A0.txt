[Briody / Conklin]

[Three Sisters]
We three sisters, weird sisters indeed
Plant in Mac Beth the tyrant's seed
As it grows from thane to king
Deceit and murder is reaped

[MacBeth]
The sister's prophecy has won me title of thane
Yet I feel I'm so much more, my lady feels the same
I can be king with just a daggers thrust
Careful planning and this bloody deed is done
I cannot commit alone my lady must attend
Together we will wear the gowns of royalty in the end

[Duet- MacBeth & Lady]
We can do all things. Hand in hand
We can live as kings. Hand in hand

[MacBeth]
This night together we commit this bloody deed
No one will suspect us in doing such a thing
We'll place the blame on the servant we shall kill.
Leave no witnesses and erase our guilt
We are so clever none shall suspect
On the marrow they will place the crown on my head
