The words are slowly sinking in
Despair comes unexpected
Everything falls out of place
Now my imagination
It moves in all directions
I can only see your face
Now please don't leave me

I'm caught in the middle
It pulls me down to places no one goes
So you need to find out
If there's a chance for us
What a difference it makes
Waking up here without you
Baby we can make this right
