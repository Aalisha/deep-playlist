In my mind
I can see reminders of a past decade,
so far behind
like the shadows linger at the close of day.
and we could see
we were timeless dreamers of another day
and we were free
in a dawning age we had so much to say

oooh, the nights you came to me
a blue jean lady so eager to be free
and the wind in your long hair blowin'
as we stood for the band.
oh Hollyann

(chorus)
Hollyann
We made the dark into the light.
