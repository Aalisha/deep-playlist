Feeling like a loser
Feeling like a bum
Sitting on the outside observing the fun
Don't get on my bad side
I can work a gun
Hop into the backseat baby
I'll show you some fun

These people are weird in here
And they're giving me the fear
Just because you know my name
Doesn't mean you know my game
I look myself in the face
And whisper "I'm in the wrong place"
Is there more to lose than gain
If I go on my own again?

On my own again
Inside the outsider (on my own again)
Inside the outsider (on my own again)
Inside the outsider (on my own again)
