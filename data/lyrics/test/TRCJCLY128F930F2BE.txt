I've been needing a girls night out
I've got nothing but hand me downs
I need a quick fix to make these clothes hotter
No matter what it is a girl's gotta

The pedicure, right tip French
My legs don't make no sense
Not rich but I bought a diamond anklet
Keep it on, it goes with my outfit, hey

Hey, lets go, if they're not to high, to low
I'll take them home, in purple, red or gold
'Cause I know them boys, they like those open toes

Jeans all black, hair slicked back
Baseball cap, still cute in my open toes
Mini skirt, feet don't hurt
Just a flirt, too cute in my open toes

Work or play, night or day
Do my thing, too cute in my open toes
Never to many open toes
A girl needs plenty open toes

I'm lovin' these sling back shoes
I like the way they stay loose
I could wear them all day and listen to the click-clack
Shoes like this make me hate flats

Swipe that card I'm good
Another pair in leather and wood
