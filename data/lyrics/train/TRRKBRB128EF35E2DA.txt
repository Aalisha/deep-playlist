N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?
Yeah, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz
Na, na, nah, it's N-Dubz, N-Dubz, what?

I should have knew this from the start that if we blow all these people
The so called friends who I ain't spoken to in years
They got the nerve to call me up and waste my time
I don't need you for nothing so come the *** out of my life

Yeah, I live my life on stages Feva Las Vegas
Sylvester Stallone in it, any chick I'm boning it
I'm entrepreneuring, we do this all ourselves
From the productions, videos and everything else

See the buzz that we created was rare
Two independent releases from 'Better Not' to 'I Swear'
But I presume it's the tune with the chair that caused the havoc
Got all of these labels talking 'bout who the first to grab it

About man tryna buy ma publishing for only 80 grand
I might look like a boy but I got a mind of a man, straight
See the *** game gives you a false high
When you think you're speaking to me mate you're screamin' in my eye

Success causes jealousy
It can turn your best friend into your enemy
All I know, I believe in what I do, I can live without you
You *** are tryin' to suck me dry
