Please, just leave me alone
I'm all that i need
Please, go away with yourself,
i know that it burns
It's best
Separate peace,
honey leave me alone
I'm living just fine on my own
and the more that we try, it always just ends with goodbye
So go back,
come to midtown, your driver knows the way
He's tryin to reach her waiting,
the silver shines the way
