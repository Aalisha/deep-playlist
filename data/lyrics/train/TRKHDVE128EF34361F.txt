I know your gonna through a lot of things
I can see it in your eyes but i can't explain it
Situation looking so strange
Like a picture on the wall without the frame and
When tears fall i want to be there to catch em (just let me babe)
And if you get lost let me change your direction (it's this way)
Cause he's not treatin you like a... (queen)
And i hate when he causes a... (scene)
I wouldn't do it in my wildest... (dream, no)
Don't let it happen because baby you are so beautiful
I don't want to step on his toes but i think he should know

You never had someone (that's all about your needs)
You never had someone (that always do you properly, yeah)
You never had someone (to give you what you waitin for)
You never had someone
But now...
Baby you got someone
You ain't had, never had no one to lay you down
Strolled up on the bed
When we're finished we'll be on the ground
But you hadn't been workin
Girl i know you been hurtin
But baby don't you worry
Cause now you got someone

At home with your head down
Don't want to show your face from the confrontation
Can't even go to work now
