It's not hard to see anyone who looks at me
Knows I am just a rolling stone
Never landed any place to call my own
To call my own

Well it seems like so long ago
But it really ain't you know, I started off a crazy kid
Miracle I made it though the things I did
The things I did

Some day I'll go where there ain't no rain or snow
Till then I'll travel alone
And I'll make my bed with the stars above my head
And dream of a place called home
...
