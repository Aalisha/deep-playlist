You're standing on your head
You're standing on your head to make amends
For something that you did
And you don't ever seem to get over it
Apologies and shame
You look up to the ones that love to blame
And you'll never be like them
You'll never get so good and confident

But in this world we have you still have to live
And in this life you have you've got so much to give

Isn't it strange
How people they look so small from an aeroplane
...
