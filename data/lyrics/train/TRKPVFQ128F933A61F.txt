Sometimes I find myself sittin' back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
And I remember when you started callin' me your miss's
All the play fightin', all the flirtatious disses

I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too

The littlest things that take me there
...
