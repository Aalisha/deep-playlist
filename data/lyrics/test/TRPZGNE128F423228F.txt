Jesus if you need a break you can stay with him and me
We gots ourselves a radio but we aint got no t.v.
We inherited a black mercedes benz
We could go for long sunday drives
Jesus we aint much for work we could waste the days together
You could sneak us into the matinee through the locked doors of the theater
Jesus if our women comes around
You'll have to hide cause they think our friends are a bad influence

Glory be everyone is guilty
Glory be everyone is guilty

Jesus once we've rested up we could go out the people
This time try a new approach avoiding church and steeple
Jesus your name still would draw a crowd
