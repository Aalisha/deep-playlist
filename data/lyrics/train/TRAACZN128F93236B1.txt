I drive a yellow Volvo, '86 submarine
Someone's behind me in an Escalade
Trying to blind me with their high beams
I make a left, I'm the road to nowhere
Heading west, the sky is purple streaks

The sun is setting in my chest
I feel warm inside so I'm going for a ride
Put your picture on my dashboard
'Til my fate and your collides

Seaweed washed upon the shore
Severed locks
Of he who walks the ocean floor
I drive a yellow Volvo, '86 submarine

Rims like Tibetan prayer
Wheels and my tank is filled with dreams
Fuck the game
