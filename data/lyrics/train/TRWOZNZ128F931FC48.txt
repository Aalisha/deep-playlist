A broken voice from the broken dreams
My heart is drowning in loveblood
I can't forget your leaving shape
Everyday is like a long walk in the cold rain
I'm bleeding and loosing my grip
Tomorrow is a closed gate

I have been dead for so long
And no one's gonna shed a tear
I have been dead for so long
And no one seems to care

Sometimes I really hate people close to me
They want to see my reaction
That I don't want to give
Sometimes I really want to be just dead
Without any kind of torturing stress
...
