One more time [Incomprehensible]
Uh huh, yeah

Baby, I'm back
And by the way I had to come to you
To see if the love that we knew before
Had passed the test of time

Time, it changes almost everything
Sometimes I don't see the best side
Of the feelings we once shared

So baby, let's go round again
Maybe we turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time

Let's go round again
Maybe we turn back the hands of time
Let's go round again
One more time
One more time
One more time

Now, baby, I know
That you think I will be different now
