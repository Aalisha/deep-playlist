I've got them candy kisses on my mind.)

[Verse 1:]
I never met nobody like you. (like you)
That'll do all the things that you do.
(that you do)
Every night when I go to sleep,
make my heart skip a beat.
By the way that you kiss me.
And Ooh, Now I see.
This is the way that love's suppose to be.
Me with you.
You with me.
I don't ever want you to leave,
'cause you give me.

[Chorus:]
Candy kisses all over me.
(I've got them candy kisses on my mind)
Like a kid in the candy store,
always want to come back for more.
'cause hes my, now and later on a rainy day,
always seem to take my stress away.
He's my sugar daddy, I'm his candy girl.
We got the sweetest love in the whole
wide world.
