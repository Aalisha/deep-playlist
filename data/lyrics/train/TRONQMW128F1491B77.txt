FLY!

She starts her new diet, of liquor and dick.
Just like Hollywood, but laced in sick.
The sun goes down, and so does she.
The sun goes down, and so does she.
Sold out the love that she had
left with cut of the throat.
Drinks all round on her
before she strolls to the moat.
The sun goes down, and so does she.
The sun goes down, and so does she.

OH!
CHRIST!

Count your fucking blessings!
Come on!
Count your blessings, cause I'm counting every lie.
