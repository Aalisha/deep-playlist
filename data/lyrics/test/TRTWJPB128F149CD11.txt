see you walking down with that smile babe
If only you would look this way
Lookin' cool
Lookin' fine
You bring me up make me higher baby

oo-oo-oo Feel the love that I do
I'm tryin' to make you see that I'm the one
oh oh woh-o-o

People say it's just another silent dream
They all forget what real love feels like
Nothing will stop me, I only know to go on
Wait and see, the power of love will see me through
