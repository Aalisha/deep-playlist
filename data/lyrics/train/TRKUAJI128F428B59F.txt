Hall√•, ja
I see, it's fine
You're somebody else's little girl now and will never be mine
But give me a minute, let me get through to you, yeah
I will continue to call you repeatedly till you do
Summer nights you know what we do
We're just keeping it tight, simple as that
When in dark outside, holding me down for delight
And we could do it all night long
Reconsider me baby, c'mon
