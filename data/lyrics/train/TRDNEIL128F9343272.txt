Redone
Pixie
All my friends are going out
but I've been thinking
maybe I better stay in bed
The ceiling's spinning round
like I've been drinking
I've got this banging in my head

boom boom boom boom
I need my-yy medicine
and the cure ain't Aspirin

I don't care about tomor-o-o-oh
here we go again, here we go again
I'll be the last one on the dance flo-o-o-or
when this party ends, when this party ends
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!)
Never wanna stay
I I wish that I was there
I don't even care (NO!), I don't even care (NO!)
