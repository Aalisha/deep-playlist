I knew right away that you were out of the world
When I first saw your face
My head spun like a tilt a whirl
As I tired not to puke all over the place
You seem so down to earth
But things aren't what they seem
But now it's too late
You've got my heart in your tractor beam

I can tell by the blank expression on your face
You're fucking lost in space
...
