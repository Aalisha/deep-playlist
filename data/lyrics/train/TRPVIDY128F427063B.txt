I'm not such a good lover
I'm a better talker
So when you touch me there
I'm scared that you'll see
Not the way that I don't love you
But the way that I don't love myself

There are things these days
That can help you through a phase
Like food and health and fear
I prefer the beer
Not the way that I don't love you
But the way that I hate myself

Oh when the cityscape is born
...
