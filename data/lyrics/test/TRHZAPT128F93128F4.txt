We've made the best of our love
And we gave our all, but the tears began to fall
It seems we're always too late
When we try to change, rearrange the hands of fate

Two lovers lost and alone
It's so hard to face this love we can't replace
Now I'm searchin' to find someone new, isn't easy
Remember that I could have been here next to you

Lost in the night games
I've been missing you
We've only got ourselves to blame
Now love is through

Lost in the night games
I've been missing you
Lost in the night games
All alone
...
