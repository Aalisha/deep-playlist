Feel I'm waking up
Feel I'm breaking lose
Start, begin to turn in
Feel the inside break
Fired
Push it to the red line
Push it to the edge
And it starts to unwind
Last call sucker
Holds you steady
As it starts to shudder
Fill me with her fucking lies
Fill me with her fucking lies
Fill me with her fucking lies
Fill me with her fucking lies
Crashing through the bassline
Leaving in the dust as you beat in decline
Mold, I'll crush her
Selling our skin as it fuels you within
