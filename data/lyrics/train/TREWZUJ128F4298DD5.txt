Cause I'm a mess and you know that I can't help it
The drive home never seemed this long before
We're killing time just a little bit faster
And I swear we'll make it

But I can't tell you what I don't know
(Be mine tonight, be mine tonight)
The simple things that make my heart go
(Be mine tonight, be mine tonight)
But I can't tell you what I don't know
You'll have to wait
You'll have to wait

Stay safe
Stay strong
And let me know that you'll be here while I am gone
Because I'm coming home
Coming home tonight
So let's get this right
I said I'm coming home
...
