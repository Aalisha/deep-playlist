We shall dance, we shall dance
The day we get a chance
To pay off all the violins of the ball

We shall dance, we shall dance
The day we get a chance
To get a dime to buy back our souls

We shall dance, we shall sing
My dear love, O my spring
My love good days will come
You'll see the corn will grow in spring
