Oh, oh, check it

Hey, Mr. Wonderful
You think you're so beautiful
I bet you nine out of ten would fall
I ain't the one to be the fool

Two days to work you out
At home while you were out
Your last name came about
When my girl's sister's best friend
Talking 'bout how you came 'round

How does it feel
When you're sittin' alone, there's no-one else at home?
It's my time for thrills
Now it's time for you to listen to my answer phone

Ain't no big deal
You're just one of a million guys
Let's keep it real
Your dirty laundry's out to dry

So Mr. Know-it-all
Tell me how many points you scored
While you're clocking the girl next door
I know what you've been doing

To dinner bought her gifts
For afters you were it
I called work they said you were sick
A guy like you will never hit this
