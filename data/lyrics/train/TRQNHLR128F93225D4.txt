It's 3 in the morning and
I'm still not sleeping
cause I am finally running your race
The mountains you've been climbing
seem like they have steepened
since I decided to pick up the pace

If the whole world told me I should disappear
could I fall right next to you?
Just let me burn the night away
Oh, baby let me burn the night away
By thinking of all the simple things you say to me
that get me through the day
You keep me wide awake
You keep me wide awake

So don't look back the hour glass is running empty
...
