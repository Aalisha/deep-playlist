Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
But now you aren't in step

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
Now you aren't so in step

You had your photograph in a magazine
Such a pretty boy and only nineteen
But now your 23 and it's all gone now
You ain't all that you wanna be somehow

Maybe it was only a dream
You just thought you could be
Anything that you want to be
Sadly, it all went wrong so

Never took a scene check
Never were a reject
Always lookin perfect
But now you aren't in step
...
