It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird
Who is bound he'll be heard
Is throwing his heart at the sky!

It's a grand night for singing,
The stars are bright above.
The earth is a-glow
And to add to the show,
I think I am falling in love!
Falling, falling in love.

It's a grand night for singing,
The moon is flying high,
And somewhere a bird
Who is bound he'll be heard,
Is throwing his heart at the sky!
