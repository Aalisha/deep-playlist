Contemplatin' every day
Wonderin' if I'm wastin' all of my time
You know I'm dedicatin' every thought on only you

My mama used to tell me that patience is a virtue

And so I wait through the night
Cause tomorrow you might find
That you will need me again
For some tender lovin' care
So I wait hopin' you
Will discover you're in love
That you need me
As much as I need you
And so I wait all my life
Hopin' one day you will see
That love's a lock
You're the key
You will come and rescue me
So I wait hopin' you
Will discover you're in love
That you need me
As much as I need you
