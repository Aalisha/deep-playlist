Listen up and listen close. 
Ok so maybe I wasn't clear enough with the words that I chose. 
Now I'm asking you, I'm begging you just so everyone knows. 
Now I'm daring you to say something original. 
Give it up and oh I know words are failing you 
but sweetie sometimes thats just how it goes. 
Matching words and matching phrases count the days because 
the battle might be done 
but the war is well on its way. 
The war is well on its way.

Oh I know you feel it too.

Now I'm watching you dig your hole 
and it looks more like a grave. 
It's just a theory or so I'm told. 
There will be nobody left here to save you. 
Now ask me how I'm so matter of fact. 
Well the fact of the matter is it's just a matter of tact.
