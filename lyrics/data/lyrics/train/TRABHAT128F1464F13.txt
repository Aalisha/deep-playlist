On and on and on, here's the break of dawn
Coming through the window heart
Pull yourself a chair up, love

On and on and on, quiver like a reed
Let yourself a go go, old one
Honor me, solo young man

Careful not to give yourself away
There is still tomorrow and a heart felt meaning
When you get that feeling, you will recall
A night of love in motion

We shall lie warm inside
Quite at ease, you watch me glide
We shall lie side by side
...
