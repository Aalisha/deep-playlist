No way to settle when you're sleeping with the devil
And you know they're gonna figure you out
They're gonna blow you cover it's one way or another
Bet you know just what I'm talking about
You've got nothing up your sleeve now
Ain't got no miracle card
You keep on running but the end is coming
And you know it's gonna batter you hard

You're on the way to the bargain bin now
Going nowhere fast heading nowhere at all

Used up loose ends hang by a thread
Yesterday's news and they're not even read
...
