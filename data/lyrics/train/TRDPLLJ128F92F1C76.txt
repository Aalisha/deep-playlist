(Let's go!)
(Yeah! Alright!)

Walking through the terminal
I saw something beautiful
You left, for your duty call
Next I'm getting on the plane
That's when I see you again
I can't get you off my brain

(Let's go)
That uniform you're wearing
So hot I can't stop staring
You're putting on an awesome show
The cabin pressure's rising
My coke has got no ice in there

(Chorus:)

Air hostess
I like the way you dress
You know I hate to fly
But I feel much better
Occupy my mind
Writing you a love letter
I messed my pants
When we flew over France
Will I see you soon
In my hotel room
For a holiday romance?
Air hostess
