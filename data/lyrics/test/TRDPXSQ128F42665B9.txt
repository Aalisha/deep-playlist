I put some whiskey into my whiskey
I put some heartbreak into my heart
I put my boots on that ole dance floor
I put three rounds Lord, in my 44

I love the girl, she was my sunshine
Her name was Eleanor Caroline
She got fast, with a friend of mine
At the dance hall Lord, on the county line

I put some whiskey into my whiskey
I put some heartbreak into my heart
...
