Even when your heart is aching
Even when the clouds are fading
I won't let you down
I will be around

You gotta let it go
Let the feelings grow
Don't need to run away

You gotta understand
I'll be here till the end
I'm here to stay

Let the feelings go
Let the feelings go
When the music starts
Cuz' it feeds your soul
When the moon is bright
Then the feeling's right
Deep in your soul

Let the feelings go
Let the feelings go
When the music starts
Cuz' it feeds your soul
When the moon is bright
Then the feeling's right
Deep in your soul(soul, soul, soul,.)
