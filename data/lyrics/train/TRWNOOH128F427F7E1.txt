I got the clue from your looking at me
Tired of waiting for you to turn me on
It's gettin' late and this is my last dance
Are you gonna take your last chance?

It's gettin' late and this is my last dance
Are you gonna take your last chance?

She walks away she wants you
I say I don't know why you should stay
She walks away she wants you
Uoh oh

I got the clue from your looking at you
