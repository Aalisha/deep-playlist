Sing it from the mountain
Tell it to the people
Sing it from the mountain
Tell it to the people

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it

You got this feeling you? ve been wanting to share
It makes you feel as though you? re walking on air
You say this feeling needs a thing called love
Then you should tell the one you? re thinking of

When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
You should let them know it
When you say you love somebody
You got to let them know about it
It is time to show it
