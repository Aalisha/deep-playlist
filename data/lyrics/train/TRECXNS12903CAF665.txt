They tied me up, they stripped me down,
Against the world I'll stand my ground,
I'll sell my songs, but not my soul.
They'll chew you up, they'll spit you out,
Yeah, follow me, we'll ride it out,
I'll sell my songs, but not my soul.

I'll take dignity over industry,
My wardrobe has never meant shit to me.
I'll sell my songs, but never my soul,
And what the fuck happened to rock and roll?

I've got bruises on my hands and knees,
And a list of failures in between.
Always dirty, I am never clean,
Music is what you hear, and not what you see.
