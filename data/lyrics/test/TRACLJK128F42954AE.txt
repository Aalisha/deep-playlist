On a Sunday

I said that everything was my way
But could have been her way
She left me round about spring last may
And had it all her way
Someday today I'll forget about us
Travel in the rain on a hesitant day

Gathering sticks on Sunday
Makes my everything in between
Gathering sticks on Sunday
Makes me forget all I've been

I know it sounds funny but I just got in the way
Lost in his own day
Never love past honor just speak today
And had it my own way
Lost in a day on a Grey Sunday
Travel in the rain on a hesitant day

Gathering sticks on Sunday
Makes my everything in between
Gathering sticks on Sunday
Makes me forget all I've been
But everybody knows I'm someone
Gathering all his sticks in dreams
