Butter beans, I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna stick you I'm gonna take you down
And then romp I'm goin to hell you're riding shot gun


(Butter beans, I'm gonna get you,
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you)


Butter beans, I know she wants you
That you'll make a lovely headdress or
A double breasted suit, whoopsie

(Butter beans, I'm gonna get you,
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you)

Cause Butter beans, you better stay sharp
