Could you be the one

I can think of nothing better
Than to know the one you love
For as long as we've been together
We should open our heart, yeah

If I gave you my heart
Would you be the one that I love?
If I told you my feelings
Would you be the one that I trust?

Would you make sure everything's fine?
Would you hold me close through the night?
Would you be the one that I love?
Will you hold me tonight?

I feel like breaking down the walls, yeah
Welcome you into my world
I'm not afraid of what you find in me
I just want us to be closer, yeah
