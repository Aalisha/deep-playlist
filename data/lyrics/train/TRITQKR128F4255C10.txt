Cast not thine eyes on what is mine
And leave it all behind
I take thy sight and thy mind
I'm here to lead the blind
And there's a man in home so I'm never alone
And the place that he's going is the place I call home
So I hold out today and try to make the exit in the easiest way

Old Man and the Angel
I said I'm ready for home it's the way to go, let it flow
Old Man and the Angel
Out of the warth and through the stars to the cold
...
