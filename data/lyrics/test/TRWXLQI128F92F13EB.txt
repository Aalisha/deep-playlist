Steven dale jones/billy henderson

Speaking of the devil
Look who just walked in
He knows just where to find me
Here we go again
I can tell he's gonna ask me to dance
But that's not as far as he wants to go
I need ten thousand angels to help me tell him no

Lead me not into temptation
Heaven help me to be strong
I can fight all that I'm feeling
