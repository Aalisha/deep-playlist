I`ll catch you again someday
On the streets of pittsburg pennsylvania
Then again maybe not
Where we can sit and remenice
About our younger years
And how we`d stay in bed all day
When you should of been in class, then
Then in the night
That light shown down upon you
Made you look like the star that you were
Then in the night
That light shown down upon you
Made you look like the star that you are
Daytime thoughts on those streets
Through winter breezes freezing gusts of wind
Cutting razors to my ears
