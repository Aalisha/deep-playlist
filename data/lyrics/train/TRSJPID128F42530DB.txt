In the middle of a deep dark night
Your body's soaked in sweat
Well outside it's cold as ice
But you're burning up the bed

You've got a nasty little fever and it's climbing up high
Nothing you can do to stop the aching inside
I can relieve you, you know that I could
You've got it bad, baby I'll make it good

[Refrain:]
Hang on to Dr. Love
