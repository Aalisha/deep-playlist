Venus sheds her skin of gold
Sacrafice her life
Washes out the demon sleep
That hides between her eyes
Walking, watching, wandering out
Of soul she must persue in death
Will she reach you?
Flytrap
Flytrap
Flytrap
Flytrap
Venus takes the lightning
And her hair becomes a flame
With a guise of innocents
...
