You say you're lonely
Don't care anymore
Emptiness abounds
and love surrounds
the hole besides your heart

You're feeling so sad,
And it's never been this bad.before
Don't wanna change the world
But I'm gonna change your mind
I'll only say that if you stay
Love is what you'll find
But you're gone...'cause love takes so long

You say you're empty
Don't feel anymore
Loneliness abounds
And the music pounds around and around and around...

You're moving way too fast
Like nothing ever lasts
...
