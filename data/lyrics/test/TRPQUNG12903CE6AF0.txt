(Floesist)
You know sometimes we um we dont recognize our dreams inside our
realities, and other times were not aware of exactly whats real, we walk around
daydreaing but the sun is shining, the sunshine always is

Chours
I just wanna see my lovely sunshine, i just wanna bring back all of
my blue skies, and if you take away my rainbow i will cry (cry) cry (cry)
give me back my sunshine.

(songstress)
Dreaming in my state of being and i see you smiling so happy
just laughing and standing strong, im missing you right here
listen to my tears, im waking up to skies so gray im needing
you to brighten up my day
