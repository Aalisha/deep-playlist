If it feels so right
Feels safe and sound
How can the sky be falling down
If it's all good love
Two good hearts
How can we fall so far apart

How can hearts be breaking in the middle of the night
How can strings come unwound when they've held so tight
On the ride down this road if it's time, time to let go
Tell me, how should I know

If we're still on fire
The burn's still there
