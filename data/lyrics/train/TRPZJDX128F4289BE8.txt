I'd like to be a fly on your wall,
When you think you all alone,
Learn your secrets once and for all,
Never tell no one.
I can't read your mind,
It's secret telling time.

Tell me, how do I turn you on,
Tell me, how do I turn you on,
Oh, oh, oh maybe there's a game we could play,
Is there something that you want,
But you're too shy to say.
How do I turn you on,
