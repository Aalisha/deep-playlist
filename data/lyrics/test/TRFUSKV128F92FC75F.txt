Mayday,
I gotta return to base,
I been, hit so hard,
Spinning, all over the place,
And i, cant regain control,
Dont think i'll make it home,
Is anyboday listening, on the radio?

Gotta abort this mission,
Too many lost in action,
So many wounds that can't heal up,
Both my wings have been broken,
Ohhhh Ohhhhh Ohhhhh

Help me,
I can barely breathe, i got cabin fever,
...
