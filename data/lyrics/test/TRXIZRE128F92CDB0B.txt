Normally this time of night you wouldn't find me here
I'd be reaching for a good night kiss instead of one more beer
I'd never take a second look at the blonde across the bar
Much less invite her over and let things go this far

Chorus:
But anything goes when everything's gone
You ain't around to give a damn whether I do right or wrong
So bring it on, anything goes when everything's gone
