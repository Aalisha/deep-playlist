My boy builds coffins
With hammers and nails
He doesn't build ships
He has no use for sails

He doesn't make tables,
Dressers, or chairs
He can't carve a whistle
'Cause he just doesn't care

My boy builds coffins
For the rich and the poor
Kings and queens have all
Knocked on his door

Beggars and liars
Gypsies and thieves
They all come to him
'Cause he's so eager to please

My boy builds coffins
...
