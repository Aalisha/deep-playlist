Warning Sign!
And return to the foundation
This is Edley Shine and a Notch
Kids from foreign live, click click
And now ya boom boom click
Watch this!

Ey yagga yo giyay, ey yagga yo giyo giyay, ey.
Yo giyay, ey yagga yo giyo giyay, ey.

A lotta man nuh get nuh (pum-pum) tonight, no.
A lotta woman nuh get nuh (pum-pum) tonight-ight.
Becuh ya see decision is getting harder,
And ya know sir Born Jamericans will live long and prosper.
Come on ay!

Jah mi seh red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Kids pon de mic, we are de star fi de show.
Red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Ed pon di microphone so all the mass of y'all a blow.

Mi seh easy pon the toker, Edley Shine is relaxed.
Ya cyaan get de message, then we send it pon a fax.
Watch pon de riddim, how me cool and relaxed,
When ya see de red light, some boy give a stop.

Rub-a-dub he tried to hurt on Edley Shine, nuh decieved.
When you see de yellow light, some boy reduce your speed.
Reggae music a de wata, so tell it to ya daughter,
When she wine up in a dance, you might think she outta order.

It's not the slackness, I man a defend.
Now ya get de green light, so make de niceness begin

Cause a red light, yellow light, green light, go!
