If you closed your eyes
You would see much clearer
Free from our confines
Would you paint a new picture?
I can see the hurt in your eyes
Disguised behind our selfish pride
Who'll be the first to apologize?

You don't know me at all
We're at our final curtain call
It's now or never at all
Add salt to our pierced, wounded hearts
