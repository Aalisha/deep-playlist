"Circle"

From the Limeliters albums Alive! In Concert, Harmony, A Mighty Day, Singing For The Fun, and Until We Get it Right

A moving song about life's ups and downs - - a common concert closer for The Limeliters.

All my life's a circle, sunrise and sundown
The moon rose through the nighttime til the daybreak comes around
All my life's a circle, but I can't tell you why
Seasons spinning round again, the years keep rolling by

Seems like I've been hear before
But I can't remember when
...
