W.A.S.P.
Miscellaneous
9.5.- N.A.S.T.Y.
One woman down my street is too hot for the average man
Hard to handle, a fire in her eyes, wants the hot rocks right in her hand
I know she's burning hot with love, a come on look and she ain't fooling
And she knows just what it does
She gave me a number to make me fell fine
She said call me up baby it's gonna be

9.5.- N.A.S.T.Y.
You're everything I need
Cause I want what you're giving
I'm yours to do with what you please
N.A.S.T.Y.
You're everything I need
