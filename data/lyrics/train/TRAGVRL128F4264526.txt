He had brunet hair with blond streaks
A different kind of fellow, so very unique
Sitting on the road in New Orleans

He ate fillet gumbo, I think I ordered steak
I looked into his eyes and said
For heaven's sakes, listen to me
I got what you need

I don't know what to do anymore
I've shown him all of my love and more
I don't know what to do anymore
I've shown him all of my love and more
I don't know what to do anymore
I've shown him all of my love and more
