Only in my dreams
I've seen the way it's gonna be

I've waited for this moment
The moment when we share ourselves
This moment can't be thought about
It has to be felt

We're closer to each other
Closer than we've ever been
Seeing things we've never seen before

I've dreamed your fingers touch me a thousand times
Dreamed the warm skin of your body burning next to mine
Kissed your sugar lips, caressed your hips
Now we're together baby now it's time
Time to make you mine
Time to make you mine
...
