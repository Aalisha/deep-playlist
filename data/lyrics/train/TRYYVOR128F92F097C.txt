This Georgia road is red, the Georgia sky is blue
And it looks just like the day that carried me to you
Oh, the good Lord up in Heaven knows what I've been going through
And He's whispering to me, that I'll get over you

My angel in distress, you look okay to me
I'll send you my address and I know that it will be
I could easily stay with you on your side of Heaven's door
'Cause I don't love you any less but I can't love you anymore
