[Verse 1]
There comes the fire, a thundering light.
It is a symbol, a symbol of might
For all the sons and daughters of steel.
Let's get armed and storm the battlefield.
We live for Metal, 'cause Metal is strong.
We are always standing one by one.
In every stadium we're raising our stacks.
We are born for a Metal attack.

[Bridge:]
Will you fighr a holy battle?
YES WE WILL!
For the truth of Heavy Metal
WE WILL KILL!
