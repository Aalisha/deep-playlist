Is it right or wrong
Try to find a place
We can all belong?

Be as one
Try to get on by
If we unify
We should really try

All this time
Spinning round and round
Made the same mistakes
That we've always found

Surely now
We could move along
Make a better world
No, it can't be wrong

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
In sweet harmony

Let's come together
Right now, oh yeah
...
