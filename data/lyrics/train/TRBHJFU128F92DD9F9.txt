She could pack her things and slip away
Save her pride for another day
He could go on pretendin'
He's said, all there is to say
That if love is never ending
When broken hearts need mending
They find a way to hold on to
What matters most of all
There are no rules, there are no truths
No reason, there's no rhyme
There's just your heart, to see you through
It tells you every time
And when you feel it down deep inside
Without a doubt
That's what love is
...
