Pumpkin seed gonna get you soon. 
Couse couse, kitchenware, attitude... 
Nothing more than an acorn shell. 
Yeah this is my October. 
Shadow me accordingly. 

Nothing more than a bit too fast. 
Fall down, hit the ground, not meant to last. 
Nothing more than a need to yell. 
That this is my October. 
Let me die. 

Since I've been running out of empty, 
All I have is candy bars 
And costumes to defend me.
