I like an old guitar
Playin' a Gosdin song
In a smoky bar
That's what turns me on, yeah

If that makes me a little old school
Go ahead and call me yesterday's old fool
If that makes me a little throwback
Throw it at me, don't worry, I can take that
Call me hick, hillbilly, hell I'm proud to be what that makes me
