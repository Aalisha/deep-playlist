Gave him the keys to the city
Called him the lovin’ man
His conversation is pretty
Loves all the people he can
Some call him a hot-blooded mother
He’s got Venus in Scorpio
Says folks should love one another
Says that’s the only way to go

Lovin’ man, lovin’ man
Lord have mercy, he’s a lovin’ man
Lovin’ man, lovin’ man
Lord have mercy, don’t you know he’s a lovin’ man

Got his moon in Taurus
A heavy hummer yeah
Sensuality seeker
You really know when he’s been there
