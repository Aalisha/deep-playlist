Today's not the same as everyday,
It's far from ordinary
The pain I endure, you're my cure,
but my mistakes had led me
Far away from you

You turn away
From all the things I've been trying to say
And all those promises I shouldn't have made
I did it for you

Mile by mile
Feelings I just can't reconcile
My heart's on a string, these broken wings
...
