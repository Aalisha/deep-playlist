She was wearing shocking pink and jewelry of gold
Papa said son isn't she fine
Knew he would be out all night
Though son is only 9 years old
This is how he's forced to spend his time
Looking out window into someone else's home
Watching mother, father, child at play
Wishing he could be a part but it's
Too hard to forget he's alone
A typical day
The boy at the window
One more forgotten son
Ah, looking to the corner
To see what he'll become
The boy at the window
If he's still sitting there
Are you even gonna care
Papa always tells his son
