All of me belongs to you all the time
You're the only one that's ever on my mind
There's no way that I would ever be untrue
There's not one single part of me
That don't miss you through and through
Cause all of me belongs to you

Eyes are worthless cause you're not here to see
Lips're so forgotten since you forgotten me
...
