Taking to the floor with the wheel to the sky
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie
Locking down the door with the rhythm and rhyme
I loosen my tie, I loosen my tie

Trying to recall what you want me to say
I shake it your way, I shake it your way
Counting on the night for a beautiful day
I shake it your way, I shake it your way

And I say you can't get enough
