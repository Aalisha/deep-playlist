INTRO:

It's one of those nights when you turn out the lights
and you sit in the dark and say to yourself "I miss her"
It's one of those moods when your body broods
and you conjure up her picture and you kiss her
It's one of those things for the pain it brings
you say to yourself "Hey couldn't I live without it?"
Well, I think so, on the other hand, I doubt it

Well suddenly she's crashing through my mind
like waves upon the shore
And I nod my head, whoa yes love, I'd welcome you again
if you knocked upon my door
If you didn't, I'd seek you out love, I'd track you down for sure
like a thousand times before
