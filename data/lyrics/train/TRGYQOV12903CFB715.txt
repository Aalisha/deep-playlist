The waves are falling out of the virid sea
And paint me in the sands where no one waits for me
My destiny written from old Father Time
A long time ago between all the lines

I find the desert rose and swim in a crystal sea
I will walk through Wonderland my daddy said to me
Now I swim in a sea of tears and rose a desert heart
And if this is Wonderland it seems too cold for me

Under the rising star
Just too small for the sky above
Asking for what we are - why we're a part of the universe
