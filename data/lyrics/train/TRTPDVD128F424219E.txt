Malodorous Scent Of Decay
Reeking My Path To The Storageshed
Urges Deep Inside The Cortex
Raging Through The Cervix
Cranial Decay...

As I Grab The Saw...

Eviscerated Carnal Delicatesse
Had Been Lying Around For Days
My Cannibalistic Malpractice Enthralls
Gangrenous Process In Excess
Bereaving The Swarm Of Flesh
A Malpractice In Necronutricious Form...

Malodorous And Malicious
The Haemoglobine Infects My Cortex
...
