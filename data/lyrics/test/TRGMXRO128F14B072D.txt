Your individual erodes doing saying what you're told
Perception of reality is destroyed
Blinded submission, consumption with reason,
Brainwashed, corrupted and controlled
Oppressed slaves to your aggression, driven
Absolute control is a must
The life you once new imagination victims of one enemy
New is all you know old is forgotten
Religious infamy turn away it will set you free
