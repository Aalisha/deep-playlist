Danny says,
that he got caught up,
in all the talk of
how it used to be.
and he says,
i never used to mind
that same way of life,
its just you and me.
danny says,
that he's so bored now,
since he figured out,
that back in the day
he rarely says,
how i remember this,
and don't give a shit,
about what you have to say.
He's only 19,
burnt out on the scene, yea.
he's only 19.
