You know it's so complicated, first you love then you hate it
Someone's laughin', someone's cryin', someone livin', someone's dyin'
Somebody always loses an' we still play the game
An' the fire will always burn you an' we still light the flame

Let's make it up, baby 'cause I ain't gonna fight
If you're the death of me, darlin', I wanna die

You always say that you love me an' there is no one above me
Never givin', always takin', never bendin', always breakin'
I know you ain't a liar but you don't tell the truth
An' you're walkin' on a wire wearin' someone else's shoes

If you're handin' out misery, I'll be the first in line
If you're the death of me, darlin', I wanna die
...
