"Twilight"

She's got eyes like deep blue skies
Reminds me of the times I've gone inside her mind
When I crossed the line and I tripped into divine
When she looks at you she'll take you to
That hidden place that you once knew
Inside of you, inside of you, inside of you

When the stars align
And the east meets the west
When the new moon rises
And we're put to the test
When we come to the crossroads and you know we'll find a way
Yeah, a new day will begin

We could drift away through the atmosphere
