Ten steps weaving to the bottom, to the floor
I've taken eleven, broken the door
Twelve step, and I don't want to think like that
I will change my coat, pull down my hat
And pray

Clear eyes and clean hands,
A good man.

Circle, go down delusion drive
Nine tail cross-eyed two foot slide
Spit the joy from the joyous green
Find an old fence that I can lean against
