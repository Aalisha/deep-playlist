There might be millions of others
All perfect in their own way, little girl
I've had my chance to have lovers
But I passed them right by girl, day after day
There's only you on my mind, girl
What can I do to make you see
I'm so sincerely in our world
I only wanna let you know that you're all I need
I love you just for you
Girl, I'll say it again and again, little girl
I never wanna let you go
Anyone in love would know
Ain't no changin' this commitment
I'm with you till the end
So many things we're unsure of
As time rushes by out eyes, little girl
