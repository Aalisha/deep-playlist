Na, na, na, na

I don't dare to let it show
Therefore you will never know
What I really feel inside
And how I lay awake at night

Will I ever fall in love
And if I do, will it be with you?
Will I ever fall in love
And will you be the one for me?

Will I ever fall in love
And if I do, will it be with you?
Will I ever fall in love
