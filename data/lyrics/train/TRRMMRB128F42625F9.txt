I've got a name for a certain quarantine
Her name is slowburn, she makes me feel real mean
When I ask why she says I'm caught in a lie
She's got a bad disguise

I ask a question, never got a reaction
I caught a glimpse of a subtle distraction
Instinctive stomach pain, I lie awake in bed awake again
This time it's my revenge

I want to be you, already beaten me
When you are bound I'm free
I'd like to hold you so close you know I'm there
There is no refuge
