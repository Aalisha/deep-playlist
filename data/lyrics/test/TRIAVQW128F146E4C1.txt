Take a moment if you dare
Catch yourself a breath of air
There's another life out there
And you should try it

Dead ends hide on every street
Look before you place your feet
Cracks and fissures keep the beat
And you're inside it

Every thought you never dared to think
Every mood you always knew would sink
Every line you spoke out loud in a jest
All the time you took to be your best
Soon forgotten

The sun must never touch your skin
...
