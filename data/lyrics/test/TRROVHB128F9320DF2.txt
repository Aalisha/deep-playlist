1, 2, 3, 4
oh no its over can i give you a call?
we've come so far we can't climb over the walls
yeah...
caked up, break up and now i want to be friends
its hard to breathe i hope this doesn't offend
offend...

how come you never want to dance with me anymore?
lying cold sleep at home while i'm on the floor
how come you never want to dance with me anymore?
you've got a hold on me girl
