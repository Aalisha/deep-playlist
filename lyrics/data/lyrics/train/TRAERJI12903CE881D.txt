A lonely boy, a handful of dreams
Cold wind blows through a heart wired-in
Open skies he would explore
No there ain't no mastery
Of a passion and a deep blue love

Yearn to see far away places
One day he'd feel two hearts collide
In his eyes tears and desire
But he prays and he swears every night
One day scales will fall from her eyes

Just with a dream
Just with a dream and with a song
On my own I may stumble and fall
It don't matter at all when you're blessed with
Just what's yet to come, what's yet to come

Burning feet on the ground
Got my head in the clouds
You're out to find Arcadia
And I know I will stand
What I can't comprehend
Journey to Arcadia

The more I see I understand
That there's a lot that I don't know
As you awake on padded ground
The final curtain of the show
