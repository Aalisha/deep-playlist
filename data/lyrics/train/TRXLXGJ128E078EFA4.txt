Word iz bond, word iz bond
Word iz bond, word iz bond
On and on, word iz bond
Word iz bond, word iz bond
On and on, word iz bond
Word iz bond, word iz bond

On and on, word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn and it's on
On and on, word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn and it's on

On and on, word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn and it's on
On and on, word iz bond
We be chillin' to the break of dawn and it's on

Woke up this morning with chillin' on my head
Didn't wanna wake my man, so instead I called my girlies
Let's chill today, go out and play
Get in the car and let's cruise around the way

While the lead track plays in the back so soothin'
The system is pumpin', got the kids on the block bumpin'
Just chillin' with my girls it's sumthin'
Got more funk in the trunk and it's funkin'

Me and the girls know the time before we enter
