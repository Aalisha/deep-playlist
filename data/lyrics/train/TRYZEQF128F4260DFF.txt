There were things I could have told you but you've heard it all before and you look so calm and peaceful when you're passed out on the floor swallow everything swallow everything you're the pellet with the poison you're the hand that holds the pearl you're an alcohol girl in an alcohol world swallow everything swallow everything that's how a little bit of me becomes a part of you and I know I shouldn't be complaining cause I enjoy it
