Look at you
You're my dream
Are you all that you seem?
Now you have what I need
And what I believe
Don't tell me you'll lose it
'Cause I'll have to leave

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down

What do I have to give
Until you let me live?
You're all that I work for
But that's not enough
