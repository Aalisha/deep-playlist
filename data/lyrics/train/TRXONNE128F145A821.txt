Tragic was the memory
A sacrifice of broken dreams
It turned the sky a fiery red
And dropped this curse onto my head

For forty days and forty nights
I slept all day, I worked all night
With a burnin' hunger I said goodbye
To every victim that caught my eye

I have no mercy
I tell no lies
I kiss the strangers
And then watch them die

By the light of the moon
I feel a strange desire
By the light of the moon
I hear the devils choir

Oh I am I said
The Queen of the dead
