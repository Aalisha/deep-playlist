Time... Time...
Jesus said time would heal ALL WOUNDS
Time... Time... Time... Time
But we have to live right to get the time
Time... Time... Time... Time
Time... Time... Time... Time
Please, Time, you got to be a friend of mine

Sometimes I am unable to move
I let temptation get me off of my groove
Sometimes I get it
Sometimes it's hard
To stay with it
But right now, get it, gotta get it, get it
Got to stay with it
Makin' up my mind, yeah
Gonna get it together
Gonna love every day every night till I get it
All right
