The order came directly from the CIA
To start the following investigation
Find out what's the hidden power
Lying in the grooves
That drives them crazy all across the nation
They found the jam was moving
Go hey now

It makes the people keep grooving
Go hey now
Go hey now
The agent who was assigned to investigate
When he came home he found to his amazement

And they were rocking, bopping in the basement
They found the jam was moving
Oh, go hey now
Go hey now
It makes the people keep grooving
Go hey now
