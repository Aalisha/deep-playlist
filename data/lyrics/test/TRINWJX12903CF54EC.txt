I could be God or I could be the Devil
I could be a force for good or I could be evil
I can smile like an Angel
Or I can roar like a demon
I can be timid, quiet as a mouse
Or I could go crazy like a psycho killer
I could be human, shock horror
Or perhaps some otherworldly creature

Which way will I go? It really depends on how I feel

I can always be God
He can exist deep inside of me
But it doesn't make me better or a better person
Perhaps it just gives me an excuse to do just what I want to do
God and the Devil are not so different
Both manipulate in their own ways

Which way shall I go? It really depends on how I feel
Am I happy or am I sad
Am I rational or am I mad

It's all a matter of perspective
Yes I guess it's all relative
