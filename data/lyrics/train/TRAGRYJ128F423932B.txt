It was Christmas in prison
And the food was real good
We had turkey and pistols
Carved out of wood
And I dream of her always
Even when I don't dream
Her name's on my tongue
And her blood's in my stream

Wait awhile eternity
Old mother nature's got nothin' on me

Come to me
Run to me
Come to me, now
We're rolling
My sweetheart
We're flowing
By God
