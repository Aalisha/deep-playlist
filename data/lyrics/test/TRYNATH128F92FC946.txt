[Intro:]
They say everything you go through in life makes life worth living
But if the world should end tomorrow...
I often think about that sometimes, know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1:]
I'll take the pain and the strife
I know it's not in vain
And struggle relate to everything in this life
I'm maintaining became a beam of light for the youth in the streets
Intertwining with goons never complaining cause it's all written
Don't be bitter we all sinners
Lusting for the good life, some hearts cold as December
Hiding behind stripes and stars Father forgive um
Earth out of her mind look what she had to witness
I talk to her at times she tell me what's on her heart
...
