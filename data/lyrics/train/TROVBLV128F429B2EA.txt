In this blackout inertia will hold our thoughts
And the exit sign offers no light to see by
Can we cast our shadows alone in the dark
I can't see without you

when the world is crashing down,
part with it, start again,
when the world is crashing down,
these notes will fold themselves,
standing at the margin's edge
...
