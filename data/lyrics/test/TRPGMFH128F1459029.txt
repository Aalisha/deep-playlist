(Hammill)

"Well what's the harm?
It's good clean fun...
why don't you just
go on and have another one?
When there's hanky-panky in the
boardroom, wooly-bully on the farm,
what's the harm?
It's quite allright -
I mean to say,
tomorrow's just another day..."
Oh, but in the morning,
but in the morning haze
will you still feel as fine,
will you still need to trade
day for night?
