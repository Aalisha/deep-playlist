[Intro:]
Ready now
Mi ready now
Mi ready now

[Verse 1:]
Too much white snow
Give them that hype flow
Mek the youths dem brain a trackle slow joe
Give dem that green grass
Never surpass
For my future, my present and the past

[Chorus:]
Give me a pound make me cut it up
Cut it up
Pass it around let me load me cup
Load me cup
Red gold and green full me Dutchie up
Dutchie up
While the army green full me Cutchie up
Cutchie up
Archie come in mek we take a sup
Down pon di scene we chant reggae in Europe
Wicked hear dem vibes yah dem get furious
The few them that love us
Some already curious

[Verse 2:]
Enthusiasm fills my cup
Makes me want to chant from dawn till dusk
Too much white snow
Give dem a hype flow
Mek dem youths a brain a trackle slow joe
Give dem that green grass
Never surpass
For my future my present and the past
Give dem that green grass
Give dem that green grass
