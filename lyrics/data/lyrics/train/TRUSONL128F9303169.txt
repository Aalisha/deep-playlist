[Greg Nice]
I gotta funky funky rhyme with a funky style
I gotta funky funky rhyme with a funky funky style
I gotta funky rhyme... wit a funky funky style
I gotta funky rhyme... wit a funky funky style

Pete's rickety rocket was my favorite cartoon
After marriage the honeymoon
I'll be damn gag me with a spoon
Who loves Popeye, Alice the goon
Ladies let your body flow
Send a chill up your spine like an eskimo
Here's a backstage pass to a funky show
Come give me a kiss under the missle toe
Greg Nice, my lifes like a fairy tale
Orca, was a great big whale
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale
You won't tell, I won't tell
Clientele I must excel
Took a little test, I passed then failed
Breaks... HUH, no need to hit'em
