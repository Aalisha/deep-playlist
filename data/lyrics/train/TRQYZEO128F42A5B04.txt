Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
Don't play it no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Don't play that song for me
It brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you

Oh no, don't let it play
It fills my heart with pain
Please stop it right away
I remember just a what it said

It said, "Darling, I love you"
You know that you lied
Darling, I love you
You know that you lied

Darling, I love you
You know that you lied
