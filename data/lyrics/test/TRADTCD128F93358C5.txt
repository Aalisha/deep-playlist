Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby

Don't leave me this way, now
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss, don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now, come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul

Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
Then come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cos only your good loving can set me free
Set me free, set me free
...
