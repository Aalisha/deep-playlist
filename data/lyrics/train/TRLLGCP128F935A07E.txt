Why oh, Kingston, Kingston in the place that I lie oh
Fernando, oh, you make me feel special

This the one that the DJ play
I the sexy guy them watching
This the one that the DJ play
I the sexy guy them watching

Walk right over to me
And her eyes went right through me
She said you're somebody I should know, oh

Another thing that she was saying
Had my actions delaying
Before I knew it we're on the floor, whoa
Now you're slippin' me your number

Oh, it makes me start to wonder
What I, what I should know, know
Your intentions are so clear
So keep your body right here
Don't you move 'cause I feel it too, oh

You're dancin' on me like you're My Girlfriend
