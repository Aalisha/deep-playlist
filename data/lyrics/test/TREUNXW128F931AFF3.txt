You didn't wait for me to help you out
I would've stayed to clear those final doubts
How suddenly the whole world can change overnight
How suddenly the whole world knows your name

And I find myself questioning all that I have done
And I'm trying to press the button to rewind
And I find myself whispering 'There's more I could have done'
And I wish I had the option to rewind

Is it better to have loved than not at all?
