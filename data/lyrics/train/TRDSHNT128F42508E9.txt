[Nuada's soul takes its trip to space and time. His spirit is almost on the other side. Dian Cencht, the healer and the Druids try to help and heal their beloved king, with their spirit. The magic "CLAIMH SOLAIS" is back in his arm, and his arm in his shoulder, an arm that shines, a "SILVER ARM". Nuada is the real king he is the one that comes in harmony with mother earth and the great goddess regains her pride and honor. Nuada the king the new horned god can bring peace to his people.]

I hear the chant of three spells
War witches ease my pain
The sword of light will lead the way
Eyes cold and cruel I am dreaming
Far out of space and time
The Mochin' word shaking my mind

I am in trance
Three days and nights in secret pain
A great palace on the hill...

Helpless and bathed in starlight
I am like a little child
Another part of me is dead and gone
The elements assemble
A mixture out of sand
The cloak of starlight fades away
...
