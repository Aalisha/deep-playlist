Another day in this broke down place
The towers grow and the skies are slowly replaced
With the cold gray structures that lay to waste
Everything that stands in the way

Stare at the ground as I walk on by
You make me sick and I hate what I feel inside
As I lobby for acceptance, you know I've tried
Another life for you to nullify

I'm weak inside because I see the shape of things to come
...
