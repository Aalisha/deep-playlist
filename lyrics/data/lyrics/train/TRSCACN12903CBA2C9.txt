Bushman

Yeah
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman

You, you need to overstand
You from the african continent
Just how the black American, stand up
Truly is your brother man
Had they dehumanized and taken your name
Had they fed you swine and fed you shame hey hey
Today you would be just the same, stand up
As the people you disrespect and disdain
You have been brainwashed to call each other bushman

But I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman
I am a Bushman

Four hundred and forty years you're telling I
You said as savages our forefathers died
But the savagery of your now city streets today
Makes me wish to be back in the bush now I say
You are worried about the state where you reside
What about the state of your mind
You are living in scenic places with good graces
While there is chaos among the races
