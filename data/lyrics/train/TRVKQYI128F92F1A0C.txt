Now unrest civility and
No more control
With secret societies
Everything's planned with precise calculations
Leading the humans to mass devastation
Majority of all countries
Progress in nuclear armed cognition
And forging it's sinister strengths
Energy depletion for normal life
Is exhausted and leads to
Desperate governments set upon war
The others expect from the skies
Until proper invasion allowance
Now worried on what was once foreseen
The newest values become irrelevant
