Through your heart and mind
It's what you say to me
See them come to call
Baring broken teeth
And all the hands to heal
Scars upon mind's eye
Fitting all that's perfect
Underneath blue sky

Go heart and mind
All in good kind
Go heart and mind
It's better to simply
Go heart and mind
All in good kind
Go heart and mind
It's better to simply
