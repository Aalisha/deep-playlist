Went too fast, ran out of luck
And I don't even give a fuck

I wanna be your manchild
Let's all go it hog-wild
She said I'll see you later
I always gravitate to her
Let's all meet at the station
No heavy concentration
We could all hook up there
The kids are all alright there

Should we go out later?
Showtime for strangers
Should we go out later?
Showtime, for strangers

Dontcha give a fuck anymore now
She's givin up on you now
Do it for the kids they say
It ain't about you anyway

I say we're all grown up now
And sex ain't so safe now
It's all in the groove they say
Doesn't matter anyway
