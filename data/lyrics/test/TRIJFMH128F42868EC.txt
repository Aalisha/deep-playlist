I found you, and I lost you
I was falling in love with you
can you tell me, why you left me
I wanna know
I'm turning back time (i'm turning back time)
Lying here i wonder why
drawing circles in my mind
And tears that won't dry, fall from the sky

Walking high over clouds going by
silver lining caught in my eye
a picture of yesturday, seems so far away
all i want is to hold you near,
tell you things that you wanna hear
I'll wait for you (i'll wait for you)
I'll wait for you (i'll wait for you)

I still need you (need you)
Wanna please you (please you)
