People worry, what are they worrying about today?
People worry, what are they worrying about today?
Seems like there's a good reason to worry, worry, worry...
Seems like there's a damn good reason to worry, worry, worry...
I'd sit around, I'd listen to your story if I wasn't in such a hurry, hurry, hurry.

And I'm so lonely, I just don't think I can take it anymore.
And I'm so lonely, I just don't know what to do.
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die,
...
