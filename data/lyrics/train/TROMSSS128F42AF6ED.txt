You are to me (you are to me), a light to see
You came to me, and set me free
You see me now, not how I was
I'm washed and clean, under the blood

You sit down
On your throne in heaven
And you look down
At the world You died to save from hell
So that we could be with You forever
Where there'll be no dying
Will you use me
To tell them of Your love, Holy father
Draw them in by your spirit
Will you change us, and set us on course
For revival
To set this world on fire

You are holy (4x)
