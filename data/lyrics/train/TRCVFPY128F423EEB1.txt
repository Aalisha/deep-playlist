London
Quieten down and I need to make a sound
New York
Quieten down and I need to make a sound

Kingston
Quieten down and I need to make a sound
Brazil
Quieten and I need to make sound

They comin' through the window
They comin' through the door
They bustin' down the big wall
And soundin' the four

They comin' through the window
They comin' through the door
They bustin' down the big wall
And soundin' the hall

What you want?
Bucky done gun
What you want now?
Fire done burn

What you want?
Bucky done gun
Get crackin'
Get get crackin'

What you want?
Bucky done gun
What you want now?
Fire done burn

What you want?
Bucky done gun
Get crackin'
Get get crackin'
