written by Graham Nash



somewhere in heaven wings are taking flight
flying over a worldly weight of hatred
hanging over a building in the rain

you got to heaven blown across the sky
crying out for the angels to help you
to rise up out of the ashes and the flames

send me half your angels
we're running out of time
send me half your angels
