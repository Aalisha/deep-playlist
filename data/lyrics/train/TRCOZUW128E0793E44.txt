Now, I don't wanna waste your time,
I only want to satisfy.
So wind me up and watch me go,
I'm gettin' crazy as the night unfolds.

Gimme, gimme what I want,
Keep it up now, don't stop,
And I will do the same for you.
I'm gonna take it over the top.

Pre-chorus:
What you see ain't what you get,
There's more than meets the eye.
'Cause you ain't seen nothin' yet.
It's up to us, me and you,
Together we can fly high, high.

Chorus:
I got you, now you got me.
Feels so good to be
Makin' magic, makin' magic,
...
