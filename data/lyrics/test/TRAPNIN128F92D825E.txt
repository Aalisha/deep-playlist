You're walking through the night
Still can't [Incomprehensible]
And I'm following behind

You're playing games of sin
None that fools can win
And I'm following behind

Following you, following you, following you

Do lovers understand your ply?
You command and they'll obey
And I'm watching from behind

One step forward, two steps back
I'm still following your track
And I'm watching from behind

Following you, following you, following you

Waiting here, beside you
I'm waiting for your call
Watching liars passing by
...
