My head is pounding my flesh's getting weak
I'm hiding my pleasures behind
Burnt out like a dead religion
My heart is aching as you crush my pride
I'm torn between love and hate
And victimized my soul
The sky turns grey as blood runs dry
So I did what I had to do
Refused to believe, only a precious lie
