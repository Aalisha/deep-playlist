This is my island in the sun
Where my people have toiled since time begun
I may sail on many a sea
Her shores will always be home to me
Oh, island in the sun
Build to me by my father's hand
All my days i will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters, your shining sand
As morning breaks the heaven on high
I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow
