Intro: Well you know Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid
And Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all? Talking about
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
Would you would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeers
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
