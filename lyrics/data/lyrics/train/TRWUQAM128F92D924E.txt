I am an island underneath the setting sun
In an ocean that is churning
For all I know there might be nobody nearby
Still, the world, it keeps on turning

And when that sun goes down
It gets brighter in my heart somehow
I don't know why this is
But it's what I want to know

Sometimes we start over
And go solo
We're looking for
That summer home
Beside the sea
And for the future

Since I left you I'm a gold balloon that wanders high
I won't sing through rainbows and showers
Taking lovers just might keep my tears at bay
But the dam will break at any hour
...
