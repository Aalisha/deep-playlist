I've been trying to work out how your heart beats, but where is one?
I'm dying in this dream where your car creeps-my feet can't run.
Where in your eyes are the things we've seen because i can't move on.
And if these lights get any closer I will be gone.

So like a rabbit in headlights I know there's no tomorrow.
