The way that you looked at him, and then you looked at me.
You must think that I’m proper blind,
Proper blind not to see.

That I was just a stop gap sitting somewhere in-between his hand and his lap
Let me tell you that I wasn’t born yesterday, my dear.

That kiss that lasted too long, we probably shouldn’t have danced to that song
It was nothing, it was everything, it’s really such a shame its so hard to explain to you
