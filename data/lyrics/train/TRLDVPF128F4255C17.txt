Bright Light it's a magical night
A Ghostly presence in the midnight air
Way over yonder there's a glow in the sky
So I sit back and I stare

It passes overhead and all I can see
Is a silhouette of a nearby tree
Am I the only one throughout the land
Witnessing something so grand

Make believe fantasy
A dream come true behold I say to you
