Everybody told me to take it slow
but I thourght you were the one for me
Times I felt a little unsure
I thourght that we could talk it through
try to mend this love and carry on
You didn't have to break my heart

It could have happened if you wanted to
I was your girl and I feel for you my love
Why did you have to hurt me?
you won't see the pain inside
smile when I walk I let you decide my love
Why didn't you stop to love me?

Don't go breaking my heart (I fell for you)
I can't take it again (no baby)
Don't go breaking my heart (Its up to you)
Can't move on till you say goodbye No - Oh - Oh Goodbye

No one showed me how to walk away
I just told myself I knew it all
