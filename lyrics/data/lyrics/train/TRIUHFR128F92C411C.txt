Up the duff and on the run
Off to Blackpool, sand and sun
She's got a buggy, for a baby
She's a Red Light District lady
He got a distinction in PE
His Mum got nicked for his truancy
Now he's a multiple offender
She's a back-door fanny bender

And in this day and age
It's all the rage
Rape and pillage and sexual slaves
Aborted babies don't get, graves
A sexual riot
A sexual riot
