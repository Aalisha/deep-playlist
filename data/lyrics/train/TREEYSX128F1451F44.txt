[Verse 1: Truth Hurts]
He breaks, me down, he builds, me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we riot, we fall
He comes, in late, but he's, ok
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, when he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

[Chorus: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, he turns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin, spontaneous
He's so persuasive, and I'm his lady

[Verse 2: Truth Hurts]
Oh! Tonight he's waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
