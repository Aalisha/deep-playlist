Firin' out on all eight
Got my foot on the floor
Screamin' through the red light
Honk at everyone that I know

Never heard of danger
It's only fun that I know
Now if you're feelin' squeamish
You'll never last the end of the show

All fired up
All fired up

Lettin' loose with the magic
Night time celebration
Rockin' to the music
We're headed for the top position
...
