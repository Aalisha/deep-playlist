Hateful thoughts inside my mind
Full of rage, you break the bind
Dispensed the shell into my soul
Without a bite of self control

Extinguish the weak

Have you ever
Fed the beast
Well, now it's time
To feed the beast
Have you ever
Fed the beast
Well, now it's time
To feed the beast

For my fury, you're to blame
Now I'll suffocate the flames
...
