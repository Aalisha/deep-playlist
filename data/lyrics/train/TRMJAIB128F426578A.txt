This puzzle's dead inside
Missing pieces growing eyes
Mystery
Little girls severity
Little boys begging mercy
Sticks break on me
Cost of life at 23
Price of pain a golden ring
All crimson
Melting body rubber world
Battle axe with locks of curls
Introverted

My cost, the price of a broken doll
Can you remember that place?
That place you would go to make things okay?

1000 points from insect stings
Glue my spirit, break my wings
Misery
Libido steams infectious whore
Cauterize and forge the sword
