Here we are
Under the same old sun
All alone yet somehow bound and unified
Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes won't take long
We search for a harbour
Somewhere to belong

They say that faith is all you need
To stay forever young
What you've sown is what you reap
Our sins can't be undone

There is a god in each society
So right is wrong where wrong is right
No one could be sure
Still we are certain
