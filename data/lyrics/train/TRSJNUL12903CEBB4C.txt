See the leaves falling to the ground
See them falling all around
On the cemetary mound (x2)

Teardrops on my note pad
Dope sick feels so bad
Everything seems so fucked up
I'm about to go mad

My life tried to live right
This night hope will end right
Hells doors open wide
Inside here's your invite

One breath should I use it?
Life / death should I choose it
Legacy, life of me
Hear my voice in this music

Phone calls to a few peeps
No promises to keep
Close my eyes kiss the sky
And then just go to sleep
