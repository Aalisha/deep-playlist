Mmmmm
Ohh ohh
Ah yea
Ah ah yea

Somebody told me once that pain is a game we all gotta play.
Then why am I in overtime and sudden death every other day.
I know that for the good of life there's a price we all gotta pay
But I'll pay till I'm poor and I still don't know what it is to have a good day, yeah

Since everybody knows what it is that I need to do.
