I walked down to the ocean
After waking from a nightmare
No moon no pale reflection
Black mirror, black mirror

Shot by a security camera
You can't watch your own image
And also look yourself in the eye
Black mirror, black mirror, black mirror

I know a time is coming
All words will lose their meaning
Please show me something that isn't mine
-But mine is the only kind that I relate to

Le miroir casse,
The mirror casts mon reflet partout
Black mirror, black mirror, black mirror
...
