Early in the morning I can't get right
I had a little date with my baby last night

I said, early in the morning (early in the morning)
I know it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning (yeah)
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)

I went to the places where we used to go
I went to her house and she don't live there no more

I said, early in the morning (early in the morning)
I know it's early in the morning (early in the morning)
Early in the morning (yeah)
And I ain't got nothin' but the blues (blues)
