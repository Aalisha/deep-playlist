Uh
Um-um-um
Ow she's a brick house
She's mighty mighty just lettin' it all hang out
Ow she's a brick house
Like lady stacked that's a fact ain't holding nothing back

Ow she's a brick house
Well we're together everybody knows this is how the story goes
She knows she got everything that a woman needs to get a man yeah-yeah
How can she lose with the stuff she use?
36-24-36 ow what a winning hand
