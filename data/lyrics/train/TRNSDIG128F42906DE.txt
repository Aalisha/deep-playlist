(tim johnson/david malloy)

You say that you don't love me, well that's no mystery
I can feel it in your kisses and the way you look at me
You say lately you been thinking that it's time for you to go
Tell me something I don't know

'cause I can't figure out why it all fell apart
And I don't have a clue just how I lost your heart
So make me understand why I still need you so
