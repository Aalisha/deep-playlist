London, Paris, Tokyo
Thinking of you wherever I go
And I close my eyes, you're by my side

A thousand miles can't keep us apart
Your tender words serenade my heart and
You keep me smilin, perfect timin
I wish that you were here with me tonight

See I've travelled all around the world now
And I've seen so many beautiful girls now
(girls now)
But somehow no one ever comes close to you
You know I've been to many different places
And I've seen so many pretty faces
(pretty faces)
But baby, no one ever comes close to you
Close to you, close to you
