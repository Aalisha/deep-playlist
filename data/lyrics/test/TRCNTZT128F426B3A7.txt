These walls are closing in, they´r boung to suffoeate me
Compled to live my life in ways I could never imagine
Can you save the dying eyes? Sentenced to never be free
I stand convieted of all your f**king lies

I can´t wait to see... all the things, that should never see the light
The damage is irreversable... outrageous...
