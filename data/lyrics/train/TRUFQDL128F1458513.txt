Some people say Some people do
Some people say they do What about you
Some people please Some only tease
If you pull the trigger You better be ready for me

I've been shot like a bullet from the gun
Your love's got me on the run
I've been shot like a bullet through the dark
You're the target I'm right on the mark
There's no mistake No matter what you do
For my aim is true And I'm pointing straight at you
