Watch It Scream!

Eyelids Scrutinize In This Portrait Of Idolatry And Rot
Her Body So Fragile
Now In Post-Mortal Hands
I Am Retouching The Essence Of Feminine Refinement

All Soothing Scalpel Guidetd Me To My Vision
The Era Of The Vane Lilled The Beauty Of Creation

Motionless
Paralyzed With Awe
Your Face
A Canvas Untouched

Blooming Like A Cancer
Narcissistic Nightmare
