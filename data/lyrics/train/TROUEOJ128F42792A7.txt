I sleep with my hands across my chest
And I dream of you with someone else
I feed my body with things that I don't need
Until I sink to the bottom
Don't act like it came as a surprise
Don't believe me? Then look into these eyes

This can't go on so I should just
Regret it, regret it, regret it
And even though I led you on
Forget it, forget it, forget it

I'm going missing for a while
I've got nothing left to lose
I don't listen to anything
