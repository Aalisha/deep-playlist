Midnight and I'm ready to move
Don't need a reason I got the groove
My fire is burning, burning hot
When I start I'm working can't stop

Don't need permission don't need a cue
My motor's running and I'm coming after you
Hold me baby hold me tight
You feel so good in the middle of the night

Rip and tear
Rockin' the house down taking the dare
Rip and tear
Mulholland woman she don't care

I need some action I need the chase
I'm riding hard and I'm thinking 'bout your face
Nice n' sleazy got the stuff
What you're giving me I never get enough
