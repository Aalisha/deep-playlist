We're gonna burn your cities
Gonna bring your systems down
I'm gonna drown my pity
Turn this to a ghost town

And when you know there's nothing
Your gonna run like all the rest
Pack your bags and turn your back on all the friends you had left

And it's time for us to live
Yeah!

Its my time, this is just a declaration
Of our vows We won't back down
It's my time, this is just your resignation
From our lives We won't back down!
