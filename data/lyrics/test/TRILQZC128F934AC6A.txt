What I see what can be 
It makes me want to shut out the world 
Or take it all of it 
Take it in and keep it for myself 

Cannot belive the powers to perceive 
When all around things bring you down 
Just have to shut, close up you eyes 
Let the strength come up from inside 

Feel it rising 
Through you brain 
A freight train 

When I need to belive 
I just have to convince myself 
...
