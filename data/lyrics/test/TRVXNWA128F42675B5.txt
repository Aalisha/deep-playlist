It is like I'm always thinking to myself
I'd like to meet someone else
It is like I'm always thinking to myself
I'd like to meet someone else

Darling, don't give me shit
'Cause I know that you're full of it
You're full of shit
You're full of shit

Darling, don't give me shit
'Cause I know that you're full of it

I'm sitting with my friends
Getting drunk again on wine
And I think about you

I'm sitting with my friends
Getting drunk again on wine
And I think about you

You don't have to think about yourself
All the time you're full of shit
