Kick out the windows bust down the doors
We're drinkin' half gallons and shoutin' for more
Take off your shoes and let yourself go
We're never gonna let these good times go
We're gonna boogie till the rooster crows
We're gonna party till the cows come home
Let it roll ...Well, let it roll...

We got all the chicken and ribs you can eat
...
