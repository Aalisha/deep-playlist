(Allman, Sloyer, Cadden-James, LaBrie)

I feel my future
Tied to my past
Why don't we go and leave this world behind
Watch me as I wonder
Aimless through this mystery
Counting all the times
You've fallen to the cold
You were always there for me
Always said a prayer for me

I'm drifting in time
No reason I find
You always come to my soul
Somehow you believed
There'd always be a season for us to behold
I'm drifting in time
No reason no rhyme
You always come to my soul
