Hey you, close your eyes and listen
Can you hear the voices
It's the world that's calling your name

You live your life in your small tiny world
You don't care, you don't give a damn
But the time will recall what you've done

We have a vision, we have a destination
We are here for ourselves
These are the reasons, reasons for a fall
And this will be our call

Hey you, it's time to open your eyes
