Tricky:
From cradle to grave
From cradle to grave
From cradle to grave
From cradle to grave
From cradle to grave
From cradle to grave

Grace:
I am woman
I am sun
I can give birth to she
I can give birth to son
And I can be cool
Soft as the breeze,
I'll be a hurricane
Ripping up trees!

I am woman, I am sun
I am woman, I am sun
...
