(note from Zevonfan1--I greatly prefer the alternate reading of "And I DON'T intend to use it on myself")

So much to do, there's plenty on the farm
I'll sleep when I'm dead
Saturday night I like to raise a little harm
I'll sleep when I'm dead

I'm drinking heartbreak motor oil and Bombay gin
I'll sleep when I'm dead
...
