Leaning against what's next to me
Have no fear, won't see
Will it eat me up or bring me down
I'll gradually make up my mind
My mind

Revolution within myself
I'm puzzled, still overwhelmed
By the stories that you would tell
They always send me something
Revolution within myself
Within myself

Let me give my best
I won't depend
This time I will make
Another plan to find
What's left and nothing less
Still I won't tread
I'll find my own way
...
