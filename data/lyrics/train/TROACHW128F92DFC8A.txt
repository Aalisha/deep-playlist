It's not so easy lovin' me
It gets so complicated
All the things you gotta be
Everything's changing
But you're the truth
I'm amazed by all your patience
Everything I put you through

And when I'm about to fall
Somehow you're always waiting
Your open arms to catch me
You're gonna save me from myself
From myself, yes
You're gonna save me from myself
...
