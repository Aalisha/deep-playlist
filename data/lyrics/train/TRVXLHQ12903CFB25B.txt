Temples of gold ascend to the sky
Monuments made for their kings
as they wait for the sign
Towers of stone, still mystify, ruins are all that remain
Faith in their god they relied

How long til the heavens are one with the earth
and the fire will rise from below
how many times have we try to deny
as if it has happened before
we see but nobody wants to be told

As we stare into the sky and believe we are not alone

Omens were scribed, the writings remain
reminding of what to foresee
did they know so long ago?
