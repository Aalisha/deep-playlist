Conspiracy won't let me see what it is they know, that i know they know
Communication with an alien nation can't be allowed 'cause they thing they'll show us;
A better way of life, not run by drum and fife, and the marching of a glorified war
Nation's government and money that is spent, don't want to change what's happened before

It seems so impossible to you but we all find it easy
