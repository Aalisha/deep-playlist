Uuh, guess who's back
Make it bounce, make it bounce
Uuh, make it bounce, make it bounce
Uuh, make it bounce, make it bounce
Uuh, you can bounce, you can bounce
Uuh, you can bounce, you can bounce

Boy you're telling me you wanna leave, it's alright with me
'Cuz it's something going on that you don't know
I got someone else waiting for me, this is gonna be easy
I knew that one day it was gonna end

I've always needed a way out
Boy now I know what you're about
I've wasted so many years of my life
You can have everything else, I'm out

You can have the house, here's the key
You can have the car, I don't need you anymore
Take the diamonds and the furs, not another word
I ain't coming back no more

You can have the house, here's the key
You can have the car, I don't need you anymore
Take the diamonds and the furs, not another word
I ain't coming back no more
