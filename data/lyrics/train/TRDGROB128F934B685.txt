This is my moment
This is my perfect moment with you
This is what God meant
This is my perfect moment with you

I wish I could freeze this space in time
The way I feel for you inside

This is my moment
This is my perfect moment with you

Tell me you love me when you leave
You're more than a shadow, that's what I believe
