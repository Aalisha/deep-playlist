Are you ready maybe
Are you willing to run
Are you ready to let yourself drown
Are you holding your breath
Are you ready or not

Are you ready maybe
Do you long to confess
Do you feel that you're already known
Are you sure of yourself
Would you lie if you're not

You tire me out
Don't wanna let that happen
A secret screamed so loud
Why did you let that happen

Hoo hoo so put your arms around me
You let me believe that you are someone else
Hoo hoo cause only time can take you
