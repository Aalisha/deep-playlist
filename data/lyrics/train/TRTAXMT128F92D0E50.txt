All I have is memories
Memories of you
All I have is tender thoughts of the past
All I have is lonely nights
Days are filled with groom
I wish there was a way we could be together

Oh, oh, oh, life goes on
And I'll must face the fact
That you're not coming back
And I'm gonna find somebody who can love me like you used to do
Love me like you used to do

I'm so tired of sitting around
Staring into space
My world is so empty, I'm a lonely soul
Looks like it's the end for me
But I must be strong
I like to lose this feeling of loving you

Oh, oh, oh, life goes on
And I'll must face the fact
That you're not coming back
...
