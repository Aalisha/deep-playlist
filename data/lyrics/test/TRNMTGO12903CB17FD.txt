Freight train, freight train, goin so fast
Freight train, freight train, goin so fast
I don't know what train he's on
Won't you tell me where he's gone

Don't know where he's headin for
What he's done against the law
Got no future, got no hope
Just nothin but the rope

Freight train, freight train, goin so fast
...
