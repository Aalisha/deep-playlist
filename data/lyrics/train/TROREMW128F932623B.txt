Your back's against the wall
There's no-one home to call
You're forgetting who you are
You can't stop crying

It's part not giving in
And part trusting your friends
You do it all again
And I'm not lying

Oh oh oh oh ohh
Oh ohh
Oh ohh oh oh oh oh ohh

Standing in the way of control
You live your life
Survive the only way that you know, know
...
