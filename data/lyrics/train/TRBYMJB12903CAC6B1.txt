The way You love me
The way You move
The way You hold me
Draws me to You

I’m drawn into
You
I’m drawn into
You

Late at night, when I cry
And want to drift away
Just one touch is just enough
To keep me for another day

I’m drawn into
You
I’m drawn into
You

I can’t wait another hour
For Your love to come my way
I’m better when I’m with You
I’m not ashamed to say
