To live is to collaborate
All the spineless people
won't capitulate
Will walk again
Will evacuate
And stimulate

And they will wait for the Man
With that ridicolous fairy hand
To work on their lives
And to re-adjust their faith

All the spineless people
Will walk again
Will agitate
And ejaculate

A great act of Sex will be lived here
...
