Slaving for my solace of mind,
Digging in the sand until there's blood on my hands,
Careless to the state I'm in, I've so long been alone.
I've so long been alone, I can't go on.

Rain down, rain down and cleanse my soul.
Flow like a river.

Forging insight by pagan torchlight,
In cadence warlike, we draw tears from the sky,
Because the well's run dry.

Rain down, rain down and cleanse my soul.
