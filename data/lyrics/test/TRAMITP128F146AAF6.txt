Let's walk on by, this time, this time
Let's keep it right, just like it used to be
It's such a long and wasted ride
When you're on your own, when you're all alone
I throw a word in for the real men
Hey driver man, hey cardboard man
On a cardboard scene you know it's never make-believe
Now, do you believe in me?
And freedom's only what they strip away from you
You fight back
But what you gain is nothing like it

(Chorus)
Let's walk on by
