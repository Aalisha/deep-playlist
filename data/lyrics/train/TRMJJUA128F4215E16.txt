Somethin' changin' for me inside
Took a long time
Now there's nothin' for me to hide
I say what's on my mind
Changes, makin' me see the light
I finally see wrong from right
Now I can see every sign.

Oooh, I think I like it
I think I like what I'm feelin'
Even though it's such a surprise
But you know
Oooh, I think I really like it
I think I like what I feel
And changes really open your eyes
