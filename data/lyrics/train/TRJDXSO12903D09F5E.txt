In the void, long before time,
The entity broke into fire
The elements of life once came alive
Genesis, womb of the world,
God of time, bringer of all
Spring out of the dark, behold the light
Stand tall in a land of flames
Gods at war, battle forevermore
Rise, Avalon
From the veil of mystery
The birth of time will soon begin,
For all to see
Rise, Avalon
While tomorrow fades away
Welcome to the poisoned land
