Like the beat, beat, beat,
Of the tom-tom;
When the jungle shadows fall,
Like the tick, tick, tock
Of the stately clock,
As it stands against the wall,
Like the drip, drip, drip,
Of the raindrops,
When the summer show'r is through;
So a voice within me
Keeps repeating,
You, you, you

Night and day
...
