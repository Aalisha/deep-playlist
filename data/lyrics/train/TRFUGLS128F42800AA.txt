Now I'm a walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my den
Now I'm a walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my den
Now if I come out and see my shadow, John I believe I'll go back in

Now I want some feedin' mama, so I can hear a high sound
If you don't feed me baby I believe I'll go back in the ground
Because I'm that walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my den
