Welcome friends
I have nothing to hide
The journey's end has left a mark inside
I'm sure you've heard the rumors, jealousies
And all the lies

I do not fear you
Do you fear me?
Love again

I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to that voice within my soul
I reach out
Can't give in
Learn to listen to it

No victims
These choices were all mine
Looking within
These scars will heal with time
There's no excuse for weakness, selfishness
Or compromise
...
