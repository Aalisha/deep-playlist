I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and served with the table set
In my finest suit, like a perfect gentleman
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick
Where you will sit and contemplate your day

I'll be the waterwings that save you if you start drowning in
An open tab when your judgment's on the brink.
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite
Albums back as you're lying there
...
