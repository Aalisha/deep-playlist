I had a dream
Late last night
The water was running low
And my fields were on fire
Burning my sky
My body was moving slow
And when I awoke
I tasted the sweat
Of desire on my mouth
And I realized, my heart
Had abducted my mind

And they were last seen
Headed south
Now I can't sleep
I'm so wired
And I find myself
Screaming out:

Don't you need?
Don't you want?
Can't you taste it
When you're alone?
Don't you cry?
Don't you feel?
...
