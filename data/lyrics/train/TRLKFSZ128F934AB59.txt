Learning the rules of the games
With atrocity
Living in a prehistoric weather
With intensity
Armed... Cold weapons in hand
Charged... mangled corps on the land
The bestials contortions on the prey
Makes me lust to kill'em all everyday
Curdled by frost
Too young to rust
Fight... Be wild
Warriors of ice
The hell fighters
...
