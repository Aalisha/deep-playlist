Who can befriend that morning star
That morning star
Didn't he come to mock the dead?
Small wonder my heart fled so far
Who can befriend that morning star?

Who can forgive a God that dies
A God that dies
Vanishing into bitter day
Small wonder my heart fled so far
Who can befriend that morning star?
