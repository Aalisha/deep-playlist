Snow in the air, as it rides the winter breeze
Crystals of ice are hanging from the trees
The morning of Christmas has arrived in its due time
The children are waiting, their joy becomes mine

We march down the stairs and into the other room
The lights shining bright on the tree for all to view
The window is shattered and the presents are all gone
And the cries of my children wrote this song

I swear, when I get my hands on him
He'll never breathe again.
I won't stop tearing him limb from limb
