When I was just a kid, little children
My old man used to sing a litle song
But now I've grown to be a man
But it still lingers deep within my soul
Oh yes it lingers deep within my soul

He say now this train it is bound to glory, this train
This train it is bound to glory this train, this train
This train it is bound to glory, This train it don't carry no unholy
This train is bound to glory, this train

Now this train it don't carry no backsliders, this train
This train don't carry no backsliders, this train
This train it don't carry no backsliders this train only carrry JAH JAH children
this train it is bound to glory, this train
Play a little song for me
