Falling from the top floor your lungs
fill like parachutes
the windows go rushing by.
the people inside they're
dressed for the funeral in black and white.
These ties strangle our necks, hanging in the closet,
filed in the cubicle;
without a name, just numbers,
on the resume stored in the mainframe, marked for delete.
please take these hands
throw them in the river,
wash away the things they never held
please take these hands,
throw me in the river,
dont let me drown before the workday ends.
9 to 5! 9 to 5!
and we're up to our necks,
drowning in the seconds,
ingesting the morning commute
lost in a dead subway sleep
...
