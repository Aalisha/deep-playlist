(Jimmie Gilmore)

I'm going out where the lights don't shine so bright.
I'm going out where the lights don't shine so bright.
When I get back you can treat me like a Saturday night.

I'm glad to see you coming, I'm glad to see you go, She once told me I am
Glad to see you coming I'm glad to see you go.
But how I miss you sometimes, Love, you will never know.

The things you've said don't mean so much to me, I am sorry, Love
