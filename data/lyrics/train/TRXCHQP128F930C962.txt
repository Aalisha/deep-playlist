I won't laugh now that your precious sun has gone
I won't pray for the rain to come
Words make me feel like a newborn
A new time has come, I will live it on my own

But how did it all come down?

Keep your head up now, your precious sun has grown
You'll have to wait for the rain to come
A blank page's worth a thousand words
When only one song could destroy them all

And why couldn't it be this one?
I wrote it on my own before the dawn

I won't cry now, the insiders are free to leave
And I feel at peace with the flood still waiting
...
