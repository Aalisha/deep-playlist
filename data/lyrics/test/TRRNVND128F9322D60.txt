Baby's just a little bit tired of the city
Billboards and bullshit got her down
Seems like you need a little hill country
A little back roads drivin'
A little bit of the old top down

Everybody gotta get away sometime
Forget about yourself for awhile
Seems to me that all you need
Is a rag top car and a ride with me
Okay, all right
Just might get a little high tonight
Okay, all right, carry on

Old Walt Wilkins lives up in Nashville
