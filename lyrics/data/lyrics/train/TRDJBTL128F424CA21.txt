Sacred hall, eternal might
Endless fame, see the golden light
Son of the dark, Goddess of youth
Sacrifice her and pay the price

Forever, you'll be guilty
Forever, you'll be free
Forever, you'll be strong
Forever, you will live in peace

Giants
Giants
Giants

But in the light of day, pay us penance
