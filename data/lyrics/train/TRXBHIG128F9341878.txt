Sometimes it's pain
Sometimes it's hollow
Never the same
It'll change you tomorrow
The sadness
Doesn't matter when it's gone

Girl in a red dress
Passes you by
A hurried deception
Gleam to her eye
Like the weather
Will not hurt her when she's wrong

You say you feel all broke and discarded
What's on your mind, baby?
You know you'll get on well once you've started
Over again
...
