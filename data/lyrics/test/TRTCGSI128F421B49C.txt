Be still - I want you to listen - it's all so silly
Our ways have somewhere on the way surrendered
Adjusted to the game and the dream is slightly shattered
Guess the answer was never meant to be found
And when the search is over
Our questions still remain

Enlighten me - I wanna see - how this could be the age of reason
won't you tell me - can't you tell me
Cause I need to know
It's in my head it's in my soul
The fire burns and my heart is sold
...
