If You ask me to come
I'll say go
If you say you love me
I'll say sure if you say so.

Whatever you tell me
I wont believe you
and if you try and try to make me.
ooh i would like to know
which one is willing to lose

All along the wall between us
I see a teacher there for us
I look at the wall and see right through it
I lean on the wall, there for us
