Know sweetness
a whe the gall them love best
and you know sch we no careless
you understan
satisfaction guaranteed
I am for the young in need
unu ready

sweets for my sweet
sugar for my honey
your first sweet kiss thrilled me so
sweets for my sweet

I'll never ever let you go

sweetness look how the gall them a dress
all the man them a seh them impress
niceness a whe the gall them a wear
all the man them a seh you gone clear
sweetness look how the gall them a dress
all the man them a seh them impress
niceness a whe the gall them a wear
