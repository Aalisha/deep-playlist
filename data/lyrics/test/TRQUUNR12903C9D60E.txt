I'm not the girl I used to be
Opened my eyes and I began to see
This is my game, I'm in control
Proud on my name I can defend my soul

And I do what I feel, right
Tell the boys that

When I walk the night

My decision, I want you with provision
It's my life
When you hold me tight

Look in my eyes, what do you see?
