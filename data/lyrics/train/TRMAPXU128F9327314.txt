I don't tell the truth
I bet that's not a real surprise
I said I'd be forgetting about you
But now I know I'm wasting my time
You won't set me free
I guess I'll never get away
I can't beat that feeling inside you
You're bangin' on my heart again

B-B-B-Bangin'
Bangin' on my heart
B-B-B-Bangin'

Just another girl
