[Chorus:]
Give It Up, Give It Up, Give It Up (Uh huh)
Give It Up, Give It Up, Give It Up
Give It Up, Give It Up, Give It Up (Aight go deep)
Give It Up, Give It Up, Give It Up

[Verse 1:]
Aight stop what you're doin, cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style ya all been pursuin
Who you foolin I see through you like a tunnel entrance
On wax you gangsta, trouble visits and your gun is missin
You created a rep so now you runnin with it
You feel safe cause you surrounded by a hundred niggaz
All your mans fake, they give you pounds and handshakes
Cause they rhyme too, so y'all each other fanbase
But your just a bit better, you all stole your flow
from Jay-Z, but you was the one who bit better
So you spin tales a how you get cheddar
Bitches, sixes, benzes, but did you forget Septa
Cause that's the only ridin you do
Denyin it's true, let your rhymes design you
And that's a fuckin shame, cause you one half
of one in a million that sound the fuckin same
You'll never touch the fame, your flow is
Bush Administration ain't nothin changed
And that's the truest words ever spoken dog
Cause they will see you, when the mirrors, weed and smoke is gone
And I hope this song got across, cause you can quote me on the fact you need
to
