Does your wife
Know you're out
Know you're out
Sleeping with a weather-girl
That it never rains on you

Backstage pass
Anorexic lass
On your arm
You're the man
You're so cool
You're the man

But we still love you
You give us something to do
Why can't we be as cool as you?

But we still love you
You give us something to do
Why can't we be as cool as you?

And so you stand out the back
...
