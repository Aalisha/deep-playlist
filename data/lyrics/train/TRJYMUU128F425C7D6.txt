just bought a house, can't deal with the space
just bought a beat, can't deal with the bass
before you use lived good, they'd deal in the bass
you'd only feel real with concealing the mase
not now while you made a great choice
this'll be a good home, i think you gotta a nice voice
however you seen cause it feels real fresh
cause the rappers over here don't ever say "def"
brownstove coal lady, opposite arrest
we deal in condominiums, they usually weigh out
windows on your side view, when you go down south
over there it's okay to have gold in your mouth
i sold crew a house now it's a workstore
real estate sales are the oldest turf war
we've got proxy even though it hurts more
you're on a lease if your major label
