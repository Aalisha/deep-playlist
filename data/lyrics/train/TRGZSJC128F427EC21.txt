It feel so good, my dear
Just lying here with both your arms around me
And it's good to know
That we're in love

Oh, the fire's burnin now
And I can feel the warmth so deep inside me
And it's good to know
That we're in love

There's a kind of magic in the air
That I can feel when we're together (There's a kind of magic in the
Air), ooh ooh
There's a kind of touch that lets me know
That you can feel the magic too

Every time I'm with you, boy
