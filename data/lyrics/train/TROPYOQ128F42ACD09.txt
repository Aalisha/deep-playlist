And [Incomprehensible] ate the world
On all fours, on all fours
And the big boys cry like girls
On all fours, on all fours

And everybody wants to love somebody
Now that there's no one to love
And everybody wants to kill somebody
Now fucking them just isn't enough
No, no, no

Don't believe, don't believe
Don't believe in police, sir
Pin me down, kiss the ground
'Cause I wear tight blue jeans

Federalize, circumcise
Put a bullet in their lies, lies, lies, lies
Don't believe, don't believe
Don't believe in police, sir

Praise the paraplegic
