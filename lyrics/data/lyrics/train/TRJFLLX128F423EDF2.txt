How many times can i lose
I got a long way to go, so do you
I can't afford a mistake
But never see things your way
You bury your best evidence under the basement floor
Can i shake this feeling, and keep my lips from sealing
Is it fate, anticipating

We can't go on with anymore of this
Cause we kept our honor and never clenched a fist
We can't go on

How does it look from your side
