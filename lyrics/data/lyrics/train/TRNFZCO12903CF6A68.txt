The tide rolled in not a breath in sight
And this town went down like the moon at night
These poor rooftops only go so high
The volume of our bodies is causing the waters to rise

Why do we cry out only when things go wrong?
How would you feel if I only sang sad songs?

The gavel slams the verdict is in
And the jury find you guilty for the things that you did
You're scared for your life, so you turn to the man
The man that holds your life in the palm of his hands.
And your heart starts racing like a bullet from the gun
