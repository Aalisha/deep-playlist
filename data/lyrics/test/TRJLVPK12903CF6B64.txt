Dreams to Survive, Dreams Make a Wish Come True,
Oooh . Keep Your Dreams Alive
Dream... Dream On Your Dream Will Come Alive
Come On Dream On, Come On Dream On
Come On Dream On, Boy, Your Dream Will Come Alive
Come On Dream On, Come On Dream On
Come On Dream On, Boy, Your Dream Will Come Alive

Once Again a Song Comin' Strong,
Here to Remind You Got to Dream On.
Go For What You Know Don't Let It Slide,
Take a Change Let's Ride.
To the Future Not to the Past,
Take It Easy and Not Too Fast.
Many Failed in Society,
To Blind to See You Need to Be Free.
