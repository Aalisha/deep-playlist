Slip into the mind and you will find a reckless world
Too many times I watched you abuse it
A pain inconceivable makes unpredictable youth never talk the truth

All your friends walked far away better get used to it
Can't remember yesterday got to get out get used to it
Can't remember yesterday got to get out get you out

Evelyn are you losein' it
