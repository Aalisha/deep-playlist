(Jay Dee and T3)

Ay yo yo yo, and ya don't stop(3x)

Go Ladies(5x)
Ay yo, y'all just rehearsing, rehearsing, re- a re-a re- rehearsing,

(T3)
Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo,
Get this shit
She on our list as a lady to hit
She's kinda thick, I'm getting wit quick
Yo hit me up nine, seven, six
Thugs look to her, just like that
I see you in the corner, I like, yeah I like that
See, ho, yo, me and you girl, goin on yo
Come to my crib lets get in some bizznesss
Wit me, what you wanna do, nigga named 3
It's gotta be, like that, like it's gotta be
This girl aint tryin to be funky
This is how I do it ay yo, yo
This is for the ladies ay yo, yo let me get funky
Just like soul
I get on the mic and drop a flow
