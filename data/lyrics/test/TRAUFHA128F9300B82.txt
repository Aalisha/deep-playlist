If you leave me, baby, say you won't be back
That would be the end of me, 'cause I'd have a heart attack
You better get some insurance on me, baby, take out some insurance on me, baby
'Cause if you ever, ever say goodbye, I'm gonna haul right off and die
Darlin', how I love you, long as I got breath
