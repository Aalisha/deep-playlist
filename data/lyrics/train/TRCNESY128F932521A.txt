Chorus *(Yukmouth)*

Broke niggas make the best crooks
ya best look
over your shoulder
if you's a Highroller
(broke mutha fuckas they make the best crooks)
(broke mutha fuckas they make the best crooks)

Verse 1 *(Knumskull)*

Let's see how your vest look
see if it fits ya
picture four hideous hustlas
quick to lick the silliest bustas
I played the roll
and ready to fold
fix bitches in gold
is a no-no
livin low like De La Soul
it's the "O"
and the folks don't understand
yes you can
rush, shake the van
and catch the Ice Cream Man
they know me
as the loyal citizen
the boy who visited
hot
but on the spot
I'm more chillier than Dennis-in
finishin up my zip
quick to make my grip
you fuck around and get licked
by the Luni click
so that means bitches can't fade me
fuck lobster
I'm fuckin up yo monkey like the monsta on Aliens
I got work
someone told Knumskullin
rollin
four man deep
in a stolen jeep
wit heat
keep the space between niggas and me ever
What? Ballin outta control?!
Nah, petty theivin
leavin no evidence or clues
bitch you gets a date wit yo moms
but you gets robbed by the Luniz fool
if I was a bum
I'd be straight to ride out
fuck a piece of the pie
I take the whole cake and sky out.

*(chorus)* x1

Verse 2 *(Knuckle Head)*

cuz when I roll
