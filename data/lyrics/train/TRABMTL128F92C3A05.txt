I'm no leader I'm just a mess
It's not the way it's supposed to be
It's just the way that it is

I'm afraid we are all victims here
And the one whose in charge

Are we too far gone?
Are we too far gone?
We always assume the worst
We always assume the worst

I'm afraid no ones listening anymore
I'm freaking out
