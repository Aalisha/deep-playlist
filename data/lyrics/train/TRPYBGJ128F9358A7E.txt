Johnny Guitar Watson staring at me
riding on 3 wheels, a woman on his knee
With a leg under the red dress I wish I could see
further North the warmth of lovin' lingering
Now Johnny he be having lots of women
Oh the reason he'd be smiling known to him

On the left the girl in red so innocent
never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed
Yeah the type of girl responsible for original sin
can't help but wonder where and who she is
Oh and the memory's always getting clearer
...
