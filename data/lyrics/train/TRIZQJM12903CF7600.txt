Oh, you're sweeter than the honey that the bees make
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Sweeter than the icing on the best cake
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
I was in the dark but now I see
What was always in front of me
I was always proud
But now I'm saying it loud
Keep on giving it to me
Love and affection to the bone, to the bone
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Keep on socking it to me all night long
Soul sister, you're brown sugar
Girl, you're always there with your man
It's 'bout time he took your hand
