VERSE 1
Hmmmmmm
From when the suns comes up and down again, all my time is spent just thinking of you,
And when the moon comes up and takes its place, I just can’t erase my thoughts of you,
It’s like all the things that you do, only lead me wishing to have you right here by my side,
hoping I can see you tonight, to shower you down with my kisses
