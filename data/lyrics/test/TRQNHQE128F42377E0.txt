Must've had your reasons when you left without a call
I don't want you thinkin' that I shed too many tears
I never felt the need to cry for all the wonderin' why
I don't think love can ever feel that way again

I searched this whole town 'round for a whisper of your name
I don't need you thinkin' that you got the best of me
And it doesn't shame me that I spent a lot of time
Wonderin' if love can ever feel that way again
