So beautiful, yes you are…all my life you’ve been, my good luck charm…
You grew this boy, into a man…showed him how to walk the righteous path…
Wanna thank you for, all you’ve done…for the neighborhoods you fought to keep as one.
Through the thankless times, when no one cared…you were always a rock standing right there.there.but I…
Can’t express my love…
Such an honor to be your son…
It was so hard and so much fun…
There’s not a thing that I could say or do to repay you…
