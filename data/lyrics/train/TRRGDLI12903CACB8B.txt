One step back from a beat down maniac
I'm tired of taking a back seat from all the other demons
That are stealing all the good shit
Leaving me with nothing but my hands

Another stroke down my back, tasting all the flames
That are licking around my neck and making me insane
As they pull me down, pull me down into my grave
I can't get away

Ooh, it doesn't mean nothing
Until you're deep inside dancing to the devil's swing
Whoa, it doesn't mean a god damn thing
Dancing to the devil's swing
