I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys

So honey gotta help me please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby detonate for me

Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
