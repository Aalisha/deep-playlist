Oh no, now honey what have you done?
Oh no, no, it's the sound of my gun
Oh no, now honey what have you done?
Oh no no, that's the sound (that's the sound)

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun

What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?
They say when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath the train
But man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Everybody is on the run

Tell me now it's untrue
...
