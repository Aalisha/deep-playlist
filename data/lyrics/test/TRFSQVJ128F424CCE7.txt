I can hear their laughter
Whistling in the wind
This is my punishment
The price of my betrayal
I can feel their hate
Floating in the air
I can see their faces
I can feel their fear
Death can' be a refuge
This is the sad privilege
I have inherited
For ever
Why can't I move
Everything's confused
How did I get here
Strange I feel no fear
My body's floating
The earth is moving
Oh set me free
Please forgive me

Come to me
My sweet angel
