You never told me about the bell and ball
We built the three-house and forgot what it was
It left me feeling numb

And all the stories that you painted for me
Blue crayon dreams that no one ever would see
They vanished in the wind

And you would put it away
The glass
Away
-To stay

Wont you strip // I cant // oh // breath your // to // day // stay
Reflections were untold
Of your lip // I can't // oh // breath // to // you // lay // say
Reflections were untold and to say

Reflections were untold
The magpie stole our gold

Wont you strip // I cant // oh // breath your // to // day // stay
Reflections were untold
...
