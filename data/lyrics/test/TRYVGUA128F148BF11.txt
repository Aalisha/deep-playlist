It's such a complicated situation
it always ends up in a fight
what I wouldn't give for some isolation
but I'm gonna stay with me tonight

I catch my gaze across the bedroom
we only need some time alone
lost in a haze of self indulgence
oh what's indulgence on your own?

it's an unrequited self love affair and it's not fair
...
