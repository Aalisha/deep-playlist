Well, tonight is our last night on earth my friends
So let's sleep with the stars as our ceiling
And kiss me one time and please make it good
It could be our last night until morn
Well, I guess I know that I'll always be
The one and only one for me
But I hope that this once we dance this dunce
What's to be seen now together we'll see
Oh the train it rolls hard on the cold steel track
...
