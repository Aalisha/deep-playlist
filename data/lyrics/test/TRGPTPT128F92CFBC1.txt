When I was young and I was a victim of a killing smile
Love was cheap and it was great for a little while
I had to leave but she wanted me to stay
Now and she ripped of my shirt and left her marks of her distain

I just can't take it no more
I can't spend another night alone
I can't take it no more

If this is where we ended up
Then I refuse to be so hard on myself this time
If everything I have is gone
Then what is wrong with spending time with you

I keep you warm and you hold me tight
This might be our only night
Be our only night
Oh I can't give up
No no, no no
...
