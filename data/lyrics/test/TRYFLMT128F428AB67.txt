Jah
Ras Tafari!
Home oh home
Oh children home
I wanna go home
Home Oh home
Yes children home
I got to go home, yeah!
We've been trodding
From Genesis
Right on through Revelation
We've been a subject
To masters whip, so bleak
So we wanna go home, yeah!
We are a people
Enslaved and sold
Scattered through the earth
Jacob is calling his children
Twelve Tribes
So we 'wan' go home

Oh children
...
