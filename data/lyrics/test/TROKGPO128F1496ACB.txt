When all goes sideways and all goes blue
That's the time to make right with you
Give up for angles give up for clues
That's the time to make right with you

When all of life's dragging me through
I've got to make right with you
Lord knows, lord knows I do

When power makes offers I pull back my hand
That's the time to make right with man
...
