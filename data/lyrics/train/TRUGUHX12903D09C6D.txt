There was a time, was a place back when
You and I were livin' alone together
We held each other in the middle of the night
And swore we'd somehow make it better

We set our sights on the big city lights
No moss on these rolling stones
And here we are with everything we ever wanted
But now we're together alone

Gotta break out of this place we are in
Runnin' out of time and out of sin
We were livin' smoke and mirrors anyway

Gonna drive all night 'til we disappear
...
