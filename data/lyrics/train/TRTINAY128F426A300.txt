Never seen a sky so blue
I've never been happy with anyone
Like I am when I'm with you
Look at the sun shining up in the sky
I feel a little closer to heaven, baby
When I'm looking into your eyes

And as long as we're together, boy
I'm sitting on top of the world
Wanna feel this way forever, boy
I'm sitting on top of the world

Last night I lay in the dark
Tryin' to figure it out, tryin' to talk to my heart
But now it's morning and I still don't know why
All I know is that you got me feeling so good, baby
...
