i surrender my soulto the dark and the oldi break free his delusions i cravei`m waiting on those who release me my grave visions bright as the dawnhis wishes enlighten me making me strongthe ancient ones call me uponhe whispers my name, come join us my son father, come alter my virtual senserelease me i`m caught between the mortal`s fenceevolution set free, humans are prouderase me my past, come liberate my soul to a world where my enemies will falli`ll rejoice, as my spirit is completeunmask me my ghosts, my future is yours...
