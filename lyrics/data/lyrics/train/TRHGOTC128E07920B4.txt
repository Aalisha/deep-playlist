When the world leaves you feeling blue
You can count on me
I will be there for you
When it seems all your hopes and dreams
Are a million miles away
I will re-assure you

We've got to all stick together
Good friends, there for each other
Never ever forget that I got you and you got me so

Reach for the stars
Climb every mountain higher
Reach for the stars
Follow your heart's desire
Reach for the stars
And when that rainbow's shining over you
That's when your dreams will all come true

There's a place waiting just for you (just for you)
It's a special place
Where your dreams all come true
Fly away (fly away)
