Mother told me, yes she told me
I'd meet girls like you
She also told me stay away
You'll never know what you'll catch

Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off
Some Indonesian junk
That's going 'round

(Chorus):
Mommy's allright, Daddy's allright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
...
