I've been working longer hours, watching money streaming in
I've been trusting crooks and liars like I don't have any friends
I've been finding myself praying when I'm deepest into sin

It's been painful resolution set to jubilant applause
It's soaring highs and crushing lows and grinding in the jaw
It's been begging for forgiveness after laying down the law
It's been like surgery to get through all the flaws

Will this overture seem dull to all my friends?
