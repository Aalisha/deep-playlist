I am an arrow, I am a rocket
I am a river and nothing can stop it
'Cause You are the target
And You are the atmosphere
You are the ocean that keeps pulling me
You're pulling me here

And I can't get away, can't get away
Can't get away, can't get away
I can't get away, can't get away
I keep running into You
I keep running into You
