Im just looking to the future, hope theres compromise,
 Hope it all works out in the end.
Never mind this fickle system, never mind the rage,
Coming down like an avalanche.

All I wanted was a dream; all I wanted was to scream out
Your never gonna get that far. All I wanted was a taste
Come in anyway.

Get me Out Of This Place, out of this war
