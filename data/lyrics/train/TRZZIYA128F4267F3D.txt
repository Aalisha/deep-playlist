They say just once in life 
You find someone that's right 
But the world looks so confused 
I can't tell false from true

And love's so hard to find 
In this state of mind 
Oh i hope I'll know him 
I hope I'll know him 
If he's ever near 

Well it seemed the time had come 
I thought you were the one
