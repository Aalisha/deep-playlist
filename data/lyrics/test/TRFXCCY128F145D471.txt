One thing I know
I've learned over all
The more that you trust
The harder you fall
The more you believe
The more you recall
You'll see the signs
You'll hear the sound
When your feeling of hope
Is turned upside down
My hope lay in tatters
Lying cold on the ground
When I found

You lied
From your head down to your toes
You lied
But somehow I know I'll survive
And I can't believe another word you say
...
