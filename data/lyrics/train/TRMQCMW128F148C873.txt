Nothing is real but it's real if you want it to be
(Ideas in my mind none self subsisting)
Look forward to life all of your life
Just your life not a dream, yeah
(Hello, I've been waiting to meet you)

So turn around you will still feel
That the real is deep inside
And I have opened all my doors
So there's nothing left to hide, I said it, yeah

Turn around you will still feel
That the real is deep inside, I said it, yeah
And I have opened all my doors
So there's nothing left to hide, I said it, yeah

Live in your hole, box your soul
Without hope, pride or faith
(Depend on full attempt of boundary)
Turn around before you fear what you've found
