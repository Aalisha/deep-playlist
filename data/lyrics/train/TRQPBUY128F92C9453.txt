Brother John saw visions of God
So they put him in chains for acting too odd
As the crowd shouted, "Off with his head"
The priest said, "Have mercy let's burn him instead"

Trapped in a world that he never made

I woke up with my head on the floor
In a windowless cell a room full of doors
I got lost, now I'm so far behind
