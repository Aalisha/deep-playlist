Softly something comes
The train into the station
She has often waited
And wondered if he'll come
Why has he kept her waiting
Hell from coming home now
Was it trouble (something)
Or a brand new family

Will he step down
Onto the platform
Will he stay now
Or go again

Softly something comes
A feeling that she loves him
Remembering his birthday
And sentimental times
Was she really that bad
To force him to silence
Were her tears forgotten
Or was it just likeÂ ?

Daddy will you
Stay this time
