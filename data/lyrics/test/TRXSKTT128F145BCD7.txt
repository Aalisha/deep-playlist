(S. Pippen/L. Keith/J. Slate)

I'm your friend you can talk to me
I read your fate I see misery
'Cause the one you love has left you dry
Don't start believin' that you're gonna die
Just pick your heart up off the floor and try, try again

You'll find
Better love next time baby, don't give up and I know you're gonna find
