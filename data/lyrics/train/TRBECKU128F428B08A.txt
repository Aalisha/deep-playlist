I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot

Open the door, feel the breeze
And park that ass like AJ's and Free's
But this section's E's behind the rope
If you're not with me, freeze, back the hell up

(I'm hot)
DJ's know what time it is
Kid Capri, Flex, S, Clue or Biz
It is off the lid, spot's type crazy
Cat's up in here got more bling than baby

I'm not ice rockin', Cristal poppin'
The type to rebound with chicks I'm not Rodman
I gotta girl with a butt big as Trina's
And green eyes but mines are greener

(Oh baby, I'm hot)
I keep it simple like, add and subtract
One color, everything I rock is black
Like that black chic, black whips
Black Amex, card brand new, never ran it

I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
 (Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
 (Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
(No doubt)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
 (Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven, ooh
 (Oh baby now, let's get down tonight)
