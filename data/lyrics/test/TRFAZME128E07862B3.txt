I get mad wicked (fuck around) and catch a bad one by the funker
I puff the mad spliffs and roll blunts with Archie Bunker
Cause my brain is twisted, so I cock the biscuit
Cause shit's thick, some say I'ma bastard of a swift bitch
negro, funkin it with the style in your ear bro
To make you _Fear_ me like _Cape_ without Robert DeNiro
You big pussy, so funky that you have to douche me
You can't hear me then my record label didn't push me
I know I'm sayin fuck too many times in my rhymes
but if I wasn't bad, I wouldn't freak it in the line
But it don't seems to matter cause my shit get fatter and fatter
I'll do the funk in your face and it slaps ya
How does it feel with the face full of funk
with the bass in your trunk, weed laced with the blunt
I puff, I never got snuffed, bust while I dust your monkey
ass off then I just crush on the hush hush
So if you want a taste of the funk from the gutter
Ask the brothers (why?) Cause I'm bad (word to mothers)

"I'm a bad."	"Yo word to the mother" (3X)
"I'm a bad."	"Bad bad, and a wicked in bed"
"I'm a bad."	"Yo word to the mother" (3X)
