Crying on my pillow, lonely in my bed
Then I heard a voice beside me and she softly said
Wonder is your night light, magic is your dream
And as I held her, she said, see what I mean

I said what?
She said oo-oo-oo wee
I said all right
She said love me, love me, love me

Undercover angel, midnight fantasy
I've never had a dream that made sweet love to me
Undercover angel, answer to my prayer
You made me know that there's a love for me out there (somewhere)
Yeah, somewhere

Heavenly surrender, sweet afterglow (undercover)
Given up my heart to you, now angel don't go
She said, go find the right one, love her and then (undercover)
