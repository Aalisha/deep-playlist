If you feel the rollin' thunder
An' your eyes see lightnin' strike
Don't be afraid to call on me
I'll bring you shelter from the night

When the wind is howlin', I'll hold you near
An' soothe your troubled mind
With a little bit of this an' a little bit of that
I'll make you leave all your worries behind

Don't try to hold on to what you got, uh
'Cause I got what you need
Don't try to hold on for anyone
Come on, give it to me, oo

Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood, you're hot property, young blood
Young blood
