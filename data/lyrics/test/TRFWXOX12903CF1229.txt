You're number eight. Your name is Jane, with black hair, braids, and black lines around your eyes... Shades to hide your habit. I don't know your age, though you guessed mine... My sign. Your sign! The opening line is always just the same. The same intention, destination. You and me and rainbows.

Loaded guns attract. We know the rules, we don't react. We wait in hope, we don't expect - You and me and rainbows.

Down here everything is fine. We have a straw, we have a line. We have a bag, a rock, a mountain with a string of shepherds driving lions. Aiming skewers at the sheep... face down, asleep in onion fields. The frying fields. The worms... they peep through holes which once were eyes. They thrive... they bake although we painted out the sky and the sun. There's only thunder, and you and me and shadows.
