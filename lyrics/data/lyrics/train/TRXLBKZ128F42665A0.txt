I can see the world's changing,
I can see it re-arranging,
Happening before my very eyes.

Everywhere the cements growing,
In the street the traffic's flowing,
Ruining the air up in the skys,
Is no surprise.

I want to get away and live my life,
In the rivers and trees,
I want to spend the days making wine and be free,
Be free (Be free, be free)

I can hear the cities calling,
Come on down i can feel you falling,
...
