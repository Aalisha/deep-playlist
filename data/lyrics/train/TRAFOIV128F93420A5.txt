what you need is to take a chance
dancin' days are a thing of the past
mix it up and make her go
Just to let her know

This is the night
to let it show

and if your feelin' wounded
don't waste the time move right away
'cause fallin' down isn't that far to go
Just to let her know

(hey now, hey now, take it to the other side)
You don't look so cool
but you look so alive
...
