All I see is terror, all I see is pain
All I see is mothers dragging children to their graves
A curse as old as time, an Armageddon misery
Spectators of a world in ruins, hypnotized I'm staring at

Impossible brutality, impossible brutality
Impossible brutality, impossible brutality
Is all there was
Is all there'll ever be

All I see is violence, all I see is hate
All I see is tyrants dragging servants on a chain
A curse as old as time an Armageddon misery
Spectators of a world in ruins, paralyzed I'm staring at
