Come and listen, brave and tall,
The greatest tale I have to tell you,
It was a bleak and barren moor.
In ancient days he fell.
There rode a man of high renown
His name it came as hunter Childe.
Every day he chased heath and waste
On a moor so black and wild.

The wind blew in and that hunter
Fell upon a bed of snow.
The night drew in and that thunder
Stuck him in a steady hole.
He looked up high and he begged her
"Let me see my lover home".,
The moon called out to the hunter
"Come into the shadows".
