Oh sleeping stars, why are you so sad tonight
Oh sleeping stars, will you shine for me tonight

Can you hear those echoes of their sweet cries, creating a tune
Can you see them shine so bright
Can you feel their loneliness through their cold light, touching you

My eyes feel so weary when the stars are calling me
