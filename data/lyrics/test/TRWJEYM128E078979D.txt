Relax, relax, relax, my little brother
All that you'd been through... a lifetime
Cling on, cling on, cling on to me my little brother
And we'll laugh at the grand scheme of things

You burned yourself down to the ground
You picked me out from a crowd
You're losing it, but I couldn't tell
Till you hung yourself
...
