There's no way that I could ever explain
I got to hold you in my arms, dear
Or else go insane
And what I'm feelin' in my heart
Feelin' in my soul
It makes me just a little dizzy
And out of control
But I've been waiting all my life
For someone I could stand
And you're the primary reason
I feel like a man
And what I'm feelin' in my heart
Feelin' in my soul
I couldn't ever hope to tell you
I'm sure you must know
CHORUS
It ain't the cool thing to be leaving
You're a sweet, young and naive thing
Here comes the night
