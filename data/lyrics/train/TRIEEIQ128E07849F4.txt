There goes another night time
There goes another dream
When will it be the right time?
It's later than it seems

I used to wait for you
All that has changed so soon
How much can someone love
A someone like you?

I really don't need no light to see through you
I really don't need your love to see me through, yeah
I really don't need your heart to set me free
I really don't need the way it used to be, yeah
