And so it erodes, from my septum to a numbed aorta,
Yet I longed to run as I watched you grow smaller,
And finally fade into the long perspective.

This time you won't be calling out,
So I'll keep on longing, keep on longing,
As you keep on walking.
I longed to run.

We'll never walk together through leaves and over bridges,
To the sound of bells ringing out from that lone tower.

Steps strive towards,
