(I might be yours tonight)
I see you lookin' at me in the club
You been waitin' to come and show me love
I'm passed my limit, he's lookin' good, must admit it
Happy juice up in my system, let's keep it hot bartender
His hands upon my waist, so close that I can't wait
I'm going home with you, if I have one more drink

One more drink then i'll be, then i'll be in love (one drink)
Then i'll be in love, yeah (you may get lucky)
One more dance, good chance that you'll be in love, that I'll be
in love, yeah
(Baby)
One more drink then i'll be, then i'll be in love
Then i'll be in love, yeah
(I'll be yours tonight)
One more dance, good chance that you'll be in love, that I'll be
in love, yeah

I'm getting lost in this liquid high
