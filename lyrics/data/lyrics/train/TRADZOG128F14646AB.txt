wake me from this lucid dream
i no longer have control

grabbing hold of nothing
slipping down the Nile
soft river in white water
dragging down the ill lit road
gasps for air and awkward chokes
flailing limbs to fight for surface
an edge to take the sun away
turn of tides the water trails
travelling further down the mt
slowly losing all will to fight
the river swift it picks up pace
ruthless waves and swelling whirlpools
and soon my body will be thrown down the waterfall
...
