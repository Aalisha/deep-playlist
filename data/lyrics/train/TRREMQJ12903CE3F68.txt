I board the train tonight
To run from the man
Who pens all these years of my life
To make us wise

I was convinced I was not innocent
til tonight
When the truth with the flare and the scales
That were pinned to my eyes
And wrung them try

Would someone please hit the pause button?
Please hit the pause button
Now that I'm here
Would someone please hit the pause button?
Please hit the pause button
Now cause I'm scared

And no I don't want to grow up
and take on a world that is
