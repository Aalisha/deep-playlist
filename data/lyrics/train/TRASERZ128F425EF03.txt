Uh-huh, yeah,
Uh-huh, yeah, uuh
Uh-huh, yeah, uuh
Uh-huh, yeah, uuh
Uh-huh, yeah, uuh
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

Hear my cries
Hear my call
Lend me your ears
See my fall
See my error
Know my faults
Time halts
See my loss
Know i'm lacking
Backtracking
Where i met you
Pistol packing
Itchy finger
Trigger happy
Try to trap me
Bad rap
Wiretap me
Back-stab me
Break the faith
Fall from grace
Tell me lies
Time flies
Close your eyes

Come with me
Come with me, yeah
Come with me, uh-huh, yeah

You said to trust you
You'd never hurt me
Now i'm disgusted
Since then adjusted
Certainly you fooled me
Ridiculed me
Left me hanging
Now shit is boomeranging
Right back at you
Think long range
Narrow-minded
Left me blinded
I cosigned it
Shit backfired
But i'm bouncing back
I grinded
Not many would bear the pressure
You comprehend me
You want to end me
You offend me
It's trauma
Feel the trauma
