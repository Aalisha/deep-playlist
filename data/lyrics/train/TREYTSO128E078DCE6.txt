Heaven On Earth
We Need It Now
I'm Sick Of All Of This
Hanging Around
Sick Of Sorrow
Sick Of The Pain
And Sick Of Hearing Again And Again
That There's Gonna Be
Peace On Earth
Where I Grew Up
There Weren't Many Trees
Where There Was We'd Tear Them Down
And Use Them On Our Enemies
They Say That What You Mock
Will Surely Overtake You
And You Become A Monster
So The Monster Will Not Break You

It's Already Gone Too Far
Who Said That If You Go In Hard
