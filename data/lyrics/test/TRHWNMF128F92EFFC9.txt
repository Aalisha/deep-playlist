I am stuck at the airport
Waiting for the numbers to change
I'm stuck at the airport
Hoping that the flights will rearrange

I am stuck at the airport
And my iPod is broken
I am stuck at the airport
I'm trying to text you, I'm not joking

Babies crying, someone sneezing
On my carry on bag
Chihuahua dog is flying
I've got a little seat, what a drag
