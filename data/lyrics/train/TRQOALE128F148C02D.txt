Come to me baby, ahh, sexy lady
I'd get a thrill if you'd say you will
Come here, baby, come here, baby

Let's play house, babe
Come here pretty baby
Be my spouse, babe
Ooh, sexy lady

I'd get a thrill if you'd say you will
Let's play house, baby
Do it with me baby

Gimme the music
Let's play house, baby
Gimme the music
Let's play house, girl

'Somebody Done Somebody Wrong' song
Gimme the music
Gimme that 'Baby Come Back Home' song
Gimme the music

Let's play house, baby
