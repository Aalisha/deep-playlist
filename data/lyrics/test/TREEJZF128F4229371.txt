sound the bells and take to the streets in arms.
we're descending fast, a pox on your house of cards.
dry your eyes, your daughters have lost their faith and started feeding upon the bait that we wear on our sleeve.
promise us you won't tell the public the fury with which we despoil.
I've got a wife and kids and a hybrid car. I've got a good life and I can't risk losing.
if you can keep it a secret then me and the boys will bring pale hell to this town.
we're trouble bound and we summon the devil electric.
prey on the faint of heart.
