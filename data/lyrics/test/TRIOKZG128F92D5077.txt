1, 2, 3, 4

What's up girl? Let me holler at you for a second
I just want you to know all of those other girls
They never meant anything to me
You're the only one for me

You turned me on, sounds so good talking fast
But before we go on there's something I should ask
Not about your past 'cause I don't care who came before me
No my maturity's bigger than that

I am more curious 'bout what you truly want
Do I sense sincerity or just good talk?
I don't care about the rumor mill but be understanding
How you truly feel for me and yeah I want you sexually

But I ain't talking 'bout that, ain't talking 'bout them
Ain't talking 'bout her, ain't talking 'bout him
I'm talking 'bout trust, I'm talking 'bout truth
I'm talking 'bout me and what I'm giving you

This is my heart, please take care
