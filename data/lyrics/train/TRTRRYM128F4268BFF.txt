Assholes and opinions
Everyone's a saint
I say don't discriminate
Let's increase the hate

Manipulating governments
The TV is their tool
God is saying just be praying
Everything is cool

Preachers praying on their flock
Mounting them on holy cock
Shove a bull whip up your ass
And call it art, I have to laugh

Our world is run by power hungry
Selfish, greedy pricks
They want us to divide
Unite and turn the tide

Kill, kill, kill
Kill the assholes
Kill, kill, kill
Kill all the assholes

Kill, kill, kill
Kill the assholes
