Wonder why, wonder why, wonder why
why must we pretend
Why can't we be more than friends?
Let's be more than friends.

What are you afraid of?
We've been playing games love
Together we crazy, good I mean baby, so why you gotta change up?
Baby when we make love, in ways I never made love
Feels so real, but something still is missing from the picture
Everywhere I go, people wanna know. wonder where I been, what's the deal wit him
Is y'all really cool, is he just a friend
Now I'm asking you, tell me what it is
Look me in my eye, you don't have to lie
Must think I'm a fool, f**king round with you
Need to give me proof I need to hear the truth
I just got one question for you

CHORUS:
Wonder why, wonder why, wonder why
why must we pretend
Why can't we be more than friends?
Let's be more than friends.
