When you find you can't somehow
Make it like all the rest
You won't need to scrounge
Around for someone else

Torn between the unknown
And the place that you call home
And the life you want
But have never known

There was a time
You could put it out of your mind
Leave it all behind
There was a time
That time is gone

What has a life of fifty years
In this town done for you
...
