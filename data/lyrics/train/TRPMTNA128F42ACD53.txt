Everything is still not a chicken not a body
Just an awful sicken silence roarin' in my brain
And the fog of death deepens and lies upon the land
An ould wan rolls over on her back
The grass stains still green upon her chin
I can still hear her keenin' and screamin' in the wind

God's curse upon you, Lord John Russell
May your black hearted soul rot in hell
There's no love left on earth and God is dead in heaven
In these dark and deadly days of Black 47

God's curse upon you, Lord Trevalian
May your great Queen Victoria rot in hell
'Til England and its empire answer before heaven
For the crimes they committed in Black 47

Paudie says "Come on now
Don't look back, she's not livin', she's a phantom
