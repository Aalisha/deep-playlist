Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.

Well I begin the weekend with a groove roll about eight deep now
What's my next move
Wait until night fall so I could enjoy systems
Pump by four Jeeps
running like a convoy roll to the club
Kind of crowded
What a scene
pulling up with Jodeci
Blasting out the fifteen
So I park my ride
Girls see my gear and notice my grill
Here comes the pointing and staring

Ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of your body tonight.
Whoa, ev'rything's gonna be alright.
Let the music take control of you body tonight.

Now I sign a couple of autographs
Take a few flicks
Order Dom Perignon and lay back with my chicks
Mike is on the left of me
Smooth is Flipping
Tricky and Moet are on the dance floor ripping
Silk is with a cutie
Big D, I'm trying to find him
