[Intro: Jay Love]
Cuz I've been waiting just to see what's between your legs

[Chorus]
I if I told you I love you
would you get on all four for me?
would you tell your little boyfriend
you're coming on tour with me?
(Cuz I've been waiting just to see what's between your legs)

[Verse 1]
Is it your upperhead or is it the lower?
I've been wondering if you've cut your grass short when you give it the {?}
And since I was hoping that your head would visit some more
I keep my rain forest clear if you're kissing the boa
I'm in a position to show ya, it's mad important
What a cat just sportin, keep your ass for shorting
You don't want to call about her, I'm in the lab recording
And spitting a hairball out like a cat that's coughin
I've seen enough nights between the up-rights
To know how to feed the lovelife to keep your muf tight
I want to see a cut like your in the marine court
Or a burf so shiny like you're swim for a team-sport
Of course your lover means more
And it's enough that I don't have to change exsistent puff
But I'll fix it up a bit... with the bigger than just a scissor-cut
{?} less clip of us
This isn't just to keep the yatch in between your dock
I'm thinking outside girl, I'm not just a bee in a box
You want me to treat your crouch?
