Goin' home, goin' home
I'm a goin' home;
Quiet like, some still day,
I'm just goin' home.

It's not far, just close by,
Through an open door;
Work all done, care laid by,
Going to fear no more

Mother's there, expecting me
Father's waitin' too
Lot's o'folk gather'd there,
All the friends I knew,
...
