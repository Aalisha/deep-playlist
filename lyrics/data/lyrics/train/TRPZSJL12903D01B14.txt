We are the nothing grating against the norm
We are the something that will not conform
No one understands what we've been given

We are the useless by-products of soulless meat
We are all gone we all sing the same tragedy

Open wide and eat the worms of the enemy
We are the enemies of reality, in a world that's unforgiving
