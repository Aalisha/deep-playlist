Yesterday my life was filled with sadness, 
I had little hope of ever, ever finding gladness, 
All my roads were closed, 
And marked with Never, Never, Nevermore, 
I had accepted my life to be just a bore.
Whooohooohoooooo... 
All I did was sit at home, 
And watch and search for tomorrow, 
That was the only thing from life
That I thought I could just borrow.
But now my life has changed, 
As the world turned, it's rearranged, 
'Cause I found sunshine, yes I did, ha! 
Had shone over the dark hill.

Wooooooooww
Oh, I'm, I'm so glad, so glad, I fell for you, 
I wanna say I'm, I'm so glad, so glad I fell for you.
What I wanna do is thank you baby, thank you, 
Thank you baby, thank you baby, 
'Cause you knew what, you know you knew what to do baby, 
Oh yes you did.
