gather 'round, ladies, gather 'round
hear the news that's coming down
the ships are in and the sails are down
the boys are back in town

get your skirts down off the rack
the boys are in and the boys are back
and no time now for takin' slack
the boys are back in town

yeah the boys are back in town
...
