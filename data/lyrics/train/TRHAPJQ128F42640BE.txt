Where have I placed my reason
why do I lose control
seems that I've lost the lesson
it seems I'm blind to what I see the most
Through all the crowd day to day
the smallest things drag me the most
I feel laying cricket 'fore the rain
from loosely to completely lost
Gets so mean for it's own sake
...
