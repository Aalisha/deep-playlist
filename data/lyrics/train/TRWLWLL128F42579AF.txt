Bathe in laser light, the beam will underline
The birth of universe from nothingness
prime awakening, the second beam comes in
To bounce and interfere as drawn by will

We're finding that we can never die
A subject no more to loss and gain
The more you try to connect with form
The less you're yearning to see all you could behold

Then the third beam comes to bring it all alive
And bring to form the once chaotic swirl
See creation sing the word infinity
Behold this organized constructive skill

We're finding that we can never die
A subject no more to loss and gain
The more you try to connect with form
The less you're yearning to seel all you could behold
