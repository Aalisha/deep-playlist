There's something that I wanna keep
inside my heart where feelings are soul deep
things could get worse day after day,
I know my dreams would never fade away.

I know you've got soul but you're wasting your time
looking for our goal you don't need to find
so please change your style and start living for a while
everything is already there in your heart.

yeah yeah yeah

It's there when you are asleep
when you heart beats you can hear it soul deep.
