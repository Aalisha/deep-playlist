Lipstick powder and paint, lipstick powder and paint
Lipstick powder and paint, is you is, or is you ain't
There goes my baby up a tree, a-giggling and a wiggling her toes at me
Let me put my glasses on, haven't had such fun since she's been gone

Lipstick powder and paint, lipstick powder and paint
Lipstick powder and paint, is you is, or is you ain't

Hound dog scratching fleas, looking like she's in love with me
Licks my hand everywhere I go, I wish my baby loved me so
