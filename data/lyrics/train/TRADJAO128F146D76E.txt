Standin' on the corner of civilization
There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps

Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home

Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind

Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can't taste the salt when I lick his tail

Naked in the rain
