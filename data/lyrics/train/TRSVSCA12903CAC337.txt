Pretty mess with a pretty voice
Humming in my ear
Drowning out the world's noise
Such a pretty one, such a mixed up one

I once was lost then I was found
I wanna make things better the second time around
What a precious sound
Hearing the words a second time around

And how will you understand? As if I would back then
How will they understand that's who I was, not who I am?
And I'm not a perfect soul and I'll fall again, I know

I must pull myself together, this is a brand new day
Pull myself away from my mistakes
Pull myself together, it's time to let the waves
Take me, pull me away

And I know for you this must be hard
