Everything around me seems much different from where I'm from
And at this rate I think that my faith has been
Well go cause if you live a life that no one knows where shes gonna go

Right here right now, this ends, gonna give it up in the end
And I won't say one single thing till we get this right
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

Hey mom I wrote you some soft songs, and tell dad I'm just fine
We have to choose we made our moves, now we gotta go, gooooo

Everything about me seems much different when I was young
I couldn't wait to take my place 5 years to pass
So why, I've never felt so alone in my whole life, times not on my side
