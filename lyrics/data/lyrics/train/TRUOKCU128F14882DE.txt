Look beyond the sullen sound
Past your boxed up hollow station
We are moving forward towards your own betterment
Fire your attention away from jaws to your feet where
We'll make 'em, make 'em move forward

If you change this grand design
And sweep its general outlines
You are one step closer towards your own betterment
Every time we close our eyes
Rhythm falls out
Come on, come on you can't hide

Slide into the middle
