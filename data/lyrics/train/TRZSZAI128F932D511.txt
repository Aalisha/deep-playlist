And we lived in a family time,
And we'd unite in a family way.
And off in the ancient mountain,
They were splitting every nucleus.
But they said, "Don't be alarmed,
They said just don't try this at home."
And they were the mystery that made the world run
And we had the power, 'cause they were the sun
And we called them our heroes, and the future had come.
They said, "Look at the light we're giving you,
And the darkness that we're saving you from."

Soon they were bringing it into our showrooms,
And they'd unveil it with its title,
Bring your family, bring your family,
It's the great unknown.
You can look, but you can't fathom,
It's the Great Unknown.

I'm no ordinary princess,
I was born in the Cold War,
And my team is the Rockets,
