I know you told your friends
All about me
It's love in vain, I'll set you free
You didn't break my heart
You ripped it out
We can't go on like this, there's no doubt
There's no reason
To make it dirty
It's one on one, baby
Here we go
I don't really want you to leave
But I know you'll find a better man
Goodbye good luck
Goodbye good luck
I won't see you again
'Cause I love you to death
Goodbye good luck, baby
