Sure got my piece of heaven
An angel in disguise
Gone wild

But I thought you were a man
Who knew right from wrong
That's why I really don't understand
Why he's with her

What has she got that I don't have
Is it the way she looks at you
Laughs with you, can she,
Does she make you beg for more
This is hurting
What has she got that I don't have
