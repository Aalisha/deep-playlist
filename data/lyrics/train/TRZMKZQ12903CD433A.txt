I can tell you're looking at me
I know what you see
Any closer and you'll feel the heat
(GG)
You don't have to pretend that you didn't notice me
Every look will make it hard to breathe
(T R X)
B-Bring the boys out
(Yeah You know)
B-Bring the boys out
(We bring the boys out Yeah)
B-Bring the boys out
Soon as I step on the scene
I know that they'll be watching me watching me (Get up)
I'mma be the hottest in this spot
There ain't no stopping me (That's funny) stopping me I know life is a mystery
I'm gonna make history
I'm taking it from the start (Ah ah ah ah)
Call all emergency
I'm watching the phone ring (Ah ah)
I'm feeling this in my heart my heart (Ah ah ah)
B-Bring the boys out
Girls' Generation make you feel the heat
And we're doing it, we can't be beat
B-Bring the boys out
We're born to win
Better tell all your friends
'Cause we get it in
You know the girls
