I been watching, you been watching me
(Baby, through the night)
And if destiny was meant to be
(Then I'm gonna hold you tight)

Oh, watching, you been watching me
(So baby, it's alright)
I wanna wine and dine and set you free
(Under candle light)

Night and day, yuh, body sway and your smile
Wanna be, wanna say, "You fit my profile"
'Cause that's the way true playas play
I got nothing to hide, so right now baby
I wanna feel your bonafide

I need you, lady right here with me
To satisfy my fantasy
Been waiting for so long for someone like you
Your finesse justs keep me going through the other [unverified]
