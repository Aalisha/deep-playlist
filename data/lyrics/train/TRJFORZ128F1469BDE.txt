Sugar Cane


History takes me back to the basement of our culture
I can't hide myself anymore
Beneath this so-called of civilized men

The hand of the past may help to lay back relax
If we check it now.

And what you've got to do is just take care of
That inner black beauty that shines through
Your melanine tone
