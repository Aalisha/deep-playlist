Back then, I didn't know why
Why you were misunderstood
So now, I see through your eyes
All that you did was love

Mama, I love you, Mama, I care
Mama, I love you, Mama, my friend
You're my friend

I didn't want to hear it then, but I'm not ashamed to say it now
Every little thing you said and did was right for me
I had a lot of time to think about
About the way I used to be
Never had a sense of my responsibility

Back then, I didn't know why
