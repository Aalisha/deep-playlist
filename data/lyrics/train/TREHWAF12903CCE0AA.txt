I've been waiting in this bedroom
And nothing seems to make this any easier
I think I'll take another shower

Hopefully if I keep singing
Maybe this will all just go away, oh, oh
The next guy that walks through my door
Might strangle me and then I might be saved, oh, oh
San Paulo seems so far away right now

Kill me, baby, won't you kill me?
Kill me, baby, won't you kill me?
Kill me, baby, won't you kill me?
Kill me, baby, won't you kill me?
