On this day, snowy day
Let me thank you for the joy you're giving me...
I'm so happy...
I have snowflakes of love smiling down on me
Winter bliss when we kiss
Every wish my lips could see
I'm so happy...
I have snowflakes of love smiling down on me

Snowy day
Would you please take me away
Away with you...
