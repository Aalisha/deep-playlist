We've been out in the cold
Trying to get in
We've been ripped off and rolled
Heads in a spin
Nothin can stop us breakin' through
Finding my way back home to you
Standing alone in the fight
You've never been out of our sight
We're back on the streets again
We're back on our feet again
We're out of the night
Into the light
