Tell me tell me why you wanted to go
Though I asked you to stay
Most definitely the finest girl
From around my way

Sexy physique, sexy for that
It was just your way
I coulda been your man
You could've been my sweet lady

Now I can't see how this could be for real
Oh, no, how you could go and leave before
I could tell you how I feel? So I sing it

Now I don't know
As I'm cruisin' in my ride
How did I let you go
Without a woman by my side?

Always stoppin' my flow
It's just my flow, give it a try
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
