Like a summer breeze floatin' cross the water
Softer than a whisper on my skin
I can't begin to tell you how it moves me
It's so intense, I burn within

When she gets close to me
My emotion break free
And I just wanna hold on to her permanently
It's like nothin' else my heart has ever felt
It's unbelievably heavenly
When she gets close to me
