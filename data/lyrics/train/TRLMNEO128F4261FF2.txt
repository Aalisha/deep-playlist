Praise Him all you shining stars
Praise the Lord in all the earth
Every creature near and far
Praise the Lord
Stormy winds and clouds
Of white
Valleys clothed in splendor
Burning sun and moonlit night
Praise the Lord

(Chorus)
Heaven and all the universe
Proclaim Your power and
Your worth
Hallelujah
