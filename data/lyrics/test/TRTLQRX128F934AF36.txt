The poison is still in your veins
The poison I slipped in your drink
Cannot see me, I am but a ghost
Never saw your dangerous host

Wake up!
You're still alive, wake up and die

All you can see in the darkness above
is the white in my eye...
I'm standing on the edge of your grave
looking down into the eyes of the dead
Buried Alive... Buried Alive

Wake up!
You're still alive, wake up and die
...
