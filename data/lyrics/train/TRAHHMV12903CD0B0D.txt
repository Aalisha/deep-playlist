Intimacy's
Fresh from my dreams
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
A higher self esteem if you're on me?
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Spoiled crazy

Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in my direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA hey hey
(I want your PDA)
Your PDA, hey hey
(I want your PDA)
Your PDA hey hey
(I want your PDA)

Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
