Well I never lived through the great depression
somethimes I feel as though I did
I don't have answers for every single question
But that's OK 'cos I'm just a kid

Well I've seen pictures of my mother
When she looked exactly like me
And I've seen all my friends running for cover
Running from something they can't see

And it's not easy to get a handle on my life
