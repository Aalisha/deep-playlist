Shadows are finally freed to hover... the wintry landscape,
Apart from their mated-masters,
They seem serene has they dance childishly.
Has for my soul... it is floating over some greyish magenta,
Watching me losing conscience from a good distance...
Solaris is dimly shinning,
And is desperately trying to pierce the pale wall of mist, blurring his vision.
I cannot exactly describe this weariness in which I am drowning,
Yes... it is possibly the darkest day that I've ever experienced.
Yet misery don't seem so heavy anymore,
...
