Where did it go?
The one

One big dream we don't give up
Steel-eyed through the pressure drop
Thirst and hunger, workday rhymes
In disastrous times

Build up this family, we draw so close
Outside of the lines, we're still screaming
For the music
The meaning

Meaning what is right
Two thousand other souls burn bright

All in, this entertainment
Break out or be contained in it
Reaction, reaction
...
