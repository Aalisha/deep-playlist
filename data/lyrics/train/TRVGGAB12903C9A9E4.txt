Mama Mama can I climb all the trees in the park?
Mama Mama can I stay out 'til late in the dark?
Mama Mama don't over-protect me now
I just want to have some fun at night
But I can hear you say

No!
Because I'm not old enough
No!
Because I've been told enough
No!
Because I should listen to my pa

What's wrong with the kids from the wrong end of town?
They're my friends 'cause they always want me around
