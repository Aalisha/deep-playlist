Mule train (giddyup, pah, giddahh) *whip* (heah)...*whip*
Mule train (yeah-ha) *whip*

Clippity-cloppin' *whip* over hill and plain
Seems as how they never stop
Clippity-clop, clippity-clop
Clippity-clippity, clippity-clippity
Clippity-cloppin' along

Mule train (eeh, heahy-ah) *whip... whip*
Mule train (weuh) *whip... whip*

Clippity-cloppin' on the mountain chain
Soon they're gonna reach the top
...
