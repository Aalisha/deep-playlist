You saw it all on TV
You read it all in magazines
No doubt that you could go on

You found a way to be free
This is what freedom really means
You found a place where that you belong

So welcome to suburban home
Welcome to a life only in chrome
For those who can't afford the market price
This is your paradise

Waiting to be found
Safe from the, far from the city
