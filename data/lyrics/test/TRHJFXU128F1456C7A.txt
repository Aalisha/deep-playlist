Yo, yo, reverb
Boom-ba-doom, yo, feel that bassline cat
Yo, yo, reverb
Boom-ba-doom, yo, feel that bassline cat
Yo, yo, reverb
Boom-ba-doom, yo, feel that bassline cat
Reverb, boom-ba-doom, yo, feel that bassline cat
Reverb, boom-ba-doom, yo, feel that bassline cat
Reverb, boom-ba-doom, yo, feel that bassline cat

Yo, yo, reverb
Boom-ba-doom, yo, feel that bassline cat
Yo, yo that's some, that's some like, Stanley Kubrick
Stanley Kubrick

The track bouncy, no-body, get more rowdy
than Suffolk County, peace to Crackhead Crowley
Honky Thomas, Keb McGlocklin the whole crew
Cab Morada, what you gon' do we roll through
Fuck that, Big Dirt, the midget face drop 'em
Bring em to the Port Jeff house stayed on top 'em
Nobody move this, I don't give a fuck, we untouched
Strictly lust for papers and live life to bust nuts
We're God killers, let's be realistic;
we probably gon' be punished - we fuckin bitches by the 100's
Why me? Wanna fight me? Try me
Why these people don't know me - don't like me
Society, they wanna see me dead I stick out
You see me in the public, I probably pull my dick out
