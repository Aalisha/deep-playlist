Every move you made before was never meant for real
Over my naivety is this how I should feel?
Burning with my own desire, visions that all seem so clear
Now I see this in your eyes, they'll never ever be another one
Don't tell me lies
Don't tell me lies
Looking back I realize it's always been this way
