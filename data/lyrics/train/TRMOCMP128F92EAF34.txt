Im sweet like cinnamon when Im spittin this
lyrical venum,
giving rappers the blues like denim,
when Im killin em, fillin em with these syllable,
synonyms of adrenaline spillin off my spiritual
tongue,
then numbing em like penicillin,
plus Im trying to reach the lost like Gilligan,
God willin the spiritual healin, will stop the drug
dealing,
and killing, because Im feeling like Im ready to
loose my mind,
so many bullets be flying, and rydas be dying,
gotta make a difference, for instance, the inmates
in prisons make bad decisions,
for lack of wisdom, so I cut them open, and make
incisions,
fill em with spiritualism, tell em about the one
thats arisen,
how they can be free in they spirit, and have they
sins forgiven,
by the one who died on the cross,
'cause even when they were into all their drinking
and smoking,
he loved them even while they were lost,
so please listen to me, and stop dissin a G,
...
