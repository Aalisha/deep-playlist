Don't you know that the angels
In some wild and secret heart
Doubt for those who get the wrong things
Those who want to get caught

You don't have to doubt no more
You don't have to count on cryin'
No one can win a heart like yours
But damned if he ain't tryin'

Put on your diamond shoes
Put on your diamond shoes
The ones you talk about
That shine like brand new

The ones you've no place to wear
...
