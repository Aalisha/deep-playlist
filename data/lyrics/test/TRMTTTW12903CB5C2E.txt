Just a spoon full of sugar
Makes the medicine go down
Sweet Mary-Jane won't you lay me down
Lost my heart in California, lost my mind
Shot me down with a revolver, got me high
Then a heart of gold came on the stereo
Mr Young made me cry
Then all the colours of the rainbow
Fell in my eyes

I lost my mind long ago
Down that yellow brick road
