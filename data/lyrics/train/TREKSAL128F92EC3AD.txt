The way you looked at me tonight
I've never seen that look
In your eyes before
But then again
I don't think I've ever looked
Had the time to spare
The will to share with you

What have I missed
What have I done
I'm gonna turn back the tide
Like it's just begun
Time changes
Time changes
Time changes for the better

After all we've been thro'
Love don't come easy for me
...
