Well its OK to want, but its less OK to need
'Cause I started to get greedy,
that's the last thing I would need (great rhyme)
Getting comfortable with all my friends, finding no need to explore
and now I wanna get away from life ('cause I'm so fucking bored)
Did you ever get the feeling your trying put out the sun
With nothing but a pink and plastic broken water gun
Yeah, trying to extinguish all the angst that I don't need inside
I wanna get away from life and do something before I die.
Its so monotonous.
The daily grind:
I get up, go to school or work instead,
maybe hang out with my friends, then bed.
Time I spend has become frivolous
Writing songs that no one understands
but plenty will feel obliged to berate.
So one day I went nuts.
I don't remember exactly how it happened but now my mind doesn't like me
