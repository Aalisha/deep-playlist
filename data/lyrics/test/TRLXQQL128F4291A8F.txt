Disgraceful, the evil done by false prophets in God's name
Profit from intimidating poor, lost souls into the flock
Selling a grand facade, pompous posturing in vain
Reinforce spiritual weakness, insecurity

Forgotten essential, freedom of choice
All goodness is discarded, kindness affected
Right or wrong, coerce the congregation mob
To abide your tumid words, the only god they know

Selective agenda with no foundation in truth
Corruption, stumbling block, ruined credibility
Vulgar salesmen growing fat, lies you tell consume your sheep
