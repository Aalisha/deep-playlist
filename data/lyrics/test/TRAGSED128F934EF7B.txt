I submit my soul to rapture, in the kisses of the scarlet ones
Their Apocalips are gentle, till the morning when perfection comes
They are naked and relentless, as they carry me to devildom

In the Eyes of the Scarlet Ones

I submit myself to rapture, in the kisses of the scarlet ones
I am tasting their Apocalips, till the morning when completion comes
