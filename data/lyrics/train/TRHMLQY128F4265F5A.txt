I can see you in the distance
And you're heading for a fall
Sinking deeper by the minute
You're about to lose it all...

You better change
Before the sun goes down
You better leave
Before you are the last in town.
You better raise
Your fortresses or tear them down...
Tear them down.
Tear them down.

There's an angel on your shoulder
...
