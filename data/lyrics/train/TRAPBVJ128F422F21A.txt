Next year,
Things are gonna change
Gonna drink less beer
And start all over again

Gonna read more books
Gonna keep up with the news
Gonna learn how to cook
And spend less money on shoes

I'll pay my bills on time
File my mail away, everyday
Only drink the finest wine
And call my Gran every Sunday
...
