You hate to be ignored
Or maybe you're just bored
So I opened up my mail and there's a note from you
You say you're checkin' in
To see how I have been
Hey I'm doing so much better if you'd like to know the truth
You taught me well
You were my teacher and I thank you
For the hell you put me through I'm very grateful
