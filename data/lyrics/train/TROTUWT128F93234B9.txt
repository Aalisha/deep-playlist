Well our mums got talkin at the village store 
I was three you were four 
You looked lovely that's for sure 
Just somthin about you 

Together we went everywhere 
You scratched my face i pulled you hair 
You sent me tumblein down the stairs 
Just somthin about you 

Bridge 
You must have known that I want you (that I want you) 
You must ahve known that I want you don't you 

Chorus 
Somthings happenin 
It's written on the wall that you're sexy in Latin 
This time, come on 
Everthings changin n we can't hold on.
