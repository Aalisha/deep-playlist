Contagious, a breed of disease
Aiborne created to kill
Boiling intestines, flesh eating plague
The skin is covered in wounds
Parasite, an infectuous spice
Screaming from deep within
No more pain, no more whispering voices
Sanity a conquered illusion

Carrier of world destroyer

What once were will never be again
A breed to inflict mankind
Nervous system close to collapse
Respiratory arrest creating panic
