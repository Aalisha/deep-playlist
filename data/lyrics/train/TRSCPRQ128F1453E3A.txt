What is this? What is this, man?
This sounds like some graveyard shit
Well, that's what the fuck they gonna need
'Cuz I'ma bury these niggaz this time around

Who better than me? You better than me?
Shit you never will see, if you dead and deceased
Keep tools, lead and the piece
And I'm bustin' it off right

Leave a trail of smoke like a fuckin' exhaust pipe
Tilt the coke up out the stash 'cuz they know about the stash
Now, I'm like swallow these dope up in the bags
Coke up in the bags, yeah, sown up in the bags

I do my chicks like Ludacris, "Blow it out your ass"
I'm a mean pimp, you know what I mean, pimp?
Four hoes on each strip, all bringing me chips, futuristic
So when I'm gone they gonna have to do ballistics
Just to prove I'm this sick

You niggaz need to be spanked by your mommy
Forever thinkin' you'll be greater than I'll be
You get that short, late, waist-packed money
I get that all straight ASAP money, bring it here now

Touch the coke, touch the pot
Add the soda, what you got? Me, yeah
I am what I am, I be what I be
And that you will see, I am crack

Touch the coke, touch the pot
...
