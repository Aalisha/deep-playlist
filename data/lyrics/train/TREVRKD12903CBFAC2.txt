Featuring Prodigy]
Yeah A we gone do this up son
Yo we from Hempstead as close to the shacks as Parkside
Chorus:
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style and we be rippin shit
My whole team is out for the gusto
Internally blood drip through ya body slow
We on the go but yo time is still limited
Unlimited type style
A:
Welcome to the PSG I represent
The littlest in the crew but first one to get up in em
I straight up skin em like wolves
I wish you would have been
Fakin jack and get ya whole hood hit
But it's all good
We do the things y'all wish y'all could
And play the bat yo and watch the brothas bark like wood
So knock on it
Go head you want it
Nobody want it
You turned in for it pulled nine stingers like a brown hornet
While y'all was droppin I was underground shadowboxin
Layin low puttin final touches on the flow
So here we go, tryin to snatch that dough
Got niggaz breakin camp like Dre from Death Row
From the streets to the jail, I represent well
Touch a nigga like brail, jacks are hotter than the third rail
Scale to tip in my favor, the livest save
Grade up in the U.S. now lets get this paper
Chorus:
