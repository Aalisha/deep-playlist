Kiss of life!
Rub that line above the sand
I can see you closer
Closer than you´ll ever be
Rub that line above the sand
I know you think it´s over
Staring out into the sea

Don´t let go this could be so perfect.
Don´t let go if we hold onto it

Rub that line above the sand
Right before the tide comes
Washes you away from me

Oooooh kiss of life (2x)

Could you wave goodbye to sun?
