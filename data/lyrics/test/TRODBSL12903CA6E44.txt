(talking:)
Listen, tell y'all bout my side of town
Just like, your side of town
My side of town
Where haters jackers, and police ride around
Watch where you find yourself boy
Watch where you find yourself, my side of town
Where haters jackers, and police ride around listen
Yeah, watch where you find yourself
My side of town
Where haters jackers, and police ride around yeah
Watch where you find yourself boy, listen

(K-Rino:)
I'm on the cut, focused in on my mission
I spot laws from the corner, like perifferal vision
I stay humble, but if ever we rumble
You get swung on like baseballs, or trees in the jungle
We lie we still, smoke weed we rob we kill
Put diamonds in our grill, and pop X pills
Have sex for scrill, move weight for big faced bills
Fornicate daily, and sip drank and emcees chase deals
We pushing cocaine, with no containment
And it's a dead homie's mama, making funeral arrangements
We talk slow, but our game is faster
And it's a lady church member, getting smashed by the Pastor
It's a playa, bout to get caught slipping
And 18 year old girls, is prostitute and stripping
