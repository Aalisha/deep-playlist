Full of cobras, yolla, dosia stands / Soldiers roll as hoes come to hold your hand / What they told ya is bogus, motive scams / Payola for motorolas and coco plants / Ask the bitch why you attracted to a older man / If you play you better know your hand / They be po-po fans / Loco in the cabeza / Possessive, no questions / Hoe sexes for yo necklace / Self esteem low / Pimps get the green dough / Extreme show of gratitude for slapping you / I’ma rapper with actual facts for you / Look at that, that’s what crack will do, zappin fools / Make the most attractive boo turn transient / Lost in the ambience pantiless, scantily dressed / She like give me a kiss, a price for pimps with a pantry of flesh for your cash / But it can’t be a check

Niggas be so damn slow man, I told them man
No one’s gonna hold your hand
