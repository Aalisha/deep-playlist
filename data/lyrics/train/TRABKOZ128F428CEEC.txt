The spark ignites the powderkeg, the deadly die is cast
Plunged headlong into a war, a war that will surely be the last
Command to bring the hammer down, a fatal blow to fall
Warheads aimed and now deployed, spelling death to us all

Deathstrike command
Deathstrike command
Deathstrike command
Deathstrike command
