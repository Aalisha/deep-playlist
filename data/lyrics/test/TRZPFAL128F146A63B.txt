I said I'm not trippin'
'Cause u were out slipping
And now I'm out dipping
Don't knock on my door
I said I'm not trippin'
No I'm not complaining
'Cause you were out slipping
Just don't knock on my door

Wellim knocking at your door baby
Knowing that you feel bad
Because you caught me chaeting
You see I feel bad
But I'm coming over early in the morning
I'm gonna be on my kneewbegging
Apologizing to you baby
