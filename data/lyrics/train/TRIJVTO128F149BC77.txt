When you flash that badge
You want everyone to shiver
When you flash that badge
You want everyone to worship you
I got no time to worship human kind
I only worship the All Mighty
Through his prophets I have learned
To give respect to everything he created
I give love to those who gimme love
Love those who gimme war
I love those who hate me
