On the night that I was leaving,
the moon rose in the sky.
As I came, to fetch my suitcase,
and then you began to cry.
I've never seen you look so ugly as the way you did that night.
That night was eighteen months ago.
Now I'm two hours from the station.
Yeah I'm coming home again.
I'm gonna show this town who's master soon as I get off this train.
You're gonna love me more than ever,
and the sun will shine again.
And I will kiss your face,
...
