Let's go!
From the raggamuffins of Kingston, Jamaica
Paris, France, New York City soul takers
Tokyo clubs thousand dollars whores
Well, I am the volsung from sea to shore
All i know rock and roll,
One more show here I go
Yes, I can understand
Well I'm so bad
I'm one hell of a man ...

Well I don't need a lecture
I wont confess so i dont need a preacher
Hey girl, I just wanna undress ya
...
