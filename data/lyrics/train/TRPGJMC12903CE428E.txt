You venture out to walk the streets
That no one else would dare
A blackened night, a faster pace
Running 'cause you're scared
A beating heart, a shortened breath
Won't see another day
You've had a taste, your first, your last
Your life's blood drains away
Cry Out, they'll never hear your screams
A DEATH, beyond your wildest dreams
Cold fear, you'll never break away
It's time, you and your kind will pay
...
