Like Bob say, young Dread we’re more than numbers
While de across the street…human rights slayers

Ratant crow swamp dem feed
Life is calling out to the
They who call him so Jah seh
Knights of the moonlight war-in de

Oh, true Jah you better do the right
Martyr you better heed the right
Conscience you better know the right
Moses and they that crow…

Came in cloaked as they…with a pack of guns and why
I… don’t fraternize up riverside

Ratant Crow swamp them feed
Life is calling out to the
Even if they don’t want to know

But, but, but, but, but
But, but, but, but, but
But, but, but, but by day I see them
I see them passing by
