Welcome to hell!
 
 Sweating on the top line
 At the airline
 Check-in not check out
 Wish I could get the hell out
 This is no joke
 The thing could go up in smoke
 Or plummet to the ground
 As the G-force pulls us down
 
 Flight! Fright! Get uptight!
 Throw a seven in the clouds and
 Out go yer lights
 City to city! State to state!
 Roasting coast to coast
 In a megaton freight crate
 
 Hurtle down the runway
 Is it a one way trip to heaven
 Or hell on wheels?
 In a 747 I get a little freaky
