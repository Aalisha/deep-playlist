I can? t believe it? s happening again
This side goes so never ending
We? re always back at this space it seems
And it? s all because you? re unhappy with me

'Cause no matter what I do it? s never enough for you
I break my neck but you don? t see, I blame myself, I think it's me
No matter what, what I say, you never feel differently
You want me here, but you don? t like what you see
When you look at me, at me

We've grown apart, happened some time
I'm here, you're there, our souls no longer intertwined
And you hate the woman that I've become
But I'm strong, I've grown and won't be molded by anyone, no

'Cause no matter what I do it's never enough for you
