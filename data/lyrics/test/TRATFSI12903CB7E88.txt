You've got something that I never seen, 
So hot, 
One shot gotta give me everything, 
You got, 

Baby this is your moment, 
Now this is your time, 
To find out who you really are, 
Baby this is your moment, 
Here in this spotlight, 
Shine like a superstar.

I like the way you find this moving me, 
Here sex, 
So right I can't hardly wait to see, 
What's next.
