featuring La the Darkman Dom Pachino
Killah Sin Street Life


Yeah Ins yo La the Darkman
Hit them with the deathblow

Yo yo I'm known to spit poems
Throw dice and hold tomes
Show ice puff bones
Hit beats like Larry Holmes
Through the valley of kings
You catch the killer bee sting
Trying to pick up
You're fucking with the archbishop
Defy me is like starting rap world war 3
You'd rather sell your key to NYPD
My style is vicious
I rap in a lab and break tensions
My words wear jet black hoods looking suspicious


We are (Darkman) the trouble fire
Ultra harmonizer/ track paralyzer
? Are Tazeena? real/ blood spill
On the synthisizer
Bwa turn it up a peak
