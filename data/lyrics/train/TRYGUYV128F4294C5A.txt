(hey Michael come on a swing)
mmhhmm
(looks like you've got the world on a string)
I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh what a world, oh what a life
I'm in love
I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rainbow
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see
I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I've got that string
...
