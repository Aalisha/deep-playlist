No clock beside my bed, don't try to wake me
No phone upon my wall, who's going to call?
No knock upon my door, no news to shake me
Nights like the one before, I can't take no more

Beaujolais goes straight to my head
Beaujolais puts me to shame and I don't know
Why I'm in this place or how I came
Beaujolais and I go crazy, Beaujolais, I can't explain
But it helps me to forget the past and ease the pain

One race that I can't win with an alter ego
One chance to sink or swim, what am I to do?
