When we fall we will pick up the pieces
We know that we'll never be down for too long

When we fall down we must realize
It's a temporary state we must overcome

With no regrets, there's no defeat
These obstacles mean nothing to me
We won't give up, we won't give in
We'll keep on fighting until the end

Get up, stand tall
You gotta fight for it all
