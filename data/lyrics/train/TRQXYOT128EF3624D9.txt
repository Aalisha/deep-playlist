"Live from New York it's Saturday Nite!" (Scratched
4x)

[Uneek]
Ayo kid for years I've been into rap
Writing funky rhymes to get my name on the map
And by now I know I'm hitting
Cause I say a rhyme and girls be like, "Uh no he
didn't"
I'm so nonchalont, word to my uncle and my aunt
I serve MC's like a restaurant
It ain't where you're from it's where you're at
So in that case your butt better step like a frat
Cause juice I got a lot of vaoprs
While you gotta quit, I'm always rolling with Umdada, shit
When I deliver I make you shiver
If a guy try to front, I have to show him I'm the problem giver
Girlfriend you're gonna be in bad shape
If you expect Uneek to take you shopping like a demo tape
I'll tell your brother Jack to be Nimble
Cause if you want beef we can clash like a cymbal
You need to stop all the yelling and the cursing
I know it foul, he couldn't house a homeless person
We don't cuddle in the Eyceurokk huddle
While verse is subtle, and then we wet you like a puddle
One lyric from the gut, so what?
You want to strut like you're bad and then you might get had
Yeah it's cool, it's gonna be all right
Cause live from New York it's Saturday Nite

[Masta Ace]
It's the offbeat, on beat, man with the mostest
Like Hostess, I bake MC's and oh and you knows this
