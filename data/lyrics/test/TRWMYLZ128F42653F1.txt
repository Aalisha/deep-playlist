well the world's getting heavy and it sticks to my feet
well practiced in losing and brave in defeat
with no friends in this business you keep your enemies sweet
and keep one in the chamber for every stranger you meet

I'll take pieces of silver for a head full of rhyme
I'll take a headache and a casket for a life full of time
I'll take a patch of new mexico and I will call it mine
And I'll swear never to return to the scene of the crime

Well the mob's getting angry and the torches alight
...
