I love that look comes in your eyes when we're all alone
And it's much too late for friends to come calling
I disconnect the phone

And I put on the radio
And I take her and I talk real low
And I hold her tight, and soon I'm dancing in the night

Inside Sylvia, oh Sylvia
Yeah, yeah, Sylvia
I know my love is alive

Inside Sylvia
Yeah, Sylvia
Oh Sylvia, ah

Sometimes you get so crazy, I know it's all in your mind
And right in the middle of the night, I see just what you need
And they say that love is blind

And I hold you till the feelings come
But sometimes when the loving's done
I see a scared little girl, afraid of the woman
