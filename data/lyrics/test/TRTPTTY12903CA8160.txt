It's how we think and how we move
And see our bodies changed.
The vibrant youth and endless love can be arranged.
Masters of the air and sea drunk with the flashlights.
At the gates of hell on the red carpet we spend our nights.

We can't tell the difference,
We've lost our destiny.
We can't tell the difference
Between magic and technology.
