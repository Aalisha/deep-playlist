Rules without exceptions last eternally
Every move you make creates your destiny
I've come to soak my sorrow in halo black
As black as the seal on my soul

(Cause when the lights are down there's no more to say)
Love is the real pain
An internal revolution in our minds
(And when the lights are down you're so far away)
Tell me your real name
In the silence of the darkness we unite
