I loved you
You were all that I wanted
Then, I watched you
Turn into someone else

Well I'm sick of the fighting
I'm sick of just blaming myself

Well I'm sick of escaping
I'm sick of erasing

Your face and the places
That give me a trace to you

But I will never find you

I can't hold on
I'm feeling numb
From everything you do
And put me through
When I was part of you

I'm feeling numb
From holding on
...
