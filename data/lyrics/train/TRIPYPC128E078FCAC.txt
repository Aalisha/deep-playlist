Dear Mama
Good day
I hope that when these few lines reach you
They may find you in the best of health

I doun know how to tell ya dis
For I did mek a solemn promise
To tek care a lickle Jim
An try mi bes fi look out fi him

Mama, I really did try mi bes
But none a di less
Sorry fi tell ya seh, poor lickle Jim get arres
It was de miggle a di rush hour

Hevrybody jus a hustle and a bustle
To go home fi dem evenin' shower
Mi an Jim stan up waitin' pon a bus
Not causin' no fuss
