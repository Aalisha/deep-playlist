If I could be a Superhero,
I would be Awesome Man.
I'd fly around the world fighting crime
According to my Awesome Plan.
And if I saw criminals trying to lie
Hurting other people and making them cry
I'd haul them off to jail in my Awesome Van.
Because I would be Awesome Man.

(Now some criminals want you to be a criminal, and they offer you things like drugs and alcohol, but we know what to do kids, we just say no.)

If I could be a Superhero,
I would be Drug-Free Boy.
Telling the world of the evils of drugs,
and the lives that they destroy.
And all of the junkies getting so high
...
