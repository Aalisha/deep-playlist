A material girl
In her own world
Can't even see the things she's missing
Right in the curve
A little girl, wanting to grow up
And be a star
Take a look around
Stop looking down
All these things have blurred your vision
Material things don't go up to nothing

But I know how you feel
It's hard to see what's real
