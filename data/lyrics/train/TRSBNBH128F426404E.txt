-Joy-

Can't forget the day
That you walked into my Life
It was just the kind of thing
That was so right on time

After all the love changes
My heart had locked the door
Then that girl released her magic
And made me love once more

(ooohooohhoo)

Like the warm rays of the sun
Her sweet love can shine down on me

(ohhhhohhha)

All at once turned my life around
And with one kiss she set me free

(Chorus)

She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy

She's giving me Joy, Joy, Joy
That girl she brings me Joy

Goodbye Loneliness 
And so long to my heartache
Now that Joy has taken over
And decided to stay
...
