When it's crying
Take me to a certain place
Which I don't often find
I see a family walking
Always thinking of
Being somewhere else in time
So I fall face down
In a rut
I can't seem to get out of
Please wake me
Please give me some of it back
The feelings that I had

Sometimes I wish
I could be strong like you
It doesn't matter
Each time I wake
I'm somehow feeling the truth
I can't handle

Let's get this party started
I'm sick of begging you
You make me feel insane
Which I did to you

You make me feel insane
I want to be the one
