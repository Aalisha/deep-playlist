(Intro:)
Hey
Mmmm hmmm,
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me,
listen to me
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen...

I've been talking to this man
He's been saying what I like and
He makes me smile,
When I'm down, so down

He says sweet things in my ear
All the things that I needed to hear
But that's as far as it's gone
I promise, I promise
