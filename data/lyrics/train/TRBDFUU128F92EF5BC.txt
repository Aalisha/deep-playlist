Someday you'll have to face the fire.
Someday you'll have to face their law.
Someday you'll have to face your trial.
Someday you'll have to face the firing line.
THE FIRING LINE.
Wave your flag of your beliefs and wave it high, safe within the group in which you confide.
Wear your mask, let everone know just where you stand. Irony strikes when you help bring your demise.
Casualty of war no matter what you're fighting for. Sentence you to death unless you cowardly conform.
They will pick apart your everything, shoot you down for anything, tryin to gain anything, everything.
Face the firing line.
Blindfold, hands behind your back.
