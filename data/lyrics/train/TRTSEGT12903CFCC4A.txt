I'm in a constant freefall
When I'm following You
Can't see the next step's footing
But I know that You do
And life is all just a bunch of work
Nothing more than a climbing fall

Till I surrender, surrender, surrender
All these things to You
All my life to You, to You

I was a meteor burning
With a need for Your rescue
And it's the safest kind of falling
...
