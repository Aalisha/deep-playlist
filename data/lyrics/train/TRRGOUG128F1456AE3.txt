In the game of love
Its bitter and its sweet
And you wonder how something so beautiful
Can bring such agony
Let me tell you how it happened, to me

Just reminiscing on the way I used to dream
Prince Charming slay the dragon and come and rescue me
So many things have changed
But heartbreak feels the same
Well my strength is what I found
In the eye of a hurricane

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
So if the one I love
Never gave me love in return
Love's still alright with me
Still alright with me

Be still my heart
No one said there'll be days like this
Well I made it this far
I see where the end is gon' be
I said Chante, honey gotta keep pressing on
My peace I found in the eye of a hurricane

And if somebody said
It would never happen to me
After I realized, I still could be happy
...
