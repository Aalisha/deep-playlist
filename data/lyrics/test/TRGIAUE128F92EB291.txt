Closer x 4

Verse 1:
Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just dont know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like shes right there in my ear
Telling me
That she wants to own me
To control me
Come closer
Come closer

Chorus:
And I just cant pull myself away
Under a spell i can't break
I just cant stop
I just cant stop
I just cant stop
I just cant stop
And I just cant bring myself away
But I dont want to escape
I just cant stop
I just cant stop
I just cant stop
