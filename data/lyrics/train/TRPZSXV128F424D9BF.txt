You say I'm a cheat, you say I'm a drag
You say I'm a breast, waiting to sag
You say I'm a pig, you say I'm a dog
You say I'm a bore, you're lost in the fog

But it's
Too late to cry
Yes it's
Too late to lie
Yes it's
Too late to try
'Cause I've heard it all before

You feel like a saint, you feel a slave
You feel like a ghost, digging your grave
You feel like a cut, you feel a bruise
You feel like a case, without any clues
