I wanna be there when you call
I wanna catch you when you fall
I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be the one you breathe

Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll fade away, oh
Today's the day we'll find our way grown
Today's the day we'll fade away

I wanna be there when you cry
And when you're down, I'll help you fly
...
