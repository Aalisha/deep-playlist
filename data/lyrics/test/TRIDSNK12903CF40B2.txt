Wake up in a sweat
Blood in my mouth
Fainted by the torture, had no time to shout
A gathering of freaks, and evil plot, a feast
Trapped in the furnace, sacrificial to the beast

Temperature's increased, searing my skin
I start to realize I'm the last of my kin
Acrid devastation in the furnace of fate
Bubbles on my body, I know it's far too late
Hair is removed by the embers hiss
Retarded people laugh, worthless life in a bliss
...
