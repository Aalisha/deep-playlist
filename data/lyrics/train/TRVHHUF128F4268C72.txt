Will it take some time
To release this inner apathy?
Enabled inside
And it looks like you're the enemy

Things are never what they seem
Can't explain the reasons why
The illusions that we see
The many faces of our lives

When you find it hard to breathe
Never keep it all inside
Which one should I be
The many faces of our lives?

Irrelevant minds
You become a little more serious
...
