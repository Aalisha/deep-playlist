Clip of dialogue from the film American Beauty
(Jane, he's a freak)
(Well then so am I)
(And we'll always be freaks and we'll never be like other people)
(And you'll never be a freak 'cause you're just ... too perfect)

Late nights and bloodshot eyes
Clock ticking half past five
We're barely breathing but we're still alive
Go!

Our plans are all laid out
Take all these unmarked roads
We blaze the trails to places no one goes, yeah!

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
...
