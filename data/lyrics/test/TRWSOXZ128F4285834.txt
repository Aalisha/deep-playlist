THE ALIEN INSIDE

Listen!
I am right here
I am the prince of your fears

I know
just how you feel
I can control all your tears

just leave my brain!
Please! Just leave my brain!
Please! Just leave my brain!
Please go away!
Please! Just go away now!
Please! Just go away now!
Oh Please!

Relax
don't be afraid
everything stays the same

my friend
prepare yourself
it's time to meet once again

just leave my brain!
Please! Just leave my brain!
Please! Just leave my brain!
Please go away!
Please! Just go away now!
Please! Just go away now!
Oh Please!

The alien inside takes control of our brain
living in our mind is going to rule once again
we can't stop this pain!

Relax!
We can be friends
