I've told myself time and time again
that I'm not in love with you
And then
it came to me
one night in a dream
you mean more to me than I wanted to see
there is nothing I can do
to stop it
even though you're with somebody else

if I didn't really care, why were you there?
the color of you eyes, the scent of your hair
i know dreams aren't reality
but you're so real
so real to me

(chorus)
it took a dream to tell me that I love you lady
I couldn't see that you were always there for me
Remembering the time we shared together
came clear to me one night in love

I tossed and turned and broke a sweat
woke up with tears my pillow's wet
