(In complete contrast, a pop song, and a pop singer. In a different way, this has its own magic. The magic of an accompaniment, tailor-made in the fashion of today. For this occasion, this singer, and this song)

You have been placed in a queue
But your call is valuable
It's very valuable
We hope this doesn't inconvenience you
Because you're valuable
You're so very valuable!

If you wish to make a complaint
We can handle it, we're well prepared to handle it
Of course you may have to wait
But that's understandable
Isn't that understandable?

Don't ask me, I just work here man
Don't ask me, I just work here man

(It sounds to me like you need help!)
We're very good to you
I hope you know we're good to you
