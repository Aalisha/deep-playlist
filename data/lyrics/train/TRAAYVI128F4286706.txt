Outside the cats are scratching
Inside the doors are latching
On the room, the greedy gloom
The trial is revealed
Police are six feet deep
With switchblades in their teeth
So no one leaves and they all believe
This is absolutely real
Yes, it's real
And the sergeant says, "are you ready, boys? 
Get ready, boys
Aim...
And fire...
