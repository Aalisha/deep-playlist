Can't believe that the heart of my world
Got me on my knees
Prayin' my eyes are lyin' to me
I built a whole new life around you

In an instant we were through
As our future disappears
Fallin' like tears
Are the dreams of a love we thought we shared

It's not fair, I was true to you
I finally settle down
Then you don't turn around
And betray the trust I had in you

It's not fair, after all I treated you
Respectable, with care
Said that you'd be there
Now, who am I to turn to

And I trusted you
And this is what I get in return
You was like a brother to me
But now I is see you was just waitin' your turn
...
