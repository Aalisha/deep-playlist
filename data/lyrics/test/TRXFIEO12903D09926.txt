General, I salute you
I'll put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you
It ain't nothing 'cause loyalty is what I'm used to
And what I won't do, I'll have one of my troops do
Nigga we'll kill you

I'm ready for combat, a solider on the frontline
Take me to the streets, nigga mothafuck a punchline
It only take one time, for you to send a death threat
And watch these bullets have that ass singing like Keith Sweat
You ain't met me yet
I been camoflauged in the bushes
And I'm co-signing Fifty, 'cause them niggas all pussies
Bustin' shots at ya convoy
You don't want war
No surrender, no retreat, this is Vietnam boy
Check my war wounds, I done took a couple for the team
Only niggas that been on the battlefield know what I mean
Take cover we coming, pulling pins outta grenades
You won't make it to the general, without getting sprayed
Might as well say "Hello" to my brand new little friend
Only time he come out, to put holes in grown men
