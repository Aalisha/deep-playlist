You may think I'm selfish
Sorry but I can't help it
Gotta do this for me
Please don't beg and plead
(Repeat 2X)

You don't understand it
Just can't comprehend how I can just get up and leave
You think it's gonna get better
Nothing lasts forever
Open up your eyes and see

That I'm just somewhere else
Don't need nobody to validate me, I'm good
I wanna do just what I want
Whatever that may be
I'm solely focused on me

(Chorus)
You see, what I'm going through
Might seem selfish to you
But I've never tried it and I think that I'll like it
You see want I'm going through
