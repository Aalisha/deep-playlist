Hey, hey, you, you
You got the skin of the tiger
I said, "Hey, hey, you, you
You got the head of the lion"

You beg, steal a soul or leg
Of a hopeless child
You prey, feed, grow strong again
Repeat the cycle

You're monsters
Monsters of man
You are the monsters
Monsters of man

Training young monsters
To beat good men
You are the monsters
