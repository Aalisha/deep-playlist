Do you forgive me?
You never lost your sight
So scream your heart out
To reject one more time

This tragic, need for hope
Won't give up
It's what, keeps us alive
Now who will survive
In this game of chess
Now hold out your hand
And give me
This final kiss

If I load this gun, would you hold in your heart and give your life for love?

So bleed (so bleed)
This hate (this hate)
With me
And fight these broken dreams

If I load this gun, would you give your life for love?
