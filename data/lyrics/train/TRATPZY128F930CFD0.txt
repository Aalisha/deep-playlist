Lift, McCahir Og, your face
Still brooding over the old disgrace?
That Black Fitzwilliam stormed your place
Drove you to the Fern

Gray said victory was sure
And soon the Firebrand he'd secure
Until he met at Glenmalure
With Fiach MacHugh O'Byrne

Curse and swear, Lord Kildare
Fiach will do, what Fiach will dare
Now Fitzwilliam have a care
Fallen is your star low

Up with halberd, out with sword
On we'll go for by the lord
Fiach MacHugh has given the word
Follow me up to Carlow
