You said hold on
But I feel like I'm slipping away
You said hold on
But it feels like I'm slipping away

I won't let you down
The words you said to me
It's echoing the sound
Of what would never be

I'm standing here alone
The memories remain
The same familiar home
But nothing looks the same
And I'm standing here alone
...
