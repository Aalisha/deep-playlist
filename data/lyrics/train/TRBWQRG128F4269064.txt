I'd walk across Kansas in a New York minute climb the Colorado mountains in the fall
Crawl through Arizona like a flatland lizard if I thought it'd do me any good at all
I could swim Lake Erie with my hands tied behind me
Eat a West Virginia coal miner's shoes
Drink the Mississippi River if it took a mouth of Sundays just to prove my love for you
I remember well the first time that I kissed you
