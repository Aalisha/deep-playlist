Hey, hang your red gloves up
'Cause there's nothing left to prove now
Hey, hang your red gloves up baby
No-one cares but you

What planet are you from?
Accuse me of things that I never done
Listen to you carrying on
Cheating another love song

If I were in your shoes
I'd whisper before I shout
Can't you stop playing that record again
Find somebody else to talk about
If I were in your shoes
I'd worry of the effects
You've had your say but now its my turn
Sweet dreams my LA ex
