I see myself in my fathers eyes
I see my strengths and my weaknesses
There's children safe in their mother's arms
But photos can be misleading
Right on the branches of my family trees
That's where the young ones are dwindling - with lies

So will we learn? Talk together into the night
Can we help this home to survive?
We need the strength of our family's arms
Not a false sense of solidarity

Walk together and we could work this out
Talk together and we could understand
We need the strength of our family's arms
I wish I knew where to go from here
