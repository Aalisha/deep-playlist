Stormbirds drfiting on a pool at rest
then come waves they just can't crest
Once their in the air it's a search for the kill,
thinking "if i don't do it someone else will",
till the war mandates fulfilled.

Woah can you see
can you see them flying
They look to be the same breed
but they can't stop fighting
Flying in the night under enemy sights,
Looking for targets in a blind firefight-
What's at the end of the road?
-for blackbirds vs. crows
