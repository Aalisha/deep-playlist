Eat Drink and be miserable
While it's a miracle that we're still here at all
As we sink another belly-full
Another cherryfalls bouncin' off the wall
If we live in the dead of night
Then it's a constant fight to be a social lad (?)
Back tides through darkened rooms
With a look of gloom we'll never leave too soon
We're so scared of finding out
What scares us and we're growing up
And knowing what it means
To be bursting at the seams
Souled up and fueled up to our ears
To leave our fears behind
We all know that that just cannot last
