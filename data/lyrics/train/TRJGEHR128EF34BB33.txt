Taken up out of the world
Shaken up with just a word
Turned around so suddenly
I'm alive eternally

Something invisible
Has become so beautiful
I know I am born again
Laughing and stumbling

Draw me after You
Let me run with You
Show me all Your
Kingdom come, yeah

My heart is where my treasure lies
My great reward is in Your eyes
My every breath belongs to You
You are my treasure, yes, You are Lord
