Jayston
Back...
Further back...

Sarah
Janine, just 19
Joined a pyramid scheme
Didn't think it mean
To inflate her estate
Left it too late
Broke her dreams
Broke her friends, who said
"Courtesy is dead"

And now a piece of Vambra
Is looking like Turana
She's banking on the fee
She'll get from ITV

Rethink, refrain
Don't pull a Jill, Jane
Amateur
Amateur
Amateur
