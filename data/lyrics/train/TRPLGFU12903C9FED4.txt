Annihilation or just killing by design
A new world order the conception of a nightmare
Contamination of the un-polluted mind
The inner sanctum of human race is laid bare
Abandoning morality to feed on what remains
Purging of the weakest in the name of the insane
Administration of the brutal and sublime
Another chapter in this trilogy of warfare

Kill in peace
Kill in war
Kill in peace
Kill in awe

I die, you die
They die, we die
Rich die, poor die
Every fucker gonna die
Love die, hate die
Peace die, war die
Life die, death die
All die
Who am I
What am I
I am the king of death
