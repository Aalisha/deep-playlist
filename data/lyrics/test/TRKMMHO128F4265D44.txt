I ran the way, I walked a fine line
Wasted time or need to find
You will call and I'll take mine
And to remind me I am fine

What you are is what you see and
You see me and we can be
Something we can call we
We are we are

Doing the what we can
Working without a plan
I'm beginning to understand
It's getting out of hand

I have seen these closing doors, I've woke up on this floor before
Picked it apart for hours and hours and hours and hours
Of turning tossing and looking and listening to you
And all the fucked up things you do
...
