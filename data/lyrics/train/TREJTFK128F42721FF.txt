Color me your color, baby
Color me your car
Color me your color, darling
I know who you are
Come up off your color chart
I know where you're coming from
Call me on the line
Call me, call me any anytime
Call me, my love, you can call me any day or night
Call me!
Cover me with kisses, baby
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
...
