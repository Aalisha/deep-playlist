22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city that sounds nice, it's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city it's alright
22 grand job, in the city that sounds nice, it's alright, it's alright
In the city it's alright

Girl from work, looks alright
But the lights are too bright
Bloke in sales likes her too
What am I supposed to do?
