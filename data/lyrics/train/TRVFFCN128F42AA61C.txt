Long is the day, take it away
Hold it up and you don't let it fall
'Cause devil's play was yesterday
And I don't care about that at all

I just smile, once in a while
'Cause I don't want the lines on my face
And I sit right here, holdin' the years
And I count all the stars in space

You fall apart again
And you can find a friend
Don't turn to someone else
'Cause they won't understand

Self respect, goes unexpressed
...
