Visiting hours are long over.
The gates are closed right here.
It's invitation only from now on.
We'll never get it swear.
Can't afford to pay our admission.
Not good enough to come near.
We built you fortune.
Built your fame.
We'll guard your status for another day.

All this shit is making us ill.
All this shit is making us ill.
Another dream not ours fulfill.
Let's storm the gates of Beverly Hills.

All this shit is making us ill.
All this shit is making us ill.
Another dream not ours fulfill.
Let's storm the gates of Beverly Hills.
