She calls out to the man on the street
"Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?"

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
He starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh, think twice, 'cause it's another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been cryin'
