Let it come down let it all come down
Get up get up get up, I know you got something to say
Only you don't get to talk, not to me that way

Let it come down let it all come down
Come on come on come on
Is anybody feeling the same
I will still be standing here, when you walk away

I don't know anymore
What I need and what for
All I know, is there must be something more
