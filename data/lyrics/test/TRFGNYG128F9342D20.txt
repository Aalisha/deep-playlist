Take me somewhere I've never been before
Open my eyes just a little, leave me wanting more
When they tell you it's all for the money, all for the money
Raise your voice so you can tell somebody, tell somebody

When all you hold in your heart slips away, you have to choose
Fall behind, make a change, or change your mind

Go on, get up, get out
Don't even think about it
