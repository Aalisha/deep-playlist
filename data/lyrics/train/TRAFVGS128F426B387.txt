The monumental sleep
With the sunrise at my feet
Where's the altar of the gods,
The wrath and the floods?

All is in vain

Of stars and of smoke I am
Of shade and of light
With dragons in every hand
I'm fading through life

From nothing I came before,
To nothing I go
I heard that wise man said:
"From presence to silence... we flow"

Of stars and smoke
...
