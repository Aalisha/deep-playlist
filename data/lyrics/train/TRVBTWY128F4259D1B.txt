You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
Darling you feel like I feel
And I don't have to know if it's real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
