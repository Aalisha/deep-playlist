i walk on the water, oh she's so funny 
her taste on my lips, like milk and honey 
i see crystal lights, i want to stay forever 

i want to stay, i dive in love's sweet gin (?) 
now and today, i throw away my pain, 
i want to stay, i'm gonna live today, forever... 

the Return To Paradise, 
it's all so nice 
beautiful 
i will dive into the light 
i'm glad to be in love 

the Return To Paradise, 
it's all so nice 
beautiful 
i will dive into the light 
...
