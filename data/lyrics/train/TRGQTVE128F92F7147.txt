You're never with me
You're never near me
What time is it?
What time?
Whose time is this?
Give yourself a chance to breathe
I'll give you the room you need

You're never here
You're never near here
What day is this?
What day?
Whose day is this?
Put me in your supermarket list
I'm here, I'm real, it's true, I do exist

Today you may feel a little sleepy
Maybe the morning is too soon
