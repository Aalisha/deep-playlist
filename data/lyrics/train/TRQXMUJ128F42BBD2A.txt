Sunny
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here

My sunny one shines so sincere

Sunny one so true, I love you
Sunny, thank you for the sunshine, okay
Sunny, thank you for the love you brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
