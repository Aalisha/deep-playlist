I believe everything you say
'Cause you're not frightened
The way that I've been so
So I follow you
Just in case you lose your way
So glad you let me stay around

The chainlinked fence you climbed
To make forbidden lakes our own
Yours and mine
And with ease of the seagulls
We cut the engines and we cruise high
In the summer sky, baby

Now I could speak to everything
But there's no room for my voice
When sweet feedback is
Jumping through the hoop of you ear
Ring there goes the phone
And then you're off again
...
