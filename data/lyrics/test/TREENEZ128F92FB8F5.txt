Where's that girl with the red dress on? Some folks calls her Dinah;
Stole my heart away from me, way down in Louisana.

Take Me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry;
Take me back to Tulsa, I'm too young to marry.

Little bee sucks the blossom, big bee gets the honey,
Dark man picks the cotton, White man gets the money.
Oh, walk and talk suzy, walk and talk suzy.
Walk and talk suzy, walk and talk suzy.
