This one will never sell
They'll never understand
I don't even sing it well
I try but I just can't
But I sing it every night
And I fight to keep it in
Cause this one's for you
This one's for you

I've done a hundred songs from fantasies to lies
But this one's so real for me that I'm the one who cries
And I sing it every night
And I fight to hide the tears
