The air stings my eyes, the water burns my skin
I've seen the reactions through my actions
But I don't try to change a thing at all
We're taught to close our eyes and conditioned
To believe their lies as we watch them
Rape the land and skies to build the
Things that own our lives

(We'll never stop)
We're driven by greed
(We'll never stop)
We take more than we need
(We'll never stop)
The society
And they'll never stop the politicians with their
Lies the corporations won't compromise, but still
We refuse to change our lives and we all fall down

(All fall down)
We all fall down
(All fall down)
...
