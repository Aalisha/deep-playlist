Can you feel that?
You better hold on
This one's about to get bumpy
Hahahahahahaha...

She's a ten, hellbent, I'm in heaven tonight
Six speed sex scene playin' out in my mind
One look, I'm hooked, motor runnin'
Rev'd up, my heart startin' pumpin'
Are you ready for the best damn ride of your life?

Gimme a "hell"
Gimme a "yeah"
Stand up right now
And gimme a "hell"
Gimme a "yeah"
Stand up right now
Get ready to go
She ain't movin' slow
She's takin' control
Pushin' the pedal to the floor
I'm beggin' for more
You better hold on tight

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
