1. i don't belong
I got a feeling
It's in my head
I got a feeling
Do you hear what i said?

I got a feeling there's something wrong
I got a feeling that i...
I don't belong here
I know it's true
I don't belong here
And neither do you

I got a feeling
It's in my brain
I got a feeling
I've got nothing to gain

2. cracks in the wall
I opened up my head to you
I listened to the plan you drew
Tell me what i should be
And tell me what i should see

There's cracks in the wall
Watch them fall

I dig it when i walk down the street
I check out all the people i meet
They know i know there's something wrong
Their petty lives, they'll soon be gone
I know this

There's cracks in the wall
Watch them fall
Down

3. tear it up
Mundane people, they're all around
They keep our music underground
But we're gonna break, break the chains
And watch their lives go down the drain

Tear it up tear it up
We need the change we need the change

I look around, there's no place to play
They all tell us to screw away
Streets of boston need a change
And streets of boston call my name
...
