You know everybody, no matter who they are
And no matter how different they might be
Always runs across the same problem at least once
And that's the problem of love
And maybe just once in your life
You're gonna fall in love with somebody so bad
And it's gonna be somebody that don't need you at all
Somebody that's got everything in the world there is to have
And, and you got nothin'
I, I who have nothing, I, I who have no one
Adore you and love you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you, but love
I love you
