They claim we're products from the bottom of hell
'cause the black is back and it's bound to sell
Picture us coolin' out on the fourth of July
And if you heard we were celebrating that's a world-wide lie

Yo Chuck, the fat generals man
Trying to pull a 226 on you g'
Yo man, show 'em what you got

This style seems wild
Wait before you treat me like a stepchild
Let me tell you why they got me on file
'Cause I give you what you lack
Come right and exact
Our status is the saddest
So I care where you at, black
And at home I got a call from Tony Rome
The FBI was tappin' my telephone
I never live alone
I never walk alone
My posse's always ready, and they're waitin' in my zone
Although I live the life that of a resident
But I be knowin' the scheme that of the president
Tappin' my phone whose crews abused
I stand accused of doing harm
'Cause I'm louder than a bomb
C'mon C'mon louder etc...

I am the rock hard trooper
To the bone, the bone, the bone
...
