I just can't control
How I feel about you
And I'm so surprised
With the way I act
When you're around
I know they never see
All the things that I see
They don't understand
Just what it is
That we have found

Well I don't care what they say
I've made up my mind anyway
'Cos you've got the love that I need
And I wouldn't change it for anything
