Yo, sometime you have to just be a man
And apologize to your woman, ya star
The amount of ting whe you put her through
Rock this

When a girl cry 'cause of you
Not one ting you can say or do
Make any man go change his mind
No matter what you wanna do

First you find it hard to speak
Girl straight out make a brother weak
Killin' me softly every time
And all that I can be

On the street just ballin'
Girls have been callin'
Drop top fallin'
Brothers keep rollin'
Livin' nothing but a street life, street life

On the street just ballin'
Girls have been callin'
Drop top fallin'
Brothers keep rollin'
Livin' nothing but a street life, street life

For all the troubles I brought ya
For all the time that you cried
Baby, for that I apologize, apologize

For all the time that I've hurt ya
For bringing tears to your eyes
Baby, for that I apologize, apologize
...
