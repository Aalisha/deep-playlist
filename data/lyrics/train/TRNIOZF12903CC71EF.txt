I don't sing fucking love songs because there's nothing in this world for me to love.
I want the world to have my rape baby so when it's born I can strangle it to death.
This is not a healthy relationship.
When the bomb drops you will spend the last few minutes of your life shitting your pants.
Remember how I always told you "I hold your life in my hands"?
You stare and pray as you watch them fall.
