This prison has no walls
This bondage has no chains
My memories have no mercy
There's no one left to blame

Wish I could force back the hands of time
And right every wrong
Grant me just this one last chance
Before it's gone, gone, gone, gone

How could I be so blind as to doubt Your love?
How can I go on living without Your love?

Seventy times seven
Will You forgive me for all that I've done?
Seventy times seven
I'm so afraid of what I've become

For all the promises laid to waste
For all the seeds unsown
For all the justice I never faced
I must now atone
...
