Everything must change
But not for me
I still believe in my song
I'm gonna do my thing

I'll never change my swing
In my younger days, if I was here
The music real and I sing
What I was born to do
To make it last for you

Check out my joint, it's kinda hot but it's goin' strong
I'll never sacrifice my groove, I'll never change my song
And by the way I'm doing this song 'bout you're staring
What does the music have to do with what I'm wearing

You wanna see my grooves, I'm sorry that is not for me
Why must you take your mind somewhere it doesn't have to be
Let your focus be the fat sound you're hearin'
Lyrics, you will see, now, what I'm feelin'

True to me from my soul
Can you get with it
I did it all legit, yeah

Crazy grooves, moving flows
Can you get with it
I did it all legit, yeah

Oh, as the music plays
I wanna sway, side to side, feelin' good
Never thinkin' of the right or wrong ways
