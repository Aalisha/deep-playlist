One word in the cold
Can bid you a part of their closet
We call it the unseen room
Discovered with a breath

I can say we are not alone
They imitate our noises
Of cracking deals and screaming floors
To keep us innocent

They' re knocking at my door
My faith keeps them outside
But non stop are these noises
Of the silence in my head

I've waited for this moment
The hurting season before the tears
So bittersweet is burning
Before it disappears
