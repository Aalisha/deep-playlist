Well, I'm coming face to face with my conscience
Coming to an understanding of myself
Clear out all the old cobwebs
Clear out all the old books from the shelf

This song is inspired by a good man and his tune
Thinking good of others sing 'Amazing Grace' to you
It doesn't really matter if you're all jumbled up inside
As long as you know that love is endless and the world is wide
As long as you know

Give it up
Share it out
Help, help who you can
Talk about it

It's late in the morning, close to the time
And Mary's in the alley she never stops smiling
...
