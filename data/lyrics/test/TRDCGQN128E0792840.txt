I slipped away further from you
trying to find what is real
You're somebody else that I never knew
and someone that I can't feel

I shut it away I keep it in me
Is this what it takes to keep me alive?
So you take me and you break me
and you see I'm falling apart
Complicate me and forsake me
you push me out so far there's no other feeling
