Yo yo
Yo yo
Yo yo

She's a fast love professional
Crafty, bold and beautiful
Staged right, locked eyes
I swear it's magical

Her name is Melanie
Says she digs my melodies
Likes how I move
Thinks I'm cool
That's what she says to me

Big stage, bright lights, short love long nights
Frequent flights through the skies to see stars

I come back to town
She's hangin' around
It still feels so real but it can't go too far

Her favorite colours be platinum and gold
She only loves in stereo, she only loves in stereo
I should know 'cause I've seen it before
I think I gotta let her go
She only loves her stereo

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
