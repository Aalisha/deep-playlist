Stagnation, motionless air
A shroud cast over understanding
Gasping to inhale the manna of life
But still you decay
So wake up and strengthen what you have
Before it dies completely
I am the first, I am the last
I am the living one
fury of a God encaged in
Human self doubt
Power to create burns within all
All Jah children
I am the first until this day unseen
...
