Clouds on the moon,
It was a hollywood sky,
I sat on the wall, 'til your parents drove by,
And i walked to you door,
And remember how you smiled,
Well that was a long time ago.

Your fault or mine,
It's such a tough one to call,
Do you one day look up to see your innocence fall,
From a twelve storey window, to the concrete below,
It was all such a long time ago.
