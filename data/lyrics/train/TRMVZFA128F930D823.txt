We wait, viper eyed shepherds
To bleed flocks in devotion
The altars, inverted wells of lifeblood
Kings and queens
Incarnated gods for you to adore
Pervading your wombs, breeding puppeteers
Weaving masks worn at war
Seeded in onslaught rehearsed
Spectatorly, channel the pain
Of a fenced game watched and culled
Venison flocking towards us, godlike decoys
Sowed fear in theirs souls, faking solicitude
