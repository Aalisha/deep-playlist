A lot of cats are hatin', slandering makin' bad statements
Mad cause they sit on their ass just stagnating
Always vacillatin', now classmates I graduated with
Are wonderin' how the stupidest kid up in the class made it
Sick landscapin' and jammin' down in my mans basement
Getting restraints and complaints from mad neighbors
Now prejudice bigots say I sound just like them damn #@#
Them pair of lenses ain't repairin' their impaired vision
I'm on a mission escaping my own prison
Inflicting more pain then you're givin' see I'm my own victim
I can't believe I let you take up my time
Take up space in mind, give it here, I'm takin' what's mine

(Chrous)
The only ounce of power that I have
