I drive in the rain
With the window open
But it's not the same
When everything has changed
But while your still near
I'll try anything
And I'll say all the things that you said you wanted to hear

But the words inside my head
Are better left unsaid
To lie like the ghosts beneath my bed, oh yeah
Don't you know that I go crazy
But I've nothing left to give
Though I'll miss you for a while
Don't you know that I go crazy
...
