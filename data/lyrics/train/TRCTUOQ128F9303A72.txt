My simple heart, my simple heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My simple heart will always love you

I heard your reason, why you're leavin'
Can't we talk it through
Yeah, I know I hurt ya, you hurt me too
It's crazy what people can do to each other

When emotions start fillin' up inside your head
It gets so complicated, and he's so frustrated
You forget to say the things that ought to be said

My simple heart, my simple heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My simple heart will always love you
My simple heart, my simple heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
