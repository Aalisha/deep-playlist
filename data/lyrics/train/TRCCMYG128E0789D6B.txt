Oh baby baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know, because
My loneliness is killin' me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, hit me baby one more time

Oh baby baby, the reason I breathe is you
Girl you've got me blinded
