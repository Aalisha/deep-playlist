I'M IN A SENSITIVE MOOD TONIGHT
I WANT TO KISS YOU AND HOLD YOU TIGHT
I WANT YOU TO FEEL ME DEEP IN YOUR LOVE
TELL ME THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH

Baby if you will
Let me hold you oh so close
By the fireplace
With candlelights and champagne
Let me hold your hand
Kiss your neck as we slow dance
'Cause the night belongs to romance
When you look into my eyes
And see the tears I cry it's 'cause of you
The one I've always loved
...
