When I was young
I never knew
what this thing called love
could do to you
but since you been gone
and I've been on my own
I've been feeling quite peculiar
but I'll get by without your smile
I'll get through without you

But I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
I wish it was me you chose
cause Elvis ain't dead
and you're coming back
and Elvis ain't dead
and you're coming back
Oh

Since you been gone
I can do what I like
but it doesn't mean a lot to me
I'm all shook up
and I'm lonesome tonight
I think I need a love lobotomy
