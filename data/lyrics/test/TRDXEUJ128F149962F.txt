The chase is better than the catch
transforming the tunes
we need your support
if you got the breath back
it's the first page of the second chapter
Hold your back for the rhythym attack
coming down on the floor like a maniac
hold your back for the rhythym attack
get down in full effect
hold your back for the rhythym attack
coming down on the floor like a maniac
hold your track so clean up the dish
by the way
how much is the fish?
How much is the fish?
Here we go
here we go
here we go again
Yeah!
Sunshine in the air
