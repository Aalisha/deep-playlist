Bodies, please don't cry
bodies, don't die
bodies, please don't cry
bodies
I been taking all the silver
i been saving all the gold
i'm gonna stuff it down the throat
of a week old corpse
save that doggone soul
I been saving up my pain
i'm gonna give it back in spades
i been strangling the cries
from the murder of love
save your soul tonight
Bodies, please don't cry
bodies, don't die
bodies, please don't cry
