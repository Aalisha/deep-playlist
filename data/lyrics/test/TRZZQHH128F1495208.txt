If He don't do another thing
Said He's already done enough
If He don't do another thing
Said He's already done enough

Well, put food on my table
And clothes on my back
Said He's already done enough
If He don't do nothing else
I know that He's able
'Cause He's already done enough

Now I read in my Bible that 2, 000 years ago
He laid down His life just to save my soul
Now what more can I ask of Him
And what more can He do?
I'm already happy 'cause He already can do

Didn't he do?
(Already)
Didn't He do it for you
(Already)

He saved you
(Already)
He changed you
(Already)

Did you
(Already)
Heal your body
(Already)

Already
(Already)
Already
