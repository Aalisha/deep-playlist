Walk out into velvet
Nothing more to say
You're my favourite moment
You're my Saturday

Cos you're my Number 1
I'm like a dog to get you
I want it up and on
I'm like a dog to get you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Sunset only seconds
Just ripe then it's gone
Got no new intentions
Just right then it's gone
