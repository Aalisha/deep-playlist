Wide awake
I'm on a plane out of town
Fly away
From the weight of the world
On the ground

I'm international
But I don't know where to go
Hopefully where summer days
Can melt these winter bones
I'm international
And you're orbiting my brain
I'm reduced to writing nothing
All over napkins on the plane

Wide awake
I'm on a plane out of town
Taking pictures of myself
In the mirror on wall
Trying hard not to make my space
The loneliest place of all

Early warning all across the sky
Clouds are rolling in on your light
Any change from here would be
The wisest change of all
Any place from here up here
Would be the finest place to fall
...
