She's blood, flesh and bone
No tucks or silicone
She's touch, smell, sight, taste and sound
But somehow I can't believe that anything should happen
I know where I belong and nothing's gonna happen yeah

'Cause she's so high
High above me
She's so lovely
She's so high
Like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite hu hu hu hu
She's so high
High above me

First class and fancy free
