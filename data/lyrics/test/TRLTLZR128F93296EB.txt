I think I´m looking for something
In fact I´m looking for just one thing
Like in a bar where I´m lost and
I can´t find the exit don´t understand
I´ve been tracking dead ends
Too many words but lack of content
Now try to understand and
Don´t interpret what you can´t

One too many glasses on my way
Here´s another bottom of this

Refrain:
Empty bottle where is the message
I used to have it somewhere and lost it
Back in the cage, man with the moustache
Held another friend of mine hostage
Too much sedated
Too much I hate it
...
