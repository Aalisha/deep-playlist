Just when you thought you had it made
You had a life, your bills were paid
But your heart was numb inside
Abandoned by your foolish pride

And this I know
Nothing comes from shallow goals
I've tried and you will find
All your riches they come from inside

And here it comes this empty feeling again
I wanna help you out
I wanna make you understand what it's about
I'm not just here to be your fairweather friend
...
