I'm done, done, done, I'm done, done, done
I'm done, done, done

Riddle me this, when you be with your friends
Laughing and joking, loud talking
Why you get quiet soon as I walk in the room?

Riddle me this, you be going out with yours
But expect me to stay in doors
You don't ever want me to hang out wit my crew

Baby, I'm a grown woman dealing with grown woman things
So if you're gonna stay my man some things gonna have to change

'Cause I'm so done with all the not knowing
So over wondering what you've done
I'm 'bout to be on to another one
