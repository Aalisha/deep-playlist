Another day of shameful living's coming to an end
Twelve hours of jests and hurting words that Mickey's used to stand
A daily dose of cruel gibes, a sorrow's set in emerald eyes
Who the hell needs such a being when the dying looks so nice?

Pleasant smell of bubble bath
Slow, slow, slow, slow down your breath
Let the life flow out of veins
Do you really think it's gonna ease your pains?
