Baby I can't seem to get you off my mind
Memories seem to haunt me every day and every night
Lord, why don't you free my mind
So that I can love again...

Love again...

Well, I ain't over the love we had, still want you baby
I am loosing sleep, can't free my mind, is occupied
Well I ain't over the love we had, still want you baby
...
