You were tenderly afflicted
And it was cold as hell
There was nobody there
That you could tell

How it came out of the clear blue
Like a vengeful ice storm
You felt it come down
But it don't matter now

It'll all be over soon

You were tenderly afflicted
And frozen in your place
With your wonderful fears
That tortures your faith

But you wouldn't move anyway
Not for anyone
You needed the pain
