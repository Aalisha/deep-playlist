In '97 don't be alarmed, Gravediggaz drop
(Da Bomb! Da Bomb! Da Bomb!)
G, R, A, V, E, D (Da Bomb!)
I, double G, A to the zig zag Z
Droppin' (Da Bomb!)

(Grym Reaper)
Ay yo I really hate snakes
I feel like bustin' off rounds in they face
But that would be exhibitin' the same weak traits
Shit is deep like bass, enemies get beat, lock breaks
From dusk to dawn I thrust upon the scene
Always conscious I was born supreme
No wonder I run with a hundred twenty three nine hundred and ninety nine
thousand convicts
Wanted by the beast in the hellified streets
With nullified beef and combat swamp rats
And ghetto playgrounds where scenes is tragic
Everyday seein' decayin' brown fabrics (Da Bomb!)
A thirty pound addict with a hundred dollar day habit
True Master! Broadcast the havocism I'm babblin'
Mic's turnin' to javelins
Stabbin' MCs in the abdomen and laughin' at 'em (Hahahahaha!)

(Gatekeeper)
Gravediggaz a cannibal for swoops and bats
Sweat rocks as the jock and they counter react
Occupation i'm a blizzard, Gate Keep freak the reason
For the break, I been around as long as the Rza
The ripper, graveyards known for plenty more
Rugged raw, puttin' hardcore kicks on double doors
Your future's at stake, big mistake
You moved! (Da Bomb!) Mmm-mm you can't escape, checkmate
The flashy nigga, underground digga
Nigga think his head big enough, I make it bigga
The trank, I bust all blank, when I intake
