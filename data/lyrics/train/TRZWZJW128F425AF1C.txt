Drive fast
Don't crash
Make your money
Make it last
Hang tight
Kick back
Prepare yourself
For the attack
Buy low
Sell high
Take your pills
Tell your lies
Fake your tan
Wear a tie
Go to the gym
You'll never die.

And that's the way to go,
And that's the way to go, to go

Fake it baby
They won't even know
You can make it
Cause everybody knows
That's the way to go
Uh-huh
Cause everybody knows
That's the way to go

Tune in
Drop out
Raise your voice
Never shout
Find your true love
