Every now and then you say something I understand
And every now and then you don't
You may say you need some time alone to comprehend
And all I hear is the 'alone'

I hear you say it just wasn't meant to be
I hear you say I'm not good enough for you
I hear you say that you want to be released
I hear you say...

You may say you know what's going on inside my brain
That you can see right to the core
You will say that everything is gonna be ok
That you could never ask for more
