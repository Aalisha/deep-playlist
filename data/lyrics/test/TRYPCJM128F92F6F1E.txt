Midnight workings
weather down the story line
I try to find the truth between all the lies
When bleeding is feeling and feeling ain't real
Will I see you when I open my eyes?

Will I see you when I open my eyes?
When breathing's a burden we all have to bear
And trust is one thing we're taught never to share
Somehow you just seem to shine

When loving means breaking and saying goodbye
I can't help but wonder what it is you do
You help heal the pain, and the thoughts of the truth
You're a question to the universe, a wonder to the world
