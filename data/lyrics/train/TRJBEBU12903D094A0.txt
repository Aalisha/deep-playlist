(M. Jagger/K. Richards)

You're gonna get it straight from the shoulder
Can't you see the party's over
Let me go

Can't you get it through your thick head
This affair is finished - dead
Hey, let me go

I tried giving you the velvet gloves
I tried giving you the knockout punch
Hey, let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
