I wanna rob you of your game face
so I can cower beneath your words.
Cause I'm a freak from the same place
let suicide make a meal for birds

Into your heart, I've got the dagger;
the metaphor will suffice for now.
Get in my bed, i wanna kill you;
Show you mine if you show me how.

I get angry,
When you're around, when you're around.
I get nasty,
When you're around, when you're around.

She slit
her wrists
