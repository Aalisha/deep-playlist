And now the sound of time is passing fast, it's getting late
Don't know if I can take much more
The way you talk I often wondered
If I heard the words somewhere, someplace before

I got so nervous when I called and found that lately
You had gone and changed your name
But I've got something on my mind
I want you here, I want you now, you'd better explain

Is this true, you're running around
Now is this true, they're calling you the Chelsea girl?
Oh, is this true you're running around
Now is it true they're calling you the Chelsea girl?

Your best friend never calls you up, but you don't mind
'Cause lately things are all the same
Ain't it strange how people always seem to know your face
But just don't know your name?
