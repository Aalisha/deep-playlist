I'm so glad I've found this
I'm so glad I did
I'm so glad I've found this
I'm so glad I did

People are fragile things, you should know by now
Be careful what you put them through
People are fragile things, you should know by now
You'll speak when you're spoken to
It breaks when you don't force it
It breaks when you don't try
