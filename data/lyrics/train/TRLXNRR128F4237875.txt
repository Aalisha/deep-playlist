Hey Laura, Laura
Hey Laura, Laura
Every once in a while I'd see her smile
And she'd turn my day around

A girl with those eyes stared through the lies
See what your heart was saying
Think of Laura but laugh, don't cry
I know she'd want it that way

And when you think of Laura, well, laugh don't cry
I know she'd want it that way
A friend of a friend, a friend to the end
That's the kind of girl she was
