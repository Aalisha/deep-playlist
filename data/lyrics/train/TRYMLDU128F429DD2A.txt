Well there's only so much that a boy can take
And look at the state of him now
His tongue is tied in two

Hands that shake
The eyes don't lie

But still I didn't expect you to sink so soon
And look at the state of me now
But guess what I've heard...

A little longer and we're away
A little longer and we're away
A little longer and we're the thing
Cos you see colours deep in me

Ahhhhhh
We ride - let the road decide
...
