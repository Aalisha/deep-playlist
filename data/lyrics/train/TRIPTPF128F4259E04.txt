Stuffed to the eyeballs with God knows what
You're a conversational hazard
Talking so quickly with so much ease
I think you might have just snorted a blizzard
Oh! Won't you tell it to someone else?

And we'll go down a different river
And we'll see where it carries us
Meet me at the muster station
And if the ship's going down we'll swim for the ground
Come on, come and join us here

Living a lie when I'm lying here
