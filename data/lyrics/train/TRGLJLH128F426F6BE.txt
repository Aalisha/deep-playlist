Everyday my heart is sore
Seeing that I'm so poor
But I shall not give up so easy oooh
Cause there's a reward for me
There's a reward for me...

Though I'm bordered down with shame
There's no one for me to blame
But I shall not give up so easy
Cause there's a reward for me, oooh yeah
There's a reward for me.
