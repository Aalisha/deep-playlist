Heaven, don't send me someone to love
Angels know, they're not what I'm dreamin' of
Tell me 'bout your fantasies
You know what I need tonight
Baby, you and me, we're like TNT
Light the dynamite

Two parts trouble (two parts trouble)
Double down tough (double down tough)
Danger you, danger me
Danger Us, I know
