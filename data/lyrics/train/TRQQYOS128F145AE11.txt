Driftin'
West of California
On highway 66, my truck broke down
Yeah, and I found my pot of gold
In the heart of the dustbowl
Western angel, in a cowboy town

And I remember
The first day that I saw her
Standin' all alone in the rain
And when I looked into her face
There was not a trace
Of heartache, of sorrow, or of pain

She's my
Oklahoma sweetheart
The pride of Tulsa town
She never quits, and she never lets me down
She's my
Oklahoma sweetheart
