In my mind, I can see Your face
As Your love pours down in a shower of grace
Some people tell me that You're just a dream
My faith is the evidence of things unseen

In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
In my mind's eye, in my mind

You know what I'm going through
I know this is true, 'cause You stood in my shoes
Desires inside of me, but it's hard to believe
In what you cannot see

Can you catch the wind?
 (Catch the wind?)
See a breeze?
 (See a breeze?)
Its presence is revealed by the leaves on a tree
An image of my faith in the unseen

It's in my mind's eye
I see Your face
You smile as You show me grace

If in my mind's eye
You take my hand
We walk through foreign lands
The foreign lands of life

In my mind's eye, in my mind's eye
In my mind's eye, in my mind

In my mind, I'm where I belong
As I rest in Your arms
And like a child I hold on to You
...
