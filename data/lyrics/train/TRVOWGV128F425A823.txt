My skin is like a map
Of where my heart has been
And I can't hide the marks
But it's not a negative thing
So I let down my guard
Drop my defenses
Down by my clothes
I'm learning to fall
With no safety net
To cushion the blow

I bruise easily
So be gentle
When you handle me
There's a mark you leave
Like a love heart
Carved on a tree
I bruise easily
Can't scratch the surface
Without moving me
Underneath
I bruise easily

I bruise easily

I found your fingerprints
On a glass of wine
Do you know you're leaving them
All over this heart of mine too
But if I never take
This leap of faith
I'll never know
So I'm learning to fall

With no safety net
...
