Breaking in a brand new Panama hat
Bought in Havana just like that
Best hat Yankee dollars can buy
Working on the brim ‘cause I like it real flat
Talking ‘bout a brand new Panama Hat
Gonna take some time
But I'm a patient guy

Walking on the beach with my private shade
Sippin' an ice-cold lemonade
Taking in the sea, the sun and sky
Working on the brim ‘cause I like it real flat
Talking ‘bout a brand new Panama Hat
