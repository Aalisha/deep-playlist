I'm not the priziest horse or the classiest fighter
with shattered glass in my voice
writing my name on the wall with the fingers my highschool gave me; I'm still
counting electric sheep at night, in love with an electric blanket
in fact I make love with electric outlets
In my sleep, it's all flying pigs and things that want me dead;
when I'm awake, it isn't much different. It's not them versus us
the battle wages over future addictions
Something's missing, and I can't quite focus on it
Oh, it must be the disappearing act we all put with our dreams
They'll never find me as long as I keep smudging off into the background
And continue to sink through the sidewalk with my head under a bench, to see
who hears me, narrating their lives by the way they hold their money so tight
so they could send their kids off, but the best historians sleep on benches
(Why is everybody sleeping on benches?)
I've been a rock as long as I've lived
since everything has to be a nobel prize winner
I should've quit when I saved the ozone
I should have known if I can't feel the ones I came with, it's a good time to rest
and hold fear at bay like some hold the margins they need to survive in
Barely alive, and you want me to lighten up?
Make an angel on the beach or pick a boquet in your garden
