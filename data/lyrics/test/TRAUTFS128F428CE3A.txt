You tell me I'm the only one
That my love is second to none
You have to practice the love you preach
If my love you want to keep

Don't hold back on your love
You don't know what you're missing until I'm gone

You don't know what you got
Until you lose it
You abuse it
You don't know what you got
Don't confuse it
How you use it
Come on

Don't give me all material things
Don't you tell me what you really don't mean
I don't need your loving that bad
...
