(Intro)

Uh-uh, uh-uh
It's all about the funk
Wuh-uh, ah-ah

(Verse 1)
How many times did I try to tell you, you know
You ain't gonna get sympathy
You can't always chase your own desires
Or you'll be chasing endlessly
Decide, see what's to decide in your mind
Why you got to mess around and let her down?

How ja think she'd feel about it
She'd feel about what you do
How ja think she'd feel about it
Oh-oh

(Chorus 1)
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about it
Ho-ho, ho-wuh-oh
How ja think she'd feel about it
How ja think she'd feel about it
Ho-ho

(Verse 2)
I know about the rhymes that you been spinning
You know in time it comes back on you
This ain't a story you'll be winning
