I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine, it owes me a living
But ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
Oh ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams

Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I don't know.
