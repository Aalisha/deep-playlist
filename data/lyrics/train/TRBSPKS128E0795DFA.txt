I'm in my car
I got my telephones and radio
This is my home
I have learnt to love and live
The only way I know
And I don't want to change a thing
This is my world you are sitting in
I got a fax so I press send
Send a message to my DJ
A message to my DJ
'Cos he's my best friend
I'm in my car

And I am happy here
Even though the fools will never know
...
