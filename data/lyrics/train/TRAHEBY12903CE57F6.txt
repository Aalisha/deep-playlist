The same old song plays on the radio
That played that night I should've let you go
But I left you only in my mind

So here I am lying in the same
Cold bitter bed that liars like us make
Wondering if the circleâ€™s gonna break this time

What could I do
To keep from sinking down
What could I make
From all these pieces on the ground
I didn't mean to fall in between the same cracks of love
That you fell into
