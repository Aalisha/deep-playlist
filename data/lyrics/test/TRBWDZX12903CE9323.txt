Cow Cow Boogie Lyrics

Out on the plains down near Santa Fe
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
And as he jogged along I heard him singin'
A most peculiar cowboy song
It was a ditty, he learned in the city
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

Now get along, get hip little DOGIES
Get along, better be on your way
Get along, get hip little DOGIES
...
