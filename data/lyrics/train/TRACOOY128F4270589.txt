Rock and Roll It's been a long time since I rock and roll,
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll.
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back,
Let me get it back, baby, where I came from.
It's been a long time, been a long time,
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.
Yes ithas.
