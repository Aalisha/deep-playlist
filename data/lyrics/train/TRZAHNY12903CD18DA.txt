You never asked me what I wanted
You only asked me why
I never thought that so much
Trouble was restin' on my reply

I could say it was the nights when I was lonely
And you were the only one who'd come
I could tell you that I like your sensitivity
When you know it's the way that you walk

Why do you have to say
That there's always someone
Who can do it better than I can?

But don't you think that I know
That walking on the water
Won't make me a miracle man?
