(Yooooo whoa yooooo)
Wipe away your tears
Let's take a little walk up melody hill
Put aside your fears
We're gonna take a walk up melody hill
While sun shines on the flowers
(La la la la)
We'll kiss away the hours
(La la la la)
Listening to our happy little song

Baby me and you are living in a dream like Jack and Jill
Where skies are always real
Where grass is always green on melody hill
There's always perfect weather
(La la la la)
For me and for us together
(La la la la)
