Only hate is left to feel
Old enough he is to bear the weight
He's lying bruised and left to die by the sons of his own
The storm is leading him into the dark

Dark is the light inside your fearful mind
Your fearful mind
Plead... plead for your life, there is no other way
No other way

A drop of tear falls from his eyes
...
