what the hell am i?
thousand eyes, a fly
lucky then i'd be
in one day deceased

sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

i can feel the wheel, but i can't steer
when my thoughts become my biggest fear

ah, what's the difference, i'll die
in this sick world of mine

what the hell am i
leper from inside
inside wall of peace
dirty and diseased

sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman
...
