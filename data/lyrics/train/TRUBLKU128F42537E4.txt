(Reedoo:)
culcha candela one more time now 

(chorus:)
it's all about the next generation 
where people get ready for crossover stylee 
it's the next generation 
we mix up dancehall hip hop and reggae now 
next generation 
worldwide you see we unite 
for the next generation 
now we say knowledge and style move on 

(Lafrotino:)
esta nueva generaci贸n te trae una nueva sensaci贸n 
la escucharas en cada ocasi贸n en cada radio estaci贸n 
ahora quien nos va a parar quien lo quiere intentar 
sin cultura no hay candela y tu no lo podras logar 

(Johnny:)
and again here we come with the positive vibe 
with or without mic gotta work for our future 
gotta see the responsibility of the next generation your jau 
see we livin in a time of decision 
and use our energy to make a change is our mission 
am a son of the almighty me say just like you 
and anyone of us have struggle for pass through 
any thing you a go do is just to make yourself grow 
until you get a chance to make a better tomorrow 

(chorus:)
