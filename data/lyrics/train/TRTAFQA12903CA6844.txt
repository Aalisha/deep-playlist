Sometimes it's better not to know, 
Holding on to something when you should just let go.
True words, spoken in a dream, 
Swimming to the surface like a last breath, last scream.

Push, pull, hurry up and stall, 
Would you give a little if you can't give it all?
Ten years of picking at a seam, 
Trying to wake the kid, messing up my wet dream.
Hey kid, rock and roll, a bulls eye's hung on your soul.
