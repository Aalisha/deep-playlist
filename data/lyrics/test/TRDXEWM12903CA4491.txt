I lost myself at your show last night
Looking at the sparkling eyes
In the middle of a fresher crowd
You keep living like you're a movie star
But tell me who you really are
When the lights go down

Baby, you're a glitter doll (on the radio)
I dissolve (in my stereo)
You've got me
You've got me coming back for more

Pop princess, hold my hand
Pop princess, I'm a fan
Pop princess, I need you now
Freak me out
Turn me inside out
Pop princess, make me smile
Pop princess, drive me wild
Pop princess, I need you now
