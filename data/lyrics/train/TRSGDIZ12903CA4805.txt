I'm walkin' down the street, shufflin' my feet
Whistlin' a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along

I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me

The people downtown are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me, I'm sittin' in the shade soakin' up the day
Watchin' 'em all roll by
...
