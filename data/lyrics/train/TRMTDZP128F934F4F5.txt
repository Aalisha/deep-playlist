You live in the same world as I do
But somehow I never noticed
You before today

Beautiful people
We share the same back door
And it isn't right
We never met before

If I weren't afraid you'd laugh at me
I would run and take all your hands
And I'd gather everyone together for a day
And when we gather'd
I'll pass buttons out that say
