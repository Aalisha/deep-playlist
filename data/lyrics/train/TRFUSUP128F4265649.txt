You don't want my - eyes to see
You can tell I - still love you desperately
I can't keep goin' on - searchin' for some way
To stop my heart from breakin' - every day

So I want you
To release me
I'll do anything
Goin' crazy
Please set me free
Someone help me
Heal my agony
Memories every day
Tried every way
Make you go away

Starin' at my - ceiling every night
Waitin' for some - guiding light
Why have all your pictures - closed their eyes
I know you're out there someone - give me a sign
