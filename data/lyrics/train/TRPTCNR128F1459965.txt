Hey!

Hey!

Don't come around here no more
Don't come around here no more
Whatever you're lookin' for
Hey! Don't come around here no more

I've given up, stop
I've given up, stop
I've given up, stop
On waiting any longer
I've given up
On this love getting stronger
Don't come around here no more
Don't come around here no more
...
