Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Oh oh ohhh

When the roll is called up
I'll be standing taller
To face the darkest and the hardest of times
We'll be takin care of
All the children there of
But if it's required we'll be on the frontline

You can call me by my name
I am ready to roll
Once the rules remain the same
How the story's been told
Call me any time
Never cop out
Lioness is on the rise
Don't you ever have doubt

Never say never we're in this forever to fight and be strong
Once is for better I'll write every letter in moving right along
And I roll with the punches
Accept changes
Work with the formula do what I have to do

And call me by my name
I am ready to roll
...
