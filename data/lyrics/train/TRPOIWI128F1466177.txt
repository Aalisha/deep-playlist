Young people
Welcome to the close heaven[Incomprehensible]and ministry tonight
Won't you please turn in your hymnals to page 333
Sister Mildred, we're gonna play free at last
Free at last, thank God Almighty

Free at last, free at last
I thank God, I'm free at last
Free at last, free at last
I thank God, I'm free at last

Have you heard?
Listen carefully
I can't stop

Free, free, I'm free at last
I thank God Almighty, I'm free at last
Free, free, I'm free at last
I thank God Almighty, I'm free

'Cause I'm free, free at last
And I'm free, from my past, and I'm free
Free from sin, and I'm free
And I ain't going back again

Shackles had me down but he gave me a new sound
So reclaim my name from the lost and found
Ya see, something's got me jumpin' and I think it's the way
That he can take a hard man and turn him into soft clay

Out of the darkness, the father has sparked this
The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass
If you're seriously curious about my past
Well I once was lost but I'm free at last
