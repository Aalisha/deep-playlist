Keep away from me, Mr. Welfare
They just keep on saying I'm a lazy women, dont
love my children and I'm mentally unfit
I must divorce him, cut all my ties wth him cuz
his ways they make me say
It's a hard sacrifice(hard sacrifice), not having me
a loving man
Society gave us no choice, tried to silence my
voice pushing me on th welfare
I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying to prove my
equal rights
Though I've made some mistakes for goddness
sakes, why should they help mess up my life?
ooh, so keep away from me, Mr.Welfare. Did you
hear me? Keep away from me, Mr.Welfare
Holding me back, using your tract, to make me
live against my will,(hard sacrifice)
If that's how it goes child, I dont know, I can't
concede my life's for real
It's like a private eye for the FBI, just as envious
