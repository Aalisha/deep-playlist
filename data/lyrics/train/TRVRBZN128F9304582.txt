Though they broke your heart they never broke your will
Your script stayed strong through the years you were ill
They caged you like the animals and tortured you but still
They could never hurt what cannot be killed
Though the mortal life of a true freedom fighter's gone
Barry Horne, Barry Horne your memory lives on
