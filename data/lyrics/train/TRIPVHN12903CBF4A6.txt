Well I'm low down and dirty mama
I got low down dirty ways
Somethin' to tell ya baby
I'm gonna clean 'em up someday
But one day, I'm gonna lose these dirty ways
'Cause I'm low down and dirty
Low down dirty way

Low down in the mornin'
Low down late at night
Tell you baby, somethin' just ain't right
Sayin' low down, low down all the time
