Is there something more?
Surely there must be.
You can't lose everything,
So you're quite happy.

To live with nothing more,
Than a life-long shopping list,
You tick it off on credit...
Well you'll pay for it.

Week in and week out,
Your lucky charms will always let you down,
Maybe next week we'll see,
Maybe.

You stand in line completely still,
...
