I feel a separation coming on
Cause i know that you want
To be moving on
I wish it would snow tonight
You pull me in and avoid a fight
Cause I feel

A separation coming on
Just prove that there is nothing left to try
It's the truth
I rather we just both deny
You kiss me with those open eyes
It says so much
It's no surprise to you

But I've got something left to say
Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
