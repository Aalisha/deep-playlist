When we first met you said 
It's complicated take it slow 
Depper the water goes the more you wanna dip your toe 
I couldn't get enough 
I wanted you right there and then 
Ignoring all the signs 
I thought that you and I were cool 
Said I was beautiful you put me on a pedstal 
I would do anything to get back to those days again 
Don't know what's wrong 
Want to stay 
In your arms

If two people can have it all 
Live the dream and break the rules 
Tell me why not us 
If two people can fall in Love 
Destiny should be enough 
So tell me why not us 
...
