You played a game for rich rewards
The stakes: your blood, your mind, your soul
You try to gain all earthly power
You unleash plagues of Famine, Death and War
All my sins have damned my soul in hell

All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
