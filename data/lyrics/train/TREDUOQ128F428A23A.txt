I don't know what I'm doing
I say the wrong things half the time
I'm only human
Not anything you can't define
I'm rushing day to day
To find my way
To where I'm going
Don't try to fight me
I'm all I can be

Sometimes it's hard
No matter who you are
It's life (it's life)
Yeah, it's life (it's life)
And I'm just trying to get it right (yeah)
Sometimes I feel
Like this whole thing isn't real
It's life (it's life)
Yeah, it's life (it's life)
And I'm just trying to get it
I'm trying to get it right

I can't keep living
Counting every breath I take
Just wanna jump in
