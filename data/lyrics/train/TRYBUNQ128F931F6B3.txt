Oh yes, I loved you baby
And I made you feel so blue
Well I'm coming back, little baby
Yes, and make some love to you So save your crazy-crazy lovin' baby
Save your crazy lovin' just for me, oh yeah
Don't let nobody else love you
Save your crazy-crazy lovin' just for me, oh yeah
Well you been so fine baby and I wanna tell you this
