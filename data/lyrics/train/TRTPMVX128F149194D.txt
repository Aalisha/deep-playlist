When I was a boy,
I thought it just came to you
But I never could tell what's mine
So it didn't matter anyway

My only pride and joy
Was this racket down here
Banging on an old guitar
And singin' what I had to say 

I always thought our house was haunted
Cuz nobody said "boo" to me
I never did get what I wanted
But now I get what I need 

It's been a slow turning
From the inside out
A slow turning
