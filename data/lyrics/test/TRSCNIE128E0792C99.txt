Sometimes I feel so uninspired
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel so very tired
Sometimes I feel like I've had enough

Sometimes you feel like you've been hired
Sometimes you feel like you've been bought
Sometimes you feel like your room's been wired
Sometimes you feel like you've been caught

But don't let it get you down, no, no
There is no reason for not failing
You've got to smile and turn the other cheek
So today you might beat up

But by tomorrow you'll be sailing
...
