I've never seen your glitter shine so see-thru
As right here
I've been between myself on me and you
Is it good enough for a run?
Is it good enough for the fun?
Now you've made me see and I'm excited cause...

Now it's a "No"
Now it's a big "No"
Is that honest enough for you?
So now that you know
It's all there
I'll sit and watch you go
And I ain't findin' it hard to do
...
