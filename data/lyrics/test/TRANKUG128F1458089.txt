Let's Have A Party
Wanda Jackson with instrumental backup by Gene Vincent's Blue Caps.

Peaked at # 37 in 1960


Some people like to rock, some people like to roll
But movin' and a-groovin's gonna satisfy my soul
Let's have a party
Hoo, let's have a party
Well, send `im to the store Let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear, I never kissed a *`coon*
But I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room
Let's have a party
Hoo, let's have a party
Well, send `im to the store Let's buy some more
