The time on the clock reads half past four;
I'm wide awake and thinking
With my pillow on the floor
That maybe I'm just wasting my time dreaming
In a harsh reality
I don't wanna wake up just to find out
I've been deceived...

Let it roll
Our time is fleeting so we take control
From California to my home sweet home
Our days repeating like it's all we know
It's all we know

Out here the hills roll on for miles
...
