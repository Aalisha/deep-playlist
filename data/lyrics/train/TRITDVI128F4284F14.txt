Why do I feel like a newborn child
Why do I feel like a silver dollar
Why do I feel like a newfound drug
Why do I feel like I wipe my borders

What do I look like (high)
What do I feel like (high)
What do I taste like (high)
What have I come to (high)
All the love in this world (doesn't mean a thing to me)
All the love in this world (doesn't mean a thing to me)
