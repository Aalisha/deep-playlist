Our darkest dreams set us free
Our darkest scene set us free
I wanna live the dream
Inside a shadow heart
Where all things are alive
Through a blackened soul
Take me back to
The depth of remembrance
In the summer of love
My heart turned cold

Call me
I'm coming

The rush of you forever
Inside our darkest dreams
I need to remember
Things are not what they seem
...
