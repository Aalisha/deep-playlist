Every Night I Dream The Same Old Frightning Nightmare
Calling Out For Answers No One Can Explain.
Voices In The Distance, Can Not Understand Them
Faces Look At Me, They Call Out My Name.

Back To Realtity I Realize It's The Naked Truth
See People Stare At Me - Can't You See That We Went Much Too Far
