I am soon to reach the pith.
My spherical vile so sacred.
Engendering the divine fusion.
Visions of emerging stars.
I am about to stake my stance.
Fly above the precluding fence.
The cosmic feast I am to gasp.
To honour the divine cast.

Cyclus - frames the core of the causes.
Circle - the way of the forces.
Gods, I am here to prevail.
End the subsequent existence.
The resound of thousand tales.
Hear the call, stirring the fall.
