Hah, when I left my wife and child, Louie go back home
And my, oh my car jumps and it's about to drive me wild, Louie go back home
Ah a little voice inside my head goes on and on, Louie go back home
Says Louie Louie Louie, you'd better go back h-home

Hah hah, I thought I'd make it above myself, Louie go back home
But my baby has got my heart locked on the shed, Louie go back home
Well hah, I can still hear my baby moan, Louie go back home
Oh Louie Louie, you'd better come back a-home
