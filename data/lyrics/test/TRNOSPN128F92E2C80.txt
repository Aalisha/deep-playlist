Mmmmhhh mhmm
yeah yeah
Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Holy Diver

Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you
Look out

Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
