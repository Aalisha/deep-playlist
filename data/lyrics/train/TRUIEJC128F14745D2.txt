Maybe I should drop you at your door
Or leave tonight and vanish up the shore
Anywhere but here

It's three o'clock, we're driving in your car
You're screaming out the window at the stars
"Please don't drive me home"

Blame us 'cause we are who we are
Hate us 'cause you'll never get that far
And who'd suppose you would go?
I've already learned enough to know
