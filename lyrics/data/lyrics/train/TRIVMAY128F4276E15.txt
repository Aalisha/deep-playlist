Sweetness and light, you were right
Summers are gettin' harder
Days echo by, blood red sky
Chop wood and carry water

We only do what we can
And there's a natural plan, you know
And I know that you understand
'Cause you're just that kind of man, you know

Oh, we try and try, we cry, baby, cry
Everybody knows we get nowhere
Again and again forever till the end
...
