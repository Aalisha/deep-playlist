You scared hoe
What what what
You scared hoe
What what what
You scared hoe
What what what
Kickin in the door I make
Them bitches hit the floor
For keys

You scared hoe
What what what
You scared hoe
What what what
You scared hoe
What what what
Kickin in the door I make
Them bitches hit the floor
For keys

You scared hoe
What what what
You scared hoe
What what what
You scared hoe
What what what
Kickin in the door I make
Them bitches hit the floor
For keys

Bust in with that 45 make them bitches back it up
Catch them ridin on them thangs make them bitches jack it up
Here they got that pot it man make them bitches bag it up
Finally got that money man make them bitches sag it up
Take it to the spot man now its time to crank it up
Don't play tomorrows a brighter day I gotta pack it up
Means I bees the first up on the block I guess to rack it up
Pocket full of stones oh boy I gotta track it up
Fuckin wit you snitches man don't make me wanna hang it up
But lookin at a empty plate dont' make me wanna keep it up
Any nigga with that work gon make me wanna kreep it up
Even though my pockets don't got deep they ain't got deep enough
