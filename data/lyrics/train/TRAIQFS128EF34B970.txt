Ba ba-ba-ba-bah ba-ba-ba-bah ba-ba-ba-bah
Ba ba-ba-ba-bah ba-ba-ba-bah ba-ba-ba-bah

When the world in which you live in
Gets a bit too much to bear
When you need someone to lean on
When you look there's no-one there
You're going to find me out in the country
Come on and find me out in the country

Where the air is good and the day is fine
And the pretty girl has her hand in mine
And the silver stream is a poor man's wine
...
