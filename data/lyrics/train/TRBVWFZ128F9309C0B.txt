On this dawn the colours of the autumn are reflected by a light
A light that as been captured for years in oblivion

Circles of wind are raging now
And so his powers are slowly dying
Before the coldness rapes the lands
His spirit is wandering into the night... to DIE!

...and he heard chimes ahead playing these enchanted notes,
That lead him to a wooden cabin, where he could rest for the night...
...
