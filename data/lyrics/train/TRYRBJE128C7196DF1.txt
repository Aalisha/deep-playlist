One day
I know
We'll find
A place of hope

Just hold on to me
Just hold on to me

Walk tight
One line
You're wanted
This time

There's no-one to blame
Just hold on to me

And I'm right on time
And the birds keep singing
And you're right on line
And the bells keep ringing
And the battle is won
And the planes keep winging
And I'm right on time
One day there'll be a place for us
And the girl keeps singing

I walk
I wait
With folded hands
And lonely
I stumble
...
