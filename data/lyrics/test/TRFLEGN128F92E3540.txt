I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified

I give my life
Give my life give my life
Give my life to be in
The book of love
Give my life give my life
Give my life to gods above
When I go when I go when I go
Come see my spirit fly
Give my life give my life
The night I'm sacrified

There's a wizard who pampers the virgins
He's collecting a potion of blood
There's a blizzard when drowning the valley
Take the virgins away by the flood

On a mountain the wizard perfecting
He's collecting an ancient perfume
Every tear every drop of the essence
Breaking hearts in the temple of doom

I give my life
