Jesse James and Frank James,
Billy the Kid and all the rest,
Supposed to be some bad cats
Out in the west.

But when they dug me,
And my gangster ways,
They hung up their guns,
And made into their graves.

Cause i'm a gangster of love,
Say, i'm a gangster of love.
Oh, well now,
When i walk down the street,
All the girls that i meet
Say: "he's a gangster of love"

(yeah!)
