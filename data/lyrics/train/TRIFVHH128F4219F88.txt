Drinking for a living
that's just what I do
When I'm not with you
My heart goes to bed.
End of the bar
that's just where I'll be
Don't try and come find me
Cause I'm already dead

With one eye tied upon the open road
I feel your presence and I can't let it go.
It moves so slowly as it creeps into my mind
Steals every breath I have and leaves my heart behind

Wanna know what you're feeling if your feeling alone
I wanna hear if you still care
The last time I remember you was the last time I wasn't scared
