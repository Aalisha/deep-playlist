Fire with the bless from a long time
Every one Burn fire burn Babylon we come from passion thing
Fire with the bless from a long time
We Burn all hypocrites and the parasites design

Now we Sick a dem story, me sick a dem story (4x)

Promises, promises is all them giving
Say them break inno to help us on their willing
But all I see is just your senseless feeling
And the youth them all yeah! Creeping for dem shilling
You then graduate and can't no get employment
No one inno inna them pocket them can't get no enjoyment
But it's easier for a dry tee to be at our throat
