Every day it comes to this
Catch the things you might have missed
You say get back to yesterday
'Cause I ain't ever going back
Back to the place that I can't stand
But I, I miss the way you lie
'Cause I'm always misunderstood
Pulled apart and ripped in two
But I, I miss the way you lie

Catch the sun before it's gone
Here it comes, up in smoke and gone
Catch the sun, it never comes
Cry in the sand, lost in the fire
