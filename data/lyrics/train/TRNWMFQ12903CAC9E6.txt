Letting loose on the streets
On the prowl looking for meat
We're always out, out for you
Better watch out, we're coming for you

Evil's staring in your eyes
Your time is here
Breaking out of our cage
We smell your fear

These fangs are sharp, will tear your flesh
With matted coats and rotten breath
Demon dogs from the tomb
Torn right outta the bitch's womb
...
