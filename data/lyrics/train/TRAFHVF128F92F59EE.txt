Pimp C
Let me see it, hold up... hol' up
Let me see it, uh... hol' up... let me see it
Let me see it...(repeat)
Bend over lemme see it,
Let me see it...(repeat)
Bend over lemme see it...

Bun B:
Now, from the city that I live in
To the city where I'm from,
For all the hoes that we done did,
And the hoes that we ain't done,
From the ones that fuck for shrimp,
To the ones that fuck for cum:
If you ain't fittin' ta fuck Pimp,
Then you ain't fittin' ta fuck Bun.
Got some hoes from the 'hood ('hood)
That live to keep it live (live),
And some office buildin' boppers (boppers),
Workin' 9 to 5 (five).
Ball playa baby mama bitches;
But to me it ain't no thang
Let that monkey hang, baby,
Let me see it...

Chorus: (Pimp C) (x4)
Let me see it, let me see it,
Let me see it, let me see it,
Let me see it, let me see it,
Bend over, let me see it...

Bun B:
Go'on and let a nigga peak (peak),
And let a nigga poke (poke),
Fuck a nigga from his street (street),
And let a nigga stroke (stroke).
