(Funk, funk, funk for love)
(Come let's all get funky if you take the right
Please let's all get funky if you take the wrong
Come let's all get funky if you take the right
Please let's all get funky if you take the wrong...)

It's the love funky music and the feeling can't control
Oh no, funky music and the rhythms in my soul
Hey, sweet love funky music and the beats in my head
I love funky music and my lady understands

She can be funky, he can be funky, I can be funky too
With your love
You can be funky, we can be funky, I can be funky too
With some of your love
Home is where you live and play and laugh and be happy
Making love every day
We already know how to blues it

Sweat down my spine, feeling fine
Ain't it the love funk, baby?
