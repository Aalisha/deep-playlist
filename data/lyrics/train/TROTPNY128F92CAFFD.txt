Nowhere to run to baby, Nowhere to hide
I got Nowhere to run to baby, Nowhere to hide

It's not love I'm runnin' from,
Just the heartbreak I know will come
Cause I know you're no good for me (You're no good)
But you've become a part of me

Everywhere I go, your face I see,
Every step I take, you take with me, yeah

Nowhere to run to baby, Nowhere to hide
Got Nowhere to run to baby, Nowhere to hide

I know you're no good for me,
...
