Pretty soon you'll be able to remember him
Lying In the garden singing
Right where he'll always be
The door is always open

This is the place that I loved him
And these are the friends that he had
Long may the mountain ring
To the sounds of his laughter
And he goes on and on

In his soft wind I will whisper
In his warm sun I will glisten
...
