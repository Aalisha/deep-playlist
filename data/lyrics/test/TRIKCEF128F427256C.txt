Well be bop a lula she's my baby
Well be bop a lula summertime blues
Well it's something else man and you can't lose
I'm gonna race with the devil and maybe I'll win
And I'm gonna dance with skinny Jim
Well hang on tight you better get ready
We're gonna rock with Gene and Eddie

Halleluja I love her so
