Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, a time where we should know.
I can't fly high, I can't go long.
Today I got a million, Tomorrow, I don't know.

Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow.
Sometimes I believe, a time where we should know.
I can't fly high, I can't go long.
Today I got a million, Tomorrow, I don't know.
