didn't think I'd have to choose
didn't think I'd wear brown shoes
didn't think that I'd ever have to read about this in the news
you gonna have a go
well I don't want to know
I just thought that I should try and say hello to those who'd

never exist without being generic
you have to impress our bovine public
you'd never exist if you wasn't generic
you have to impress our bovine public
I'll never forget how all this begun
and I will never regret a thing I have done but
you would never exist without us

so maybe I do not have the time
fair-weather friends of mine
a year's a long time
...
