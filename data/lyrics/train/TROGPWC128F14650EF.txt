All Around Me Wants To Know
Y I'm Wid Him
And Wot The Deal Wid This
Obsession Wid A Guy I've Been
Loving For So Long
They're Into Wot They C
Superficial And They Dnt Give A Damn
That He's Got The Finest Qualitys
And They Cant Control

How He Sends Me Over
And Makes Me Quiver
How He Takes Me Up
And My Feet Dnt Touch The Ground
[Chorus:]
