I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long

Hmm just

Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just wanna be a woman

From this time, unchained
Were all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
