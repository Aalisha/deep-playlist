You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall

You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall

The hunger and starvation
For love that you feel in yourself
And all the deprivation
Will pall when you see what love is
Oh, I've begged you, girl, stay outta my life
Though I've welcomed you sometimes
I wanna tell you, girl

You're too young to fall in it
Oh, baby, to fall
You're too young to fall

You're too young to fall in it
