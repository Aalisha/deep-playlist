Who dares to care when affection's all we need?
Who dares to bare what the others have to feel?
I put my trust in a prominent machine
Feel no pain and don't you dare to make a scene, no

The search for truth's just moving' on
Everybody want a priest
Denying the sound of a restless soul
Keep your eye on where you've gone
I don't think that you belong
Escaping reality won't set your judgment free

Who'll hide to find the ultimate belief?
Who'll ride the kind of perpetual disease?
I thought that still every breath I take is free
...
