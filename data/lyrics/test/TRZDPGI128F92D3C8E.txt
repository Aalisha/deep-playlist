Open up ya eyes and watch the sunrise
One part of me I've been made clear
Love that goes spread all the world
Me love ya comes out of devotion
To rule ya spread to the world
In Trenchtown I'm on my mission
Where we praise the day straight our way
All the nation

Let me be the love that comes from the sun
Let me be your rainbow rising on
Every single race out of space
Will shine on, shine on!

Let me be the love that comes from the sun
I wanna be your love light from above
