Crouching down inside a deep ravine
Those angry cries pass quickly by, can't be seen
So many ways spent hiding in so many undone plans
Forgetting what it's like to fight when no one understands

Close call there in the shadows
There's a fear in the dark
There's no one out there

All those memories, pain and anger, flood back one by one
They must be just around the bend, they always come
At night as I lay sleeping they come to me in herds
...
