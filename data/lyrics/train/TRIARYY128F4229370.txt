Turn the lights off, turn the lights off
Your daddy better lock up his girl
Say a prayer boy, call on the cross
Cause you ain't got no morning' if he comes home...
Board up the doors, the windows and keep your crying under your breath.
Cause I smell a drop of beer in a ten gallon tank and I'm movin' in for the kill.

Yeah! In the wild kingdom...

You don't live 'til you're ready to die! (x4)

Which one of you sons of bitches is going to make me feel alive?
Which one of you motherfuckers is gonna get inside my heart?
