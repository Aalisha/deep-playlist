Our love has changed,
It? s not the same,
And the only way to say it?
Is say it? It? s better.

I can? t concede,
This way I feel,
For all the time we spent, together,
Forever? Just gets better .

See what I? m trying to say is:
You make things - better
And no matter what the day is,
With you here - it? s better.
