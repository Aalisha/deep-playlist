I was looking the wrong way
when you came into my life
like a story returned everyday
and my heart gave a warning
and it stopped for a moment
and I thought I would never get well

but the poison and passion and action of love
running away with me huhh
the fighting and hiding your hating and love
until you could set me free

I was caught in the middle of a rock and a hard place and
I needed a soft place to fall
Then you showed me the reason to rely on my feelings
I had nothing to fear at all

I'll never go back to that circle of one
that circle of loneliness yeahh
I'll never go back to that circle of one
Oneee!
