GI, Shazam (baby), and yo my boy Dino
Oh yeah (baby) ha-ha I'm Stick baby (I'm gonna show you what sexy is) and I got yo back, yeah
H-Town beatin' down yo door for the 9-4 (baby)
And this one is definetly for the ladies, check it
While I got ya ridin' in my 6-4
With your body laid to the door
While your legs catchin' sun from the window
Girl you know I'm bout ready to go

I see you're lookin' at your tick tock
While I ride straight by the bus stop
Every girl wanna be in your spot
Well damn it's a good day
And I go to park (say, say)
Then I stop, put the brakes on

Shhh, hush don't talk

Baby, come a little closer to me
While we slip in the back seat
