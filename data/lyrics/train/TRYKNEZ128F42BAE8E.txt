I'm on a helicopter ride through Vietnam.
I'm the Leicester Square kid I'm superman.
I'm putting on weight for the Oscar.
Man gonna get through anyway I can.

Hey hey hey we're in the movie.
I feel up and I feel groovy.
Let's go out and get some of that.
Gimme gimme gimme some Russian Roulette.
I said hey.

Everywhere everyone is red and green.
I gotta lust for glory and a tape machine.
I'm living out Frank Coppola's dreams.
