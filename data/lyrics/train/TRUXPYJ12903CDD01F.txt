Your blood flies in the wind,
It's old and worn and has no glory
Hand on heart allegiance pledged

Patriot, hatred instilled
Ignorant, white trash stand proud
With bigotry endowed

These colours don't run
These colours well worn
These colours don't run
But put to the torch they'll sure as hell...

Burn like your passion,
The passion of the damned
Can you still hear Dixie?

Ignorance is your strength
A raped stolen land stands so proud
Can you still hear Dixie scream out loud?

These colours don't run
...
