There's a village by the seaside

lt's the village I was born

Lives a lovely girl named Silver

By the colour of her hair.
Yes
we used to play together
By the harbour an√§ the beach.
Yes
we used to sing together
With the people in the church.

AII the older people smiled
When we were walkin' down the streets.
Yes
they said that I was born for you
And you were born for me.
