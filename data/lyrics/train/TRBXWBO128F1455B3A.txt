(L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E, love conquers all)
(L-O-V-E, L-O-V-E, love conquers all)

Making like a Romeo, making on a Juliet (she said)
Maybe you're a Montague, maybe you're a Capulet
Maybe you don't trust me yet, let me light your cigarette
Be you shark, be you jet, never forget that

Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)
Love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)

When Bogart saw Bacall
He knew that love conquers all (L-O-V-E love)
(Woah) It's only love, yeah
Love conquers all
(Woah) It's only love, yeah
