Yeah

Y'know what it is

SK

With 9th Wonder on the beat

Elliot Ness.
Custom Made, Bad Boy collabo (9th Wonder!)
We all about the cash flow

The bottom line is, me and mine are solidified
You little dudes run along, go and get a grind
I rock rubber bands, but not for fashion

I keep 'em cause I'm literally stacking
And I don't fuck with Visa or plastic, I just pull out a [?]
And wrap it with elastic, pillowcase stash it
Spit straight acid, the stars is lookin' in
I sit you on your ass, like your father should've did
Ladies and Gentlemen it's the world renowned
The city's favorite hustler I [?] up your town
Dude keep a bad one shot, wearing her out
Her deep throat so mean, she can't hear in her mouth???
