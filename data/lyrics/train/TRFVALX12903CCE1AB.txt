I need love, love to ease my mind;
I need to find, find someone to call mine;
but mama said you can't hurry love,
no you just have to wait,
she said love don't come easy,
it's a game of give and take.
You can't hurry love,
no, you just have to wait,
you gotta trust, give it time,
no matter how long it takes;
but how many heartaches must I stand
before I find a love to let me live again.
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on,
when I feel my strength, yeah, it's almost gone,
I remember mama said,

You can't hurry love,
no you just have to wait,
