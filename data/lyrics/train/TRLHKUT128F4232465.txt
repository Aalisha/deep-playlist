EASY! EASY! EASY! EASY! EASY! EASY!

Hey you, give me the dummy tits,
Forget the rest of the shit
The man with the skull and bones,
You think you know, but you don't.

To Sodom I will go,
Not to Megiddo.
Several Lucifers come,
We can beat them all.

A Carlton Corsair,
A Raleigh Twenty, yeah!
A little lost roe deer,
The wind in your hair.

NO LUCIFER!
