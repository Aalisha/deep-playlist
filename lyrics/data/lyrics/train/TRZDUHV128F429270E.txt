When I was young I knew everything
She, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
Stopped a babies breath and a shoeful of rice, no

Can't be held responsible
'Cause she was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise
And we never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of Valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he says
