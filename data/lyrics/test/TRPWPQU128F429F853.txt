Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa
Go

Inside a wall street mind a psycho lurks
Lines of cocaine cut in hell
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Compulsively you'll die... I hate people

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh
Struggling to breathe, go

The sweet asphyxiation and dismemberment
Sex puts me in the mood to make you die
Obsessive hands gently grab your neck
Look into sick eyes... I hate people
...
