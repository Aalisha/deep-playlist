I wake to see the sun rise from her slumber
I hear the birds sing their songs of love
A knowing smile warms my face, I remember
To be thankful, it's a beautiful day
My lost and lonely heart was calling
Out to find the way

Then I found You, wonderful You
Like a dream You came, let me live again
Oh, now there's You, glorious You
I need forever to know You way

There was a time when peace of mind just eluded me
And the sun was always clouded from my view
But You opened up my heart to see a new day
Now this fire within me needs to praise
