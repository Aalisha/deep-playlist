I'd rather face the sky in the Caymans
Than face indictments of heavy when taking lightly ain't the way I take my rhyming
Maybe it's fate that drives me
Greatness I seek may never be achieved til the day that I cease
I think of my peeps either in the grave or the pen
Or on the block pushing that rock like Payton to Kemp
I gave you a glimpse of the way we exist my book of life
So full of anguish pages I skip I write with a radiant wrist
The nights is the way that I spit so much crack I gave you a brick
And expected you'd question the weight of my shit
It's so real you smell the stench of elevators with piss in
Feel the palm sweat from pumping all day on the bench
I see fake niggas embrace men they say the resent
They hear the door hit the floor I'm straight off the hinges
Food for thought a lot of niggas ate off my strength
