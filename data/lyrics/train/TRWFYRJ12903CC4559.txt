I fell in your arms tonight
I fell hard in your arms tonight
It was nice
I died in your arms tonite
I slipped through into the afterlife
It was nice
White light in your arms tonight
I lost sight in your arms tonight
It was nice

And hey, you
Don't you think it's kind of cute
That I (I) died (died) right inside your arms tonight
That I'm fine even after I have died
Because it was in your arms I died
...
