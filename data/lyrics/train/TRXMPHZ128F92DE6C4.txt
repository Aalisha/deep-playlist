It's so fucking hot in here
But the devil doesn't care
The front row will be dripping wet
But satan won't even break a sweat

He's in the car corning up the heat
Burning my hands burning my feet
Some cool lemonade would hit the spot
Cause it's really really really really really hot

Hell's on fire
Burning your body right to the core
Hell's on fire
You can fry an egg on the floor
Mmmm I like 'em scrambled
