Hole in the Middle - Emily Jane White 

Everybody's got a little Hole in the Middle 
Everybody does a little dance with the devil 		
And everybody's got a little Hole in the Middle		
Everybody does a little dance with the devil		

And you know I'm evil now				
And you shout it loud and proud			
Singing "Born in the USA"				
And you know I'm evil now
