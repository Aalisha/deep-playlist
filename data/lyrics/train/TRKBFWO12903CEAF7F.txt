Girl, I know the hall looks dark
And the storm it seems so scary
Your face lit up on beats of lightning

You start, you start running
And your eyes are like screaming
And since there is no end and no beginning

You will run, you will run, you will run

Girl, I know the woods look dark
And the trees they seem so deadly
The girls around you are so frightened

You start, you start to panic
And your courage starts to vanish
And the world, it really is on fire

And it burns, and it burns, and it burns
It burns, and it burns, and it burns
...
