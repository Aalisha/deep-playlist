We could let this love be the fading sky
We could drift all night untill the new sun rise
Pass me a drink or maybe two
One for me and one for you

And we'll be free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee

Here comes corner winds and the changin' tide
We better drop them sails and get inside
When will the weather ever let us go
I guess we'll have to wait until the trade winds blow
