After all this time I guess I finally made it through
All the darkness to the point of being over you
Now and then my mind runs into your old memory
But it ain't quite as big a deal as it used to be

Now I know, even though you're not here
You will never be too far away
Anywhere, you'll be there
Like a whisper inside me each and every day

(If I win, if I lose)
