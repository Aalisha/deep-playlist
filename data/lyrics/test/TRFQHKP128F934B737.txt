Tired of drifting, searching, shifting through town to town
Every time I slip and slide a little further down
I can't blame you if you won't take me back
After everything I put you through
But honey you're my last hope
And who else can I turn to

Come on Silver Lady take my word
I won't run out on you again believe me
Oh, I've seen the light
It's just one more fight
Without you
Here I am a million miles from home
The Indiana wind and rain cut through me
I'm lost and alone, chilled to the bone
Silver Lady
