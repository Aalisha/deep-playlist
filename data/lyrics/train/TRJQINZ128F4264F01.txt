I don't understand about complimentary colors
And what they say
Side by side they both get bright
Together they both get gray
But he's been pretty much yellow
And I've been kind of blue
But all I can see is
Red, red, red, red, red
Now... what am I gonna do

I don't understand about diamonds
And why men buy them
What's so impressive about a diamond
...
