the city makes so much noise when you record it
the streets have secret voices
if they don't shut up your head will get dirty
so you block out the hum
desensitized, it's not healthy
but the city's like a miniture body
with miniture versions of our universal problems
if i can make dorm rooms and stadiums silent
my record, when played, will make the whole world more quiet

my ears are wringing
things hid in me
i want to keep my tissues eye lashes and intestines clean
by i can't think
open for business! infected!
every particle pulled in a separate direction
...
