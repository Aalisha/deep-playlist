Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness the most highly acclaimed event of the century
This is part two of history making, H-Blockx alongside Dr. Ring-Ding
The king in the ring, this is our return, myÂ ?, to kick some butt, right, uh, ha ha ha ha
Comiiing

Alright, twenty for seven the H-Blockx alongside Dr. Ring-Ding, come again, ha ha

99 days sparring with the Don King of the business
I'm in and this is where it begins
The arena is packed and stacked with the P-Pack
The pact is sealed and we are gonna react - SMACK
The judges?: "READY", the coaches?: "READY",
The referees?: "STEADY" Henning?: "Boom ah yeah"
The bookies gimme 5 Grand for every buck I bet on me
From what I understand they don't expect an upset - SEE
Instead of fame what you like me to bet
I'm gonna get in the ring for another trickery history
It seems ok, the hour has come I hear the clock go ring ah ding - ah ding dong

Ladies and Gentlemen, the bout is about to begin
Get in the ring Henning Boom ah yeah, yeah and sing

Get in the ring if you wanna fly high
Kick a hole in the sky have a good time
In the ring we wanna fly high
Hit the sky if you wanna have a good time
