Cue the music,
Curtain falls,
The lights all fade to gray.
Don't think there'll be an encore
For our secret Passion Play.

It's time to play the final card
In a game I now despise.
To me it seems so obvious-
To you it's such a big surprise.

It's already over-
If I stayed here, I'd only make you cry.
It's already over-
We can't move forward,
So let's move on...
Bye-bye.
