I wanna take a walk, rain cloud, coat on
and the wind is blowing from the south
I wanna climb a rock from bottom to top
Nothing is getting left behind

I wanna hear your voice call me call out loud
When you talk to me I'll hear you out
I wanna space it out
Too close move on out
It's all around for you to see
It's all I wanna see
But there's such a lot of baggage

You got us into this
So get us out of this
