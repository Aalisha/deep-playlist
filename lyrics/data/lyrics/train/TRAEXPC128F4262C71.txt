I'm trying to change
To make the best, for us
But I'm just the same
Same as I ever was

Oh and if you stay with me
Honestly it's what I want
But if you stay with me
I know I'll hurt you more

So won't you save,
Save yourself
By leaving me now
For someone else
If I'm crying out
Don't listen to it
It's only in my heart
Save yourself
It's only in my heart
Oh no

So tell me I'm gone
Please won't you change, my mind
...
