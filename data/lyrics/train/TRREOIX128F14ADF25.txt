Great wars have been fought
Great crusades of the 'Saved'
Have been launched
(Over You)

Their heretic searches and inquisitorial taunts
(Over You)
At least that's what was said by the ones

Over You, over You
There is nothing, there's no one
There's no other Lord over You, over You
You're the great King, the one God, the Lord of us all
There is none, there is none
Over You, over You, over You, over You

The skeptics laugh
"Faith is past, God is dead
