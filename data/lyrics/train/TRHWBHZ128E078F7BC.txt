I heard a voice and it changed my life
And now it's a brand new day,

Well, he'd travel so far
With nothing but a song and his old guitar
And a tour bus and some semi-trucks,
Thirty crew men and a little bit of luck
Well, he loves all the people, the ugly and the randy
If you don't believe me take a look at the family
And they'll tell you that it's true
When skies are gray what would Willie do?

Well, long ago when he came unto us,
His words were simple but they went right through us
And the whole world sang along,
But then they didn't want to hear his songs
