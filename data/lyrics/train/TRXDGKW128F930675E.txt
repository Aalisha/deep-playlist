A time of innocence and love
Could we go back to how it was?

I remember when life was so simple
You did or you didn't, you would or you wouldn't
But it ain't like that anymore

I remember when life was so easy
People said what they meant
They were either for it or against
But it ain't like that anymore
(Somewhere, we lost the score)

[Refrain / Chorus ]
Bring back the days of Yea and Nay
When we could plainly see the way
Then he was up to us to choose
Whether to win or lose
