One chance
For a true love
If a heart breaks,
Does it break forever?
There'll be no more,
Though you want back together

You soon will start running baby,
I know you will.
Though I've seen it coming lately,
I love you still.
How long must I keep on trying
To change your mind?
How long till there's no denying
We're out of time?

Is there really just,
One chance
At a true love
If a heart breaks,
Does it break forever?
There'll be no more,
Though you want back together.

Is there really just,
One chance
