Chicks, kicks, cats, cool, yeah school!

Yeah, yeah, yeah I go a swingin' school
Where the chicks are kicks and the cats are cool.
Well we dance the greatest and we dress the latest
Wo, wo, wo I go a swingin' school.

Ah, Bobby Ah! Uh huh! Everythings cool, thats cool
We're glad you go to a swingin' school.
