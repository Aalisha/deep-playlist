Well I know
you couldn't love me
Cause you're promised
To a wealthy man
Take a look
what are you seein'?
Should I go to see a healer

Nervous twitchin' in my hands
Nervous twitchin' in my head
God help me rid this feeling'

Cause I'm falling all to pieces
And I can't get out of bed
Beggars & hangers-on

Try to take you from me
Someone with a Bible
In his pocket
Clouding everywhere you see
...
