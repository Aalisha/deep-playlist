Tonight's the night
Stop the copies, word from the press
We're making headlines, broadcasting worldwide to anyone who cares
This night has just begun, this isn't getting any better
Face to face we meet again and I'm not masking my words to sympathize, to your needs
Your fucking masterpiece
Just look at what you've created
This is something worth writing home about

Don't hold your breath
It's too late, I'm suffocating
This isn't the first time
