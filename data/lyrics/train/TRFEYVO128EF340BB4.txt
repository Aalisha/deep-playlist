Put a noth on this belt when I leave a toll is taken
My head is traveling way too fast.
I gotta slow down for the sake of overlooking
The silent rituals need to be caressed
let me stay here and hide my eyes from the bitter world.
LORD KNOWS I'M NOT READY TO SHINE.
Let me stay here and save my breath for the coming flood.
