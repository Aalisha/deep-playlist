[Verse: Donell Jones]
(I'm looking for that special girl, that special girl)
All ya single ladies that look out for me
I'm the hottest single nigger to step on the scene
Got the east side rockin',
Got the mid west talking
Got the dirty south bouncin',
Got the west crib talking

The type a nigger that you wanna roll with baby
Dont get it twisted thinkin' i'm a sugar daddy
You can look like Halle with an ass like JLO
And a smile like Janet but thats not enough
You may think that i'm tripping take a minute and just listen
It aint all about sex 'cause I can always get that
I'm a million dollar nigger need a million dollar woman
Met this chick named Yvett and this what she said

[Verse: Yvette/Beverly]
I can give you everything you need
I can be your freak, even cook and clean
If thats all you got then you cannot get it
'coz I got a chef who can cook all my dinners
Im looking for that nigger who aint cheap,
Take me shopping every week
I play this game for ceeks

[Verse: Donell Jones]
If thats how you get down its a rap and your finnished
There aint no use in me gettin your digits
Im looking for that special girl

[Chorus: Yvette/Beverly/Donell Jones]
