I'm amazing
No compare to me
ain't no competition
I'm on fire what

And now I'm on a mission
I'm amazing
I'm amazing

I hear em looking for me

I just keep em guessing
I'm making history

I'm going down a legend
I'm amazing

I'm amazing

Bring it to the flo bring it bring it to the flo
Bring it to the flo bring it bring it to the flo
You ain't never seen no one like me (like me)

You ain't never seen no one like me
Bring it to the flo bring it bring it to the flo
Bring it to the flo bring it bring it to the flo
You ain't never seen no one like me (like me)

You ain't never seen no one like me
HAHAHA
look how I got em now
