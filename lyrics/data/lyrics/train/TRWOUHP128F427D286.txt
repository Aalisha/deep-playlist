Hey yo joe, volcano
hey baby, betray me
hey baby, you don't know
I'm no joke, we both do
(I'm wanna, I coulda, I shoulda,
I'll never be
I'm gonna, I wanna, I coulda,
you'll always be)
Walking down thisÂ ? stinking place?
I bet you're mad at me
eye on the enemy
right beside me
(so long, so long)
what good is happening?
(move in, move on)
it seems to empty
