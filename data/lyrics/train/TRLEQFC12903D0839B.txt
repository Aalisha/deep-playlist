I'll be the ticket if you're my collector
I've got the fare if you're my inspector
I'll be the luggage, if you'll be the porter
I'll be the parcel if you'll be my sorter

Just for you here's a love song
Just for you here's a love song
And it makes me glad to say
It's been a lovely day
And it's okay
...
