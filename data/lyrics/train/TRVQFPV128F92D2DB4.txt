Eternal flame

Yes
I wanna have it
Yes yes
I wanna have you now
But I can't be the lighter
I can't be the lighter

I wanna go there
Yes yes
I wanna show you how
But I can't be the lighter
I can't be the lighter

Just in case you never knew
I can't be the lighter
Of your eternal flame

Oh! Oceans, rivers, lakes
That we could swim as two
But I already own my
Own body of water
