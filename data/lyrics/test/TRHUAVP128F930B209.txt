There goes a friend of mine
He wants to be me
And then another one
Just wants to see me

And everybody else
Say that they know me
Sometimes the bottom line
Tries to control me

I can't help you
I can't save you
I can't be your
One and only friend

Someone who wants to hang
Tries to inflate me
When I don't go along
