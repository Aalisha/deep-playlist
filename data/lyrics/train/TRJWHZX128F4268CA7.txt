Yo, this what hip-hop is comin to?
You can say whatever on the mic and when?
Let me see if you can hear me now when I'm doin this

Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, E. Sermon and ("Kurtis Blow!")
Can you hear me now? Good
Can you hear me now? Good
("Turn it up!") Don't take this serious
("One, two, three four hit it!")

[Erick Sermon]
Yo check one two, mic's on
I'm well known like the Osbournes
Me - I love Kelly
See us both in the bed man, touchin bellies
This here "Pimp Juice," I got from Nelly
I got "Punk'd," show it on the telly, damn
My eyes green like Yoda, get cream like soda
Two thousand ("FOUR") means a brand new motor
Phoenix, capitol of Arizona
But that means nuttin, I'm just sayin somethin
Spare the moment them niggaz is suspect
I took a line from Keith Murray off his first cassette
I never took my dog to the vet
And I download songs off the net
