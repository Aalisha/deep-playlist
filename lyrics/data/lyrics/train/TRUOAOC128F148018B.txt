Stab a sorry heart
with your favourite finger
paint the whole world blue
and stop your tears from stinging
hear the cavemen singing
good news they're bringing
Seven seas
swimming them so well
glad to see
my face among them
kissing the tortoise shell
A longing for
some fresher feeling
belonging
or just forever kneeling
...
