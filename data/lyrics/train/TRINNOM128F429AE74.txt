I wonder if there's a life,
Between right and wrong
I wonder which side I'm on,
or if I'm strong enough
I wonder why,
They left me here for dead,
No wonder there,
Are voices in my head

Standin' at the edge of our day that's soon to come

You give a little,
And then you take so much
Caught in the middle
I guess I care too much
I guess I care too much

I wonder what's in your mind,
Behind those eyes I see
...
