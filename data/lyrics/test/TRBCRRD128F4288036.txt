i see you, 
and i`m waiting to make my move 
but i`m scared, and i know 
that u have better things to do 

I touch your hand, and i`m wearing my heart 
on my sleeve, its cleche, i know, but baby its the price we pay
to get the things that we've wanted and get the things 
we've left behind, what you wanted what you needed 
what you`ve always dreamt about. 

dont take another step, dont breath another breathe
