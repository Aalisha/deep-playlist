I'm livin' every moment
Like its my last
You could say I push too hard
But I like it fast

There ain't nothing
On what you can depend
What you call your highway
Could be your dead-end

Luck ain't got the time
To be your friend or mine
I'm doin' nothing
I'm killing time

Don't get me wrong
Don't wanna bring you down
Take or give it as it comes
...
