Yea, yea, yea, I done learn from mistakes
Like who's my men and who's not
Like who's gon' run but who's not
Like who's gonna shoot if you shot?
Who gone hold they own, who's not
Who's gone choose spots?

In the streets of New York you can't trust nobody
Niggas will run up on you wit a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free, smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here wit a body

In the streets of New York you can't trust nobody
Niggas will run up on you wit a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free, smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me, you gotta leave here wit a body

When I was 10 years old I seen a nigga take 3 in the head
Probably around the same time he used to pee in the bed
I stayed a wake 'cuz my nightmares of seein' him dead
The smell of burnt tire peelin' after leavin' him lead

The killer fled wit a fuckin' laugh
My heart pumpin' on blast, I just stared at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin', fingers shakin', spittin' up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug

There I stood stiffer than wood
See homie use to buy me candy
Now, he's gone whose provide his family?
My ear ringin' should have been runnin'

I never thought I could be that sick
Damn, I was suppose to see that shit
That's when I thought it was more than 3 shots
