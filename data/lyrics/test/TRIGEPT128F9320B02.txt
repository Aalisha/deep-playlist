You know your eyes say it's dead inside of you
Just an empty shell and faded tattoos
And everything's just a memory and every day's just the passing of time

Did you notice when the lights started to go out?
Welcome it with a smile and your arms out
And now it's all so much easier, bury yourself in banality and comfort
Never waking for a moment
