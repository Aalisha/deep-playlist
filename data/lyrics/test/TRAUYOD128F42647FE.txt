Say things to me like a cowgirl would
I'll do tricks for you like a cowboy should
You look romantic layin' in the hay
I need you tonight in a new kinda way
When you look at me with those eyes
It makes me start to fantasize

Do it to me like I know you could
So I can do it to you baby like a Texan should

Ridin' the range I think of you
