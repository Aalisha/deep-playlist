I think that I love him more than life itself
I know that I'll never find nothing close to him
Never going to stop
I'll love him till I drop

Ain't never going let him go
He drives me so crazy
I so love my baby
The way he be making me feel

I know you think I'm dead wrong
Said this should not be going on
But are you gonna stop my heart
From falling in love

Doesn't everybody wanna fall in love?
Doesn't everybody wanna need someone?
Remember when you told me
That you didn't have no one
You would've given anything to have someone
So don't hate on me cause

He's so good to me
He's so sweet to me
I know that you don't think I know I'm in love
But doesn't everyone wanna fall in love
Fall in love

You think the way Im to young
Won't give me a break
I know when you fell in love you were seventeen
I bet you didn't stop
When it was getting hard
And I know you didn't let him go
So how is this different?
And why should I listen to you
