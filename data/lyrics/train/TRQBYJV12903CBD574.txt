We could have been the best of friends.
Now I'll never see this place again.
So please, please, please, don't wait for me to try and get it together.
Please don't wait for me to reappear, cause I'm not here.
Because, I won't wait around for the grass to grow back now.
I won't wait around for your vaults to open, let me in somehow.
