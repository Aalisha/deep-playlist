She pulled out of Mobile
in the pouring rain,
Moving through the darkness
like a hurricane.
From southern New Port waters
to the Cumberland so green,
Louisville by Nashville
and all points in between.
Pounding out a rhythm
making up lost time,
Heading for that
bluegrass state of mine.

()
White smoke a rollin'
Whistle a blowin'
Listening to her engine keeping time
Kentucky borderline.
