Everything is not the same at all
Everyone is not the same as some
Wintertime is every tear
It won't do me no good
if it lasts too long

Everything is not the same as peace
Every now and then you get some war and disease
Mister Johnny Cash is gonna sing his song
He's got a voice like a grave
he'll put your mind at ease

Everytime is not the same as wrong
Just keep on asking the questions
until you find out some
Pablo Picasso put the springtime on
You got to shake your hips
until the early morn'

Guy Laroche and Yves Saint-Laurent
They're both out in the corner
