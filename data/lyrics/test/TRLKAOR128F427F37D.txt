When you got pissed the other day
I didn't mean to but I called you
By your best friends name
Well give me a break I said that I was playin'

And on your birthday Monday night
I didn't get you anything, I ran outta time
It's the thought that counts
Well that's what they say and

And I know that I passed out that night
When you got naked

But turn around
There's always something
Please calm down
And I will do anything

You've got me runnin' around
Can't get my feet on the ground
Turn around
I'll make it up to you today
