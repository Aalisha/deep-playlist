(Mike)
Down the line, comin' down the line, a V6 Merc in blue
Without the sparks or distributer cap, I'll slap them on as it rides through
8 to 4 on the assembly floor, watchin' V6 Mercs slide through
I can drive and she can drive, but this car's made for you

(Mike)
I'd like to buy her one

(rest)
where 'ya gonna get the money son

(Mike)
I'd like to buy her two

(rest)
but you'll never find the right bijou

(Mike)
I'd like to buy her three

(rest)
but you're workin' in a factory

(Mike)
And I'd like to buy her more
Than this blue collar can afford

(Mike, w/ rest doing supporting/call-back lines)
Down the line, Chipper down the line's got a cottage up on Scugogg
Last Christmas bash he spent all his cash plyin' Mr. Bewdley with eggnog
He got the raise and from what he says he'll have that love nest paid off soon
I got the keys, but my girlfriend, she's not getting off till Sunday noon

(Mike)
I'd like to buy her one

(rest)
where 'ya gonna get the money son
...
