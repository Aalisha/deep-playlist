(feat. Hell Razah)

[U-God]
Once again...

Through the storms... I gotta stay strong
Take deep breaths, hold on long, bring the harm
with no regrets, on my chest, let me knowledge be born
on levels, wild, devil copters mark my every step
When the riots form, my woman keeps me warm
>From Fort Green I sing the song mean
Bring the calm overseas, glide high in the skies
Sky dive... far... far as the eye could see
In the midst of acapell', I ball my fist up
Unravel, travellin to the cells of Gotti
I shot up a shell, will he drop? Will he flop?
Will he go pop a cell? Is his mind frail?
The worst is groove frantic, he expand the planet
Plan harder, your Godfather's plans failed
I air mail the senseless scar, two snub noses
Niggas love those expensive cars
Is it him and those twenty inch rims, splittin the tar?
An amazon woman from the stripbar
God, it varies, Halley Berry, stars eatin hard cherries
This world is bizarre, not bein far from Mars
Galaxy hoppin, non-stoppin the sun rays
Stay and paid for real, 'til I'm old and grey
Pretty legs, of course, soft as clay
Degrees, hot breeze in your hair all day, all day
Engaged a lot, rockin hot and cold chains
...
