I know you're leaving
Leaving me behind
I'm seeing you, darling
For the very last time

Show a little tenderness
Mama, before you go
Please, let me feel
Your embrace once more

Take me in your arms
Rock me, rock me a little while
Oh, with you, darling
Rock me, rock me a little while

We all must feel
Heartache sometime
Right now, right now
I'm feeling mine

I tried my best to be strong
But I'm not able
I'm like a helpless child
Left in a cradle

Before you leave me
...
