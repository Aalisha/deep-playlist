I have eyes for you to give you dirty looks
I have words that do not come from children's books
There's a trick with a knife, I'm learning to do
But everything I've got belongs to you

I've a powerful anesthesia in my fist
And the perfect wrist to give your neck a twist
Hammerlock holds, I've mastered a few
But everything I've got belongs to you
