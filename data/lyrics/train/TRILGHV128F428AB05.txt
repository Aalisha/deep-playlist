(Joe Eriksen/Dennis Caldiriola)

La... La... La...
La, la, la, la... La, la...

You... led me to love again
You..., you must have known by then
Your dream would start to take you far away from me
And love was less important than your dream
You're finally found success
I saw you even less
Those midnight calls from concert halls
Increased my loneliness

Now I'm just another face in the crowd
Calling for you to take your bow
And I'm just another face in the crowd
Crying inside, cheering out loud
For you

You..., you were the very best
...
