Aaa
Don't you see how I fight it?
Tryin' to hide from a life of real pain
Maybe time has allowed it
Feelin' the feel when I'm hearin' your name

'Cos you will decide how I survive?
Do you realize inside oh?
 (Its you who'll decide and how will I survive?)
 (When we're going to live a lie)
Just how much it's killing me

I'm just caught in the middle of you
Play my heart with a little bit of
Dangerous love
And I really want to be free, aa aa
Got me caught and I'm livin' in a low life world
It's your unoriginality that's killin' me
I've just got to be free

Now tell me what you want from me
Again and again you pretend it's alright, yea
I'm feelin' now that I can breathe
Can't comprehend how you can't recognize

'Cos time can't change the way I feel
 (Time that, time has changed)
 (Change the way I feel)
 (You will, you will find)
And you will find that I'm gonna be
 (Now that time has changed)
 (Change the way I feel)
