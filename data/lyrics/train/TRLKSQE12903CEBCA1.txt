I don't want to get back into the ring 
But I feel like these gloves are glued to my knuckles 
And every time, and every time I try to stand up for myself, yeah, yeah 
I start to feel, I feel my knees start to buckle, buckle, yeah, YEAH! 

One too many blows to the head 
Left me for dead, but still I fight on 
One too many blows to the head 
Left me for dead, but still I fight on 

And as I step, and as I step, and as I step, and as I step
And as I step, and as I step, step, step into the ring 
I see my opponent, he is 10 feet tall and 500 pounds
Yeah, this is getting kind of frightening
