Mary, have you seen better days?
And will you find different ways?
And does he really mean that much to your heart?
Carry, all of the weight you can, find another man
And lead him directly there to the source
You've got to chart his course

'Cause it is only in your heart
This thing that makes you want to
Start it all again
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

Wake up from an elusive dream
You've got to change the scene
...
