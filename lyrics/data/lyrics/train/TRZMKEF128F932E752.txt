Well the party started early bout a quarter till three
Just a few close friends and my baby and me
We just got started when somebody asked
How long you think this party's goin' to last

We said all night long all night long
We'll be rockin' we'll be rollin' goin' to boogie woogie all night long

Well the next door neighbors started raisin' a fuss
Said you had a party and didn't call us
I said put on your dancin' shoes and come along
