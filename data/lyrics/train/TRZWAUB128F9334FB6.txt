Did I, did I, did I?
Did I, did I, did I feel this way back then?

Did you wake up to the sound of pouring rain?
Fadin' days of blue rush past your eyes
Would you lose yourself in someone else's vain?
Or should you shout your mind out when the loss began?

Bring it on

High until you washed it all away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, yeah, yeah, it's all the same
I realized it through this song, I sing out loud and call your name
Do you feel I'm only someone you could never ever know?
In it all you'll find, you see, you're not that far from me
So walk and hold your head up high, a stone's throw away

I feel right now like I felt way back then
The center of my life, I lost it all
Never ever knew how much I'd loved, until you left, you're gone
...
