Turn right:
too much doubt

Turn left:
too much rival

Keep moving straight ahead -
onwards, forwards,
and relax.

Concentrate your energy,
expect the worst calamity,
brace yourself for misery,
then you'll stand it best.

Concentrate your energy,
expect the worst calamity,
brace yourself for misery,
then you'll stand it best.
