Oh what I wouldn't give to see you once again
Oh what I wouldn't give to see you once again

Folks will see me walking
They will know I've cried
it's crazy but I don't mind
At least I won't have lied

They will say I'm crazy
But say I didn't try
But all I really want right know
is to keep you in my life
