They say we look pretty good together,
Well, don't you wanna find out, don't you wanna find out,
I know you think you're oh so clever,
Well, soon you're gonna find out, soon you're gonna find out.

That when the sun comes up, there'll be nothing wrong,
Coz' I will be away from you,
When the sun comes up there'll be nothing wrong,
Coz' I will be away from you.
