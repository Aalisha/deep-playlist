Please don’t fall,
On me Oh Lord,
In a fist of fire, ash and stone.
As the whole world sleeps,
On gold & silver sheets,
I’m picking up my bombs to make it known.

To anyone who stands,
Ten times taller than a man,
With winter teeth and snarl that block the road.
Soon you’re going to fall,
By the hands of big and small,
We’ll sing it loud,
And you will know.
