I heard that you were home again,
but you don't look like you're back to me
with your focuses changing,
your gaze is transfixed
a point that i can't often see

you've got your new ties,
I've got my old knots,
you've got your inside lines
but you're never happy with what you've got

careful now
you're so beautiful
when you've convinced yourself
that no one else is quite as beautiful

I heard that you were living well,
but you don't look like you're living to me
though the sparkle is gone,
your smile is in place
so that everyone watching can see
you've got them all convinced
...
