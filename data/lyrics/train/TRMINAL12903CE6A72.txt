You speak to me
And in your words I hear a melody
But in the twilight it's so hard to see
Whats wrong for me

I can't resist
Until you give the truth a little twist
As if your gonna get away with this
You're not sorry

I can't believe I fell for this
I fell through the hole

Down at the bottom of your soul
Didn't think you could go so low
Look at what you've done
Your losing me is what you've won
