Just as fast as you found
The waves have crashed down around me
I'm still searching but out of place
I need your help, I need your grace

When will this battle end
Or does it ever end at all?

And we fear what we can't seem to understand
We believe what we allow ourselves, our selfish lies in the end
We believe what we allow ourselves, our selfish lies in the end

But is this the end
I feel like the word is getting the best of me
