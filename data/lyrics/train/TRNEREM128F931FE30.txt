Our day together's so enlightening
My life needs some brightening
Some people can make me fight
You pick me up and put me on like a tie

It's all so good today
It's all so sweet today

And when we laugh, we laugh at the same time
I think now we get it, we get it
If we could always be together, it would be so sublime
