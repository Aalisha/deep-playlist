You could come back crawling on your knees
Practice every sentence with, a pretty pretty please
It's nothing to put my mind at ease
So just go run back, whining to your shrink

Cause I see
Through your smoke screen
And I see, the reality
And I know, the distance that will grow
Wider than you will ever know
