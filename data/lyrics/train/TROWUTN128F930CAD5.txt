I heard opposites attract
So you're stuck with me
I'm like Jack Kerouac, on the road for weeks
But when I come home you'll be there for me right?
Without you, I'll never make it
I got a sick sense that I got a reason to worry
And sometimes I'm dense but these thoughts come in a flurry
You say they're nonsense but I dreamt you left in a hurry
I don't think I'll ever make it alone

Annihilate
I'm wide awake
Don't walk away
I'm suffocating

(Chorus)
Don't change your mind
Cause you'd be killing me
Hitting at an all time low
