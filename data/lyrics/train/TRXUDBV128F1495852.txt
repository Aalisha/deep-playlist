[Intro]
I got something to tell everybody out there
Sometimes you may feel like life have you in bondage
You don't know which way to turn
And you just feel like deep down inside
God, you have to help me
But take it from me, someday
It may not be your day or the day that you want it to happen
But someday we'll all be free
I got a message to tell y'all
I want y'all to listen to me
