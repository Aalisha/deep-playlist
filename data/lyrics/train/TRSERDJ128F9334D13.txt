Step into this picture, release all your light
I think God has gone mad here tonight
You can't believe your eyes, control is so hard to keep
Obsession can be hell from which you'll never be free
It's all for the taking, here tonight

Rip out your heart
I'll tear it apart
Throw it to the ground
All fall down

Where good girls go to die, that's where I'll be
...
