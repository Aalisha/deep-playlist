Ramblin', where to begin?
I taste the summer on your peppery skin
Been saved, the warmer the waves
I felt us slip into a watery grave

My girl, linen and curls
Lips parting like a flag will unfurl
She's grand, the bend of her hand
Digging deep into the sweep of the sand

And summer arrives
With a length of lights
...
