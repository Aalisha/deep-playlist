I used to play around with hearts
That hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl
I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
[(Oh oh, poor little fool)(I was a fool, oh yeah)]

She played around and teased me
With her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me
But her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
