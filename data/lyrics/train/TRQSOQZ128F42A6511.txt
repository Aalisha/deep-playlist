He needs – needs somebody to love
Sent from heaven above
He's searching for that perfect situation
Perfect love
He needs somebody to love (somebody to love)

Sent from heaven above
He's searching for that perfect situation
Perfect love
First Time you saw him in a club

You thought that it was love
But that was not enough, you had to get too serious
There's others in the game
But your heart remains the same
But you're rolling with the love
And you can't get enough
So watch what you're wishing for
He needs – needs somebody to love

Sent from heaven above
He's searching for that perfect situation
Perfect love
He needs somebody to love (somebody to love)
Sent from heaven above
