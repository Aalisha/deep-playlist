Abolish government, it's nothing to me
Forget about god, He's not here to see
We live by a system a perfect mold
People perfect people who are poor and old

Lives were spent on the ladder of success
Working for nothing in this, in this worthless mess
Presidents a name, presidents a label
Highest man on the government table

America, land of the free
Free to the power of the people in uniform

People are so blind they just can't see
Send your son to boot-camp, send him off to war
