Let's save the women,
But let's save the children first
Let's act like real men, for once in our lives
We're going down straight to the ocean floor,
To join the rest who have gone on before
Don't be scared...

Captain,
Did you feel the water rise?
Did you feel the water rise?
It's all around you now
(Do you know where you're going?
Do you know where you're going?
Do you know where you're going when you die?)
[x2]

Don't forget to say goodbye [x4]
Don't forget, don't forget.
