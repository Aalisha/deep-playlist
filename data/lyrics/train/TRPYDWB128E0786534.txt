If you only once would let me
Only just one time
Then be happy with the consequence
With whatever's gonna happen tonight

Don't think we're not serious
When's it ever not?
The love we make is give and it's take
I'm game to play along

All I can say
I shouldn't say

Can we take a ride?
Get out of this place while we still have time
