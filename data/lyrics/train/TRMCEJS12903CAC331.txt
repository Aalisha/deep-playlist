I'm on the top of the world,
I can see it all around me,
Such beautiful words,
"Leaving" and "Oceans"

Ooh, Ooh
I can feel it,
I've never felt this before...
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Got a beautiful woman,
We're coming off of hard and harder times.
Gonna be starting something,
That gets us, straight up out of here...

Ooh, Ooh
I can fix it, let me take us away
Ooh, yeah
We'll Leave at night, new state by day.

Say you're with me,
There's gold ahead, there's golden dreams
In life's hills and valleys,
Yeah will you hold on with me
...
