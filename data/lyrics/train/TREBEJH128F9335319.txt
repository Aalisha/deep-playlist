Why don't you talk to me?
im standin here alone
i know youll never phone

Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to me?
come say it to my face
so we can leave this place
Why don't you talk to me?

what your thinkin i would never know
nows the time for you to let it go
let it be and hold you tight
scream at me for just one night

Why don't you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to me?
come on and dig your horns
instead of dirty looks
Why don't you talk to me?
