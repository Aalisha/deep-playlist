Lover you've gone from me and left behind
So many memories

Here's your old friendship ring
I can't wear it no more
Here's your old love letters
I can't read 'em anymore

Lover you've gone from me and left behind
So many memories

Here's that old Teddy Bear (come and get 'em)
That you won for me at the State Fair
Here's some old Valentine cards (come and get 'em)
Give them to your new sweetheart
