I'm watching your shadow cut by the moon
Peacefull I wait for the dawn

These moments in silence are all that I need
The softness of hearing you breathe

And I know it doesn't get better than this
Funny it starts with just one little kiss

Baby all I know you're no longer alone
We've started a home of our own love
All my love is yours, you're no longer alone
...
