You want it all
You want it cheap
You want some peace
So you can sleep

You want somebody to care
You want somebody to know
You wanna live the lie
The lie that's in your head.

(It's so easy)
You want it easy
(When you're gone)
Easier said than done
(It's so easy)
You want it easy
It gets easy when you're gone

You want some money to spend
You want somebody to share
You want somebody to see
...
