Oh, oh, op-bo, bo, bo-bo-bo!
oh, oh, op-bo, bo, bo-bo-bo!

Yes, me friend, me friend,
them set me free again
yes, me friend, me friend,
me deh 'pon street again
The bars could not hold me
force could not control me now

They try to keep me down,
but god put me around
Yes, i've been accused,
wrongly abused, now
but through the powers of the most-'igh,
they've got to turn me loose... mm!

Don't try to cold me up 
...
