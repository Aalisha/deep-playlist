Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My laser's trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected, electric spy
I'm protective, electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
