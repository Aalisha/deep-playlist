This song it was written down
In a pea green windowless room
Four o'clock and the TV's dead
Wired up with nothin' to do
I drunk all my whiskey I smoked all my beer
I'm already gone I just got here
An old hairy ass hillbilly
Still up and hangin' on

Made me think of a Similar time
In the Tropicannibal motel
Takin' showers 'bout every hour
'Cause I wasn't really feelin' well
Well in walked the Alabama Leanin' Man
His ol' buddy Billy Swann
