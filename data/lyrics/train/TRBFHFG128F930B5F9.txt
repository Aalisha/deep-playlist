It was on one bright March morning
I bid New Orleans adieu.
And I took the road to Jackson town,
My fortune to renew,
I cursed all foreign money,

Which filled my heart with longing for
The lakes of Pontchartrain.

I stepped on board a railroad car,
Beneath the morning sun,
I road the roads till evening,
And I laid me down again,
All strangers there no friends to me,
Till a dark girl towards me came,
And I fell in love with a Creole girl,
By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
