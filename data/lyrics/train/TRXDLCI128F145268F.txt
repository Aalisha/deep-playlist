Look Jav, I Can tell something is going on with you. You seem like you have things on your mind like you distracted.(Man how did i get into this) We've always been honest with eachother,(i didn't do a thing) So if your heart isn't in this anymore just let me know,(damn) Don't let me here about what you've been doin from somebody else(what was i supposed to do)...

[Verse 1:]
YouÂ ? hear something
Cuz she took me down,
Right on the ground
She's supposed to be my girl's friend
If she only knew, what she's doin
I told her that she needs to leave
Because this could, get risky
She wasn't tryin to here me
She took off them clothes
So here we go...

[chorus:]
You know we shouldn't be
Doin this kinda thing
I love my baby
And she loves me
Over this tempting love
Just can't get caught up
Indecent Proposal
Indecent babe,
Indecent babe,
If you were in my shoes
Tell me what would you do
Your woman's at the crib
