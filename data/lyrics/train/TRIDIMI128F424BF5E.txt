How did Camus really die that night?
Were they right?
When he died was it really his time?
Or was it suicide?

And Holden Caulfield is a friend of mine
We go drinking from time to time
And I find
It gets harder every time

Three went down but only two of them come up again
The minimal is criminal but less is a sin
Though three went down but only two of them come up again
I'm not going to play if there ain't no way I'll win

Hemingway never seemed to mind
The banality of a normal life
And I find
It gets harder every time
