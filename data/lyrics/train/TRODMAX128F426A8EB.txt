Lying on the floor, I feel nothing
Trying to remember
Everything is a haze, yesterday is gone
Feels like I've been hypnotized

Will this be the last time?
I wonder will I ever learn?
Still searching for the rhyme
Maybe now it's time for me to turn

I rise, I fall
I always stand before I crawl
I smile, I rule
But who am I really trying to fool?

I'm on the spire
Reaching up to the sky, high above
I'm on the spire
And it's on fire, I'm going down below
