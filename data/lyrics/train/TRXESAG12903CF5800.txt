The truth is subjective
And the court has lost perspective
And what is your objection here?
Fear's only fear if that's what you call it
But what do you call it if you cannot speak?
Fear isn't real unless you invoke it
So how can you blame it if you don't believe?
Why won't you believe?

You liar you thief
What you did to that priest
You're wild and you're reckless
You've cursed the queen's necklace
You've connived and deceived
And you've learned how to read
You've made the men wary
And say you won't marry
