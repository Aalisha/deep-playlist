God, takes real good care of me! Every day is good as I can see!
I serve him with gladness, I have no regrets, for he walks beside me-
Why should I worry? Why should I fret?
Faith to strengthen every day- his guiding light, each step along the way-
his goodness and his mercy every day is mine- and I can call on Jesus, any time-
See, God takes good care of me!
Gaithers: God takes good care of me...
