Crossroads and given the option
To pass and look back at goals I've missed
Rainbows or burning bridges
If you squint a little more it looks the same

But ooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of me inside you
Gathering what you've lost
But oooooooooooooooooooooooooh
There's a little bit of you in everyone
Can never keep a secret
