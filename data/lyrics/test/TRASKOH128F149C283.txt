So you just keep on drinking
And you try to forget
How they strung up Joe Byrne
To the jailhouse door
Like a marionette

He was dead for two days
I'll tell you no lies
With the press still around him
Making their money
Shooting postcards of him through the flies

Close your eyes Kate
I'll sing you to sleep
Close your eyes, your dreams will be sweet
Kate Kelly, Kate Kelly
I'm gonna sing you to sleep

Ned rose up through the mist
Man made of iron
Fighting his way to the smouldering inn
...
