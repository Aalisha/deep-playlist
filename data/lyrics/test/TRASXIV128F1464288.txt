la la la la la la
whooooooooo

from coast to coast
from sea to sea
from ghetto to ghetto, yeaaah
from street to street

la la la la la la la la

from the 310, 323's, 213's
you want me, you find me
my mind be, unlike these MC's
compton is back, we ridin with long beach
where the _________

full of alcohol and the _______________
sexier than j kwon on my side
hope the pair of ______ for they life
oh no, it aint no love blood
got the raider b&e and some gloves cuz
_______ on the one ten
with the gun under the hood, ill run again

while they out smokin anf drankin all your liquor
im on the grind and my rhymes are gettin slicker
while people think that this game gone last forever
my people throw me green pain in every letter
la la la la la la la la
and thats whats im gonna do
