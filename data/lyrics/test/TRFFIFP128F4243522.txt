The future age
cast asleep but the film remains
this aftertaste
all I want is that which I gave
master / slave
I burn fast on sinking ships
and I can talk
I place pride on tick and tock
this lonely silent shrine to dawn (lonely silence ran 'till dawn?)
rite of passage open doors
but I'm not frightened
master / slave
line and sinker take the bait
where others float
you and I crash land
where others float
you and I crash land
