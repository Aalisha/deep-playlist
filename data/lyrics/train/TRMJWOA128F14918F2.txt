There's a danger of getting so close to you.
There comes a time, when the walls fade away,
And when love turns to bitter blue,
Sometimes it feels like it's hard to stay.

Last night we went to bed angry,
We didn't mean what we said.
Seems we never get past forgiveness,
We try to hide, we never learn,
To swallow our pride.

On the downside of love,
Where the love turns to hate, we just can't relate.
On the downside of love,
When you're misunderstood, 'cause when it hurts you.
It hurts you so good.

Baby life has no guarantee,
Never knowing where love's gonna lead.
