Frozen forgetful again
The part where I lose my head
The scene where I'm supposed to speak but instead
I sit and listen again, I'm stuck with these cards I guess

Leaping from this cliff in my thoughts
I fly like the stones in my heart
Drowning in doubt for what reason
I sit so patiently
Drenched in what you want me to be
I can't escape
