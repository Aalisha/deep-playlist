There's no reason, there's no compromise
Changing seasons, living the high life
I don't know you, so don't freak on me
I can't control you, you're not my destiny

Straight out of line
I can't find a reason, why I should justify my ways
Straight out of line
I don't need a reason, you don't need to lie to me
