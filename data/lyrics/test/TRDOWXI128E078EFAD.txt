On a perfect day
I know that I can count on you
When that's not possible
Tell me, can you weather the storm?

'Cause I need somebody who'll stand by me
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there

Sunny days
(Everybody loves them)
(Tell me)
Can you stand the rain?
(No, no)
Storms will come
(This we know, for sure)
(This we know, for sure)
Can you stand the rain?

Your love, unconditional
I'm not asking this of you
Got to make it last
