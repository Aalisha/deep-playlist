That's it baby
YES!
I'mma do some new shit, some new new shit off the new album
Never been done before

I'mma do it
Long Beach
Flip that, flip that

Involve etiquette medicine freeze
Mother is a pill still fresh from debris
Some fire chance fire Manson degrees
And yes I am still
Watchin' it
Look liver spots on a 30 year face
Dirty ear wax luggin' systems around
Illegitimate tax on my cigarette packs
Need another eighth coulda built some more jail
Pale in comparison the ford ______?
Prices like his we could read before sleep
Cheap sucker Schwinn with banana bike seat
Golden arch falling on my card charge fee
Hard wheat harvest for the rain that we need
Speedy recover like a pied in cocoon
Got it in tune slightly high middle C
But it'll be another month before I bark at the moon

Sex backwards, piss for past tense
Hands for scandals
City now, ready how, steady some risk
Every out fits, it's allowed this

Don't interrupt interact
Or play with matches memories some of us never catch
