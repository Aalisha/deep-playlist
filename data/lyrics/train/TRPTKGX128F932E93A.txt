Jeanie has a dad that might as well be dead.
A case of day habit every other kids.
She's a much more beautiful person
Then you'll ever know.
She hates the world
At least the one outside.
She's a Myspace kid livin a virtual life.
She's a much more beautiful person
Than she'll ever know.

[CHORUS]
Close your eyes and the time tick by.
In this life, it's OK to cry, sometimes.
It can be hard to see what's right in front of you.
You're gonna smile sometimes,
...
