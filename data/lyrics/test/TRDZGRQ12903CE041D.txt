What will you do if you're left on your own
What will you do when there's no one at home?

What will you do when I'm gone
What will you say when you're out with our friends
Will you just play them along
And say it was better we quit in the end

What will you do with the life that we made
What will you say
What will you say as the memory fades.
What will you do when I'm gone
...
