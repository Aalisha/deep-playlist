Turn on my V.C.R., same one I've had for years
James Brown on the T. A. M. I. show, same tape I've had for years
I sit in my old car, same one I've had for years
Old battery's running down, it ran for years and years
Turn on the radio, the static hurts my ears
Tell me where would I go, I ain't been out in years
Turn on the stereo, it's played for years and years
An Otis Redding song, it's all I own
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
When the world is running down
You make the best of what's still around
