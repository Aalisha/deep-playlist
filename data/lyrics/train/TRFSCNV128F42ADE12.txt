Well come on
All you people
The time has come to get together
You gotta have a little rock 'n' roll music
To get you through the stormy weather
And do whatever you feel
when you let go
Nothin's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll

So come on, put you hands together
You know it's now or never
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll
