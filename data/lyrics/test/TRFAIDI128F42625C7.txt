Ha haa uh
Hmm mmm
Y'all gon feel this one this one to my ladies
Uh here we go y'all
(Hey little Lady please tell me yo name)
Yeah, wassup girl, how u feelin' oh me, I'm alright
See, I been watching you for a while now
I feel like we should take it to the next level

See you over there with ya girls chillin', caught my attention
I was hangin' with my fellas
That's when I wanted to approach you get to know you
Baby can I get cha number, catch a readin'
G-String on yo hip
Lookin' sexy wit' cha belly ring
So, I walked over
Stepped to you
Played it cool and asked
"Do you have a boyfriend?"

Hey little lady, please tell me ya name
Hey little lady do you have a boyfriend?
Hey little lady can I get to know you
Can I call you on ya cellphone
Can you be my girlfriend?

Hey little lady, please tell me ya name
Hey little lady do you have a boyfriend?
Hey little lady can I get to know you
Can I call you on ya cellphone
Can you be my girlfriend?

Hey lady, so nice to meet you
Tell me something about you
Is ya mom's cool?
Will she let me go with you
