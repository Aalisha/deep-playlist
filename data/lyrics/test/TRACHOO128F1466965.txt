I'll throw my stone life...
These days I feel I've been left high and dry
In a land where the sea don't touch the sky
Where no moon
Bring no tide
Where no sail
Can arrive
For no ship can return her into mine
I hope that where I'm going won't be long
Because my heart has sunk
Into a sea of black
Because the end has come
And now the end has sunk
Into the sea of black
So deep and slow
I'll throw my stone life...
...
