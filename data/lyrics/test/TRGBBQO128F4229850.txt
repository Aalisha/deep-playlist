I only watched her walk but she saw it
I only heard her talk but she saw it
I only touched her lips but she saw it
I only kissed her lips but she saw it

Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight

She only blinked her eyes but I saw it
She only swung her hair but I saw it
She only shook her hips but I saw it
