Yes a him name the boss of crime
mr. don vito eh i
nobody ever yet cross him line
something might reach you
Throw a dollar to the shoe shine boy
and say he's a goodfellow
silk ties and designer shirts
all buttons to the collar
limousines, lots of greens
for him and his harlot queen
sub-machines the order of his day
Because he's caught up in a family business
living the life of a ganster yeah
caught up in a family business
...
