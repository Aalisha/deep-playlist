Oh, they say that into each lie
Some rain must blow
And the tears as only rain
To make love blow
But I've been crying, uh, for days
And all I've got to show for it
It's a swooned face
Tears can help me fun
Answers to the problems you left behind
Honey
Tears can help me high
This emptiness that I'm feeling sad
Only your love can save me
Where are you, baby?
I'm lonely for you, baby
I'm so lonely for you
