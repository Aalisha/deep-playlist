I know enough now
To judge you somehow
A first impression that always leaves me 2nd guessing
I'm not the kind of guy
Screw hello, you had me at goodbye

So you think you had the right to tell me what to do
I didn't see you crying after you said we were thru
I don't wanna go
But after all it's what she said
Why do you keep playing these games with my head?

Turn around, walk away
Make is easier
No one's forcing you to stay
Make it easier
You stole my past
