This is how we party
Foolin' with your body
C'mon, everybody
Can't get enough of you

Here we are, back in the game
Raise your hands and feel the rain
Got one thing you've got to try
Making many money, making big boys cry
Too bad that he's a liar
She's so cool, but her hair's on fire
Let me go; make me feel strong
We've got to set it off till the break of dawn
