I know you will let me down
Everytime you come around
I still feel I'm on my own. yeah

you're leaving my heart bruised
you're the stone in my shoe
and I can't seem to move on, no

Im heading straight for a fall
It's a worn out illusion that's all

It's all a joke to you
You're not good for me
You don't know what you do
Scratching the core of me
You're back, and you get me off track
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
It's all joke to you.

Now who's keeping the score
when you're asking me for more
