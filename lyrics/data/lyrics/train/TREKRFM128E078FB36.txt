My crew (4X)

[Cheeks]
Yo yo now now now now

When I wake up before I gather up my pens
I shine up my fronts I give a Dutch for all my mens
throw on some Marvin Gaye
I smoke my weed and clean my kitchen dishes
Tec to the sky see how mom's is always bitchin'
I'm done buffin' got my cheese my pen & paper
it's time for me here to prepare my caper
I written it down the line & now a ring is on my phone
it's my nigga Spigg Nice he tellin' me he in the zone
Yo I got the liquor the grain fool let's make a tape
I'm caught up in my own zone can't really escape
I ran it down the line as Easy Mo played the song
He checked my five he said to me yo later on
about an hour passes
about my loosey deuce deuce & my tinted glasses
I got the bike that I copped from my younger cousin
cause that cat is up in class like a nickel & he wasn't
I'm concentratin' on these moves that I'ma soon be makin'
and once I break then I'ma show my peeps that I'm not fakin'
See my man Pop or Die from the block
niggas wearin'? reverse as we handle barred it to the block
See certain situations happen
when you caught up in the 'hood in the game of rappin'
You see scrappin' now leads to cappin'
we used to have each other's back
what the fuck happened? Stupid
Yo fuck it
Anyway Mary? Easter? record store
walked to the back now let me get a four
Exit from the spot everybody know what's hot
you get yours on & soon as you see 'em
the thieves turn the block
Jump on them right now when niggas chillin'
if you ever sported it you know how I'm feelin'
Cracked open my St. Ides took a squig
