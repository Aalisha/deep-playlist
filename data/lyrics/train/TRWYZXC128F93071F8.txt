Yah...
Don't stop now...
We done did it again...
I see you there from time to time...
I know whatchu lookin for...
I can give it to you...
Go on do your thing...

(chorus)
Go on do your thing mama
Just enjoy yourself
You aint gotta be all by yourself
Your not lookin for a man
You want a special friend
To lend a helpin hand tonight
Go on do your thing...

Baby your sure comin on strong
But aint nothin wrong
With going after whatchu want
How that you've been workin all week
Now your workin on me, feelin on me, buying me drinks
And your tellin me...

(female chorus)
I'm not a ho
Cause I slept with someone
So I'm not a trick
If I want a lil dick

I'm not tryin ta judge ya
...
