Back in the day when nothing really mattered to me,
I only saw with my eyes, what they wanted to see.
And everything around me seemed to never change.
I'm looking for an easy way out, someone to blame.
Why does it work this way still today?
We wanna take somebody down along the way?
But I won't let that one be me,
'cause I don't want the drama it brings.
See today isn't "back in the day" anymore.
I know a little more than I did before.
So don't forget before you start bringing me down,
what goes around always comes back around!

(Chorus)
You can't bring me down! Can you hear what I'm trying to say?
You can't bring me down! I'll never turn the other way!
