My subject matter and context are blessed
Vocal inflection connects, it's a slugfest
Ladies approach to hear quotes from the spokesman
Thoughts are like oceans for my lyrics to float in
I'm absolutely astute so salute
You try to be cute, and you get tossed like a crap shoot
Don't misinterpret or slander
Just get with the words and the way I command ya
Cause you're in the right place, and luckily it's the right time
And since I'm inclined, I'll kick precisely the right rhymes

(Premier cuts and scratches "to kick the right rhyme")
