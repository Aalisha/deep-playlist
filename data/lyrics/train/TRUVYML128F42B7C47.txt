Knifing my way through a diamond mine
Dragging those rocks
From seabed to shoreline
Rubies and sapphires from Emerald bay
Stretching across the milky way
One day... one day...
Prospecting gold and staking my claim
But the only thing I treasure
Is hearing your name
Most everyone dreams diamonds and furs
I dream of love and baby it's yours
One day... one day...
One day you'll realise
You'll see it on her eyes
No room for alibis - one day... one day...
...
