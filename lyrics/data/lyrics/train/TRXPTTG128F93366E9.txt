Don't count your chickens
'Cause they're never gonna hatch
You can't catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack
'Cause you're too dull, baby
You can't see the wood for the trees
'Cause you're too slow, baby
You just couldn't get off your knees

Don't count your chickens
'Cause they're never gonna hatch
You can't catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack
'Cause you're too dull, baby
You can't see the wood for the trees
'Cause you're too slow, baby
You just couldn't get off your knees

I can see the love and the hate in your eyes
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise
What you gonna do and what you gonna say?
I'm not the only one believing there's an easier way

It doesn't pay to disorientate me
It doesn't cost to be someone
