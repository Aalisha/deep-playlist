(Rebecca Lynn Howard/Trey Bruce)

I don't have to turn the head of everyone I see
I don't have to live inside a mirror
I don't get upset and freak
Or let it bother me
If I don't walk and look just like a picture
When you tell me that you love me
You make me feel pretty

Extraordinary or just forgettable
Very ordinary or irresistible
