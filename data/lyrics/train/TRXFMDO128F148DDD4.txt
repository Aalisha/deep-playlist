Oh yeh yeh, oh oh, hey

There's a place I've never been
A place I long to be
Will I reach? I just don't know
Still I hope one day I'll go, hey

My wish just never seems to come, yeh
I know for certain you're the one, yeh
So close I get, still no cigar
Carrying my wounded heart, yeh

I can't stop the river from running, I can't, I can't
I can't stop the rain from falling down on me, oh no no
I know I'm not what you want
I'm hoping in time you'll see how
...
