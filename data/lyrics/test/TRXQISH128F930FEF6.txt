Nobody else can see you the same way as myself
Fly high and touch the sky, you're the angel I adore
If only you could feel for me that I feel for you
Why do you ignore me, angel, why can't I go with you?

You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch
You're an angel witch, you're an angel witch

The more love I feel for you, the more you fade away
Why can't you come and love me, do I have to stay this way?
I'm going to go insane if nothing happens soon
I look out at the night to see your shadow by the moon
