It's the second time around for you and I girl
And believe me woman it's confusing me
I'm afraid to say let's make up and all's forgiven
But something tells me I'm heading for heartbreak
So lady please I'm praying that
This time will be different
That you and I can share the same that I visualize

Are you really ready for love girl, or is
It just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love girl or is
...
