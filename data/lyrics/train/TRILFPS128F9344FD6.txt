After bombs are dropped to kill
After all the buildings fall
At the time we'll have the will
To climb up from beneath it all
We'll find the strength to live
To rebuild something new
If there's anything forgive
What else can we do

I don't wanna fight your war
I don't wanna play your games
Better pray for world war four
Better hope for something more
