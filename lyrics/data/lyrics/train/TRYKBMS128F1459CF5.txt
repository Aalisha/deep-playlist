Can't remember my first mem'ry of you you were always there
And now I know I never knew you well
But I was just a kid and you were always there
To pick me up everytime I fell.

And you always warmed a blanket to wrap around my feet
When you tucked me into bed to say my prayers
And I'll bet I never thanked you among all the other things
That I took for granted cause you were always there.
