On the last breeze of summer as the dusk comes down
I'm sittin on my roof and checkin' for the clan
a whistle from the street look down upon Mr C
He says he's bound West accompained by me
I tell him I'm static and I'll see yer later
He's on his way an urban navigator
Night starts droppin' but I don't see no stars
Moon lives on a promise and the smell of the cars
Listen for the silence but i just hear a noise
follow the darkness deppe into the night
but not a man can see so i snatch a funky flight
like the autumn lraves directed by the wind
fallen from tree so it must have meant i sinned
