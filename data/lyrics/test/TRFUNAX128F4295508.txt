You're baby blue eyes that you promised tonight have got me in a mess
Why don't you do right and quit try to fight everytime we get this stress
Your sugar daddy and your money well ain't gonna treat you right
You better do something baby whether wrong or right
Oh baby tonight's the night

They say that love is a wonderfull game and it happens everyday
Oh why oh why did you pick on me and make things happen this way
