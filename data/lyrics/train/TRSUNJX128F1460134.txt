Everyday, everyday, it's a gettin' closer
Goin' faster than a roller coaster
Love like yours will surely come my way
(Hey, hey, hey)

Everyday, it's a gettin' faster
Everyone says go ahead and ask her
Love like yours will surely come my way
(Hey, hey, hey)

Everyday seems a little longer
Every way, love's a little stronger
