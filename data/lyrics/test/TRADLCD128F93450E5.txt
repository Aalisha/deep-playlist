You can get them in the cd jacket.but if you don't have them here they are.
The other day I saw your photograph
looking into me
don't wanna think about it
try to forget about it
but it never goes away
the other day I thought I saw you
in our favorite pplace
i had to get away
I wanted to run away
everywhere I see your face
