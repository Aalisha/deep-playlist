You are my window
You cast my shadow
All in the light is you
All I ever saw in the love light was you
All I knew
You are my marrow
You cast my sorrow
You feel the world for me
You are what the world isn't feeling for me
And the key
Here with me
And the world is black but I can't see my window
You are my prism
You are my reason
You're what I want to be
You are everything that I want you to be
