Oh yeah
You wanna find it
C'mon yeah

I'm on a plane
With cocaine
And yes I'm all lit up again
Cough up love
And touch up
Your mama said packing lines is sin

And yes I'm all lit up again
On the couch, in my bed
And yes I'm all lit up again
Flyin' on

I love the cocaine
I love the cocaine
Mama can't you wait yeah!
