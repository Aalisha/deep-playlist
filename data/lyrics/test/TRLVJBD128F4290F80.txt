A child's mind is easily inspired, violence fuels the fire
Video games and chaotic scenes, are what they see, act out violently
Absorbing what they view, repeating words we say
In a culture of profanity, ignorance starts at a young age
Throughout history, bloodshed would always be
No way to stop the conflicts fought, we have destructive genes
Entrenched in our anatomy, from genetically enhanced apes
Planted by beings from space, a loathing hate we can't delete
