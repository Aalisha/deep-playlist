In their eyes is a place that you finally discovered
That you love each year, you've got to stay
On this bottom of the rock, an island
On which you find the love within you twitch
You feel that itch in your petticoat
Your pretty, pretty, petticoat

Then you smiled, he got wild
You didn't understand
That there's money to be made
Beauty is a card that must get played
By organization

But ooh la, she was such a good girl to me
And ooh la, the world just chewed her up, and spat her out
...
