There is, there is
There is, there is

There is the time
There is the place
There is the time
There is the face

There is the hand
There is the touch
There is the love
I need so much

Oh, girl, why won't you let me love you
And let your troubled heart be free
Take heed to all my goodness
Take a hold and follow me
Now listen, baby

There is today (yeah, yeah)
I am the road, I am the way (oh)
I'll fight your fears down
Through the years (uh huh)
Believe me, believe me, baby

Girl, why won't you let me love you
(What does it take to make you see)
(You got to see, baby)
