One more man eater
but perpetrate like your sweeter
But I'm hip to the game, I know your nothing but a cheater
Always trying to game on my wallet
Fuck you or love you, how should I call it?
And its true, all you say is do
for you. and If you got a kid I guess I gotta do them too
Wrong, aint no rings on your finger
You've mistaked Eiht as some punk love singer
Saying your down with me, and only me
but I'm hearing your fucking the neighbourhood G. Little Skee
Ain't nuthin popping
No snaps get spent until the panties start dropping
I guess a hoe is a hoe
but for you to gank me? Bitch, Eiht don't think so
Your nothing but a user
raised in the Compton streets girl you's a... bitch
