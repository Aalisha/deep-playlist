(I've been workin' so hard, baby,
Tryin' to get to you.
I'm gonna be there soon,
Because...)

In the heat of the day,
Many miles away
When the sun is beating down
Upon the main street,
I'll be waitin' here at the station,
I gotta move down the line.

They'll be dancin' and singin'
And doin' their thing,
And they'll be rockin' and rollin'
Until the day is done.
You know, I've got to
