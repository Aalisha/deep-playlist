You've got my mind spinning like crazy
I'm in a dirty mood and I can't change it
Let's take a chance we wont break it
Boy
Hey now you have got me feeling
Crazy in love I can't believe it
Is this re-e-al or am I dreaming
Boy

You got my world spinning round n' round
I'm ready to give myself to what we found
