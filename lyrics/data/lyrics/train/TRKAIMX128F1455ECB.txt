I've been a fool, I've been a fool
Forgivin' you each time you done me wrong
I've been a long time leavin' ya, but I'll be a long time gone

Loved you so much, loved you so much
I stayed around when I should've moved along
I've been a long time leavin' ya, but I'll be a long time gone

I say, "Hi there high line, hello highway"
Here come a big old semi my way
I stick up my thumb, hear the truck come
