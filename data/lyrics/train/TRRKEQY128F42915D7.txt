Forever I've suffered in this world, con't prosper, no
Monument of ruin, dead empires, statues decay
Endlessly searching for an end to my pain, gone
Seething, tumultuous suffering, decadence, mine

Fiercely seeking death, existence, my plague
All hope, a disease lost in a lost time

Fallen from your secure world to famine and death of
your values gone
Nothing is held sacred
The meek beholding the ruins, scavenge for life,
seeking answers, dying
Monoliths of decay
...
