I'll hold a place for you inside

Inside my heart for you and I
I won't forget these tears I cry
With every year that passes by
And I can't sleep without you

And I can't breathe anymore
Good times last forever

I'll keep my heart with yours
For every minute I am gone (I am gone)
Swear you'll never leave me
I'll be there every time
In your heart and in your eyes
...
