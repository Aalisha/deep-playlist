Well, come on lets go, lets go, little darlin
Tell me that you'll never leave me
Come on, come on, lets go again and again and again and again

Well, now swing me, swing me all the way darling
Come on, lets go little darling
Lets go, lets go again once more

Well, I love you so yeah,
And I'll never let you go
