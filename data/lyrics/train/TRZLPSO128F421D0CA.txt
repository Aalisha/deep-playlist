Zeigeist - Bunny from The Jade Motel

Don't you look at me and think you've got a chance
A tank-toped-muscled-boy can never show romance
Cause I will move along to dance floor bodies
and you can stay and watch as you do with movies as I dance

A tank-toped seeked my eyes as well the other night
I let him touch my razorblade and sent him off to die
No regrets at all moved to dance floor masses
Better proof yourself or youâ€™ll burn to ashes as I dance
