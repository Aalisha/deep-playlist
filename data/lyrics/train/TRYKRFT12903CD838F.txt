Save your breath you're just someone helpless
Searching for answers all the time
Answers you can't find
Waste your breath it's just numb and hopeless
Searching for answers in your mind
Answers you can't find

Face it
You faded away from me
Face it
I'm used to it anyway
Watching you disappear... 
Face it
You're pushing away from me
Face it
I'm used to it anyway
...
