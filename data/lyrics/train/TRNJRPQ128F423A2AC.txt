Lonely in my world, 
I accept this role
And mornings and evenings crawl.
Lonely in my world.
I'm so scorned
To watch this light that makes me blind.

And people get me nervous when they say nothing matters.
Every day is dull and filled with grey and I feel better.
And the silence, and the silence turns the soil dry.

Feeling or agony.
"Free from my world". It's what I can wish.
