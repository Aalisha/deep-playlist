Mistress Mabel seriously wrong
Clears my table badly then she's gone
Takes a liberty if you let her
Yes, she's old but she should know better
Oh dear Mabel, please don't put me on

Wind them down and then keep them kickin'
Sunken eyed and all panic stricken
Oh dear Mabel, it still worries me

Hemline rat bag so they told her
Last nights name tag across her shoulder
