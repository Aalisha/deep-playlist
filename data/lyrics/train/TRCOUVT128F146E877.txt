I'm just a man with a job
You can call me Harry, Jim or Bob
Three floors below from Picadilly
It's dark and chilly
Counting the cars with cocktail bars
Keeping a check on four-wheeled wrecks

Three floors above it's not the same
Picadilly, lighting up the rain
Here I'm a ghost in the cellar
The kind of fellow
Who's counting days that could be nights
Count on the man who's counting lights
