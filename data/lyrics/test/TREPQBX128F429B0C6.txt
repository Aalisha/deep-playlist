i take the blame,
it's not the same,
what a shame,
future lessons for past insinuations,
it makes sense to me,
makes sense to me,
i left the keys under the seat.

if you're feeling desire,
its the need to,
hit the lights and,
fuck the lier,
when you're chewing on your words,
you won't need to believe me.
