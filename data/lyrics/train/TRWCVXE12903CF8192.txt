I'm standing in the shadows
I can't hide it anymore
The moon is full
And it's taking over me

I just can't take it
I just can't take it anymore
This curse is haunting
Haunting me just like a ghost

I can feel it taking
I can feel it taking over me
There's no stopping me
I'm addicted to what I've become
I can feel you shaking
I can feel you shaking on your knees
There's no stopping me
...
