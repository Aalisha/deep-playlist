I've blown it in every single way
Screwed every single chance that came
You're a super star in waiting for the silver screen
Then the pressure came
Swept away in a tidal wave
Could be all of you, still awake at noon
Blew my chances in a tragic flurry, sweeping apathy
Buy all my food from the B.P store when the night kicks in
I'm turning my back on everyone
I've blown everything I've ever done

I've fucked it up, shot my load
Spewed onto the motorway shoulder
