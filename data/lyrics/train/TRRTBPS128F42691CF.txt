Lead us to war... ...war!
return home because war's where
the heart is
lead us to war... ...war!
a procession fallen into submission

Black skies surround everyday
there's no sign of the light that once
embraced us
Time is our enemy now
without warning it carries us far away
dig deeper intot his hole
falling faster and leaving
ourselves to blame
shackles of death hold us down
use the anger inside to keep us war

...
