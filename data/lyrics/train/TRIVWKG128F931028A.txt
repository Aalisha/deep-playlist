I give my all my everything
Anything you want I've tried to be
I tried, god knows I tried
Or am I stuck somewhere between
Who I am and who I hope to be
Am I fighting the good fight

Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong
Keep pressing on
Fight the good fight
Fight, what you know is wrong

I've come so far to fall too fast
As for? I can't look back I try
God knows I try
I shift my eyes to the sky
