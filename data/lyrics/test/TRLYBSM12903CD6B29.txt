I know, thinking of you*
It's not the 'wisest' thing for me to do
Uh oh, some say, love is a game
How many times must go through the pain
It's just a whispered confession, you're my faithful obsession
True, oh so true
You are the ultimate lover
Passion is the perfect cover
True, oh so true
Is my secret love, and I can't let go
Dreams of us, are in my soul
It's my secret love, baby don't you know
Your my secret, your my secret, love
...
