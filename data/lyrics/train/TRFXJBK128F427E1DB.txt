I seem to recognize your face
Haunting, familiar, yet I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
All these changes taking place
I wish I'd seen the place, but no one's ever taken me
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
