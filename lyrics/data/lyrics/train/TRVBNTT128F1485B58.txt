I can't go anywhere,
without feeling strange
I can't see anyone,
everything has changed

Cause every time I close my eyes,
it's you again, you again
and every time I hear your voice I,
don't know what to do with myself

You, You, n da da da da da
dum, you, n da da da da da
dum, you, n da da da da da
dum, you, n da da da da da
...
