Desmond has his barrow in the market place...
Molly is the singer in a band...
Desmond says to Molly "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand...
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...
Lala how the life goes on...
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...
Lala how the life goes on.

Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store...
Buys a twenty carat golden ring...
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door...
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing...
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!...
Lala how the life goes on...
...
