Feel the touch of death. 
Feel the toxic touch. 
Life never meant anything to you. 

But now when it's almost over. 
When the end comes closer. 
You regret the fact you never really lived. 

Life's abandoning you. 
In a brutal way. 
The curtain falls, it's all over. 

Now you're scared. 
To cross the border. 
I wish I could help you to ease the pain.
