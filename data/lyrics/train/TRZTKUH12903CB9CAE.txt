Postcard from Mars
Having your fill
You can't see the harm
In a little pill
See what you've done
Biding your time
Making my world
Unthoughtful in sunlight

Till I wake up
Boy I'll take some time to understand
Soon I'll be a part of this
The last time
Oh the last time
I'm sure it comes back on again
