Turn on the radio, turn on my T.V
They're talkin' 'bout war, they're talkin' 'bout peace
Talkin' 'bout you, talkin' 'bout me
The way we ought to act, yeah, the way we ought to be
They talk about stars and the latest styles
They don't talk about much that seems worthwhile, meanwhile

Me and my baby slip under the covers
Get away from the world and whatever other stuff is
Goin' on and start to workin' on
A little heart to heart an' mouth to mouth
Thats what I'm talkin' about
...
