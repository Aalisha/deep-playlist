Walking through these empty streets
this town is dead
Rain is coming harder now upon your head
You can't get far enough away
What's it matter anyway
You never win

They handed you map to show you
where to go
Gave you everything but what you
need to know
You know your friends enough to say
Where they'll be on any day
Come what may

Surprise surprise
The morning sun is in your eyes
...
