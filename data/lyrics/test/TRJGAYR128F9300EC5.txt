Aaaah aaaah
Konvict Music!
Yeah

The pressure's building up
I feel like givin' up
How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up
When everything has changed
It will never be the same
Nobody knew me than everybody knows my name

And I feel so ashamed
I've never been the kinda nigga that would complain
But it's so crazy, man
There's no different
Everyday is just the same thing

Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doing so many different shows
Head spinnin' feeling like it's gonna explode
