I've been burning up the blacktop
I've been wearin' out these tires
I've got a rebuilt carburetor
I've got brand new spark plug wires
I've been clutchin and a brakin
I've been up these hills and down
Her good love keeps me makin
That Asheville turnaround

I've been working like the dickens
Trying to make a livin
Just waitin for the weed to end
I try to pay attention
