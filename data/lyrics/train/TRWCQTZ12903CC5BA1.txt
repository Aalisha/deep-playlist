It's been a decade now I've mastered my craft
Slick quick and sharp as a tack stick like the sex in your back
Perhaps I'm strapped with a gat but best to step the fuck back
Three hundred pounds of the tats
Prepared to stomp your face flat
I'm the reason heathens quit breathing by bleeding from lesions
Leading these demons through killing seasons and leave them grieving
No need in proceeding your begging and pleading
Only appeasing my thirst for blood, I stop when Hell is freezing
The Hitchcock of hip hop, the darkest shit on the block
These haters hate it cause their bitches on jock
I got it on lock, dropped like these empty shells from a Glock
I'm quick ta bullet ya spot and watch your corpse as it rots

Going to Hell and they wanna blame me
And your children were pale now they wanna name me
