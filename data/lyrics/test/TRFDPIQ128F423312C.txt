Drink the good stuff down in one
Call for another, have yourself some fun
Here's to the good life, drink it down
Stick around
The morning after, playing dead
Don't see the black clouds gather overhead
Consequences raining down
Stick around
You might just learn something
God only knows what that could be
Stick around
You might just learn something
