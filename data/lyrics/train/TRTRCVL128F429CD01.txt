Do you still remember how we used to be?
Feeling together, believing whatever my love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers, young love in the sun
Felt like my saviour, my spirit I gave ya, we'd only just begun

Hasta ma√±ana
Always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes I still remember every whispered word
The touch of your skin, 
giving life from within like a love song never heard
Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
...
