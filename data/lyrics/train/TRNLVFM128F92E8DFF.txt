If I gave you just a bit more time
Do you think that you would make up your mind?
You can't expect that a flower will grow
Until you get around to giving it more
Like it's only

Something to fall back on
Something to fall back on
Something to fall back on

Like a crumpled dollar hidden in your hat
For the subway home when there's no welcome mat
You'd be left with nothing if it weren't for that
When you need to find it it's right behind you

Remember when you were the talk of the town
And you didn't care if I was around
...
