I guess now It's time,
for me to give up,
I feel It's time,
got a picture of you beside me,
got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup,
oh yeah,
got a fist of pure emotion,
got a head of shattered dreams,
gotta leave It,
gotta leave It all behind now,

whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean It,
I just want you back for good,
whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing It,
you'll be right and understood,
I want you back for good,

unaware but underlined,
I figured out the story,
(no no)
