Who's the boy you like the most?
Is he teasing you with underage?
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset?
Static silhouette somehow?
Single in his bed someday?
Quiet till it fall, fall, falls

Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no, what did I say? What can I say?
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen
Here I'll be driving, you look the other way

That ain't easy to ignore
When your shutters open all the way
When it's candlelight I see I go insane
Distant silhouette somehow
We shared a cigarette somewhere
Addict till it fall, fall, falls
