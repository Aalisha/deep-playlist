Wish that I could close my eyes
And stop this room from moving
Any sound could cause surprise
Except my blue phone ringing
Won't someone come see me
They could change my weather
We could talk together now

Because I still feel high
And so low (low low low)
I still feel high
And so low (low low low)

Is my reflection telling lies
Or is my mind just blinking
Self esteem and bottle mark
Compete for last position

Why don't you come home and be me
You could read my letter
We could talk together now

Because I still feel high
...
