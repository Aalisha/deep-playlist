S-A-T-A-N he's our man, hey!
S-A-T-A-N he's our man, hey!
S-A-T-A-N he's our man, hey!
S-A-T-A-N he's our man, hey!

You know I just can't describe the feeling inside
when the music fills me with a sense of pride
that's why I can't understand how a rock and roll band
can play the devil's music without taking a stand

that's the kind of lie that made me decide to be an

Unholy roller
A Satanic soldier
an Unholy Roller
'cause there's only one thing that's gonna save our souls, yea!

S-A-T-A-N he's our man, hey!
S-A-T-A-N he's our man, hey!
