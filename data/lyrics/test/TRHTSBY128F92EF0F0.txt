Late at night I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why
Sometimes I? m so tired, I don? t even try
Seems everything around me fails

Late at night darkness makes it hard to see
The history of the saints who? ve gone in front of me
Through famine, plague and disbelief
His hand was still upon them 'cause there is a reason, there is a reason

He makes all things good, He makes all things good
There? s a time to live, a time to die
A time for wonder and to wonder why
'Cause there is a reason, there is a reason, there is a reason
