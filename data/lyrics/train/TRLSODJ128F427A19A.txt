I got an urge to tell a story
Mad house set to unload
I try my best to keep a distance
From going down loony road

But I get crushed with the temptation
For the place that makes
You move-to the groove
Right down loony road

This certain pad will make your heart beat
Rum, sex, drop hit the floor

Next day you feel your head spin
Back up again, do it some more
...
