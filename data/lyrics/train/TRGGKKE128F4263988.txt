Demented New York athletes staggering round the block
Deforned Chicanos pour in, Chicago's rolling stock
Digital bathrooms drilling for furs
Surgical stockings marked his and hers
Guggenheim attitudes back to back
With Jewish Baroque

No way street
No way street
Happy to see you, have a nice day!

Defecting Russian dancers dance into Hockney prints
Exclusive to Bloomingdales, gift-wrapped in red
From the land of blue rinse
They boggle at menus in Olde English verse
"Ode to a burger" by Keats at his worst
The hissing of omelets the breaking of legs
Don't shoot till you see the whites of their eggs
The pink fillet mignon looks black on the negs

Strange apparatus
You've never seen
Strange apparatus, even stranger theme
Street alligators
Big Anglophile
