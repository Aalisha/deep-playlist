Half asleep with the sun coming up out east
We're driving down Garfield Ave when you said a strange and significant thing
I can remember the words - "this was a beautiful night
It won't, it won't ever happen this way again"

No, my dear, nothing much grows around here
We carry our roots with us, a couple of weeds pulled up, misguided
Girl, you'll be the heroine of my book, the plot is the course we took
The setting can't be nowhere else in the world

And the story opens up with you
Your broken dreams and cheap perfume
You're on a city bus, the rain it falls
Your make up bleeds, the wind it howls

And I stumble on from Uptown bars
I guess that's all I've got so far
Yeah, but at the end, I don't know how
