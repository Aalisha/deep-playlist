It's late at night, I watch the stars shine
I plead for giveness
I sit alone and watch a candle burn
Forgotten memories, I rise to make my turn
I stand alone and watch the moonlight
The last I remember the world was cold as ice
Gaze at the clock, it's nearly midnight
Wait for sunrise, that's when I'll go on

When love fades away
The hardest part is being all alone
And there's nothing you can do

Now as the night it slowly fades
...
