Someplace in a dominant time, 
We mend the break in the weak frontline.
Waist deep in knowledge that will save us.
Overrun by the yellow dogs.
Pray for salvation from napalm gods.
Bubbling skin always brings a smile to my face.

Fall back to the rear; the cowards arrive with numbers overwhelming.
They are swarming from beneath the ground.
I will let you pass
