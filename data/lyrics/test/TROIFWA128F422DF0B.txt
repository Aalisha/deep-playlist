Hunters with their dogs and deer rifles
Thousands of them line the pavement
Like patient pupae waiting to become worms


Another dark night, teething I'm marking a beast sheep
Like I walk in front of 39 thieves in a beat
Smores over warm helvetica brown proper
For the odd God or monster, proper to teleprompter
Wild blue yonder, blue in the face, angel
Blew into the bugles in lieu of the euthanasia
Usually the shooter community chew the corpse
But I see the wolves have already gotten to you and yours
Day of the dead, play the ledge closely
Train a barrel of monkeys to aim at the lowest bogey
Dope the gonzo of what we sold choked socially
Stole the golden fleece with the culture of total nobodies
Earth rised, the divide up of fighting tribes
All we do is watch 'em waddle back and forth lighting fires
Detonator, wire cutter, pliers
Two cities and the one is broken up in tiny towns
And I won't pose, I'm in the heart of the lion's throat
For a photographic token of my primordial growth
You parade around and kill, so damn proud
Like a flatline fetish, had it's feathers fanned out
War tore the symmetry, skipped into it gingerly
Silk worms ping-pong ministry to ministry
Hell's bells every which way the the wind blows
So I bang my head against any wall you can build, go.

Another dark night
Another not-all-right
Another bad ritual
More botched surgery
Better follow the bread crumbs back in fact, urgently
