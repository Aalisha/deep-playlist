Hush
Dont speak a word
About the dreams that i live for
It hurts to reach you when I'm down

Dont speak again
Im still waiting for my turn...
it hurts to Reach you when im down.

My dreams are growing into...
frustration when i hear your voice...
(feeding me 'till I'm choking, 
feeding me 'till I'm choking)
My ears are ringing louder.
repeating words that bring me down
(ringing, my ears are bleeding,
ringing, my ears are bleeding)

So hold your breath and spare me...
(the pointless conversation,
i'm running out of patience.)
Dont blame me for trying to...
(Reach)

Hush
...
