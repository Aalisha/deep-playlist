Look ma, top of the world
He'd started talking to himself
His ma was dead
The first sign of madness, talking to yourself

Alarm bells should have
Been going off in his head
As clear as crystal he ignored the S.O.S.
Gave a little whistle, made his last request

He tuned into his local commercial radio station
And listened to the spokesman for his generation
Who said, "Put your hands in the air like you just don't care"

Put your hands in the air like you just don't care
About anything or anybody
About love, hate, cruelty or pain
About football or music, the sun, the wind and the rain

It's the after taste of paradise
It doesn't pay to advertise
Part one in a two part pack of lies
A titillating, trivialized
