I can't breathe and I can't see in front of me
And I am feeling lost at see without you
And I don't know which way is left and which is right
But I will go out of my mind without you

So I will try to look into your heart
And see the man you claim you are

Just like learning to swim all over again
I have to believe that I can
And I'll give you my heart all over again
