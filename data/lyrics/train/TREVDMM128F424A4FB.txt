I love the tip, I love the top
I love you better than a hog loves slop
'Cause you're a big legged woman
With a short, short miniskirt
Promise me darlin'
You'll never make me feel like dirt
Do you have the vine goes around the stump?
You are mine, call it sugar lump
'Cause you're a big legged woman
With a short, short miniskirt
Promise me darlin'
You'll never make me feel like dirt
I've told you once, I've told you twice
We go together like fried beans and rice
