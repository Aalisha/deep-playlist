Oh one last kiss, oh baby one last kiss
It never felt like this, oh baby not like this
You know I need your love, oh oh oh give me one last kiss

Oh one more time, oh baby one more time
You make me feel sublime, oh baby so sublime
You know I need your love, oh oh oh give me one last kiss

Darling it isn't right I must be sayin' goodnight
