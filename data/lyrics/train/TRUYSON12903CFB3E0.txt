Now my road has turned to tracks,
Stones to pebbles, see them roll away.
My wandering troubles need not break my back,
Mmm, sorrow is the price I pay.
I sing my sorrows to the morning; I speak them to the night.
You best believe I? ll keep singing until I make my wrongs so right.
Devil said, a pity for your troubles to take your tired old soul?
So you know you got to go.
Hurry, to catch the morning.
