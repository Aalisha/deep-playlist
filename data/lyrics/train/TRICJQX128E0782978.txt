It's a slow parade
Down a dusty road
We've learned to take abuse
From devils we don't know
People who have lost all heart
Look for someone else to blame
You just keep on walking
When they call you a dirty name
All the mud in this town
All the dirt in this world
None of it sticks on you
You shake it off
'Cause you're better than that
And you don't need it
There's nothing wrong with you
The moment that we dread
It comes all too soon
Voices in your head
