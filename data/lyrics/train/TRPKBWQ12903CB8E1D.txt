It is he who holds the power
It is he who reflects the will
It is he who reigns the masses
It is he who urges to win
It is he who lights the fire
It is he who controls the flame
It is he who breeds hatred
It is he who withstands pain

The endless gap
between servant and lord
will grow stronger
within us all

It is he who decides the course
It is he who takes the step
It is he who moves forward
