Chorus:
Pour me another Tequila Sheila,
Take off that red satin dress
I cross the border and I beat the dealer
For all the damn gold in Juarez.

I feel like old Pancho Villa, Sheila
And sure could use a friend (I got Pesso to spend)
So pour me another Tequilla Sheila
And lay down n'love me again.

Though I can tell you about it
But don't mind my gun by the bed
I feel kind of naked without it
And it eases the fear in my head.

Just pass me the salt n'the lemon
...
