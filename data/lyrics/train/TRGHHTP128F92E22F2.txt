Well i fly off the handle
a little too quick
Guess you could call me a nervous man
For the last week or two
It don't take too much
to make me wanna raise my hand
Well it's one of those days
when you'd rather not be
so low down and dirty
your luck's out to sea
Well i fly off the handle
a little too fast
...
