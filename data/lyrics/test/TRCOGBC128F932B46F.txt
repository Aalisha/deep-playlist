I should just stay in, stay away from them
Constantly peacocking, flocking around porches smoking thins
Fashion victims and their new boyfriends
Steady cleaning jaws and talking daddy needs his medicine

Yeahh

Red eyed reptiles, smiling coke smiles, wearing dumb styles
Holding hands into the bathroom

Can we please leave soon?
Pretty people, awful to talk to
