Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you passed them by
(Passed them by)
Now you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try
(Let me try)

Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even have a song to sing
All I know is

La la la la la la la la la means
I love you
Oh, baby please now
