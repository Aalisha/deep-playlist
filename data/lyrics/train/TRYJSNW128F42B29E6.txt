Mama, mama, dem hold papa,
Seh dem hold him fe smoke ganja.
If mi never jump two fence, dem hold mi too,
So tell mi mama, whatcha gonna do?

Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do now?
Oh, mama, whatcha gonna do?

Next week, next week case to case,
Him haf a dread judge to face.
Him a fe I to live in space,
Or make di doctor dem work 'pon him fase.
