Well all I hope is that you forgive me and understand how I feel
All I wanted to do was tell you what was true, but it had it's effects, I could tell

My heart's in broken pieces but I don't pity myself because I'm to blame
I couldn't carry on this way when all I wanted was to stay
It took it's toll on me
And I will never forget, no, I will never pretend it meant nothing to me
