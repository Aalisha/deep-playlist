The intent, I intend, the intentions of one will guide.
I strive to speak what I have learned and learn from those I see.
To step out of this life is my ambition.
To speak out and show you what I have seen.

I am one voice amidst the shouts of many.
I cry for those without a voice.
For those who don't know that they have a choice.

Open your eyes and see what it means to feel compassion and live in love.
