Motherless children have a hard time
When their mother's dead.
Motherless children have a hard time
When their mother's dead.
See them wander from door to door,
Lord, they don't got no place to go.
Nobody love you like your mother can
When your mother's dead.

Father will do the best he can
When your mother's dead.
Father will do the best he can
When your mother's dead.
Father will do the best he can
But some things, your father can't understand.
Nobody loves you like your mother can
