I don't like your cats, you don't my shoes
But I love you babe thats why I'm singin the blues
You call me right up, don't even hesitate
Don't go to New York baby, ahh

Now I'm cryin I'm here all alone
Your leavin this place that you once called home
I'm suppose to listen to you say
That we won't have one more date

Don't go to New York baby,
...
