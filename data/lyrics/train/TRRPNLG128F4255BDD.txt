Standing in line
Counting the time
Waiting for the chance to
Open your eyes
Sift through the lies
You should know it's not your fault

You won't end this day
Leaving in pain
Which is wasted through your heart
Now that we're here
We brought all our fears
We can take them all apart.

And we are still in love
Fearing you will wait
Tonight am I afraid as you are?

We could be one
We could be so much better
We should be one
We should go all together

Down in the heat
