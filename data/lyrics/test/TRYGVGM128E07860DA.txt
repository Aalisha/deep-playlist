Got to be God's favorite.
A what's up all the people in the world "all the people in the world".
Everybody across seas.
Everybody, everywhere, that love N-O-R-E
"I know y'all love me"
I know my fans been sitting around waiting
They looking...
Said damn it's summertime n-o
Ain't drop one
I know I drop one four summers straight"four summers".
Had to pause this summer though "had to pause"
Learn how to be a motherfucking man
"learn how to be a man"
