was just coasting away
And wasn't even thinkin of anybody no
You took my mind sexy no doubt
Envisionung turning u out
And then we caught eyes ain't no stoppin now
Burn some candlelight incence
Taste of berry wine
Just me and you and all i wanna do
Is get with you
One night it could be so real
If you give me a chance baby
I want to show you romance baby

[Chorus:]
