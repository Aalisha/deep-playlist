it's da bomb
it's da bomb
I drop bombs like Hiroshima
it's da bomb
I know you hear me comin here I come
So you besta watch ya back
it's da bomb
I know you hear me comin here I come
And I'm called the Miggida-Miggida-Mac

Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb
Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb
Can I drop the bomb drop the bomb
Well, here it comes
say what
Here it comes
It's the quicka rippa ripper
Known to flip a script like it ain't notin'
All ya MC's that used to MCs better duck an'
Run an' hide cause it's too late to try to make it right
Ya just messed up and I ain't tryin' to let ya slide
Cause I ain't the one for that I ain't the one that slack
I'm the Miggida-Miggida-Mac pack and I ain't takin' jack
I don't care who you get or who ya wit'
Just know you won't be equipped to what it takes to break this krossed
out kid
I've got deez off dout clout cause I'm deez off doubt
I'm bad suckas if ya wanna know what I'm talkin about
So lay your cards on the table cause I'm able to rock
When ever, where ever I still rocks the cradle
Cause i'm a nappy happy bad little sun-of-a-gun
And in my eyes, nigga, you don't want none
Cause on the mike I get dum-ditty ditty-dum
So watcha back when I say here it comes
