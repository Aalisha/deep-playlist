Come if you're joyful, happy, laughing
With a song spilling out of your soul
Come if you're broken and all that you know is
Your life is spinning out of control

Come if you've never had a father and
You're looking for a Father who will hold you in His arms
Wherever you've been, just come on in
No distance is too far

Chorus:
Come everyone under the sun
Lift up your heart to the Savior
