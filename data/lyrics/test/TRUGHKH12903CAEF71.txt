Ninjas! kunoichi and oniwaban unite...
dealing in murder by blowdarts tonight...
your shogun is calling, order is falling...
It's time to strap up and obey the calling...

Shinobi, cast off your farmers apparel...
an old allegiance is needed in the time of D.A.R.Y.L...
put down your sodoku, stick on your shoku...
climb down from your tree and kill people with me...

Fighting! Iron fisted men...
...
