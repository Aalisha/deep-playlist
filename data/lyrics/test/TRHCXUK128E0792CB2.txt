It's the end of the year
I have just settled here
It may not be much, but it's enough
Yet trouble has sprung from the pubs and the clubs
We'll see blood soon, when the night's through

Still you can have it all, there's a hole in the wall
Get some money and we'll show them
This is our territory, this patch belongs to me
Why don't they understand but I've got a plan?

So come take my hand
And sleep well tonight
Tomorrow we fight, oh, would you like it in town?
As the bass drums boom by
...
