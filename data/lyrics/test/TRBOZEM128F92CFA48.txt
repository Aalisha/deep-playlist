I remember like it was yesterday
First kiss and I knew you changed the game
You had me exactly where you wanted and I'm on it
And I ain't ever gonna let you get away
Holding hands never made me feel this way
So special, boy it's your, your smile

We so in love, la, la, la, la
Yeah, we so in love, la-la, la, la, la
And I just can't get enough of your l-l-l-love
Yeah, we so in love, love, and I want you to know

You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up, oh boy, oh boy
You're my every, everything that I could ever dream of

You are my baby love, my baby love
You make the sun come up, oh boy, oh boy
You're my every, every, every, everything

In a minute now, we're still holding it down
Butterflies every time you come around
You make me so crazy, it's crazy, oh baby
And I don't ever wanna be with no one else
You're the only one that ever made me melt
You're special, boy it's your, your style

We so in love, la, la, la, la
Yeah, we so in love, la-la, la, la, la
And I just can't get enough of your l-l-l-love
