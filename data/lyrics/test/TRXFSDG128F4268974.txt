(Sinner, Beyrodt)

(Chorus 1:)
Here I am, bounded in blood
No escape 'til the darkness will fall
I hear them scream, hear them cry
Slaves and shadows ... caged in this twilight

(Chorus 2:)
Somewhere inside, you will hear this sound
You will understand what turns me inside out

(Chorus 3:)
Will you hear me calling
You will fear the nature of evil
Will you see me screaming
You will fear the nature of evil
