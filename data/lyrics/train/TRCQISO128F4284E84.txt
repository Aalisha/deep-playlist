I got a present for brother.
Choo choo train
And I'm just dyin' to see my dear ol' mother.
Choo choo train
So don't slow down til you see my home town.

Choo choo train
Choo choo train
I know you're not a jet aeroplane.
But you see my baby's waitin' at the station.
So give me just a little mo' acceleration.
