Don't talk to me about money
Don't talk to be about fame
Don't tell be about your lyrics
Coz your songs are all the same
There's 11 on the guest list probably more by far
Photographers and magazines and stacks of A&R

Like i said about the guest list
Well forget abot the birds
They don't need names and tickets for the ones in denim skirts
You highlight for the weekend
Unless your on the team

Brand new tops
And bottoms drop
No knickers underneath

But there's one thing that you'll never understand
Oh there's one thing that you gotta understand
Man i hate your band
