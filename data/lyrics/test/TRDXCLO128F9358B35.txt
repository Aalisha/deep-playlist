R-r-r-r-ring

Hey, ring de alarm
Hey, whoa, ring de alarm
And not a sound is dying, whoa
Hey, ring de alarm
And not a sound is dying, whoa

Hey, ring de alarm
Some sound sound like a big drum pan
Listen de sound it a champion
Ram the dance inna any session
Rock up the woman and rock up the man

Ring me alarm
And not a sound is dying, whoa
Hey, ring de alarm
And not a sound is dying, whoa
Hey

Donkey wan water but dem hol' I'm trough
Tee tar toe we beat 'em all in a row
Dark haas waan water but, hol' im trough

Ring me alarm
