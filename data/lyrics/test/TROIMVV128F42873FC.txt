Only holding on
is this what you want?
is this what you want?
dreams are falling apart as were only holding on
ambition gets old
when our hearts lie to us
our hearts break our trust as were only holding on

we gave our everything
we gave our everything
we gave our everything
all for unwanted dreams
we gave our everything

lights dim down
were the stars tonight
