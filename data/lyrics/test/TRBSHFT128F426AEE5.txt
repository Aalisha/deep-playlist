You're safe inside your room
Deaf to people scream
Fear of loosing anything, heart of stone
You got the power for your selfish dirty aims
A smile misleading people against you

Your values, sand in the wind, you bough reality
You sold your dignity for a dream of glory
Now your time has come, but can't set the world free...
