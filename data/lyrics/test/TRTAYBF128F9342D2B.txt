Picked a girl up at the trainstop where I live
Took a drive along the beach by the ocean
Talk about the dreams we had while we were growing old
Wrote a poem on the back of your shoulder

Tell me your name, tell me your story
Cause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfit

Tell me your name, tell me your story
Cause I'm into it, runnin' through life like a misfit

I will start again
I will start again
...
