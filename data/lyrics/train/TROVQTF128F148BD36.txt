Baby, only for you
Lady, only for you

What will it take my love to show you
I'm still in love with you?
What will it take my love to show you
How much my love is true?

Feeling she gave to me
Makes me feel so brand new
Love you forever
And there's no other like you

Baby I know I hurt you twice
Promise I'll never hurt you no more
Although I know it's not nice
Promise I'll never go back through that door

Although you've got your choice
Please make sure the first is the Cure
I make my sacrifice, only you
No one before

What will it take my love to show you
...
