I'll keep on holdin' on, oh yes I will, I'll keep on holdin' on
I know that you're the kind of guy, you've got too much pride
You're scared to love someone, run and hide
Each and every day, and each and every way
My love is growin' stronger
And I know that you can't hold on much longer
When there's no place left to hide
I'll still be by your side
'Cause I'll be, waiting, oh yes, sure 'nough
...
