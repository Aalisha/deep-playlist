It could all be so simple, simple

Don't need high heels, for a good feel
You can keep the fancy clothes
I'll take walkin' in the rain, over things material
I'll trade Melrose and the big names, give me faces that I know
Just play a melody that everybody knows

Take it down, down, down and strip it to the core
I don't really need much, less is more, more, more
 (More, more)

True to life, true to me the way it's got to be
(So simple, so simple, so simple, yeah)
Live to love, love to be absolutely free
(So simple, so simple, simple)

Give me wisdom, plain and truthful
Teach me somethin' I don't know
Plain as education, inspiration I suppose
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
