(I want everybody to get up off your seat
And get your arms together, and your hands together
And give me some of that o-o-old soul clapping)

You didn't have to love me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did
But you did, but you did
And I thank you

If you took your love to somewhere else
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death
You made me feel like I've never felt
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

You didn't have to squeeze me but you did
But you did but you did
And I thank you
You didn't have to hold me but you did
