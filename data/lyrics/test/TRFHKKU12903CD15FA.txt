When you turn and you walk through that door
It hurts me sore, said it hurts me sore
When you look at me and you say 'Good bye'
You made me cry, said you made me cry
So listen to me, what I say to you
Breaking up is hard to do
Everybody know, breaking up is hard to do
I cannot let you go now
For my love is strong
