Lucifer:
I've been waiting for the fall,
I've been waiting for the crash,
Wait a minute Mr. Man,
Can't you see this is the end,
But this is no goodbye.

And I've been calling out your name,
Oh at least a million times.
So wait a minute Mr. Vain,
You got caught up in the game,
But I am still around.

Gabriel:
Until you see me, you hear me,
Till you reach out and feel me.
I can't discover why my love was never healing,
I can't discover why all you do is suffer,
You've got to keep holding on,
...
