I see myself when I look in your eyes
And all of the sadness you're keeping inside
Oh baby can't you see
If anyone knows, if anyone knows it's me

So many years I tried to pretend
That I would live on in silence my friend
Then something changed in me
Funny how love, it's funny how love sets you free

Don't run away
From my love it could save you
If only you'll stay

How many tears will you cry in the dark
'Till you let me close to your heart
Doesn't the loneliness tear you apart
Let me get close to your heart
...
