A cloud will rise, the sky will fall
A flash of lights will bury us all
(cause we are a time bomb)
The flashes rain and hide the sun
All that remains is what we've done
(cause we are a time bomb) 
We're waiting as time goes on and on, and on, and on

(Chorus)
Underneath the sky we'll rise and fall
Till the weight of life is gone 
Underneath it all dies to go on and on, and on, and on

A new empire to wear the crown
A new desire will carry us down 
(cause we are a time bomb)
...
