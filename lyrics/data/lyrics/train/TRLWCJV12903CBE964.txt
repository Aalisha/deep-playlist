You, You,
You were a fast one always in control, Kamikaze,
Spreading your wings full of holes as you drag the sky
And no-one can tell you if this is to spin or free falling
'Cause no-one is so sure that this was meant to fly.

Uptight.
You flicker and flame like the
Bright light.
They're calling your name from the
Outside.
You don't believe in the real world.

Tryin to process all of your need and desperation
So you can straighten out every devil lie.
The ripple is falling comin' down slow like silent movie
And they will abandon time
...
