Tell me where it all went wrong
Maybe I can make it better
Tell me where it all went wrong
Don't you know that you really upset her
When you act like a man who is cross with every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill and you will be the first to make me mad
Then you'll have to go
Maybe you'll have to go

Is this the kind of fate you could contemplate
...
