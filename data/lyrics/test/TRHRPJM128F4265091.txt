Oh, wake up Susie
Put your shoes on
Walk with me into this light
Finally this morning
I'm feeling whole again
It's been a hell of a night

Just to be with you by my side
Just to have you near in my sight
Just to walk a while in this light
Just to know that life goes on

Wake up Susie
Put your shoes on
