[Intro:]
La La, La, La
La, La La, La La
La, La, La, La, La
It's one of those songs
You just gotta, put a name in front of
When you making dedications
And it's gonna say whatever you want
You know what I mean

[Chorus:]
Girl if your in your car, or the crib
Listen, reminence
Know that this song is for you
It's for you, it's, it's for you
And you know who you are, your my heart
I'm missin', been missin' you
Know that this song is for you, oh
It's a way to say "I love you"

[Verse 1:]
Maybe you was out there creepin'
You know, only you know
Or maybe you was doin'
All the things you suppost to do, oh yeah
Either way it goes, this song covers it
Baby you can press play and just walk away
