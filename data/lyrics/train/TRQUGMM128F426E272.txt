You're a hard act to follow, heaven knows
And I wouldn't have it any other way
And with the weight of the moment upon your back
And me hangin' on to every word you say

This lonely heart was callin'
And strung out on the line
So you took yours and put it next to mine
And in the heat of the moment
I just froze
Ever since you swept me off my feet you've kept me on my toes
...
