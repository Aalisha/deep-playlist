The age of the storm has come
And with it the end of man
The rise of the hybrid race
And the crowning of a new darkness
In darkness we cease to exist
As we fall into emptiness
The winds are blowing, freezing earth to the core
Nothing can live on in this endless storm
Can you see the instinct to kill within my eyes?
The thirst for blood is overwhelming
Man's foolishness is sickening
This is the age of emptiness
The skies above are growing dark
The age of man has come to an end
