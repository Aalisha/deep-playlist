Open your burning eyes and behold what is rising.
Feeding infernal fires with useless human flesh.
Light the stars of hatred with fires of burning blackness,
awaking pure black hearts with blood of our purity.
Blood of humanity is the sign of our burning honour.
Laughter and delight, our fires are burning might.
