They say that your kiss is like a pill
Designed to change the way that I feel
For every heartache you gotta cure
That's why I put my trust in you

Everybody's looking for what they want
And everybody's looking for what they need
Gotta keep on looking for what I want
Gotta keep on looking for what I want

[Chorus]
But I don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
To put out the flame

Don't even know your name
So I will call you medicine
You can ease my pain

I don't wanna feel the same
Tonight I need your medicine
To put out the flame


A Medicine
