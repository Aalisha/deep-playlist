Before we go any further, friends
As you call? em they call you when they need somethin.

Trees for the blunt, two G's for the frontin
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of their eyes
Bright with surprise once they finish spittin lies
Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggaz, homies?
Close, but really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn't even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs, no feeding the baboon
Seein as how they got your back bleeding from the stab wounds
Y'all know the dance, they smile in your face, y'all know the glance
Try ta put 'em on, they blow the chance
