Who colt the game
Who colt the game
It's not natty dready
It must be bald heady
Somebody play the wrong domino
And want the world to follow
Someone is fillin' their sack
In a completry? Black
Who colt the game
A you colt the game
Why you play the bad card
Now we catch you off guard
Natty dread want to shuffle
Not lookin' for nothin' to scuffle now
