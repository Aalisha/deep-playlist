Hey I need a visit to Vienna,
a weekend of romance and fun
Baby check your busy agenda
if you got time for a final round
Maybe it's a way to skip the end
but it is what you do when you can't rewind
You said you would take me anywhere I want to
if I swear I'd leave my doubts behind

We pity you loves leftovers
and look down on those who can't stay true
We are safe but we can't stop wondering,
if this is it then who's fooling who?

My baby and I oh
...
