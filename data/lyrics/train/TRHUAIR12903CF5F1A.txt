Your cold flesh covers my eyes.
From the burning of chapels we rise.
My nails under your skin, 
Makes your blood touch the air.
Keeping you down, wearing your crown, 
The crown of salvation, the divine erection, fading your light.
You will wake up, just to see a piece, 
Of the hammer inside your eye, 
You will be eaten alive.
You will fall to the ground, you shall feel the wrath.
