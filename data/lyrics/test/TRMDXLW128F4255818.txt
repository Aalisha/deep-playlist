Laa laa, laa laa laa, laa
Laa laa, laa laa laa, laa laa
Laa, laa, laa laa

That laa laa, laa laa, laa laa laa, laa
That laa laa, laa laa, laa laa laa, laa
Smoke it up, smoke it up, smoke it up

Now 'fore you roll this shit, settle down, young girl
Before we smoke this shit, settle down, young girl
You rollin? witcha boy, you? re chillin? witcha boy
And this is how it is when you fucks withcha boy

So let's smoke this shit, settle down, young girl
You can't be too quick, settle down, young girl
Let's do this thing right, it's goin? down tonight
And I promise everything'll be alright

Now shawty, roll it, roll it, roll it
Make sure you close it, close it, close it
I'ma show you how to hold it, hold it, hold it, hey
Now puff puff, give that shit back to your nigga

We on that laa laa
One hit'll make you fly, fly
And all you gotta do is try, try
And trust me, girl, trust me, girl

Oh, we on that laa laa
