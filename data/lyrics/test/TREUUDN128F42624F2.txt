See it in the songs of youth, worshipping the souls of love
How we dance upon the ground we bring together
Can you hear the echo sound, showing us a wisdom found
Was there ever so much trust in our foundation

Cos' I believe the world, the earth is fine alright
And we keep believing we shall live forever
And I've truly learned the lessons, soul eternal love
We all need to stand to trust in the light
