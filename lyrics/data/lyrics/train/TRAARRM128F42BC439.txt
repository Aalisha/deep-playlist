In and out of honky tonks from one town to the next
But anything worth loving, Lord, just too hard to forget
Everyday's another way of feeling more the same
Looks like I'll run out of highway before I out run the rain

But if there's fire and smoke
Ooh, what a rush I got when your love was hot
Oh, but I couldn't see that when the flame burned out
...
