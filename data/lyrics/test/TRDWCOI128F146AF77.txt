I can see the Russian Army rolling through my head
On one side of me lies the enemy, the other half is dead
I've got diamonds and I've got pearls. . .
And I said "Hey mister, won't you come for me?"
You can take me home, but I will never be your girl
I won't let your mystery unfurl

That's the whole thing about it. . .
I'm so in love today
I've been waiting at the bus stop
