I just woke up
Everything was fucked
From the night before
I was beyond repair
I had just woke up
Everything was wrong
All the cats were dead
And the phones were gone
I had just woke up
Like a heart attack
I weren't coming back
And mum was dressed in black
I had just woke up
I had just woke up
Everything was fucked
Everything was fucked

The guilt won't leave my circulation
The guilt won't leave my circulation
The guilt won't leave my circulation
The guilt won't leave my circulation

I had just woke up
In someone elses bed
