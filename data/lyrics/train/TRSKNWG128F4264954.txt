A bunch of wild boys was hanging around
At the local neighborhood saloon
And some cat kept dropping quarters down in the jukebox
Playing all the favorite tunes

And back by the bar playing cards looking hard
Was big bad Solomon Jones
And watching over his luck
Was the love of his life
Is the lady that was known as Simone

When out of the night which was dark and cold
Into the smoke-filled dimly-lit room
Stumbled in a thug
Who was smelling like bud
And his eyes looked high as the moon

He looked like a man with his foot in the grave
And his lifetime about to be out
Yet he slapped down some hundred-dollar bills on the bar
And he yelled out "drinks on the house"

Now nobody could place where this dude was from
But we knew that he was far from home
But we drank to his health
And the last to drink was big bad Solomon Jones

Now there are some G's
Who just run the streets
And they live life in and out of jail
And such was he, that kind of OG
That looked like he'd been through hell
...
