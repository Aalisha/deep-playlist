Without warning
Emotions tide in like a breaking wave
I can't remember yesterday
I don't recall ever being this way before

Cause I feel weak
Like a defenseless animal
Weak
Though my will is gone
Weak
As if I never really had any strength at all

From the inside I could feel myself lost in reverie with you
From the inside I could feel myself paralyzed
From the inside I could feel a change coming over me with you
