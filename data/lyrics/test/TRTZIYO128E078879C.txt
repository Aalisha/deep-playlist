Hey child wash away your tears
hang on till tomorrow comes
'cause it will soon be here
hey child don't give up today
gotta be some good time baby
not too far away
Child love don't come easily
and child don't be afraid to feel
'cause the times gonna come
when you're gonna go
and my only advice is 
to live life your own way
I'm here for you
till my dying day
Hey child wash away your tears
hang on till tomorrow comes
'cause it will soon be here
hey child don't give up today
gotta be some good times baby
...
