Johnny was a schoolboy
When he heard his first Beatles song
'Love Me Do' I think it was
And from then it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar
Used to play every night
Now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit
And everything's alright

Johnny told his Mama,
"Hey, Mama, I'm goin' away,
Gonna hit the big time,
Gonna be a big star someday"
Mama came to the door
With a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said, "Don't cry Mama,
Smile and wave goodbye"
Don't you know?
