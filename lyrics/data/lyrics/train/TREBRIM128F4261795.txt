I see you looking for shooting stars
standing in that sleazy bar
You tell me that you are getting old
you've searched but you've never found your goal

You tell me buddy about that sorrow
That you don't care about no tomorrow
You tell me all about all that trouble
You see light through an empty bottle

But I can't see that she's getting high
Not that want us so don't waste your time
I can't see that she's going wild
