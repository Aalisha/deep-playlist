You're a late child, you're a love child
It's enough child that your so appealing
You're appealing, you're appealing
To a need that we all have been feeling
You don't fit where you've been put
They're so straight
Straight out of some book
Tried to fake it with a real man
Tried to fill your father's size ten

Alone [living] in this world
You're not a boy or a girl
