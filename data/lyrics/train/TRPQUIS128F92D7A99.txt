I have a headache rhetoric
And I'm so happy I could slit my wrists
This is an empty vessel lesson
A collective works of what the mystic insults

Oh, this is an arm of disorientation
A central nervous brain of terror
This is the heart of emptiness
Banging the broken bell of treason

Oh, these are words of ones that're lost
Absurd and cracked under the surface
This is a twisted awkward beacon
I have to do nothing about the great boredom
