I've got alligator shoes
And I've beeb makin' news
I've got plenty of women
I've got plenty of booze
(Give me a shot)

Walked into the spot light
At the local bar and grill
Find a down and dirty woman
Well I'm gonna take my fill
Look right into her bloodshot eyes and
Scream my honey, I'm gonna make you mine

I paid the tab
I called a cab
Went back to my place
Had a hell of a time

I get excited
I feel loose
I move to quick and I get
Caught in your noose

(And I sweat)
Every time that we touch
(And I sweat)
...
