This is definitely my most favourite time of the year,
Oh yeah mine too, yes, I think it is
It is mine yeah,
I reckon Christmas is all right, cause like the football season is still on.
And you can watch football on Boxing Day when everyone is being really
boring and, you're fed up of your presents.
Listen right you can do whatever you want at Christmas as long as it's good, man
Well what I say this Christmas is just do what you want,
But make sure you do it like a lady!
If you can't be good, be careful
(and a ring-ding-a-ding-ding-ding-ding)
And make sure you get all your pressies off Santa!

Just hear those sleigh bells jing-a-ling-ring-ting-a-ling-a-ling-ting,
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you,
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling you,
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you,
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
Ring-a-ling-a-ling-a-ding-dong-ding
