Henrietta, we got no flowers for you
Just these three miserable cunts
Sitting on the back seat
Turning on the off beat

We know you love us, and you probably do
Although your husband may cut us
He's an animal
Though everything is possible

Give us a kiss and maybe we can go out
It's hard to miss you when you follow us abou-ou-ou-out
Buy us some shoes, and maybe take us for cola
We'll get you there in some filthy big gondola, and it's

Clean out the bank and bump off your daddy
You can come live with us amongst the has-beens and the addicts
These are crazy times down at Costello music
You can answer the phone and talk anyway you choose it, come on

Oh, come on
Oh, come on
...
