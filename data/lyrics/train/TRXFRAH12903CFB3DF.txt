Well I can't give you everything you want
But I could give you what you thought you need
A map to keep beneath your seat, you read to me in time I'll get you there
So fold it up so we don't find our way back soon, nobody knows we are here

We could park the van and walk to town
Find the cheapest bottle of wine that we could find
And talk about the road behind,
Our gettin' lost is not a waste of time.

The water moor will take us home
In the moment we will sing as the forest sleeps

It's all for the sake of arriving with you
Well it's all... for the sake of arriving with you
