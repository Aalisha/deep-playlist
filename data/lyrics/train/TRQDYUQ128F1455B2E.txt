Do you remember Sunday nights, summer time at shoom?
Joy big enough to fill the world, just inside that room
Do you remember Friday nights at the hacienda?
Armistice for gangs, no fights, just beats to make the world surrender

Was it all a dream?

No war, no hate, no more

No war, no hate, no more
If you'd unlock the secrets of your heart, heart

Day to day existence got it's gentle grip on you
Suffocating your soul, eclipsing everything you do
