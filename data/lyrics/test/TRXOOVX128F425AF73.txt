Pardon my dust, excuse the mess
we're making somethin' new out of all of this
I'm saying my prayers, and I'm trying to change
so give me some time, 'cause I'm still finding my way

Why are you lookin' at me this way?
pointing your finger, shakin' your head
how 'bout some love along the way, instead

Pardon my dust, excuse this mess
