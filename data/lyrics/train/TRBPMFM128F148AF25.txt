I wanna tell you 'bout a dance
That's goin' around
Ev'rybody doin' it
From the grown ups, down

Don't have to move yo' head
Don't have to move yo' hands
Don't have to move yo' lips
Just shake yo' hips

And do the hip shake, baby
And do the hip shake, baby
The hip shake, baby
Shake yo' hips, baby

Now, if you don't know
Don't be afraid
Just listen to me
