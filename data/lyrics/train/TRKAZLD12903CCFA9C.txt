Up above I see specks of silver in the evening sky
Specks of gold in the river running from the deep moonlight
See us shake in the wild distortion of the water's waves
Still I know you're in the darkness shining from a mile away
When the sun starts coming through
Or when the cardinal chides the moon
I believe in energies that no one has to see for us to prove
I believe in you and me and everything we'll ever see and do
Hear your voice come across the pillows, whisper sweet and low
...
