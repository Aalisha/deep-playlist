You can lead me to the river
Drop me down on my knees
You can read incantations just for me
I will gaze up to heaven and admit my disease
I will ride in the water or I will freeze

Lord I will say what you want me to say
I will pray what you want me to pray
Just please, make me whole!
Make me whole!
Make me whole!
