There is such confusion in my mind,
To play your illusion is so unkind,
I didn't know who you were this afternoon,
You said that it didn't matter and I'll see you soon.

Standing here in the rain,
Maybe the weather will change again,
Change again or stay the bleeding same.

How I met you in the first place I'll never know,
...
