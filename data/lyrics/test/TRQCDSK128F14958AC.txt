I was wondering how you're feeling
I thought I saw you kneeling
And holding your gut last night
It looked like you were praying
But I heard someone saying
You had been in an awful fight
You get the worst of it every time
Lashing out with no reason or rhyme
To lose all this rage, at so tender an age
Little baby growing up in a rat cage
Are you ready for the fallout?
Who you gonna call out?
When does it finally come to blows?
I think that you're forgetting
The blood that you'll be letting
Has a price on it, no one knows
