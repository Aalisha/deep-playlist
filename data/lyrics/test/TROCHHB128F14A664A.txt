a man sits at his desk
One year from retirement
And he's up for review
Not quite sure what to do
each passing year
The workload grows

I'm always wishing
I'm always wishing too late
For things to go my way
It always ends up the same

Count your blessings

I must be missing, I must be missing the point
Your signal fades away and all I'm left with is noise

Count your blessings on one hand

So wait up
...
