It's like we're standing outside while they're looking out the window
Picking up pace, losing control
Of all the things we are, all the things we know, it's like... hey (it's like hey)
It's like I just couldn't care less, but I'm wrapped around her finger
Started placing all my bets the day that we met
And staying up too late, the way you make me wait, it's like... hey (it's like hey)

Don't you know if you go
You'll go without me
Don't you leave me as if you never cared at all
If you go, don't go, go without me
Don't you need me?

So say, you are my everything
Just say, I'm hanging onto every word that you said
A part of me will never be the same

It's like she takes me up to ten, but she leaves me at eleven
Now you're telling all your friends everything you intend
