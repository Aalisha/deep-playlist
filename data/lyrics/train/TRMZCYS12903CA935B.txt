When I'm out and about
Skipping around the city
Up and down
Without a doubt
I'm okay with me
But when I'm home all alone
With only the phone
And all the crap I've accrued
What can I, what can I, what can I do?
Mama, Mama I wanted to please you
Mama, Mama I wanted to please
Dadda, dadda, I wanted to be better, better,
I wanted to be Mama
