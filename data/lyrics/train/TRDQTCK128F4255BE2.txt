Spare me the suspense
Spare me the suspense
I got no currency
But I'm heaven sent

So spare me the suspense
Just spare me the suspense

Hey lady wraith
Oh, I so hope you try
You're late
Babe, you know it's your time

I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
Alone you can't make amends
No, I won't let you sit by
So cold in the pitch night
We should dance like two fucking twins

Just spare me the suspense
...
