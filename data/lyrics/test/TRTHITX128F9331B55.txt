You can do what you want, be how you be
But I gotta fall back, boy 'cause this ain't me
Ooh baby, baby, I ain't trippin' over you

Go ahead and do you 'cause I'mma do me
But you just lost one and the one is me
Ooh baby, baby, I ain't trippin' over you

Mama told me watch out for bad boys but I didn't listen
Givin' all my stuff away for some hugs and kissin'
Not waitin' 'til I found the right one
I let you in you disrespect me now I'm done

What happened to you?
You're not what you said you were
