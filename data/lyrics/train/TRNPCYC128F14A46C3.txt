We figure out the past through photographs
They took while we were young
Even though there's no way out, we'll find one
We're the love-struck ones
The degrees of separation close in
Look who just walked in

A finger on the pulse is not enough
To show who's wrong from right
You know it's gonna be a long drive
Not an easy ride
The degrees of separation close in
Look who just walked in
