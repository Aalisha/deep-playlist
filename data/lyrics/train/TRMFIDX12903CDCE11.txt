Can you feel them? 
Those hands around your throat
They're cold and they're trying to kill your soul
I know, I've been there
At the end of my rope
No sign of help in sight
Lost every ounce of hope
Can't see the Light at the end of the road
No happy ending, nothing left to live for
(2x)
Even though the tears will fall
It can't rain all the time
Your darkest hour will not last
...
