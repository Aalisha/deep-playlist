(CHORUS)
In my Continental
Splinter off the mental
When you want the best show
Never accept anything less
Elements of purpose
True love from the first kiss
Spread it on the surface
Sit back and watch the progress

(VERSE 1: Slug)
T-t-t-t-t-t-teacher, teacher, how can I learn patience?
Planted in the middle and outside of your nation
Take the care to build a familiar foundation
Speak to the youth that keep the truth sacred
Free the, free the good inside your heart
Your neighborhood, it needs you to travel with your art
From New York to Cali, some day they'll all know
Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Chicago
Now I've come a long way from the younger days
When I used to look up curse words in my dictionary
If life's a game, gotta choose a side to play
If I gotta pick a position I'ma pick missionary
I've had a little bit too much to think tonight
But it's cool, I be alright, just make sure that I keep travellin
Your reactions only reinforce the previous thoughts
You'd feel the distance even if the bridge was collapsin
