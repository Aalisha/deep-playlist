You make me feel real good
But it's to good to be true
Sometimes I feel I'm losin my mind
Cuz everything I'm feelin all depends on you
You make me feel better
Than you turn to bring me down
Got me running to keep ya
Know I should leave ya
That makes you the illest thing around
Oh, u got me right
Oh, it feels so right
Still I'm feelin like
I hate to love you
It's like you got me on a roller-coaster
I wanna get off
But I ain't supposed to
I hate to love you
I do
I hate to love u
You're treatin me real bad
And it works everytime
Just when I think about leavin you
