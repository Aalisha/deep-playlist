(Noreaga talking)
Elpee...
Ya hot with this one dog!
Show these niggas what I'm like
Show these niggas I don't like
Show these niggas what I'm like
Show these niggas I don't like
Show these niggas what I'm like
Show these niggas I don't like
Show these niggas what I'm like
Show these niggas I don't like
Show these niggas what I'm like
Show these niggas I don't like

(Noreaga)
Yo, yo, yo, yo
I'm like Rich Porter, the epitome of Alpo(?)
AZ and Nicky Barnes, I rock (?) charms
I chopped it, and I cooked till my hands got numb
Shotguns malt-liquor and ones
I used to pay homage and wanted to play to be a fat cat
Someone like Castro, mad cash flow
Me and 'Pone like the best in the business
Niggas show love, hoes show interest
My gun game - got my pops to blame
I used to hop over fences and buck in the rain
And I'm not that nigga that'll f**k ya dame
I'm true to my niggas, hop out the car
Hand on my mac, cock back, ready to clap
Up in Iraq, see my niggas hustlin' crack
The same scheme from Queens when you livin' your dreams
You gotta sell things if you're looking for fiends

(Chorus)
(Noreaga)
I got love for niggas
(Capone)
Niggas always snaky
(Noreaga)
I got love for hoes
