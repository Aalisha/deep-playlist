Trying to be
To be so strong
I look into your eyes
And say hello
So hopelessly
I wait for your reply
When suddenly you grab me close
And press your lips to mine
You read my mind

Every memory
Every embrace
Every time my lips touch your face
It's nothing like loving you
It's nothing like loving you
It's nothing like loving you
Every single touch
Every on my mind
Cross my heart
Don't know why
It's nothing like loving you
It's nothing like loving you
Loving you

And hopin I'll be
That I'll be strong
I looked into your eyes
And say goodbye
And as I step away
The pains too much
And I turn my face to see your open arms
And I run to you, to you
...
