Yeah, introducing Brutha, let's go
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Say you can't be my side-chick
But I have been blowin' up ya sidekick
Tryin' to get out she's wants a grown man
But you frontin' and ya boy, can't understand anything

You say I am just too much to handle
'Cause all the girls want a ride in the Limo
But none of them hold a candle to you
So what are we gonna do?

Why you been playin' like this, why you gotta be on that ish
When we both want this?
I can make you love it, I can make you love it
Yeah, I know you want it, know ya gonna love it

When the truck pull up out front, be ready, don't stop
And the horn gon' honk like
I can make you love it, I can make you love it
Come and get on it, I'ma make you love it, yeah, yeah, yeah
