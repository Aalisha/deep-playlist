Goodbye the rain is fine I 'm gonna make my time, everytime.
A Farewell to my little maid and I decide to go before you stay
I feel you didn't change but I don't understand the words you say.
But its fine, the rain is fine I am gonna make my time, everytime.

Foxy lady you're my lady
You're my lovely lady lie
Foxy lady your my my lovely
Lovely lady lie

Listen to me close
Listen to me Myra
Everything must go
