Wanna wanna wanna wanna take a ride,
Get your clothes off in the summertime,
Wanna wanna wanna wanna be surprised,
Put a big kiss on these lips of mine

So hot I can't believe it,
So hot I can't believe it,
So hot I can't believe it,
Hey ho, don't be slow, ready to go yeah

Wanna wanna wanna wanna take a dive,
Head first into Summertime,
Wanna wanna wanna wanna take a ride,
...
