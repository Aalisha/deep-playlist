So it's over and your heart is on the floor
And you need a way to run and hide
Now you're knockin' on my door
Tryin' to pick it up and save your pride
You can say it but I've heard it all before
How I never should've said good-bye
The one I still adore (?)
and how you never meant to make me cry

You are the one who let me down
You are the one who fooled around
Now I'm your lost and found
Don't gimme that

Aa-aah, aa-aah, aa-aah, Don't gimme that
...
