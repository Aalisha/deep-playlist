[hook]
Wherever we go it's just life and love, you & me
we make the world go around for eternity
though we can't last that long, we'll stil go on & on & on

Hear me now
livin in a dreamscape trying to keep food upon my plate
though the pleasure & pains remain
I do what I can just to maintain
they say it's a commitment
but more like a real life sentence an' I'm
trying to understand the ways of the rules and the crimes guess I'm just conflicted
when you been so far when everyone knows ya name
no matter where you are just keep up on a humble face

[hook]
Wherever we go it's just life and love, you & me
we make the world go around for eternity
though we can't last that long, we'll stil go on & on & on

An' we say
me haffi get up an go whey I don't know
I'm inna fight livin life takin it blow by blow
