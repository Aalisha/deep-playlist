Well, I know you find it hard to smile,
To keep your happiness in style
You pass in silence in the mornin'
You know you shouldn't ever try to ignore me.

And you look to be pretty nervous
Sweaty hands and blood shot eyes.
So hard to identify you,
Just a loser in a loser's disguise.

She don't back down,
And she won't come around here
An' there's all this talk about dying
Man I don't get it, for the life of me.

With your fingernails painted red
...
