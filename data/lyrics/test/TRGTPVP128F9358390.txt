I saw Pete and Johnny too
Dressed up in their Sunday suits
Getting themselves all up to go
Down to Richmond to the traveling show
I fixed the gate like you told me to
Done my chores like I always do
And I won't tell mama you let me go
Down to Richmond to the traveling show

Please Papa can I go
Down to Richmond to the traveling show
Please Papa don't you say I can't
