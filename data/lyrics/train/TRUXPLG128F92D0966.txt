You know there's always somebody talkin bout me,
Oh but really I don't mind,
They try to stop and block my progress all of the time,

You know the mean things you say don't make me feel bad,
I can't miss a friend Lord, that I never had,
I got Jesus, Jesus and that's enough

Understand see, you're talkin' 'bout the great emancipator
Oh, and a heart regulator, Jesus is, oh Jesus is
...
