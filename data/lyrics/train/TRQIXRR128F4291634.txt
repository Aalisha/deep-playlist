All our lives growing up, we are taught to respect the laws of life:
Honor they mother and father.
Listen politely when others talk.
Be prompt.
Never disrespect your elders.
Never lie.
Put forth your best effort.
Don't smoke or take drugs.
Sex at an early age is wrong as well.

The moral values sound correct, kind of like our president,
Lying to protect us
Conceals the truth, we are fragile creatures, living in a sheltered womb.

As I walk amongst genocide, liberty's burning bright
Another way to survive, missiles decorate the sky
Long gone are the days when we used our hands to fight,
Fists were our weapon of choice.
Now we're putting guns into the hands of little boys
