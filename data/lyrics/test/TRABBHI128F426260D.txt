You'll get it right sometime, you will
I tell myself that every day
You don't need to latch on
To anything, you'll just end up back here

In your little limbo scene
It's repetitious and exhausting
I might need some therapy
Anything to keep me in check through the day

Don't think about your lover
You're already steady shaking
I might need a sedative
But I hate the taste of medicine
