girl you know this party's just a compromise
between these boardroom suits and your bedroom eyes
and don't you think the dancin is a waste of time
and i expect you to move if you expect me to apologize
for all the things i said about your man
and i'm sorry if i treat you like a maintainance plan
nothin gets me down now, man it's gettin loud out
i'm shaking in the downtown, here's a little shoutout, yeah

girl you know you're startin to really harm
and your stars are shootin up and down my arm
i've been thinkin all about what you said about my karma
