No walls, can keep me protected
No sleep, nothing in between me and the rain
And you can't save me now
I'm in the grip of a hurricane
I'm going to blow myself away

I'm going out, I'm going to drink myself to death
And in the crowd, I see you with someone else
I brace myself, because I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse

No home, I don't want shelter
No calm, nothing to keep me from the storm
...
