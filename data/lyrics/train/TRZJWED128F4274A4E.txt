My rope all freezy, dope on the TV
Ecstasy especially out the GT
You next to me, you best to be holdin? somethin? too
Least you can say, you let somethin? fly when somethin? flew

These niggaz get hit and call they lawyer
And try to sue you, that's a bitch nigga for ya
I'm tough like Mayoga and De La Hoya, I saw ya
Man, niggaz'll stack nines for that Cola

Cause zips in my shit, I don't grow stems
Him got 14 karats, carrots and gold rims
Why say somethin? about my name?
Don't jump out the window, it's safer jumpin? out a plane

I can't ditch my bitch, it's somethin? 'bout her brain
If she put her mind to it she could suck out a vein
You don't want a lead shower, stay the fuck out the rain
There's so much ammo niggaz don't gotta aim

You don't get a warnin?, there's no heads up when it's on
Here it comes, ready or not
Don't be out there snorin?, one eye blink and you're gone
Keep it cocked and ready to pop

The man makes no mistakes, it's been on since the day I was born
Stop drop or get lead in your knot
I'm known in hip-hop but I'm still ridin? around with my chrome
Here it comes, ready or not
