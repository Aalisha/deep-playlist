(.man.)
whoahh
(keyshia cole)
yeahh superstar, whoa superstar, talk to me baby

(one two three four)

rollin wit my windows dropped
wind blowin out my six o clock
then this feelin came over me
had to find myself a pretty young thing

(one two three four)

so i took a left on the next block
saw this shorty so i had to stop
girl was lookin as fine as can be yeah
i said do u wanna ride with me

(one two three four)

keyshia:
Your car is looking real smooth
and you looking kinda cute too
but boy i dont even know you
what the hell do u think we goin to

Girlfriend had a little spark
so I parked the car and just walked
i dont mean to disrespect love
just tryin to see what you made of
