My name is Crash
Side winding I flash like a burning flare
Don't look away 'cause I'm already in there
I've been there wherever you stare
I've been there longer than you care to remember

Buried deep inside you
Now you must step to accept all the past behind you
Pain breeding pain and it's back again
Only the scars in your brain remain

So you look for a vent, you consent to escape
What's gone and now I'm on
From the nipple to the needle to the bottle
And you're never satisfied
For these crimes you must be tried

You can't hide 'cause I am reality
Your birthright is a world of insanity
Disconnected legacy and you will never see
An end to the global savagery

Continuing to feed your desire for more
But deep down you know the truth
You'll never find what you're looking for
It's gone and you can't buy it back
And now your senses are under attack

So you act automatic and turn
To the frantic nation of addicts
Reduced to the manic, false erratic
Solemn, doped up slaves
...
