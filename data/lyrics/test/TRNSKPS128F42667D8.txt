Well, we do okay with the things God gave us
But will it be enough when it's time to save us
One in three can't read, so many mouths to feed
We just sit and wait like a loaded gun

We cloak ourselves in the great tradition
The United States of acquisition
Every man for himself, it's just me and no one else
Will we ever learn there's a price to pay

America the free, wake up from your fantasy
Is the nation so divided we can't see
That there's work to be done, somethin' there for everyone
I know I'll start with me
