some folks try
to multiply
from sunrise to sunset
leave behind
more of their kind
so no one will forget
but that ain't where I'm coming from - today
those easy girls don't turn me on - anyway
I wanna know where my pride has gone
the party's over
caught in a dream
inside this world machine
teachers teach
and preachers preach
of spiritual evolution
but this big I am
...
