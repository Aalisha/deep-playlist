Aggravation, fuelin' me
Money powered, hypocracy
I have no feelings, you're much the same
We have no feelings, we feel no pain!

I am numb to all I see
This the way it has to be
Gone is hope, gone is need
I know! stone don't bleed

What's it worth? if I die
What's the reason? they all cry
I have no feelings, too much the same
...
