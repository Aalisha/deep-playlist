My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love is stronger

My love is stronger
My love is stronger

My love is, my love is
My love is stronger, stronger
My love is, my love is
My love is stronger, stronger

If you think you stand alone
You've got a lot to learn
Because as long as there's one breath left in me
You'll always have someone to turn to

You're looking through that storm
There's a whirlwind in your mind
When you need a little shelter
You can run to these arms of mine

My love is stronger than your pain, stronger than your fear
Sweet enough to wash the salt from your tears
