How can you stand there smiling
After all you've done
You know it seems to make you happy
When you've hurt someone
Twice before you fooled me
With your deceiving and lying
Come in and close the door
One more time, one more time

Yeah. you've been gone so long
No one knows where
And you said that you still love me
Then show me you care
Because you've got what it takes, sweet mama
To make a man feel fine
