Take the world - just pay the price
For all the things that we need to be someone
Strange we call it a paradise
We obey like soldiers in user-military
I believe in what I feel
It tastes like sugar but it`s poison
That is dazing our minds

So you think you are alone
And you need something that pretends
You are someone
Your gold is only painted glass
