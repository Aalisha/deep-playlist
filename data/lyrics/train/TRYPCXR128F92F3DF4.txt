When we come through, y'all better move
All up in the club, y'all feelin? good
So get the fuck up, better get the fuck up
See, y'all don? t understand, us niggas don? t be playin?
Henny in the cup, take it to the brain
Get the fuck up, better get the fuck up

It? s a quarter to double 04
Who? s knockin? at my window?
Them bimbo? s and timbo? s
'Bout to tear up the club and rock the pavement
But oh, shit, I got my nigga in the basement

These niggas be actin? funny
Approachin? us like we dummies
I dare you to touch my body
Give you a run for your money

Back the fuck up
Brother, back the fuck up

My groupies are in the lobby
I hop on my Kawasaki
But nothin? ain? t gonna stop me
From shakin? my sexy body

Tonight, my girls, we rollin? deep
And when we make that entrance
You better see you out ya seats

When we come through, y'all better move
...
