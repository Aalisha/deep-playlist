Sugar, come on, it's time we go to bed
Darlin' rest your weary aching head
Lay those burdens down
They'll be here when morning rolls around

Baby, it's not always an easy fix
Some seasons you'll just have to deal with
But it's not the end of the world
I am here; I'm still your girl

So if the sky should fall
If it decides to break
Know that we've got it
We've got what it takes
Know that we've got it.

Sugar don't fret go only what you can
...
