Here comes the Inquisition
On wings of Doom they ride
Here comes the Hand of God
Attacking from all sides

The Book of Death has opened
Your name is carved inside
Your soul will burn forever
Forever you will fry

[Chorus:]
Cry you bastard, kneel before us, heed our godly Word
We'll break your will, we own your soul, we are the men of God
Your dreams, your hopes are now controlled, beware the Holy See
Your mind will lie in torment, you'll never be set free
We are the law, the only truth, the one and only path
They who won't follow will be damned, bow to the God of Wrath
