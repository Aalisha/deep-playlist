We're a ship without a storm the cold without the warm light inside the darkness that it needs yeah
We're a laugh without a tear the hope without the fear we are coming home
We're off to the witch we may never never never come home but the magic that we'll feel is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross the throw before the toss you can release yourself but the only way is down

We don't come alone we are fire we are stone we're the hand that writes then quickly moves away
We'll know for the first time if we're evil or divine we're the last in line yeah we're the last in line
Two eyes from the east it's the angel or the beast and the answer lies between the good and bad
