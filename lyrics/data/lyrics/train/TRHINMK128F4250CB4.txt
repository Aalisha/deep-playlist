A final departure - from this world we know
A race lost in a dreamworld
We've reaped the seeds we've sown
One fatal error - of the human race
We're burning our candles
As we end up in flames
This is the final stage
The end of human race
Lets crawl back into our caves
Let us arise, the sun sets dawn
Another era of life will be born
We'll end this story but we carry on - somewhere, somehow...
Let us arise, the sun sets dawn
...
