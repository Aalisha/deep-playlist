Five o' clock smokestacks 15th, check's fat
Hacked off, backed up
Hurry up and wait on the interstate
Irate, tailgate tight
Yeah, nothin' but brake lights
High rise concrete, painted up city street
Fed up, red tape, add another lane
Make it more insane, more strain
Starbucksed up
Man, I know where I'm pointin' my truck

[Chorus]
Out in the country, where the world turns green
There's a pretty girl waitin' on a front porch swing
The lazy river is a-windin' around
With a cane pole bobber goin' down (goin' down)
Time is sweeter than a buttermilk pie
And the people of the steeple and the steeple don't lie
...
