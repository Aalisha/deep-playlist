Alisha's Attic
Japanese Dream
He's A Rebel
(the crystals)

See the way he walks down the street
Watch the way he shuffles his feet

How he holds his head up high
When he goes walking by
He's my guy

If he holds my hand, i'm so proud
¡®cause he's not just one of the crowd

I think he's always the one to try
