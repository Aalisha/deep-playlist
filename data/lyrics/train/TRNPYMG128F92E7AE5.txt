Your heart I seek to find
With Your hands You fashioned mine
Let me be used by You
To carry out the truth

To the ends of the earth
'Til everyone's heard
My mended heart will share Your words
I will tell the world that You are God

I will run, I will fly
I will live to be a sacrifice
Through it all I'll rise above
Unafraid I will face what comes

I will run, I will fly
And for my faith I'll live and die
I'll be strong, I will press on
For the sake of Your beautiful name
Your beautiful name
