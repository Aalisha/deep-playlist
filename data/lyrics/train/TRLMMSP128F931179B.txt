The storms of life will blow
They're sure to come and go
They meet us all at a time
When I'm calm and doing fine

But the Captain of my soul
He's always on board
He rocks me in His arms
While riding through the storm

While riding through the storm
Jesus holds me in His arms
I am not afraid
Of the stormy winds and the waves

Though the tides become high
He holds me while I ride
I found safety in His arms
...
