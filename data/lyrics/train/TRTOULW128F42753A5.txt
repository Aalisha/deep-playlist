Rays and waves surround you
since the first day of youth.
And it's so natural for you.
Natural state where your body grew.
But now it just appear so obvious.
Living in a dreamfall.
Virtual reality is your world.
I thought it can't be true but it's so real.

Lost inside a frame.
A world created to tame your mind-sphere.
Living as a light-wave
in hollow worlds without an exit.
I would run away
but all just stay the same
...
