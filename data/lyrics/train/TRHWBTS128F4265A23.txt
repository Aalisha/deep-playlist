From the first time
That I saw you
I wanted nothing
But to make you mine
Now there's this girl
With milk white hands
And on her finger
Your wedding band shines
Still you tempt me
With your kisses
Still you tempt me
With your charm
Ain't gonna struggle
No more with this
Tonight I'm gonna lie
Down in your arms
And all my fear
And all my sorrow
It will disappear
I'll do the right thing
Come tomorrow
But tonight
I'm gonna stay right here
...
