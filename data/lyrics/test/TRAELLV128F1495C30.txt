This is what you see when you look in my direction:
Incandescent corsets draw eyes tight like wires
This is how it feels, calling out but no one even hears
The signals that we send over the air
Over the air
Over the air
Over the air

When you say my name
I want to split it from your lips
And hide like whispers in the rain
When you say (when you say)
My name (when you say it)
I want to stop it in your lungs
And collect all of your blood to put in the radio

Is this how it feels
When you don't even fit into your own skin?
And it's getting tighter
...
