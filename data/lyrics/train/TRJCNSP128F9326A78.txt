Yeah!
Come on!

Do you remember what we use to have
As if all our dreams were possible
All that existed was you and I
But distance has torn us apart

Forgive me for all that I done wrong
Lead me back to where my heart belongs

Can we start again?
Go back in time to where we started
Can we start again?
What we have can't be discarded
