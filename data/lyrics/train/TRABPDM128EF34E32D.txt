Come on honey, it don't matter no more
Let your lovin' shine down on me
Come on honey, well it don't matter no more
Let your lovin' shine down on me, aha
Have you been hurt by some girl
Who came to take you for a ride
It seems when you woke up one mornin'
She was not there by your side
Well I'm not the kind who whispers into your ear
The words that you want to hear
Then she just disappears, whoa
Someday you'll see that I'm devoted to you, oh
