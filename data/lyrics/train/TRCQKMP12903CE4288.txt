"Good evening sports fans and welcome to what should
Prove to be the best game of the year.
Hello everyone, I'm johnny bigmouth, welcoming you to
The final game of the world championship.
We're expecting to see one helluva game tonight,
There's no love lost between these two teams.
Each drawing endless amounts of penalties:
We've had fights, cheap shots, name calling - everything we could ask for...
So now, we take you live and play... the game".
You gave it your all, you gave all you've got
You reached for the limit, you pushed till you dropped
You scratched and you clawed, you spilled out your guts
You gave them your oath and you signed it in blood
Bent over backwards, your body is sore
