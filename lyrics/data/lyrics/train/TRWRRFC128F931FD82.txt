Give it to mama
Give it give it
Give it to mama mama (oh)
Give it
Give it to mama mama
For some strange reason (huh)
You done pleasin me like it's ok (Oh oh ooooh)
Like a perm that's been left too long
It's like a burn
The result is it just won't take (Oh oh ooooh)
I can see
Now it's all coming so clear to me now
I can see
Misinterpreted all of my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you
Then I can't do
My stock just went up over 2 million
So if you want to (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (want to, want to) (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
So if you want to (uh uh huh uh uh)
You got the green light (uh uh huh uh uh)
Give it to mama
Go go go goooo
Go go go goooo
