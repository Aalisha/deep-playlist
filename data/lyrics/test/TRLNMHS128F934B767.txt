Twisting the knife
Inside my head
How long will it take
Until I break
White cold empty room
Forced to enter
Into the walls

The rope
Slits my wrists
Is now an enemy
Voices clings

Hold your breath
The fumes
Ripped from my inner part

Nailed down
No reason to live
Nailed down
Nailed down
By fear of insanity

One
Nailed down
Reason to die
...
