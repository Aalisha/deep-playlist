All night long
I'm horny all night long
I'm horny all night long
I'm horny all night long
I'm horny all night long
I'm horny all night long
I'm horny all night long
You got me horny in the morning and you know
I try to call you but I can't find the telephone
I sent a message through the Internet but it rejected
I wrote a letter and I sent it with the post
The post, it takes so long, so I've got to sing this song
To let you know how I feel, what's the deal, baby
And I can't wait for you and the things you make me do
My heart is ringing, so I'm singing this song for you
I'm horny, horny, horny, horny
