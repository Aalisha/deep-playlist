The old days have gone that had use for a man
Who supported his lairdship, protecting his land
Who in times of unrest, he would have dies for his lord
Now the soldiers of England have taken his broad sword

And there's fire in the glen, fire in the glen
But no fire in the eyes of our Highland men

And the laird has a smile for the makers of graves
For the builders of empires and the keepers of slaves
For he kept his great home losing nothing but pride
