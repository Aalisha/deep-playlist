Withered away
I see it everyday
Complacence desecrates
The fabric of our lives

Emptiness fills inside me
Bitterness has denied me
Faith that this world
Could ever really give a shit

When I feel it
Come falling
I turn you away

I hear the things that you found
Might leave a face without a sound
Don't push my back against the wall
This iron strength will never fall
Will never
