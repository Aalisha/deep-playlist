Yeah, every night I rock myself to sleep
Every night I rock myself to sleep
Every night I rock myself to sleep
Thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you

Every night I rock myself to sleep
Every night I rock myself to sleep
Every night I rock myself to sleep
Thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you

And I wanna say, it's not the same since you went away
And it's not right, you're not here with me tonight
And it's a crime, just lying here, wasting my precious time
I'm so lonely and I'm so blue, thinkin' 'bout the things I could do to you

Every night I rock myself to sleep
...
