Why you have to leave?
Please stay

Forgive me if I think
That you're making a bad decision
Forgive me if I try
Please don't go away

Don't blame me if I want
The two of us to stay together
So let me tell you why

If only tonight
If this is all I got
If I can't have your love
I won't get back up this time

If only tonight
I'll race you to the sun
Before the morning comes
If I can't change your mind
It's only tonight

And tomorrow you're gone
And we're just a song
I'm singing alone

And tomorrow you're gone
And we're just a song
...
