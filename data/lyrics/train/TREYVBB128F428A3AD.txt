Never, never, never again
Will Tommy die for you

Over the top the unknown go
Into a land where no man lives
Say goodbye to his friends
Cause they will never see Tommy again
General, general on the top of the hill
Middle class man whose blood won't spill
Kept out of the action, out of harm's way
Cause he's gonna find that Tommy's dead
...
