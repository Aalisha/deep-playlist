This is where I'll be so heavenly
So come and dance with me, Michael
So sexy, I'm sexy
So come and dance with me, Michael
I'm all that you see, you wanna see
So come and dance with me, Michael
So close now, so close now
So come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

Michael, you're the boy with all the leather hips
Sticky hair, sticky hips, stubble on my sticky lips
Michael, you're the only one I'd ever want
Only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want

Beautiful boys on a beautiful dance floor
