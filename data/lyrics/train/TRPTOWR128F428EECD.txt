To the father and the son who never talk,
Come back home
To the husband and the wife who are both at fault,
Come back home
Forget the past and start again
Face to face and make amends.

Calling out around the world
Every heartbroken boy, every lonely girl
Take what's right and forgive what's wrong
I'm calling all hearts to come back home.
