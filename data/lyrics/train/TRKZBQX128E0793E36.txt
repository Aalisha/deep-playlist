(Keith, Luccketta, Hannon)

Every day, yeah yeah, I wait till the morning light
Ooh with a feeling, yeah yeah, something here ain't right
When I think about it now, oh baby, ooh
When I think about all the good times we had
I knew there was something wrong, there was no chance for me and you

Oh now, now I try to tell you baby, there ain't nothing we can do
'Cos I'm no good for you, oh no baby, you're no good for me
