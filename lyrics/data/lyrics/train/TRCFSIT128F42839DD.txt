I wasn't trying to see
But I was looking around
I wasn't trying to see
But I was looking around
I try to uphold what tears me up from inside
I am all and still I fail
When everything falls apart
Your words of disdain prevails
We're all like hollow phantoms
In a pitiful state where numbness is a fate

All my pain through all of my life
My heart is cold

I wasn't trying to hide
But I was dying inside
I wasn't trying to hide
...
