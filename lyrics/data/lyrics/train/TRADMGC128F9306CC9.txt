P O P E
pope dope

Slow and steady
Bars rain down like confetti
trained for this day
ready before they said ready
On the road to riches and am heading for the headies
I play the game of thrones better than lena headey
Adrenaline flows, recharged flows, we charged with blows
this from a nigga with less highs
and many lows
lord knows, i've been running with my grind
since i was nine, around the time
eminem rapped about columbine
forgive me mama
but i'm about to bust
bust a nut on this beat to make a hit is a must
and am a better survivor tham those on the show lost
cos i go all intel whem i process my thoughts
Theres no king on the throne
they heatd me amd abdicated
Those who came resisting got decapitated
Those who stood afar could do no more than keep hating
how long we waited?
well thats a question for the ages
we came through the stages
beat boxing, flows dropping
and we're still bumping
16 bars, a 12 iron a sledge hammer
nigga and a cup of coffee
Dont come at me unless your mama's got you booked a coffin

I'm a beat killer
