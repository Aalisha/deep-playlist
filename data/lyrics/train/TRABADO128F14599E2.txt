If you see me running through some streets in life
Baby its alright, dont even pay me no mind
Im just looking for, for my yesterday
So my only memories, I watch them fade and fade away
The night will come and the dawn will fall
Put that falling bird, put it back in its next
And the bird would sing, sing out loud
