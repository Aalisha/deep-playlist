Walking down the road this life is on
The narrow path I try to stay
But I must confess I have a tendency to stray
Well, I'd love to call it a mistake
A momentary lapse of faith
But the truth is sometimes I feel that I'm being dragged away

By the other side that people never see
A war is on between the good and bad inside of me.

So why do I do all the things that I do
When I want to do what is right?
Change this wicked heart of mine
Let me walk with you in the new life. Yeah
