Let me tell you about Colleen
My best friend since I was three
She always had a taste for dangerous things
Her scandalous tongue was extreme
I was always the one left holding the bag
Smiling and covering her tracks
Best friends, they always do that

She was the first to smoke a cigarette
She once let me watch her make love
It was the kind of balance made by kings
She took it all, but left me some
I guess I always thought she'd have my back
But it didn't work out like that
The moment I laid eyes on Jack

CHORUS
