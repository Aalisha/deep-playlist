I went to a party
The party came to nothing
I got there early and I drank for dear life
I met a girl there
She looked like the Virgin Mary
She had a tatoo that looked like a gun
I'm sure that there were other people at this party
But I couldn't tell you who and neither could she
She had a stun-gun, a lasso, and a tractor beam
And we were locked on target when I threw away my keys

And I wouldn't trade that night for a sky-blue '57
By seven come eleven we were leanin' on the dawn
Skippin past the salt pillars
Where everybody turns back
Hell-bent and heart-first into the great long gone

Lazy drunken moon
Passed out in the branches
A fit of stars in my favorite piece of sky
...
