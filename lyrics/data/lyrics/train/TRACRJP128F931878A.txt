So suddenly, you seem to be
So into me, Well i can see
You're not fooling anyone.

you wait for me
We'll wait and see
The apathy
You ask for me
Is that everything that you want?

I thought i should tell you
My mistake was falling in
I thought i should tell you

No, I want you to go.
Dont need you to say that you want me,
So what if you, what if you go?
This son that you know
Dont care if you say that you'll leave me,
So what if you, what if you go?
