Yeah-yeah
Whoa...

Oh...
Yeah...
Yeah yeah yeah

It's like your blood runs through me baby
(Baby)
And I can't get you out of my vein
A lust for you electric lady
(Whoa...)
The affliction to my pain

And the skies will fall
Without you I'm inside of a hurricane
I would sell my soul
No, no-no-no, no-no-no, no

I need mercy It's the insanity eating up the man in me, girl
I need mercy
All of my fire's, my burning desire's, for you, see
I need mercy
And it's just so painful to sit here and think about you with them, oh no
I need mercy
I pray one day that you will be with me, girl, I would never let you go

I...
Bloodshot eyes and I'm so wasted
...
