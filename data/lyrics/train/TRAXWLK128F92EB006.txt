There are things that I'll never understand
The road I've walked that has made me who I am
Reminiscing with the picture on the wall again
Reminding me just how far away I've been

I'm looking to lay my burdens down
They're something I can't carry anymore
I'm longing to lay my body down
Beside still waters and find rest for my soul

My knees are weak and my mind is tired
