Billy ran away from his home to find away to live in peace
His Mama didn't give a damn about him
His Papa's on the run from the Police

When Billy hit the city - the city hit Billy
No one needs you when your down and out
Then one kind guy with the painted eyes
Pi@ked him up and bailed him out

Under one roof sharing one room
Nobody cared about them under one roof
Sharing one room daring the world to part them

Billy found it hard to find a job to make some pay
AII day looking round
getting me down I was being turned away
And Johnny was the only one who didn't talk down
