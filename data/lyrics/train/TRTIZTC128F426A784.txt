I see forever when I look in your eyes
You're all I ever wanted
I always want you to be mine

Let's make a promise till the end of time
We'll always be together
And our love will never die

So here we are face to face
And heart to heart
I want you to know we will
Never be apart
Now I believe that wishes can come true
'Cause I see my whole world, I see only you
When I look into your eyes
