the way you looked at me
you blew your secrecy
I know what you've got on your mind
you know I want you, too
so hard to keep my cool
but it's my heart that's on the line

cupid is shooting his arrow
I'm standing in the line of fire
should I follow you into the shadows
and surrender to this desire

[CHORUS:]
(if I say yes) if I say yes
want you to treat me right
won't settle for less than the best of you
...
