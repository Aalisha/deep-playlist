[50 Cent]
I don't wan' talk about it (50)
Man I don't wanna talk about it (nah)
Man I don't wan' talk about it (yeah)
And I don't wanna talk about it (wooo-oooh!)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I make millions quick and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I shoot a nigga kid and I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I fuck the baddest bitches, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it
I'm still flippin chickens, I don't wan' talk about it
Nah I don't wanna talk about it

[50 Cent]
These niggaz police
Go 'head, ask me what I'm ridin in so I can say the Enzo
My bitch roll down the window so I could feel the wind blow
Got big enough for me to fiddle on my kinfolk
Bitches with me cruisin, Moulin Rouge and
They fuckin and they strippin nigga, I ain't even trippin nigga
Me I handle business; God's my only witness
Watchin homicide, sayin "Who the fuck did this?"
Me I run the street mayne, so I keep the heat mayne
Sews what you reap, when you fuck with the elite mayne
