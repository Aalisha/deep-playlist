Full moon glow,
Steels the light,
When headless horsemen ride,
In the distance hellhounds cry,
And banshee wails arise,
Turn your fear into fantasy,
Concealing all the pain,
You the victim of perfection,
The dark side gets it's way,
The dark side gets it's way

Ain't no use singing the blues,
Ani't no one finding no clues,
And you can't walk away,
No stopping, No escape

[Chorus]
Tired eyes you cannot fight,
The body snatcher comes tonight,
Wired mind embrace the sight,
The body snatcher comes tonight

Creeping shadows cross the walls,
...
