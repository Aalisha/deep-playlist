I used to go out to parties and stand around;
'cause I was too nervous to really get down.
But my body yearned to be free.
I got up on the floor, boy,
so somebody could choose me.
No more standin' upside the wall.
I have got myself together, baby,
now I'm havin' a ball.
Long as you're groovin' theres' always a chance
somebody watchin' might wanna make romance.

Move your body, move baby, and dance all night,
...
