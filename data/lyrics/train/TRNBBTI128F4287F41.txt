(Phyllis)
Funny how love goes
I wish I had never met you
(Damon)
I wish I had never seen your face
(Phyllis)
Cause now I can't forget you
(Damon)
The memory of you is too much for me to take

(Phyllis)
There was a time when you were mine
I couldn't wait to see you, hold you in my arms

(Damon)
Oh how I would yearn
And my heart would burn with love for you, you

(Phyllis)
You and me we got along so good
I thought our love would last forever

(Damon)
Suddenly things changed
Now the mere mention of your name

(Phyllis)
Makes me sad and blue
Oh I'm missing you
