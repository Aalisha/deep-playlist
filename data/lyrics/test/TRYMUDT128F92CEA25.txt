eyes like an angel 
blood runs like a whore 
you put your hands on my chest to push yourslef 
oh so higher never looking back on the holes you left 
no matter how many big words that you use 
i have something for you 
under my bed and i'm playing our song 
its not enough to feel you from the inside 
...
