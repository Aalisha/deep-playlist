Something's wrong with my radio

Punch my card at five o'clock
Friday night and I'm ready to rock
Hit the switch, spin the dial
Can't find nothing with a rockin' style

Something's wrong with my radio
It says "Slow down" I say "Go"
They might stare, but baby I don't care
We're gonna rock, rock, rock

Grease my hair count my dough
...
