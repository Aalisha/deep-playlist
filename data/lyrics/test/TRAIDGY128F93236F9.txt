I called to say - I'm working late tonight
to cancel our dinner date
but she just said - That's alright
and just like that she makes some other plans
saw a movie with a couple friends
had herself a ball
oh cause afterall

she's her own woman
without me, she does fine
she's her own woman
wo-ho, but she's mine

I couldn't tell you even if you had a gun to my head
...
