Seen it in my head, burning my heart
Seen it in my past, back in my home
Doesn't make sense, see her again
I don't, know
I felt it for some time, ever not at all
Poison in my head, gun love hurts
I'm not looking for love, but it's hard to resist
I don't recall, me and mistakes

She's the only one, that's the best I've had
I found her in a dream, looking for me
This heart's on fire, I'll bring myself
...
