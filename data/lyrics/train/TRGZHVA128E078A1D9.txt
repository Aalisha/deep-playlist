One, two, three, four
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh yeah)

You gave me something like loving
And took me in so soon
You took my feelings for nothing
Came back at noon
And just maybe I'm ready
To show myself to you

So if I lose my patience
You must try to understand (try to understand)
And if I lose my patience, oh yeah

'Cause you make me feel
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause you make me feel wild
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You touch my inner smile
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You got me in the mood
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
