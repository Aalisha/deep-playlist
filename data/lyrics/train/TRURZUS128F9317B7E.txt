Her eyes are so bright, and she likes the dark,
I hate when she cries cause it tears me apart,
What a beautiful mind, something I'm not,
Her words are refreshing like days in the park,
But I'm growing tired of being alone,
I've spent my whole life in a world of my own,
I'm bruised with stories, most of them boring,
But I'd tell them if you'd like to know

Are you getting this?
And am I being clear?
I'm getting out of here

Excuse me, may I have your attention?
