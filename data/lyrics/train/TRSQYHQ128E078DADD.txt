Love is but the song we sing
Fear? s the way we die
You can make the mountain dream
Or make the angels cry
Know the dove is on the wing
And you need not know why

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try and love one another right now

Mmm ...

Some will come and some will go
We will surely pass
...
