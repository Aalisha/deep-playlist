Frantic minds are terrified
Life lies in a grave
Silent death rides high above
On the wings of revelation

Multi death from chemicals
Arrogance has won
Annihilation must be swift
Destroy without destruction

Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
Awaiting the mass genocide
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
Bodies lie dormant, no life
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell
Demons not ready to die
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie

Chemical warfare

Artificial fucking peace
Line up in a death row
Generals in their slow defeat
Diminished from this hell
...
