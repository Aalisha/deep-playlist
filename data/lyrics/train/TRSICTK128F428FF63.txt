When you wake up in bed
And your heart's in a hell of a mess babe
When it's saturday a.m
And your body is sinking, it's over
Well I got a cure for what you've feeling
Just call me and I'll come healing
Take my head you won't drown
There's a new kid in town
And he's been playin' around
He's got his eye on pretty sundays and mondays
I guess it looks like he's found
Gareth Gates New Kid In Town Lyrics
The only new girl in town
But is saturday the one day
She'll say, come around?
