Crawled out of the park to eat her to a
Stairwell would I fall to please her
Just to tear this out of my belly forever
Cause I'm still hooked to the light forever
I can do it if your there
I could screw it when your there
Bless them with the arrogant brandos
Leave your heart stisched in a hundred pieces
If it's not wet then you shouldon't be doing it
She's no ***** she's far too rich
And I can do it when she's there
And It's only when your there
All these amazing frustrations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be said
Oh these amazing sensations
Are as perfect as *************
Hardly need to be sad
