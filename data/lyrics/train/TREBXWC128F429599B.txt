woman lives
woman learns
woman burns her fingers in love once

man comes 
man goes
man stumbles over and over

someone won't call
are we stuck in the middle
hopelessly spinning

you don't have to understand me
we're not the same
and who would have thought it feels this way
but everytime you touch me i say it again
thank god i was born woman
