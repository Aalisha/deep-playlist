Hey angel can we dance on the edge of this disaster?
Can we move on in spite of what we miss?
We're gasping suffocating trying to exist
The escape it's all a lie the agony persists

The trauma's lead to a bottomless despair
But i'd rather feel the sorrow
Than act like i don't care

So breath in
If i'm supposed to feel this

And taste this sweet disaster

I'm building calluses where i'm supposed to feel
