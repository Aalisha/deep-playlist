The lord above made the world for us but the
Devil made Las Vegas-
Oh Las Vegas you be the death of me city of sin
Oh what a mes i'm in look what you've done to me
Oh Las Vegas i'm looseing everything Why do i
Stay when every game play i just get deeper in

Hey Las Vegas Can nothing save us from you
Night after night watching the weel go round
Hey Las Vegas the devil gave us to you one
Of these days i'm gonna burn you down
