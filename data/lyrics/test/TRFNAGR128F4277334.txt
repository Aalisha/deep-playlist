Yo, one two one two Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
It's the Wu, creepin in the shadows Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang)
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
Sir I, Excalibur
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang) 2X
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
Yo, aiyyo my rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
My grenades raid the airwaves
catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Born master
with the faster blade,
track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones
bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction
, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original
, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
...
