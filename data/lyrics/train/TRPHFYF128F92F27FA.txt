[Chorus:]

If this is a game, then I don't want to play.
This means too much to me and you're so far away.
But I will wait for you.
We can see this through.
Now it's up to you.
Please tell me, you feel the same way too.
[Verse 1:]

A simple touch, the look in your eye, the sound of your voice.
They do something to me I've never felt but I don't ever want to leave.
[Bridge:]

Looks like it's happened to me once again.
Things are over before they started, another goodbye,
unless you want to... try and I'll promise you I'll try.
[Chorus:]
