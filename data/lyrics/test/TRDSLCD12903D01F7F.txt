The body's a temple, that's what we're taught
I've treated this one like an old honky-tonk
Greasy cheeseburgers and cheap cigarettes
One day they'll get me if they ain't got me yet

'Cause I'm living, in fast forward
A hillbilly rock star out of control
I'm living, in fast forward
Now I need to rewind real slow

My friends all grew up, they settled down
Built nice little houses on the outskirts of town
They work in their office, drive SUV's
They pray for their babies and they worry 'bout me
