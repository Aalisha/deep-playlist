Yeah, yeah
Realism of life in actuality
Uh huh,
Yeah
I wanna tell you
Uh huh
Fuck who's the baddest, only the real could relate
Bigboys,
Nothing changed, they know
The Players of the game
Realism of life in actually
The Pioneers
I wanna tell you
This is the essence right here
Fuck who's the baddest, only the real could relate
AZiatic,
Nothing changed, they know
I rep pure realness younahmean?
I wanna tell you
For the deceased, and those still carrying the torch
Hold your head though, ya heard?
Once again
I wanna tell you
Realism of life in actuality
I wanna tell you
Fuck who's the baddest, only the real could relate
Nothing changed, they know
Realism of life in actually

I know, it get kinda hard sometimes
we all looking for some kind of, outlet 
to plug into, but ahh,

From the corners of street, in every hood and every ghetto
Every hood
I'm the proof of what could be, if you try
If you wanna try
It's on you
