Where are you
When I am needing you?
So far away
So far away
I think you are the most important
To me, to me
To me, to me
My sunken footsteps put theirselves on
Through this gallery of deceased
I think their lives must be deceived
Like the sham nowadays
Where are you?
So far away
It makes no sense
It makes no sense at all

Where are you?
Where are you?
