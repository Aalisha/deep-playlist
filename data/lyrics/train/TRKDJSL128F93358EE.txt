I call you from the station
But you don't have the time
The time is tickling closer
To the end of the line
How can I trust the feelings
In a telephone call
The road keeps getting longer
But there's no signs at all
I can formulate a plan to keep
You quiet and appeased
Something in me tells me
There are no guarantees
...
