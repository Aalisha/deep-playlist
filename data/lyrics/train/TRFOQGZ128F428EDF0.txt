She got those watchpocket blues
She cried like Mary at the manger
Ain't got time to lose

No, don't care if I'm right
Baby, I'm just dying all the time
Be born again, I'll fall and rise
I can't help it, no, can't help it

Send me back to heaven
The cuffs still on my brain
Prising through bad vision
I stagger from the pain

Help me make it easy coming down
Help me make it easy with the sound
Sound of voices raises celebration
...
