Now here comes counter-action for satisfaction
Ya, Someone come fe rock the nation
Give you like a medicine injection, you know?
Do it Jah
Ca' Natty sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Then he launch an attack and dem a two boy drop
He launch and attack and dem a two boy drop

Natty trod into the jungles of Africa
Cho, Natty trod into the jungles of Africa
He open the Bible so he read of a chapter
Started to chant up the roots and culture
Tell it to the brothers and he tell it to the sister

He sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
He sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Man you coulda never hide from Jah
Cho man I said you coulda never hide from Jah

Come on I say you get away from man but you no get away from Jah
you get away from man but you no get away from Jah
Say you coulda never hide from Jah
Come on you say you coulda never hide from Jah
