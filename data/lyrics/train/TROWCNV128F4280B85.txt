I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
So I've got a plan
I'm gonna find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

Cause ever since I've tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

Is there a God?
