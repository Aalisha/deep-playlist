Someone touched me late last night
Someone tried to tie me down
Passing by at such a height
Smashing down the laughing clown

Don't tell me I'm looking well
For the truth will never tell
Cut me down, let me sleep
Promises I'll never, never keep

Something moved me in the night
Someone tried to pin me down
Asking questions, who was right
Telling me I wear the crown

Don't ask me what's on my mind
For the truth you'll never ever find
...
