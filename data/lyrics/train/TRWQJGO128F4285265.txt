Hey Hey Stranger
I hear that they call you the lone ranger
They say you love to live in the saddle
Is it true you want to high ho my silver
Giddy up you can try lawd have mercy
I will take that ride with you
I'm mighty thirsty

For love any kind of love but I do prefer
That it be good love
Hey hey stranger
