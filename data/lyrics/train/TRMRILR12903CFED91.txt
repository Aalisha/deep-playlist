Wasting the years,
Living the life of a shoveling alcoholic
One foot in the grave
The head in the toilet,
You should be kicked into orbit

And you should know
You will fall
God damn schizophrenic

Down you'll go
All alone
God damn King of Fools

Down, no more excuses
To hide your lies
Down, down you're going
You're so easy to despise
...
