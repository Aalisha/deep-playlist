Sha, la, la, la, sha, la, la, la
Just because you accepted
The moment that I asked you to be my girl

Sha, la, la, la, sha, la, la, la
I didn't believe that you could fall in love at first sight
I didn't think that you were a very nice girl

But I was wrong
(That was wrong)
Ooh, I was wrong
(So, so wrong)
I was wrong
(That was wrong)
I misjudged you
(Ooh, I misjudged you, baby)

You didn't hesitate
Because you didn't want to wait
You didn't know if I would ever ask you again
