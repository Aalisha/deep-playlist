People are always saying how do you do to you
and they don't know what's on your mind.
You'll get fat running on the beaten track
Cause dice can change your mind.
Well I rolled it a long the floor one night
And have you ever been a bad bad man
Caught up in the beat she had the devils dancing feet
As the tears flew to lover's eyes.

The same thing happens every morning
And I know the reason why
The sun goes down and the council lights go on
