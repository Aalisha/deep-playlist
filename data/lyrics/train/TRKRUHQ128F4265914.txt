So naive, so innocent, thrust in a world too intense
Flesh is weak but the soul is strong, and you will bleed but you'll carry on

Yes you need your pain, life is pain
I could hold your hand, but you must take your pain

I don't need sacrifice, I don't need advice
This hurt surrounds me like a dissonance
Anger is power, I use it to protect myself from insanity

You gotta go down deep down into the pain
Let it purge your soul like flesh to a razor blade
Dig down deep into the pain
Surrender, surrender, dig into euphoria

Time may never heal the wounds, hearts bleed hard even the sun cries moon
Fate is tragic just for heavens sake, the good lord giveth and taketh away

'cause you need your pain, God gave us pain
I can hold you in my arms, but I can't take away your pain

I am not long for this world please save me from myself and my discipline
Lashing out with tight fists in despair, my plight is running from reality
