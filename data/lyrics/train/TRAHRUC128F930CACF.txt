Farewell, angelina,
The bells of the crown
Have been stolen by bandits,
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles and the trumpets play slow
But farewell, angelina,
The sky is on fire, and i must go

There's no need for anger,
There's no need for blame
There's nothing to prove,
Everything's still the same
Just a table standing empty by the edge of the sea
Means farewell, angelina,
The sky is trembling, and i must leave
