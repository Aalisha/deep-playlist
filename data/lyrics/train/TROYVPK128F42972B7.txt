This town is going under

The temperature's through the floor
Your fingers are turning black
There's a crisis knocking at your door

One nine seven seven
One nine seven seven

You better try to make it home
The snow's getting too deep to drive
Your car might be a coffin

One nine seven seven
One nine seven seven

You're never gonna see the summer
This season is coming, long and hard
This town is going under
This season is going to kill us all

Catch the snowflakes little children
Count them as they bury you alive
Count them as they choke the road ways
A blizzard's coming in the year punk died
...
