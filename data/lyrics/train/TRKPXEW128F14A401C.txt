Ey would you be my prime I pay.
I urge you at the center stage
We crop my flakes and share some cake
heared you from the chevrolet.
No book you are my general-play.
General planes all booked today.
I'll find a way it's not o.k.
Stop and go and walk and stay cause

Thatâ€™s why
I 'm trying
To get down and to get over it.
So If you are broken I tune you.
We'd be a beauty couple.
Broken I tune you, too.
