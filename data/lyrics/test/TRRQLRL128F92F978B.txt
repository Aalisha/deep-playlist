Friday mourning
I am dressed in black
Douse the house lights
I'm not coming back

For years, I warned you
Through tears, I told you
Friday mourning, there comes a time
Before that breaks, this very smug mug of mine

This dawn raid soon put paid to all the things
I whispered to you at night time
And I will never stand naked in front of you or if I do
It won't be for a long time
