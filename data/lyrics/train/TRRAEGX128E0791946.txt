I went walking down the boulevard
Past the skateboards and the beggars
I was out looking in the windows
Just out walking, letting my mind roam
If she hung around too much I might take her for granted
But when I was away, she seemed an angel
The only one who really cared about me
The only one without an angle
For so long I've been lonely
Now I'm too weak to fight

I've been waiting for tonight
I've been waiting for tonight

(good night my love, sleep tight my love)
