Said she wanna take me
On some bizarre love triangle
And she want to know
Is there something that I can't handle?

Said she wanna take me
On some bizarre love triangle
And she want to know
Is there something that I can't handle?

She wanna roll, she wanna play
She want it all she said it
She wanna go hard, go all the way
Back in my car, she's all up in my ear

Saying, oh, I got a friend
Who wanna a ride?
She can do anything you like
So you decide what's on your mind

Said she wanna take me
