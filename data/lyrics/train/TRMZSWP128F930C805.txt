(Out in the street they call it murder)

[Tony Yayo:] Fuck D-Block

[Tony Yayo:]
Put your hands up
Give me that Gin and that Ginka
One false move you get sprayed up
I'm in that Range truck
David got me fuckin' blinged up
Last year I was broke now my weights up
I put that work in
Nigga you not my bretheren
44 Mag when i'm lurkin'
This is murder
Yayo is a clip inserter
I sneak in your crib like a burglar

[Whoo Kid:] BRING IT BACK

(Out in the street they call it murder)

[Tony Yayo:] Fuck D-Block

[Tony Yayo:]
