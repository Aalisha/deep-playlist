(Killah Priest)
At night the sky form over my hood like a kufi
I'm carving letters, all of 'em my Uzi
Bitch with the fat booty name Judy
Just left her boutique moonlight shines over her beauty
Bounce off the jury
Every night is like a scene straight out of a movie
It's like everyday somebody's reading the paper
Somebody's reading the eulogy
Far different from the streets elders use to see
But anyways back to the seeming desert
The heaven sent of the plant treasures
Unfamiliar pleasures
Where a fiend plays the part of the peasants
Five-percent lessons play the part of the Shepherd
We the sheep need deep
But if they knew most of us are really predators in our essence
Lower the weapon, AK's and SK's, Saviours' Day
Its saints, thugs on Church walls, now let us pray
-
(Hook)
Let us pray
Let us pray
Let us pray
