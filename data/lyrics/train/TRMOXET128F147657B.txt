Like the light was all I had
I struck the book with my last match
The candle burned so soft and slow
I felt the warmth and felt its glow

Salt tasting tears
They roll of of my lips
One for each day I'm inside this house, it's a trap
One I can't quite escape so pretend it's the place that I love

Won't let it pass me by again
Won't let it pass me by again
