At the bottom of the ocean
If you could hear me call your name
Would the changing tides
Ever turn you away?
At the top of the mountain
At the end of the day
Would you still have a place in your heart
For me to stay?

You're the only good thing
This little girl ever had
Your got to treat me like a good thing
You got to give me all the love I give you back
If you really want to love me
You got to show me that you love me like that
