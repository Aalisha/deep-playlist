Yeah - uh, uh
Def Squad, combustion mode
610 What? Huh, yeah
New York

(Heyyy heyyy) It's "Time 4 Sum Aksion"
That Redman shit the E come with, what?
The rap supreme Naseem Hamed
When I hit, the jam comin straight for the head ("Watch me!")
This be the song at hand, understand
Even though I never rocked the stage on Summer Jam
I'm in the lab makin tracks 70 grand
That get heard by crazy fans like Stan (hey man)
Who like my shit, cause I come through
Like a new German made, car for the paid
VS be the five-double-oh, S in front
No future in yo' frontin yo (?) pop the trunk
I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp (uh-huh)
The women fight, for my delight
Cause I'm the Green Eyed Bandit in the place to be
That, shock the house no doubt nigga please

Cha Cha + Erick Sermon
Y'all know we come through the club (heyyy heyyy)
Steppin like ba-boom-boom-boom-burp (heyyy heyyy)
