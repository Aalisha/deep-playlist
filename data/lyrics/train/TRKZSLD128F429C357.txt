Get with the, with the M-G-M
Get with the, with the M-G-M
Get with the, with the M-G-M
Get with
Get with the M-G-M-V-E
Guaranteed, guaranteed to blow your mind

Spinnin' out in another galaxy
My baby and me, so far away
2000 years, some kinda fantasy
My baby in the interstellar odyssey

Floating forever in zero gravity
Come together in intergalactic unity

Outer space girls
We're rockin' to the moon
Outer space girls
A universal groove
Outer space girls
G-force with a zoom
Outer space girls
Look out Venus, we'll be comin' soon

Get with the, with the M-G-M
Get with the, with the M-G-M
Get with the M-G-M-V-E

Jupiter and Mars are ahead of me
Oh, are we trippin' out or is that heaven I see?
