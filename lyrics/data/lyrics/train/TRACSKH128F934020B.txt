My understanding is zero
For the simple fact I'm not a hero
Born broke, beat up and always acting evil
I'm playin for keeps
I gots to carry my shank
And keep my hands on my thang
While I'm checkin my bank
I gots nuthin to lose
But I'd rather be six feet deep
I sing the blues
Cause I'm deep and I don't sleep
My understanding's zero watchin channel fuzz
