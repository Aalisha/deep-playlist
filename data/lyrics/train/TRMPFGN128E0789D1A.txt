Hope you're happy

I can speak about the pain you know
What you say you didn't see
I can show you all my scars you know
The ones I keep inside of me

Would that make it easier
Or would it be the same

Sorry that I could not be
As perfect as you wanted me
Just wondering what's going on in your mind
I sure hope you're fine
