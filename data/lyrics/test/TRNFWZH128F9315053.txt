I hope you're lonely without me
This is another stupid lullaby
Another stupid dream
I swear if you could feel my pain
You'd open up your arms again

Delete you from my mobile
But I just saw your photo
I'd throw it out but I don't want to
Not used to flying solo
Not used to feeling so low
I'd give you up but I can't seem to
