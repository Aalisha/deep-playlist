You say you need me
You say you care
Been looking for answers
everywhere.
It's on my mind now
It's in the air
Say will you deceive me
When I'm not there?

You're moving too fast
You're standing too still
You're not using your free will
You live in the past
Not now, yesterday
Does it have to be this way?
