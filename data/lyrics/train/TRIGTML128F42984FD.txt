So welcome to my nightmare
My heaven and my hell
This passionate contradiction
Of bitter sweet is where I dwell

You choose a day like today
To get me real upset
The more I love you, more I hate you
More it scares me to death

I can't keep fighting this battle with you
I can't hear words when you scream like you do
If I cry will you hold me just like we rehearsed?
So do I, so do I say sorry first?

I'm flawed, I'm so imperfect
