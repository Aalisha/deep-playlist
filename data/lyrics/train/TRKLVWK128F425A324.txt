(S Lipson/ K Poole)

Life
Has a funny way of trying to make
You a certain type
And making it hard
Yeah life
Is feet firmly on the ground
With a fear of flying
It's always too far
Chorus 1
It only makes me stronger
When you say I can't do it
I'll work that bit harder
When you say it's not within my grip
The barriers, I'll break them down
I'll prove myself, I'll stick around
I'll get through it all somehow
Nothing's unreachable

Life
Is full of all these empty words
