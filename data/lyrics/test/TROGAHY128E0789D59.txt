These days it seems as though
I've lived a lonely lifetime
All because I never had a girl like you
To hold me tight

And since you came around
And showed your way to me
I'm beginning to think that I'll
Never be blue anymore

Now that you're in my life
You are my brightest day
When you came, you chased my blues away

And you know you're all that I been waitin' on
And all the stars I wish upon
And so I say Thank you for bein' there
...
