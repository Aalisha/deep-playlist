I'm singin' in the rain,
Just singin' in the rain.
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again.

I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above,
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love,
...for love.

Let the stormy clouds chase
Ev'ryone from the place,
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face.

I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
...
