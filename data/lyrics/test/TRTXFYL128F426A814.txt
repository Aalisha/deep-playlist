Two sided heart pushing to face
Another walk from the start
Shifting my soul to what was heaven before and now's just a stain, a novelty no more
Passion and soul together deceiving my brain and I fall

But soon they will fade delighted by something else and now I rewind, one more time
Waiting for

All my feelings now in vain
The Divided Heart!

Tearing me apart

The divided heart
Playing it's game for all these wasted years
