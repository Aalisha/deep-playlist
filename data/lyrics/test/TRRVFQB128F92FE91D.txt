My boss thinks that I'm his tool and I guess that he is right
Uses me like the shovel in my hand
But if this shovel was as strong, it would'nt hold a doughnut nut
I guess that's why that I'm important to that man

Hard times, hard times
Knockin', knockin', knockin', knockin' on my door
Hard times, hard times
But I don't care very much anymore
Hard times, hard times

I think I'd give anything if I didn't have to work
I get so tired that I just can't take a breath
...
