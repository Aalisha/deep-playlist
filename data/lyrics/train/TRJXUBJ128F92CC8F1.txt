I see lovers in the streets walking,
without a care.
They're wearing out loud
like there's something in the air
Oooooh, and i don't care

They're treading lightly
No they, don't sink in
There's no tracks to follow
they don't care where they going
hmm

And if they're lucky and they'll,
they'll get to see and if they're
really really lucky they'll
get to feel.

And it kicks so hard,
it breaks your bones.
Cuts so deep
it hits your soul.
Tears your skin and
makes your blood flow.
It's beter that you know,
