I'm your witch doctor
Got the evil eye
Got the power of the devil
Another country die
Gonna teach you love
At the midnight hour
Gonna keep burning
Like a passing flow

HeEeeEeeEeey
HeEeeEeeEeey

Your witch doctor
Your witch doctor
Got my eyes on you

I was the one in the country
They'd begin to treat
And I got my blue-green
Wannabirds in peace
...
