Well it happened years ago
when you lived on Stanhope Road.
We listened to your sister
when she came home from school
'coz she was two years older
and she had boys in her room.
We listened outside and heard her.
Alright.
Well that was alright for a while
but soon I wanted more.
I want to see as well as hear
and so I hid inside her wardrobe.
And she came round four
and she was with some kid called David
from the garage up the road
I listened outside I heard her.
