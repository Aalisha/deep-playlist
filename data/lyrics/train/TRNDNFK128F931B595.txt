Might like you better if we slept together
Might like you better if we slept together
Might like you better if we slept together
Might like you better if we slept together

I might like you better, baby
Let's get together, baby
Wanna hold you, get to know you
Show you what I got in my sweater, baby

Love the red hair, the bitch in charge
And if you set a lot of her I make you see stars
Get large, get hard, go fuck, go far
When I touch it, watch it, fuck it, see my money and my I

I might like you better, baby
Let's get together, baby
Wanna hold you, get to know you
Show you what I got in my sweater, baby

Love the red hair, the bitch in charge
And if you set a lot of her I make you see stars
Get large, get hard, go fuck, go far
When I touch it, watch it, fuck it, see my money and my I

Ride no lie just get inside me
Like you better if you just ride me
