I feel us burning infinite alright
'cause I have been waiting all my life
to hear the words you say
tonight I'm born again

I feel an ease inside my heart alirght
how do you feel? how does it feel
to be inspriring water from a stone?
indeed I'm born again
I am new again
and I feel alive

for the first time 
I must make you my wife
'cause I've lived too long already gone, in this life
I have you
