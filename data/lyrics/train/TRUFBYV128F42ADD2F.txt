All these promises won't turn golden, until you touch them

It's permanent
Nothing is permanent
It's permanent
We'll be watching your back
Following indecision's lasting for years
Indecision's lasting for years

Some time ago memories in my head are starting again
Speak it fast don't move in slow
Running through the country
Maybe they will find me
