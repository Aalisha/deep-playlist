They've left me broken,
But I never give up my dreams.
The tears are spoken only in screams.
The gods have left me in this world of unbelief.
They gave me this live. Then hung me as a thief.

Calling down the rain
To crumble the earth away.
Calling down the rain
I will be back today.

They promised me wonders, I was dead in the ditch.
They gave me magic, and burned me as a witch.
