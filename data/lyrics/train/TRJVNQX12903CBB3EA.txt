See I've been here for thirty-some years
Lookin' at myself in the same dirty mirror
So it ain't like I don't comprehend
Open that bottle, swallow that friend

No crime to take a little too much
Got time to drink away a few months
Got a little cocaine habit
But he says he only does it if somebody else has it

Go do that shit, do that shit, lady
She went vegetarian for the baby
Third trimester, I see the kid kick
She showed me outside when she gave me a cigarette

Shit, there's no way to measure it
Not every pony grows up to be a Pegasus
Ya gotta let people be hypocrites
Count your blessings and mind your business

Stuck with yourself like the rest of us
Dirt gets done and then we back to dust
Runnin' in place, sun in my face
...
