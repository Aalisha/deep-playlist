So where did August go?
The leaves are shriveled up and dead
What started yellow
Has turned to gray, I turned you red

I was suffocating, so
I took a breath and let you go
You left me leaning, I spent the evening
Pounding sand with pounding head

I woke up to the rain and it won't be the same
And it won't be the same here without you
So goodbye and good luck, know it won't be the same
And it won't be the same and it won't be the same

Was kinda drunk that night, you know
And now I'm outside kicking stones
And getting drunk on grief, drunk and incomplete
...
