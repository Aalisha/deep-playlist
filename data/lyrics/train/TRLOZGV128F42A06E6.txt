It makes me weak
and in a hurry
All night long I lay
and I worry
I'm so afraid I'm gonna talk in my sleep
Who do I love
Who am I using
Which one is which can get so confusing
I've got to chose one and set the other one free

One love at a time thats all I can handle
Burning both ends of the candle can drive you insane
With one love in your heart
