The things I do for money, I'll never understand
I used to be quite critical but now I find I'm cynical
A lady with a starving baby miles away from me
No problems there, just life and death
What the hell is wrong with me
And everybody else

No questions asked
Just get receipts and write them off
Expenses - taxes are a bitch these days
Yet the lady and the baby starve
waiting for a contribution in a UNICEF box
In a drugstore in this ugly little town

The things I do for money
...
