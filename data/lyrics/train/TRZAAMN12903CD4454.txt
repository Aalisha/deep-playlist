nineteen ninety eight looked great on
plain white paper on the fiftieth plane to champaign
but to tell you the truth
if i had a chance to kill it
i'd pick it up and take it and shake it and
kiss it to death
there's something inside like a conscience
that says "you're painting floors while
your pals are renaming the stars
get up get up and go do what you started
if you want to be a martyr, try harder"

go my son have you grown?
go make a home
and put the kids in their beds


and i will talk about this year
if there was something to talk about
and you sell and you sell with your heart
so you can make a few bucks and lose a few friends
...
