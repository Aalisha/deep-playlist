And heavens cried blood as
I swallowed the poison from her lips again
And heavens cried blood
I felt no regrets for her death

No need for sympathies, what she got is what she deserved
She blackened the world, she blackened the sun

These drops of blood won't wash away your sins
I buried you deep to forget the pain
But every night I see you through sleep
...
