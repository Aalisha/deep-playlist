Living in a world of sicknesses
For which there are no cure
One of them eats it's way through me
And lets me die slowly
Infection for those who just touch me
Fear - they throw stones to chase me away

I'm banished from civilization
They throw me into a doorless room
To keep my disease away
While thousands of others lie infected yet

I'm slowly decomposing
And the stench of my own decay surrounds
...
