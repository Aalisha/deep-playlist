Pick it up, and give me a pizza!
Give me a, give me a steak
Yeah, that's what I meant to say, that must be it

I heard a rumor and it's hard to ignore
Everybody is saying punk's not cool anymore
So I called all my friends just to make sure
Then I went down to the record store
Took all my CDs of Rancid and traded them in for Inspecter 7 inch
Shaved off my Mohawk, I got a bald head
Got a tattoo that says "I'm gonna skank till I'm dead".
