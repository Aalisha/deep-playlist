Ride for me
Just don't whore me
Blood depends,
Make ponderings of me
Won't you stay a little longer
You find pain where most find pleasure

Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt you
Whoa ohoh
Only to haunt
You, it's true, it's you

She's not honest
The maddest one
Makes her kill when she needs to run
She don't mean it
She's good for the start
Begs and pleads when I break her heart
