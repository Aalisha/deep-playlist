So'
My name is Rachel
Is my name Rachel?
Do you really know what you can believe in?
Okay, then listen

When I looked at you I realized that you're so hot
And when I'm with you I know that I can't stop
I don't believe that it's all real (no, no, no)
I really don't think that it's all real (it's all real)

Nobody knows it (and that's good)
Nobody knows it (in the neighbourhood)
Nobody knows it (and that's good)
Nobody knows it (that's what they should)

Take me now, take me now, today and tonight
Touch me here, touch me there, today and tonight
Coz I've got a little secret, but I'll never tell
Groove, my baby, forget this lady
I've got something special, it's like sent by hell
I've got a little secret, but I'll never tell
That little secret's about you
