Hmm, yeah, hey, oh ho
Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah, oh ho
Umm, hmm

You pulled some tricks out your sleeve last night
Everything I fantasize about
You had me climbing up a wall
How many ways was God called
You represented in the fashion of the truly gifted

You put it down last night
Knocked me out, then had me dreamin' 'bout wakin' up, alright
Do you want some money, baby?
How about some chicken wings?
Do you want some fish and grits? I'll hurry and go get it

Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever baby, whatever baby

Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever, whatever, ooh, ooh yeah hey

We made a groove last night
