Sweet lady would you be my
sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
just call and receive me
Sweet lady would you be my
sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there, aaaah!

Now any other day
I would play it cool
But I ant now cause I want you
See I'm hooked on
how you flex your style
and I wanna talk for a little while
I never really seen your type
but I must admit that I kinda like
so maybe if you have the time
we could talk about you being my

Sweet lady would you be my
sweet love for a lifetime
I'll be there when you need me
just call and receive me
