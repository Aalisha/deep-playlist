Girl I always think about it 24/7, can't get it outta my mind,
I want so bad to be with you,
Baby while I dream about it feels like heaven,
Why you gotta be so fine,
I want so bad, to be in you,
Oh I'm longing girl to tell you cause the visions in my head,
You never will be lonely, 'long as roses are red,
You should never worry, my intentions they are true,
The only thing that matters is you,
'Cause I love you,
And I want you,
And I can't be without,
I swear there's no doubt,
That I need you,
...
