Tonight, we'll make moments because it's all that we've got
This is gutter bravado
This is our punk rock
I'm starting from scratch and there is no pretense
This is romance
This is called love for the workers in song
Keep us holding on
Heaven sent relief for those of us who still believe
In the therapy and the merit of screaming
...
