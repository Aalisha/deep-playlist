hypnotized
practically hyptonized
just hanging out doing nothing
not much on my mind
just killing time
watching the glasses dry
by this time tomorrow it'll be

saturday
means nothing if you don't work during the week
cops is on
the bathroom is wall to wall with fucking geeks
other days
its seems like the barroom's just for me
...
