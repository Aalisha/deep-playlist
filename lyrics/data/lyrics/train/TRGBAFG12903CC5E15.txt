I am the air on your lungs
and the blood in your veins.
I am all the voices you hear,
and i will never go away.

The deafening sound you hear
is coming straight from your mouth.
Choke on your words your so shallow.
Bite your lip!
Bite your lip when you hear it.
hold your tongue.
You gotta hold your tongue.

Don't be so blind.
Time is not on our side.
Look me straight in the eyes.
Do not say you will be alright.

Put it all on the line
and for a minute the earth will stand still.
