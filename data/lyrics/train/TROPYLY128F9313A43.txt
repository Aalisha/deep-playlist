Wish I never been born at all,
to this world that seems so cold
You know there must be another way,
to make things different than they are today.
Time slipping away,
What once was green is now burning away
It all comes back to you

Chorus
All these Bridges lead the way
To the place that we all live today
Now the times have changed,
can't seem to get along
Noone's right, when everyone's wrong
