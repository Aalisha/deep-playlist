Seeing things going places
Living out of suitcases
Every day's like a dream
I find myself talking to shadows
Taking the train of youth back home again

Cause I don't want to be a hero
But I don't want to be a zero

And I don't want to sit here wasting time
I just want a place inside your mind
I wish that I could turn the clocks right back
It's easy to forget just what you've got

Seeing things going places
Meeting all kinds of faces
...
