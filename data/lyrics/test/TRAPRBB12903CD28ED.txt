My mother was a witch, she was burned alive
Thankless little bitch, for the tears I cried
Take her down now, don't want to see her face
Blistered and burnt, can't hide my disgrace

Twenty-seven, everyone is nice
Got to see 'em, make 'em pay the price
See their bodies out on the ice
Take my time

Am I evil?
Yes I am
Am I evil?
I am man
Yes I am

As I watched my mother die, I lost my head
Revenge now I sought, to break with my bread
Taking no chances, you come with me
I'll split you to the bone, help set you free

Twenty-seven, everyone is nice
Got to see 'em, make 'em pay the price
