Help yourself don't say a thing
Your love won't show and anything at all
If all you do is talk

Sadly I remain in need
Of all the things you say, believe and speak
All you do is talk

Help yourself, don't think
Help yourself, don't speak
Help yourself, don't say a thing at all
Your lucky words don't bleed
