Yeuch! Brother J says yeuuch! Hmmhmmhmmhmm.

[Professor X]
Ahhhh! Straight from the temple of everlasting
ME! P.X.O., and the X-Clan (aww yeah)
Chillin, cleaning the pinkie
Hey Brother J, time for a ride
Put the key, to the ignition, and then.

[Brother J]
Ah yes yes blue, ah come on to go
We're immortals to the portals til the book folds
I'm goin Blackwards to the East, tweedle-dee, tweedle-dumb
Fee fi fum to the tribal drum drum
I'm sittin on my temple, just pluckin silly mortals
Speakin peace of mind to my many sons and daughters
Gettin loose, loose, as I release the juice
I'm more into the (?) cause a simple Mother Goose
could never hang with the words, that ever caused the clamor
I'm singin "Raise the Flag" cause I hate the Spangled Banner
Because you can't get with me, you label me enemy
Your comments on the mortal side are labelled as blasphemy
More than I am, puts the taste in the dam
Puts the X in the Clan that puts the brother on land
It's like that y'all, ya don't stop
Because the sight of the Watch is sure to shock
From the beginning
From the beginning is it winning, is it ever?
Unearthly, resistance, forever
You think your thief based system is clever?
It's a simplistic, endeavor
