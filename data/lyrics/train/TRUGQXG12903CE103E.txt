Come and release me, sender
Come and release me, I will go
It's a part of me to show
Come and release me, silence
Come and release me so I'll know
When it's time to let it go

I want to know
Where the deeper parts of life will grow
I want to see
Where's the deeper part of love in me
Where's that part of love in me?
