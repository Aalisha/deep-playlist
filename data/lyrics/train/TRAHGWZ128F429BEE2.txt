Pay attention.
stop paying for regret.
fossil resources all used up.
make the best use of your time.
you could be on to something.
too skeptic too tired to care.
they all seem to know at once.
sweet muse left me all alone.
there's only my weight left.
euthanasia could be the greatest gift.
wait outside your house to come back out.
