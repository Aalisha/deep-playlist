There's diamonds in the avenue
As the dayshift turns to night
In the Empire dinner dreaming
Hard rain, fluorescent lights
As the waitress fills my coffee cup
And the working girls go by
Drenched Irish Cops are dreaming sex
And peep show ali

Everything underneath the skyline
From the east side to the west
I see the miracles in real time
And there's one I've loved the best
