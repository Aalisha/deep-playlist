Sitting there and feeling lonely
Had my blue eyes for you only
Suddenly you turned around and smiled at me
It wasn't my imagination
Had no doubts, no hesitation
When it comes to love, I know where I wanna be
Is it real?
Am I dreaming?
I've been waiting light years for someone like you
Can't believe you are here with me
I've got the best and I can't hide it anymore
I want the world to know that

Baby, you're mine
You are blowing my mind
We are two of a kind
Baby, you're really mine
...
