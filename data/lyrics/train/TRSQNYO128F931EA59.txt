[Verse]
Set my alarm, to wake me at eleven,
the sun was shining in my face when I awoken.
My mom yelled at me that my friend was here at seven,
I just rolled over, prayed that I was dreaming.
I knew I wasn't when my dog bit me on my nose.
Crawled out of bed, slipped a felt hat on my head.
I ran downstairs, saw my friend was standing there,
looked in the mirror, saw my hair was everywhere.

[Chorus]
