Was it written in the stars
How I feel it in my heart
Will I wake up from a dream, ooh
All my senses are colliding
Feelings running round inside me

Deep in the night
I hope I'm right
Or will our love drift away on the breeze

Do we have a future
Or will love become a memory
Since the day we fell
We knew the story well
Only time will tell
Only time will tell

Could this be my destiny
...
