Oh...
oh...
that's right...
she don't like it when it's cut right
and don't like me makin future plans
and don't want me tryin' to live it down
she ain't about to give an inch of ground, no.
well she can take me for is a little ride
just as long as she drives me home
around the block, maybe once or twice,
and then some lovin, wouldn't that be nice, yeah!
i want what i wanted
oh, what a fool believes
i got 'er in my sights, but
just out of reach. oh-oh
here we go around, (round, round, round)
run-run-runaround, yeah! (round, round, round, round)
here we go around, (round, round, round)
she's given me the runaround, yeah, ow! (round, round, round, round)
i just love 'er keepin' me hanging on,
she knows exactly what i need
and right down to the knick of time,
i'm chasin love down a fine, fine line, ow!
i want what i wanted
oh, what a fool believes
i got 'er in my sight, but
just out of reach, oh-oh
