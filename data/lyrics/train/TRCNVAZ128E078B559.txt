(Dave)
As a young boy Michael helped his mother cook,
Down by her apron strings the whole day long.
Knife in hand, her eyes trained on the recipe book
He'd salivate as she sang out this song:

(funny old woman's voice)
Cut the onions, start the dicing.
Listen up Mike, it's the right thing.
Chop the parsnip for a rich dish
In the small pond you'll be a big fish.
In the small pond you'll be a big fish.

(Mike)
When in college our lad made some special friends,
Kept him from subversives and their kind.
Swirled within a world of sports and dividends.
And the song they sang was etched upon his mind:

(All)
Cut the hair off the hippy sleeping.
Listen up Mike, it's the right thing.
