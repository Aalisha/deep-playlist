Hey - yeah!
Got to have all your love
both night and day.
Yes I do.
Said not just a little part
but all of your heart.

Come on baby, let me tell you
99 and 1/2 just won't do it.
(just a little bit)
You know I got to have 100.
(just a little bit)
Hey! I got to have 100.
(just a little bit)
Yeah! I got to have 100.
(just a little bit)

Listen baby,
don't be lead in the wrong direction.
