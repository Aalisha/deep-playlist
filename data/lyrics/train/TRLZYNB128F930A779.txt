We shoot power to your heart, a mighty thunderbolt
We charge all batteries, we save your soul
We don't know when we're licked, but we turn lead to gold
We know alchemy, we bring you rock and roll
We are the ones you love, or we're the ones you hate
We are the ones always too early or too late
We are the first and we just still might be the last
We are Mot√∂rhead - born to kick your ass
