I could be contended
I don't need to suffer
You're beautiful
Good to talk to

You make an impression
To take my attention
And when you touch my skin
I smell disaster

Step away, walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away, walk away

Step away, walk away
All I want is the real thing
Step away, walk away
It should be me and you

I just forget myself
