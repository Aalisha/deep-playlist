There's a for sale sign on a big old' rusty tractor
You can't miss it, Its the first thing that you see
Just up the road, a pale blue water tower
With "I Love Jennie" painted in bright green
Hey That's my Uncle Bill there by the courthouse
He'll be lowering the flag when the sun goes down
And this is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is my town
(Nana na na na)
HEY! Where I was born
Where I was raised
Where I keep all my yesterdays
Where I ran off cause I got mad
And it came to blows with my old man
Well I came back and settled down
This is where they'll put me in the ground
Yeah this is My town
(Nana na na na)
Yeah this is My town
(Nana na na na)
My town
