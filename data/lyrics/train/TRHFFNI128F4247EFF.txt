I'm not tryin' to start anything
By comin' up to you tonight
I know that he's yours now
It's sinkin' in with time
But tonight I've had too much to drink
And he stays on my mind
I just wanted to say he's the best thing you'll ever find

Cause he ain't your regular joe, 
You know?
And I'm the crazy fool that let him go
And if he says he loves you
Then that's what he means
He's the best man I've ever seen
I just wanted you to know
He ain't your regular joe
...
