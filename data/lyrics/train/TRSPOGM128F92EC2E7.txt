He was an old time cowboy
Don't you understand
His eyes were sharp as razor blades
His face was leather tanned

His toes were pointed inward
From a hangin' on a horse
He was an old
Philosopher of course

He was so thin I swear
You could have used him for a whip
He had to drink a beer
To keep his breeches on his hips

I knew I had to ask him
About the mysteries of life
He spat between his boots
And he replied

"It's faster horses
Younger women
Older whiskey
More money"

He smiled and all his teeth
Were covered with tobacco stains
He said, "It don't do men no good
To pray for peace and rain"
