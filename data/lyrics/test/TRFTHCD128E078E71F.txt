It's coming from the side
And it's coming from the back
People, multitudes of people
Walking up the hills
Go forward

In the name of the father and the holy ghost

In the name of your father and your holy ghost

Oh, I don't do you do
And you don't do what I do
But you should do, you
You've got your voodoo
But you got no clue
You know me
Say pongo poo poo for me
Well because of no manner
...
