[Verse:]
I know taht it's a long ago; I've tried to find a way...
I still can't believe what you've done
Now I know that I'm off the track, opened up my eyes
I don't know why I should thake the blame

What is the reason you left it all behind
Only your true words can ease my pain inside

[Refrain:]
Tell me how it feels to be on your own at night
Can you ever close your eyes again?
Tell me how it feels awake, knowing you're not right?
Yeah I guess that you just wouldn't show!. You just wouldn't show...
