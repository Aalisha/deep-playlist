They're pulling up, their lights are flashing
There's no time for question asking
Hide the weed under the napkin
Try hard not to laugh
Cause I fucked up big time on this one
I'm getting busted for possession
Shit, I got a concealed weapon 
Laying in my lap

If you were where I'm at
You would do the same god damn thing
