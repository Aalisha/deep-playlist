Jesus, give me your heart
Let there be a death in me
I'm making room for al that you are
Give me your heart

Jesus, give me your heart
Break me down, build me up
Let who I was keep falling apart
Give me your heart

My Creator
Oh, my Creator
May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher
May I be low, low, low, so you're made higher
