It's all too clear now
Well, I been runnin' away
Almost on the hour
Of mostly every day

Now I see colors
That I never seen
And now the reddest of them all
So vibrant out of me

Without you
I don't know how to be
Without you
I don't know how to be

Without you
I don't know how to be
Without you
I don't know how to be
