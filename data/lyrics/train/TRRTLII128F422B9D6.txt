So tired sleeping through the day
Bloodshot eyes and sweat from my body
And I picked my head up yesterday
Found the reason of hope left inside of me

But I still believe in immortal love
And I know there's someone above

Shine down, don't take it away from me, no
And I know, you know how, yeah
And shine down, just give me a chance to feel it
It's taken forever to get me off the ground

Haunted silence overwhelming me
...
