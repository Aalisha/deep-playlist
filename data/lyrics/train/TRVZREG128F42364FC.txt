As a child I found myself alone
Always walking in defense
Here they come again
All I want to do was just get home
But I'm pinned to the fence
But here they come again

I walked home all alone

All this and more
All this and more

I guess this is living
Would you come again?
Could you come again?
I never quite feel right
But I come again
