Morgan moves back to the familiar charms of his fiery days when Morgan still felt something.
No longer, Morgan's like a slave, three feet of paper and a family of four.
Morgan wonders why his wife is so slow, blames his wife for his slow love.
He shakes his head as he climbs into bed,
Grits his teeth as he moves between the sheets.
Morgan feels like sudden laughter when he sees.
He doesn't sleep much on account of a terrible pain in his head.
And sometimes Morgan sits up in the loft reading from a book of children's stories.
Jaws no ordinary sucking harder, sagging eyelids and pocked cheeks,
Intelligent the television buzzes and crackles and preaches
Morgan feels like his family have made a conscious effort to cause him misery.
His taste buds have deserted, sneaking away from his wife's cooking.
Morgan dreads the family meal, clenching one hand under the table.
The bland wall hangings nod at the food in recognition. They are all too familiar with one another.
