It's gonna take some time till I'm over you
I gave you it all - there was nothing I wouldn't do
You know that it hurt so bad when I found out the truth
That you've been running around - oh I was such a fool

I know I can't keep holding on
'Cause it's hard for me
And now that you're gone
I'm haunted by your memory

How long till my heart can love again
I tried and I tried - I don't know what else to do
How long till this broken heart mends
...
