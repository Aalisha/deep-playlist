Hey give me a minute
Gotta tell you something
Don't mess with Bill
Don't mess with Bill
(Don't mess with Bill)
Say it one more time
(Don't mess with Bill)
Now I know he's a guy
Who put tears in my eyes
A thousand times or more
Oh, but every time he would apologize
I loved him more than before
Hear what I say
Girls keep away, ah ah ah
Don't mess with Bill
(No, no, no, no, don't mess with Bill)
Leave my Billy alone
(Don't mess with Bill)
Get a guy of your own
