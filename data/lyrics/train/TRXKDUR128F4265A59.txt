Take a look in my mind
And justify
Hell I might even sympathize
But why must you fuck with these things in my head
For so long that I feel I can break?
Never forget your lies
Hypocrisize, five million might change your mind
But why must you fuck with these things in my head
For so long that I feel I can break?

So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, get up, get up
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, get up, get up

So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, get up, get up
South Texas Deathride, you mother fucker
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, get up, get up
South Texas man, I'm living it up
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, get up, get up
South Texas Deathride, you mother fucker!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, get up, get up
So c'mon

So what if I was your god?
