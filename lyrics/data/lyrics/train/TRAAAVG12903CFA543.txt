Here we go Here we go
yeah
Here we go Here we go
yeah
Here we go Here we go
yeah
Here we go Here we go

Oh shit this chick is back and I'm freaking again
I need a man hung low and Indian
Hey, you, at the bar with the sexy grin
You may have bought me a drink but you're not my boyfriend

I want a man to do me like a robot, get it hot, don't stop, break me off 'til I hit the rooftop
Next up is Jason, Natalie, damn!
Did me so good i had to share you with my friends

Or maybe I'm back but I'm switching it up
I need a lady with class that's ready to go
I need a girl like Janell with a big bazonka
I can ride it like a train or a flying tonka

Wanna see Sheena get it? Give my panties a tug
Let me investigate, is this curtains matching the rug?
Got one or two thing to get off of my chest,
I'm not a home wrecker I just got big breasts

So don't call me white, call me light-skinneded
I can double dutch slow, run it back and bend it
Meet me back at the crib, I'm a sexy baby
Roomate doing yoga but that dont phase me

Break break me off, Insatiable, Gotta gotta appetite, blindfold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gimme gimme handcuffs, Ice cold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gotta gotta appetite, blindfold
Break break me off, Insatiable, Gimme gimme handcuffs, Ice cold

Its like 11: 30 and I'm ready to roll
Gonna sweat my weave out at the next toll
Gonna make a pit stop, you know how we do
Taco Bell, Post it up, we at the Drive-Thru

I could kill a burrito and a combo meal
