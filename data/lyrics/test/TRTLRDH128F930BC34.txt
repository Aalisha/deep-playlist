Born from the hands of all men
The things we do are nothing new
But I feel it changin'

But I don't buy that way of thinkin'
To many robots in the cue
What they tryin' to do?

It's a crazy world in which we live
We take take take and rarely ever give
The sense of the common man has gone
The way of the mammoth

Fight fight fighting fighting all the time
Us and them eating away our minds
So can we really ever get along
...
