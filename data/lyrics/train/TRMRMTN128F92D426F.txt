Like the tale by the time
It's been told by more than one, it's growing

Every day it grows a little more
Than it was on the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Oh, how it grows and grows
And where it's gonna stop I'm sure that nobody knows

Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows
Oh, like the need in a guy to see his girl
When she's gone away, oh, it's growing
Like the sadness in his heart when he knows
That she's gone to stay, yeah, yeah, it's growing

Every day, grows a little bit more
Than it was just the day before, oh
