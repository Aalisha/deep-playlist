Yeah it's true,
I've been in love with the ghost of a girl
She comes to me
In the middle of the night, in my sleep

In my room,
Where time stands still
I watch her dance in the night
But soon the dawn will come then I'll wake up
She'll be gone with the light

Only wanted to give it time
Time is on our side
When you move the way you do
It breaks down all of the walls
I've built up through the years
I've built up to survive
The times like these
In the middle of the night
...
