I cant believe it's true, I'm standin' here in front of you
And you are here with me
So unbelievable, I'd never ever let you go
My heart is yours for keep

Lets make a vow
Right here and now

This is the day that I prayed for
And you are the girl of my dreams
And my place in life, is right here by your side
On this day this very moment
