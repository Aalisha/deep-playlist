Yeah, oh why, why
You didn't have to leave me baby
See I called you today
No one picked up the phone
As fast as I could girl I ran to your home
When I arrived to my surprise
You were gone, oh babe
Your neighbor informed me
That you moved away
How could you not tell me
And leave me this way
With no goodbyes and crying eyes
I wish you would have stayed




So I count every second
I count every minute
That you are away from me
I just can't take it oh why
Can't I get with you




So I count every second
I count every minute
That you are away from me
