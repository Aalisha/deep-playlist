Your love alone is not enough
Not enough, not enough
When times get tough, they get tough
They get tough, they get tough
Trade all your heroes in for ghosts
In for ghosts, in for ghosts
They're always the ones that love you most
Love you most, love you most
Your love alone is not enough
Not enough, not enough
It's what you felt, it's what you said
What you said, what you said
You said the sky would fall on you
