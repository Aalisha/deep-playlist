Chasing the sound of lullabies that echo, that entwine
The funeral songs we're singing

Heal the pain of unheard warnings
Light will fill where dark is dawning
Show the world and bring us back to life

I know you've been a friend of sorrow
And if I never wake tomorrow
I still believe you carry me tonight
Tonight, tonight
