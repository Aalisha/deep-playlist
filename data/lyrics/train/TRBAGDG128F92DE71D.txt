Shake it out, shake it out
God, I need another and another and another and another
I could feel it now
How I felt the Lord in my father's house

And I can see, I can see
Standing, we were seventeen, make it clean
Are you the living ghost of what I need?
Are you getting the best of me?
We will see

'Cause I'm done being done with a funeral
At least for now
Are you tired of being alone?
Are you tired of being alone?

Shake it out, shake it out
Tired of another and another wasn't really what I wanted
So we bled it out
