I'm crying for the first time
Got my feet in the air
I'm breathing for the first time
And I want to declare
My demands are simple
A kind and happy universe where everyone is good

Sorry lad, so sorry son, don't put
Your aims too high, sorry lad, so sorry son, this world
Won't qualifiy, sorry son, I'm sorry son, it's what you get, I'm canceling the contract
Cause I wanna go back
