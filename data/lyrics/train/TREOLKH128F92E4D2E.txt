I: full moon rising
In a state of fallen grace
with a smile upon it's face, it came!
full moon rising today
Like a child but fully grown
like a star but not so far away!
it came here to take me away
Chorus
This has never been before
while the sun burns bright as day
light the sky - hold back no more
let the full moon rise today
full moon rising today
So there i was with my complaints
in the comfort of my restraints i stayed
i stayed and had nothing to say
but there it was returning for my eyes
like a fire that's been burning up the sky
full moon rising today
Chorus

ii: october winds
There's a town i used to know
there's a place i used ti go to play
laughin' all the way
never thought of where i'd been
autumn wind came creepin' in one day
now summer's gone away
summer's gone away ... hey
When october winds lay down
when the heat can't melt the ground
and nothing matters anyway
...
