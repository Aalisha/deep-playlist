To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
You've been trying to reach me, you bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
I've been paid, I've been paid

To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
You've been trying to reach me, you bought me a book
To be lost in the forest, to be caught adrift
I've been paid, I've been paid, I've been

Don't get offended if I seem absent-minded
Just keep telling me facts and keep making me smiling
And Don't get offended if I seem absent-minded
I get tongue-tied
