miles and miles of soldiers deployed on foreign sand
fighting for your freedom your oil and your land
technology is efficient when bark turns to bite
so wake up america, stand up for your rights

oh say can't you see that the conscience in me
said go back
when the clouds in the skies and the tears in my eyes
turned to black
...
