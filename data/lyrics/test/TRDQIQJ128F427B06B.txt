You act like you don’t wanna listen
When I’m talkin’ to you
You think you oughta do, baby
Anything you wanna do

You must be crazy, baby
You just gotta be out of your mind
As long as I’m payin’ the bills woman
I’m payin’ the cost to be the boss

I’ll drink if I wanna
And play a little poker, too
...
