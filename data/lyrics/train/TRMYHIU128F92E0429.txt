It took two days
For me to figure out
This isn't working out
But I lost my way
I drove all night
Just to be with you
But you weren't worth the view
I've gotta hit the breaks
Now you know
Get up and go

Arizona Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona Arizona's
A million miles from Florida
Now your history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home

Deep in your soul
Lies a lonely heart
That only ever pumps
...
