Dwayne's had enough
Oh baby
Dwayne's had enough
Enough of your chickens chasin his Z28 down the gravel driveway
Dwayne's had enough
Of your camoflauge panties lying on that mildew, shag carpet in your bathroom
Dwayne's had enough
Of your Dale Jr. posters staring at him while he's making love
Dwayn'es had enough
Of that burn mark on your leg you got off the exhaust pipe of that truck when we went to panama city to make your court date
Oh baby
Dwayne's had enough trailer love
Dwayne's had enough trailer love
