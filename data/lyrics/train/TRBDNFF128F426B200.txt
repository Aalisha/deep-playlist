In the battle of the obscure
Tragic death, so suddenly
Slowly unlatches the leather strap
Roaming mortals, so divine

Deadly intention, with the will to kill
Eyes locked, your heart pounds

The grey massacre, a familiar sight
Substance of fire, the visible truth
Modified version of an alternate reality

Deadly intention, with the will to kill
Eyes locked, your heart pounds
...
