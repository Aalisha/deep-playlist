Verse 1: Kurupt

Another day another dollar
another nigga jacked for his sack, jeans, and them collars
What the fuck makes life so complicated?
Why they playahatin, 'stead of congratulatin'
One of the homies just bought a new '64
And they mad about it, and talkin bad about
Don't trip 'cause you smoke dubs and he smokes ounces
Your 'fo rolls and his 'fo bounces
Planted on the ground and this fool skyrockets
Got a nigga hot enough to want to shake his pockets [All that shit]
Roll like Biggie, nigga, two glock nines
Any muthafucka whisperin about mine
All I got is, my twelve shottie
I'm a gangsta nigga, Kurupt Young Gotti
Me and Gonzoe and Capone, with a chrome
and a bone with a zone fucked up gettin blown (Yeah)

Chorus:
[Don't it feel good to survive another day]
Scared money don't make no money, [Heyyyyy]
cause uh, drug money, thug money's funny money, [and uh]
