You rush me into your apartment, 
The glow of your bedroom ahead.
Your spirit was warm when I touched you, 
We think alike to live alike, yeah.

Breathe in deep for me, 
'Cause I'll be there for you.
Don't lose sight of me, 
'Cause I watch the old tricks.
I won't waste my time, 
'Cause I'll be there for you.
So breathe in deep for me.
