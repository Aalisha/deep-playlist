What am I
Surely not this awkward frame
That carries me round
Not part of emptiness that's still to be found
I want to know
Thoughts rain down
World spins round
Upside down
As my confusion grows
Who are you
You look the same but you are different again
With all your questioning that makes me insane
I need to know
Thoughts won't clear
Caught down here
End seems near
