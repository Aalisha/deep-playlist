Wail - oh desolate gale
Bring forth your bitter winds
Wail through heart and through soul
A poisoned kiss so deathly cold
Vanish grief and inner pain
Wail - oh desolate gale
through empires by blackened tears created
On the wings of a wind - The wind of wraith
whose scythe caresses in rage

Wind shall sweep the moonless sky
The reflection of a sulphur fire

Dismal gale - Malicious storm of fate
Brought forth to assail the creation
To bring souls to the wind
...
