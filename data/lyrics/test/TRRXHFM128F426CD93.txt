Catch fire - just like a living disease
Unholy desire - a world on it's knees
Our burning minds they are ridden of hope
In a dreaming utopia - dead on dope

A generation of obscenities
We have lost our faith in our own creativity
What is evil, but good
Tortured by it's own hunger and thirst?

The living end
