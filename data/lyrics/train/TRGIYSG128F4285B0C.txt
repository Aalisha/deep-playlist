(Muthafuckin murderer)
Muthafuckin murderer
Murdered my sister
Come on dey tryin ta tell a bitch to
Take it ta dat nigga
Get dat muthafuckin wit a terrormizer
Make dat muthafucker feel what 'Chelle felt
Havin a 40 when she was well to bring them tears ta her eyes
Fuck the fusses and the fights
Why'd she have to die
Couldn't been able to pull evil away from me so god damn early
I tried ta tell her dat nigga was bad news but she ain't heard me
Fact was dat she loved dis bitch
But she found love on da graveyard shift
And all these large muthafuckas quicklifters spliffs wit dem
Found my baby stiff
She ain't deserve dat shit
Nigga you couldn't of
Nigga you wouldn't of
Put yo hand on a woman
Who happened ta be my sister
Can't say I won't miss her
But I won't forget ya
Get dat bitch for every time dat he hit ya
He gonna pay for what he did to ya
Murderer!

(Chorus x3)

MUTHAFUCKIN MURDERER!

(Verse-2)

What possesed a nigga to hurt 100% black queen so verbal
Nigga you lost your fuckin life when you took her bro
