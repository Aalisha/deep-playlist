Back in those days, back in my end
We would bro down every weekend
I miss those times, I miss those skins
I had to ask do I miss my friends?

On the forfeit towns where they misbehave
Where they skip the bills and they radio slave
I'm a cutthroat boy you're an empty grave
We can still be friends when I get off stage

Yo, rat pack Sammy Davis, rap pages
Betty Davis slab tray off the meat rack
Beat fact checkers need to take a fucking break
If you know what I mean you know what I mean

My current girl is a stewardess
But she ain't fly, she's well grounded
Still astounded to see me try
To play around with the boundaries

Beats hotter than a foundry
Less beef than a pantry don't call me Tom like Landry
Call me Alec Simon with the words that I'm rhymin'
With the peculiar timing or friends by proximity

I have friends who spend in loud numbers
I have friends who depend on cloud cover
I have friends who don't know my name
My favorite friend, she believes in change
When I tell her about the core of a man
All she says is, "I'm a woman", so then I say

"Back in those days, back in my end
We would bro down every weekend
I miss those times, I miss those skins
I had to ask do I miss my friends?"
