This is why I always wonder
I'm a pond full of regrets
I always try to not remember
Rather than forget

This is why I always whisper
When vagabonds are passing by
I tend to keep myself away
From their goodbyes

Tide will rise and fall along the bay
And I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
...
