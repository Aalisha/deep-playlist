While walking out one evening
Not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away
Before we held our show
I heard the Bethel missionâ€™s band
Singing with all their might
I give my heart to Jesus
And left the show that night

The day will soon be over and digging will be done
And no more gems be gathered, so let us all press on
When Jesus comes to claim us and says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining, no longer in the rough
