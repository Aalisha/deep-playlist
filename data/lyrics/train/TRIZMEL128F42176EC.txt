You know just what you’re gettin’ into
Somethin' so much bigger than you
It’s got a one track mind and it don’t fight fair
You’re down for the count 'cause love don’t care

Love don’t care if it’s right or wrong
Love don’t care if you’re weak or strong
You’re down on your knees and you ain’t got a prayer
It’s got you by the heart and it just don’t care

Well, well, well, well
When you had enough of all that stuff
