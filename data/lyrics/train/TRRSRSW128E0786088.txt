Gotta have that
Uh, uh, uh

I will rob and steal witcha', dog nigga what
Ride till we die, on till it's up
Thick like blood, where's my dogs
Uh, there's my dogs

I will rob and steal witcha', dog nigga what
Ride till we die, on till it's up
Thick like blood, where's my dogs
Uh, there's my dogs

Now who I am is who I'll be until I die
Either accept it or don't fuck with it
But if we gon' be dogs then you stuck with it
Let me go my way but walk with me
See what I see, watch me then talk with me

Share my pain, make it a little easier to deal with it
'Cause despite all the fame, you, I'm a keep it real with it true
Rob and steal withcha' dog nigga what
Ride till we die, on till it's up

Love is love and I enjoy the love
But when it's conflict then it destroys the love
You can't toy with love, niggas take to the heart
You ain't gon' find too many niggas willing to, bark in the dark

Keep your head from the start, don't fuck it up now
Later on they be hit like, fuck it how?
You my dog and I die for you, keep it like that
Give me unconditional love and I give it right back

I will rob and steal witcha', dog nigga what
Ride till we die, on till it's up
Thick like blood, where's my dogs
Uh, there's my dogs
