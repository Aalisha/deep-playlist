You're fading away
Scraping your head until it bleeds
Was that made for you
You tried to rape my soul
You tried to take control through my soul
I know

I know you're trying to fly but
You'll never get my piece of the pie
My piece of the pie

As you are now
You're falling into pieces
As you are now
You're crying on your ashes
As you are now
You're falling into pieces
Where have you gone now


Will you someday find your own place
...
