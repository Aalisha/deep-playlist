Daylight falls
And I'm lost in the big parade
Hold my hand darling
I'm afraid of the daylight
Shade is dark
Cool and languid for life or long
Safe in shadow, it's never as dark as the daylight
As the daylight
When I was just knee high
My momma told me never try to be someone that I am not
Yet over time I had forgot
A wandering child, so lost at play
He's found himself, but he can't find his way
