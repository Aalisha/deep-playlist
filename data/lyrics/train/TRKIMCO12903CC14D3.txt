Gotta write a classic
Gotta write it in an attic
Baby, i'm an addict now
An addict for your love
I was a street boy
And you were my best toy
I found it easy to annoy you
But you were different from the rest
And i loved you all the wrong ways
Now listen to my say
If it changed to another way
Would the difference make it?
Would it be a classic?
I gotta send it right away

Gotta write a classic
Gotta write it in an attic
Baby, i'm an addict now
An addict for your love
Back Vocals
(I'm so down)
