Girl I don't understand, 'stand the reason why, why you act this way
What did I do, tell me what the problem is?
I don't wanna see, wanna see you leave
Wanna let you go, I just wanna find a way to work it out

We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
And I apologized tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think it's time to let this go

And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
And neither one of us wanna be the first to say, "Goodbye"
Baby I think it's time to let this go

And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
And neither one of us wanna be the first to say, "Goodbye"
