There's a devil waitin' outside your door
There's a devil waitin' outside your door
And he's a bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
And he's a howling with pain and crawling up the walls, oh yeah
There's a devil waitin' outside your door
He's a weak with evil and broken by the world
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more
Give him more, give him more
There's a devil waitin' outside your door, oh yeah

Loverman
Since the world began
Forever, amen
Till the end of time
Take off that dress
I'm comin' down
I'm your loverman
'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am

L is for love, baby, and
O is for only you that I do
V is for loving virtually all that you are, and
E is for loving almost everything you do
R is for rape me, and
M is for murder me
A is for answering all of my prayers
N is for knowing your loverman's gonna be the answer to all yours

Loverman
Till the bitter end
While empires burn down
...
