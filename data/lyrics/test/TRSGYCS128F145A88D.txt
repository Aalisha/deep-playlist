I've been watching the news,
And it doesn't feel safe,
It seems so far removed this slumbering place,
Cat at the hearth... dog at the door,
Restless as sparrows awaiting the dawn,
Don't go out tonight,
Don't leave me alone,
It doesn't feel safe in our English home,
There's fear in my heart,
In my ear a whisper,
Are you afriad too, or is it just me?
