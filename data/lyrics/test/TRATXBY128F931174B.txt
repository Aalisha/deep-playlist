Did you feel the nurse at night?
She stroked and held your hand.
Did you feel the doctors might?
He cried, you understand?
That everything ain't always right.
Aw hell, it never is.
You are gonna die tonight
just like your parents did.

Remember the morning breeze on your face when you're crying.
Tell me you don't want to leave, though you're so worn and tattered on this night.
