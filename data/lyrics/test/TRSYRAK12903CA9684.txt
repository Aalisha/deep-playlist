Baby here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you've got come home with me

I have got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You've got to come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm so hard to handle now
Yes around

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
