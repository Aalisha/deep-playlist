Its going down tonight in this town
Cause they stare and growl
They all stare and growl
I take a scar everytime I cry
Cause it ain't my style, no it ain't my style
Going down to the gravel head to the barrel
Take this life and end this struggle
Los Angeles come scam me please
Emptiness never sleeps at Cliftons 6am
With your bag lady friend and your mind descending
Stripped of the right to be a human in control
Its warmer in hell so down we go

They say
This is the city
