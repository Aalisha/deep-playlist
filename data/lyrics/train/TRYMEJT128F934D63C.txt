Breathe me in my love
and hold me in tight
Wandering, not lost
alone in the
night

The fear's begun to surface
So breathe me in my love
and hold me in
tight

You had me going for a minute there
I thought I heard you coming up
the stairs
There comes a time you need to let me know
We'll fight your demons
...
