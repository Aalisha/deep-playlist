You destroyed my confidence, you broke my nerve. I've gone to pieces, now this I don't deserve. Wish you could see what you're doing to me - you made me a nervous wreck. My hands are twitching and I can't settle down. My scalp is itching and my eyes roll around; I chew my nails right down to the quick - you made me a nervous wreck. Now I've endured for years and years your tricks and your games: my confidence is long gone. You said you'd changed but it's always the same - is this love? I don't think so
