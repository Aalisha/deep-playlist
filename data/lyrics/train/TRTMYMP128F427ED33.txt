Oh take me somewhere quiet please
These motorway exit gates
Are calling to me dearly
And I need a place to go

And even numbers on a timetable
Arrivals and departures and
Those places' names
Never seemed so strange before

If there's anyone asking, did you get a rush?
There's no point in asking if it wasn't enough
There's nobody else here, so please stand up
...
