I believe in God the Father
Jesus Christ, His only Son
And the blessed Holy Spirit
Distinct, yet three in one
I believe there is forgiveness
For everything we've done
That is why all the more
I will serve Him
I believe the Son of God
Was crucified upon the tree
Laid within a borrowed tomb
Not far from calvary
I believe He rose up from the dead
Alive for all to see
That is why all the more
I will serve Him
I have made my decision
I have state my claim
I have drawn a line in the sand
And I'll not be ashamed
With the world behind me
And the cross before
By the grace of God
I will serve the Lord
I believe you must be born again
