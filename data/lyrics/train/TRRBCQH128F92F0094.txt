If I had the chance to hold you again in my cryin' eyes
I'd take a chance and fall in love with you
But I know I couldn't have one more dance
To bring you back to the rollin' highway blues

'Cause I'm back to fallin' down again, my friends
I don't have any more luck to lose
I wish the train would haul away every card I choose
...
