Everyday I love you less and less
It's clear to see that you've become obsessed
I got to get this message to the press
That everyday I love you less and less

And everyday I love you less and less
I've got to get this feeling off my chest
The doctor says all I need is pills and rest
Since everyday I love you less and less

Unless, unless
I know, I feel it in my bones
I'm sick, I'm tired
Of staying in control
Oh yes, I feel, a rat upon a wheel
I got to know what's not and what is real

Oh yes, I'm stressed
I'm sorry I digress
