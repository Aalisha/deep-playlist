Every city is a ghost town where
I see remnants of us that will never
fade because they√Ç'll never
see the light.

The streets remember our footprints,
maps made in sand and snow,
where we walked,
side by side.
The things we told eachother,
piece by piece,
as it comes back now, revisiting
I stopped searching for our missing ending.

There are no dry winds carrying
torn pagesdown abandoned roads,
fluttering, caughton telephone
poles, waiting to be foundand read aloud.
