If you want this love of mine
threat me gentle and threat me kind
Dont be mean and don't be bad
and you'll get the greatest love that you've ever had

If you want my lips to kiss
come closer don't resist
Loving you is all I crave
and if you love me pretty baby I'll be your slave

If you want this love of mine
baby come on and get it
If you should fall in love with me
