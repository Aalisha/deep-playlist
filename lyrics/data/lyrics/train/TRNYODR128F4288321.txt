This is the song about "Billy Goat"
Young man never knew what he wanted
Check it out, you see Billy wanted every women in the world
But didn't wanna get them returned
Tried his best to swing in
But it didn't work
So he gotta be down be for the right babe

Billy Goat moved over to the east coast
Well he never knew his name
But he'd always get what he want
But Billy even had a girl
But he called her friend
Didn't like to claim her name
He likes to play the game

You gotta be down, down
Down for the right thing
You can't mess around, owww
Be close to the righteous
You gotta be down, down
Down for the right thing
