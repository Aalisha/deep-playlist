I got a boy got boy trouble
I got a man I just don't want
Got myself in soapy bubble
He wants love but I don't

And when I see him on the street
I look the other way
And when he asks if we could meet
I tell him another day

Boy trouble boy trouble
He thinks he's here to stay
Boy trouble boy trouble
I wish he'd go away
I wish he'd go away
