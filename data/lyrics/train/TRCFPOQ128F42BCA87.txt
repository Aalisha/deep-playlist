She wanders all alone
This is all, she's ever really known
A stranger in her skin
Nothing more, it's all she's ever been
She spills these words across the page
It helps to ease the pain, and she cries

Nobody out there
Wants to understand
Nobody out there
Takes me as I am
I'm feeling alone here
I know there's got to be
Somebody somewhere
That's all she wrote
...
