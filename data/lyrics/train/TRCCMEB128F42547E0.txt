I don't know where I'm going
But, I sure know where Iv'e been
Hanging on the promises
In songs of yesterday
An I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time
Here I go again, here I go again

Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Here I go again on my own
Goin' down the only road I've ever known
Like a drifter I was born to walk alone
And I've made up my mind
