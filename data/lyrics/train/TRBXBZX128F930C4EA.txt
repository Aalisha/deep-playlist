Even if I had my life to live
Over again
Even if I had my life to live
Over again
I would keep coming back to the same place
Waiting on the shore for me to return

Seeing through the veil
Unclose your mind

I'm the reflection of
All your waking lives
Narcoleptic sins
Unclose your mind

In the depth of me
