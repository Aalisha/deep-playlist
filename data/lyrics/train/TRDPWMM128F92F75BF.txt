You said, you recall about seven years ago now
You said, that you we're so tough
And I loved it, ooh
Loved you for putting me down in a totally new way
Down with, the bad old, sad old days
(Get away now)
But now, too much pain for too little gain
And I feel like I'm gonna fight back right now
Gonna withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your heart, yeah
Withdraw my labour of love
Gonna strike for the right to get into your cold heart
Ain't gonna work for you no more
Ain't gonna work, for you no more
Ha, easy, I know that you said it never was gonna be easy
But not this hard
You're so cold, so cold
...
