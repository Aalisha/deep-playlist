I'm in a liquid mode, ready to explode
You can't stop me ma oh ah baby
I'm a cosmic queen, taking gipsy green
With an A plus in retro diving
I'm a midnight cat, with a flick-flash act
I'm your poison ma oh ah baby
I can brake the ground, to the ultra sound
Do the can-can on XP Island
I wanna love and take you there
And show the magic you can share
This is your island in the sun
Aqua playa, jigging desire
Taking all the night away
Aqua playa, freaking you higher
Keep on living for the day
