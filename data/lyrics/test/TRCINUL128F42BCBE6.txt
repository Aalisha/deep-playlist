Take it as it comes girl.
You gotta understand.
Take it on the run girl.
The world's at your command, Oh.
I know it's a difficult thing
when the one you love makes you cry.
I know if the phone doesn't ring
it is keeping you waiting every night.
So take it as it comes, girl.
Don't let him bring you down, yeah.
Keep your motor runnin'.
You know you own this town, yeah.
