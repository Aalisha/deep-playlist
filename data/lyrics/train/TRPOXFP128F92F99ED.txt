Wanna feel what I touch
Wanna find what was lost
Wanna be kind

As you see every curse
And in a dream it'll work
Now you'll feel tied

Wanna praise with this life
And conceal without lies
I just need time

Wanna fight every need
Every push every string
Will you stand by?

I've been awake through the wrong decisions
I've held the ground now I'm gaining soul
I bit my tongue through the cold realisations
I've been accused but I've only begun

Wanna speak what I've seen
Wanna reach what I've dreamed
...
