Words and Music by John Kay
What gives you the right hey you
To stand there and tell me what to do
Tell me who gave you the power
To stop me from livin' like I do
Remember if you plan to stay

Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Just one time I'd like to be somewhere where
None of your clever lies fill the air
I'm tired of your frozen smile and your voice of tin
