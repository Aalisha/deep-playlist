So we come a long way from the chains and the cane fields
A long way from the back o' the bus
Shoulda brought along a little map for the travelling
Seems we've come a long way from us
Squander our money waiting on reparation,
never make plans for retirement day
Who's to be blamed for our lack of preparation now we done spent every dime of our pay
On big pimping, flossing every dollar
we've got on the much less fortunate
Small thinking got us bound tighter
than the chains that we try to forget

refrain:
Tell me now malcom, do we hurt you pride?
Can you hear me now rosa,
was it worth the ride?
Can you see me now marcus
we're still not unified, no we're not
...
