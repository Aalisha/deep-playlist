Gimme, gimme, gimme
Remember me? 'Member me?
This old man, he plays one on one
He was your cool whip master, you were his B.C. son
This old man
He's got the smell of sin
He's got the nature of sin
He was your actual, factual old sin nature
Mother praying, 'Jesus save the boy,
Save him from the old man.'
Got away
Glory, Glory
Up from the water, out of the grave
