Hang glide for my nigga Tical
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit, son
Right that's my word
Guaranteed you're dealin' with the invincible

That's my word, Persian legacy one time, one time
Check the science of the black man
Stationary niggaz, have fun on this right here
Yo Shorty cross your arms

Gonna rock niggaz to sleep this year
Blade thrower, sword swinga, killa bee ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fade mas, name your God Ukarema

Shout out Medina, federaloes Noxzema
Me jury cleaner, Million Man March screamers
Rae Cartegna, cut your joint Wolverine
The lonzina, wrapped around the wrist, law seen her

How I got that yo, threw out the macker named Gina
Bust a shot, seen her, it ricocheted, tapped Tina
Now I'm out, lampin' in Korea with Talima
We moseyin', sweatsuit Adidas, best believe

I got the black heater little joint, probably Moschino
Yo, Bobby Robby, whattup, Max tried to follow me
Sadaam loungin', clean up collect, like the laundry
It's time yo swerve like the Nike line

Windbreaker Laker throw a jump shot scrape her
Statuary yo floatin' that snatch-uary
Aiyyo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch
