Neon lights draw me like a moth to a flame

Mama raised me right
That just leaves me to blame
When i get a little sideways on a honky-tonk tear
I'm Old Enough To Know Better
But i'm still too young to care
Cowgirls with an attitude

Boots and tight blue jeans
Take my mind off doin' right, and doin' other things
When the weekend's gone
I won't have a dime to spare
I'm Old Enough To Know Better
But i'm still too young to care
...
