If words are lethal weapons you've run out of ammo
Its the same old fucking same old
You need to calibrate to a new debate
The era of the police state
Take a stand against the man
Force fed lies down through your throat
Until you choke on those words that you greedily spoke
A generation of blinded men
Following every trend
Their ignorance is beyond my own comprehension
The pressure wont stop chaotic tension
What are you living for if you cant speak your mind
