[I hear you... but I'm not afraid of you]
[I'm not afraid of you]

Father, where's my gun?
Now that the war has begun
Oh let me go it alone
I need no one
I said I need no one

But oh God now here it comes and it's too dark to aim this gun
Clicking now faster, faster, faster
once again I'm on the run

And I hear you say,
"Oh my stubborn son, don't you just say you need no one?
But don't you see danger, danger, danger, headed to oblivion?"

Follow the hunt, far as I could
Through a dozen weathers
Petrified wood
And I took one shot, in the dark
...
