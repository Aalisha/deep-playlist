There is something I wanted to tell you
It's so funny you'll kill yourself laughing
But then I, I look around
And I remember that I am alone
Alone
For evermore

The tile yard all along the railings
Up a discoloured dark brown staircase
Here you'll find, despair and I
Calling to you with what's left of my heart
My heart
For evermore
...
