Buck em down (repeat 16X)
Verse One: Buckshot Shorty *
To the weak, what we do, buck em down, word life
Each and every nigga whenever I'm in the sight
Let my nigga Jewel peep your style for your card
Then I kick a verse and take a look at the God
God hit them niggaz with a verse real quick
C'mon God niggaz is all on your dick
You know what they say about niggaz who ride dicks
Upstate niggaz become chicks, word life
I ain't bullshittin, ask my nigga Buff
On the streets he was tough locked up he was sweet stuff
Shit is hot, word to Ma Duke
and get the loot from the man kick his ass with my Timberland
Shorty with the Shots that I Buck with fuck with
gang hanger with the double-edged banger
And I got niggaz clingin my drawers
Niggaz fake I'ma bust a cap fuck that I'm breakin jaws
I'ma bring it to your chest like, wind
Fill your fuckin lungs up with all the bullshit from within
But I'ma put it back so parlay
To the weak in Bucktown all we do everyday
Buck em down (repeat 32X)
Verse Two: Buckshot Shorty
Niggaz tell me chill when I kick it
Although my shit is wicked, it's all about the blunts and how I lick
