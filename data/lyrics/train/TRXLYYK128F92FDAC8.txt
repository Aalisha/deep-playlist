We're soarin', flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach

If we're trying
So we're breaking free

You know the world can see us
In a way that's different than who we are

Creating space between us
'Til we're separate hearts

But your faith it gives me strength
Strength to believe

We're breakin' free!

We're soarin'
Flyin'
There's not a star in heaven
That we can't reach
If we're trying
So we're breaking free
We're breakin' free
Uhh-uhh-uuuhhh

Can you feel it building
Like a wave the ocean just can't control

Connected by a feeling
