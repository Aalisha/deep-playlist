I looked out across
The river today
I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play.
Saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
Saw two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly
To the sea

Two priests came round our house tonight
One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying
To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach
Which way the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black
Like a murder of crows

And all this time, the river flowed
Endlessly
...
