I should have told you all I wanted was to have some fun
(to have some fun)
but you wanted me to be the permanent one
(the permanent one)
yes you did

Now when we're in the movies or the back of a car
you always stop me when I go too far
I should have known you'd always keep me waiting
for those wedding bells
those wedding bells

Oh we could talk all night but you won't understand
(don't leave me in the lurch today)
the only words you want to hear are "Do you take this man?"
(in church today)
