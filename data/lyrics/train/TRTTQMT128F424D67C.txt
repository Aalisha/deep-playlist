She takes her time with the little things
Love notes reminding me (reminding me)
She wears red when she's feeling hot (so hot)
I have her but that's all I got
She looks best without her clothes
I know it's wrong but that's the way it goes

I don't know what she sees in me (she looking at me)
But I'm happy that she's happy now
That she's with me
And I'm freaking out
'Cause I'm just so lucky

Oh, she makes me feel like shit
It's always something
But I can't get over it
She thinks it's nothing
Because she's everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And so much more
