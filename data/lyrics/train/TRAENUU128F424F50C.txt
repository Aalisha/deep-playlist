You won't know I'm there
You won't hear me breathing
Just like a ghost
I live on your ceiling
Two worlds away
You won't see me leaving
Slide down and out your door

Just like it never was
You're like a dream
And now I'm free ya now
I'm free to know just where I am
And climb back off the floor

I hit it hard - rock bottom
I came apart - rock bottom

Forget my face
Your latest obsession
Forget my name
...
