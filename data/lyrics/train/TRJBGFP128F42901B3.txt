I'm failing if I can't stay out of the cold
And I'm only going to tell you what you already know
Through the lighting and the rafters winters falling faster
And I would wait, so idly
For the line I never asked for trace it in the snowfall
I was in love with the time and the place and you fit the role perfectly
When the snow starts to melt we will slip back into our old routines
The features of the night were the iron and the ivy
You dont get it, no but you're not gonna get it
...
