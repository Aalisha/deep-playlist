Them kill Limumba for his own-a-rights
But them can't kill the Rasta Man at all, 'tall, 'tall
Them can't kill the Rasta Man at all
That's the strangest man I've seen
(That's because he's a Rasta Man)
Having the mark of a Nazarine
(That's because he's a Rasta Man)
He carries a prophetical message
(That's because he's a Rasta Man)
Borning out of time and out of age
(That's because he's a Rasta Man)

The Rasta come from Zion
Rasta Man a Lion
(Oh what a Rasta Man) (repeat)
Remember Jeremiah children
(He was a Rasta Man)
Or even Iziah
(He was a Rasta Man)
Moses in the pit of mud
