Let me use your toothbrush
Have you got a clean shirt?
My panties are in a wad
At the bottom of my purse
I walk into the street
The air's so cool
I'm wired and I'm tired
And I'm grinnin' like a fool

I've been on the floor lookin' for a chair
I've been on a chair lookin' for a couch
And I've been on a couch lookin' for a bed...
Lookin' for a bed
Lookin' for my, my...

My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
Say... my right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man

If he can't fix it, I don't know who can
