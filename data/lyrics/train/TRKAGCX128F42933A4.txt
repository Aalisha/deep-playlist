There's so many people dying
You complain' about your situation
What about me?
Half the world wouldn't know
What it's like to lose your seed
Maybe you can understand

 (How I feel)
I cannot reach that soul
You're probably watchin' over us
Know that I think of you
It's killing me

The guilt has lasted years
Still cry
