Love is the place where we came from
Created in passion, and harmony
And why can't we live with this love?
Together. in humanity

When daylight surrenders into twilight
And ten billion stars light up the night
We are all apart of this great wonder
And Earth keeps on spinnin' in the light

Take one look at what's around you
It's all apart, of who you are
Love is what makes you stronger
