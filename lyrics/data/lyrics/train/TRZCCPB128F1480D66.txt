(words t.bryn/music t.bryn, brad nack) 
(temptation rap by m. brooke) 

The beat of love is a nasty one. 
It's a flame from the devils fire. 
'cause nothing is stronger than boys and their eyes 
And it's worse when you know he's a liar. 
It's just the beat of love. 

The beat of love is a nasty one 
They promise you heaven they promise you fun then the 
Next thing you know you are down on the floor 
And you think you're in love 
Oh heaven above 
It's just the beat of love.
