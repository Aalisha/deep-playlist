I never intended
To even know your name

Except for the woman waitin' at home
they've all been the same
I've always been true
Except for you

Not even a one night stand
And I never intended
For it to get so
Out of hand

Out of hand, out of hand
I'm a hard-living kind of a man
I need more to keep me goin'
Than this gold wedding band
