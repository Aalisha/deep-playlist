Oblivious in high spirits like any other day.
Masked man waiting at the doorstep
For three of one to slay.
Welcome home,
Welcome back.
Welcome to your brutal end.
A violent force sweeps over them.
In a second all turns black.
Three of one! Three of one!
One alive and three undone.
Two on the wall, third on the floor.
For they are three of one!
Three Of One!
Terrorizing slaughterhouse
