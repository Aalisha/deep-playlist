You hide it everytime you move
impatience waits around for me
You dance under the question mark
without even trying

I'm just not sure it's gonna work
I'm just not sure it's gonna work

You can burn it all
Rally around the table
If you want to
Just to argue all the last scenes of us
You can end it all
I'm sorry enough to tell you
...
