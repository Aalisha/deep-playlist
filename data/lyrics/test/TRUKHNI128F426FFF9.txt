God's angels had no grace...
Rotting in angelic flesh, stench of heaven burning
Gorging on the savior, rebirth through atonement
Secreting the filth that fills the crypts

Swallowed soul vomits forth
Spines are severed and collected
Torn apart from the corpses
Bodies left decaying, beneath the rotting sky
...
