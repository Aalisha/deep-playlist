Lime green, lime green and tangerine
Are the sickly sweet colors of the snakes I'm seein'
Lime green and tangerine
Are the sickly sweet colors of the devil in my dreams

Lime green, lime green and tangerine
Are the sickly sweet colors of the snakes I'm seein'
Lime green and tangerine
Are the sickly sweet colors of the devil in my dreams

It gets to Friday and I give you a call
You know I'm gettin' kind of worried
She doesn't seem herself at all
Lime green and a sickly kind of orange
I've never seen her like this before

I had the best laid plans this side of America
Started out in church and finished with Angelica
Red and blue soul with a Snow White smile
Can you dig it, can you dig it, can you dig it?
