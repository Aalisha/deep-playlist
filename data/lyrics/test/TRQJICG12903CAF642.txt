Your initial reply hit me undercover
When I lost my head to it
It was out of its time, it was undiscovered
As I caught my breath again

You were running out of lies to keep me under
Afraid of your back hands
So to speak
You had me shaking at the knees

But I don't know the way out of this mess

And if you would've seen me at my best
Would it have changed anything at all?

Remember when we never had to remember
When times were better, when times were better than this
We never had to remember when times were better
When times were better than this

The door was always open
But still not nearly enough to let me in
