All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
Some I love but you I adore

You think you're really swinging
But you're off the beat
The moves your brains a thinking
Doesn't reach your feet
You got to get this complication out of your head
Or find another man instead

All I thought I wanted was a front door
All I thought I wanted was a place in the country
Now I realise I wanted so much more
...
