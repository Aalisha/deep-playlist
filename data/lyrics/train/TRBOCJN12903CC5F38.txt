When I'm walking down the street they say: hey sexy (Hey, sexy)
When I'm dancing in the club they say: hey sexy (Hey, sexy)
When I'm driving in my car or I'm standing at the bar
it don't matter where I are, they say: hey sexy (Hey, sexy)

Silly boys, they loving me so much
Silly boys, you can look but you can't touch
Silly boys, I ain't got no time to talk
Silly boys, just shut up and watch me walk

Cos I'm too sexy in this club
too sexy in this club,
so sexy it hurts
If you feel sexy in this club
Then go ahead and toast it up,
Take it down, lets get sexy right now!
(now now...)
Get sexy right now, now, now...
...
