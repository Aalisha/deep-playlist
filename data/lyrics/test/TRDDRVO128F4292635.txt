I change my dollar for a dime
Walk the shoulder
To the pay phone line
By the roadside bar
On a neon night
I pull up my collar in the wind
Warm my hand
And the pocket tears again
I hear a jukebox start
It's got a bass drum heart
Just once
Just once I'd like to find you
Just once
Just once I'd like to find you
Home
