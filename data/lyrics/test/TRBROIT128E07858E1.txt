Cry baby, cry, I hear what you say
You used to have a good man, baby
But you, you threw it all away

Live, baby, live while you still can
I can change your world, baby
If you let me be your man

I wanna get you out of the place you're in
I wanna leave you with no doubt
I wanna get you out of the place you're in
