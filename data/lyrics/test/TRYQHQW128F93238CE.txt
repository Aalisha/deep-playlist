O-o-oh, whoa-o-o-o-oh, O-o-oh, whoa-o-o-o-o-whoa
Were the teachers any good at it
Were they good at their jobs
It must be hard, can they handle it
When we become what they said we'd not

O-o-oh, whoa-o-o-o-oh, O-o-oh, whoa-o-o-o-o-whoa
Now we work and we pay for it
Doing any old chore
It makes money so we stick it through
And day to day
The days go by and by and by and by, well

I just don't want to die like a fool
I'm not
Lost
