It used to be, we would be the best of all friends
It turned to be L O V E and I was your man
So you was my lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side
Through the ins and outs, the wrongs and rights

After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how to keep the love
'Cuz I was young, I wish I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't let you go, I swear I would've made this love grow
I spent a lot of time and a lot of dough
Tryin' to match what we had and now I, I

I was hopin' we could find a way
To have what we had again today
Though it's been some time since you and I
It wouldn't hurt to try to find our love

Wish that I would have known the treasures I'd found
I didn't know until you left, I loved your smile
...
