Song Name-Crazy. Album-Messy
La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La,
La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La, La...

It started the day when I called her,
Needed to cry on her shoulder.
I was upset,
Me and my man was argueing...
I was filled with suspision,
Really do need a decision.

What should I say or do? Or scream or cry?
I don't know why he always wants to be alone,
But he is never in his home,
Won't even answer to his phone...

Me and my girl drove to his place,
And see one sket all in his face.
Uh uh, this fool's getting replaced.

You make me crazy.
Why u wanna hold me down?
Wanna mess around when you know I'm dowm.
You drive me crazy,
If you keep running around,
Wanna play around,
You get caught out.
You make me crazy,
Mess around when you know I'm dowm.
You drive me crazy,
If you keep running around,
...
