Hey, always lookin' for a good time
She came on just like a hurricane
Man, she was far too hot to handle
Like fightin' fire with gasoline

All I needed was compassion

That first bite chilled me to the bone

Bad blood
Runnin' through my veins
Bad, bad blood
Is drivin' me insane

Hey, I've become a wild one
Well, I'm not quite the man I used to be
Oh, just like livin', on livin' a knife edge
