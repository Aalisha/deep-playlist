Running with the wolf pack
Feel like I'm never coming back
And every time there's sunshine
I'm blind, yeah

I am everybody
And everyone that I know is me
Everyone that I know

I could have been a shooting star
I could have been a dreamer, yeah

I'm another number
And you know the numbers must agree
But every time the wind blows
I can't fly, why?
