Sometimes you can feel the rug pulled from below your feet
It's like one minute you're like a rock standing strong and the next you're beat
It's not up to you, something's always there, working behind the scenes
Invisible hands handcuffing and last chance bluffing, feeding their greed

Pacified reason, it's adding up to treason, we are your slap in the face now
The sons who've been cast out
Slip under the wire, our spark ignites the fire
