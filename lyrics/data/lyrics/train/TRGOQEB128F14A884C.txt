I don't believe in angels
Well, at least not in yours
But I believe in the sensation
of holding you close

And I don't believe in exile
at least not how you practise it
but I'm willing to regret
all the travels I made
all the triumphs in my book
'cause I'm afraid
that they took me away from you

-So, don't be upset
'cause your bottleneck barbiturate
ain't helping you out
-It wasn't meant to be
a hole in the ground
