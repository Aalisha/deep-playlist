A last minute decision
Lay it all on the line
Glasspipe recollections of antichrist
The nominees all on fire

Cash money upfront
We're all part of the scam
Dead stars at the end of the rope
A fake miracle to behold

Life is bright
It'll take out your eyes
Burn these lies
Cut away the ties

Ninety nine knives inside
...
