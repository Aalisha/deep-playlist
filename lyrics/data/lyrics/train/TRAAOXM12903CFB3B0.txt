I start to search all the dark places that I have found,
All the deep creases in my mind that are torn up somehow.

I want to keep the pace,
I want to figure it out,
I've got to do it this way,
If I don't, everything's lost.

Have you ever really noticed the blanket of shame,
from the torment and pain?
That you realise that no one's ever been there.
Have you ever looked at the violence you hide,
always running inside,
You can't escape, it's always been there.

I tear a hole inside me head to let the demons go
I cut my flesh to purge the hatred from so long ago

I want to keep the pace,
I want to figure it out,
I've got to do it this way
If I don't, everything's lost.
