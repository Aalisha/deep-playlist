Mic check, one, two get ready uhm
I'ma get you sweaty and JE they gon' give you some
Mic check, one, two get ready uhm
I'ma get you sweaty and JE they gon' give you some
Mic check, one, two get ready uhm
I'ma get you sweaty and JE they gon' give you some
Mic check, one, two get ready uhm
I'ma get you sweaty and JE they gon' give you some

I've tried to let you go so many times yes I have
And I never thought that going back would ever cross my mind
See I find, it's only you, back to give me that special treatment
I ain't never been one to beg, baby I miss you and baby I need you

You know I like the way you make me feel inside
