Intro:

There's something special 'bout six o'clock
In the morning when it's still too early to knock
And the dusty light shines down on the block
And reflects up and down on the hands of the clock
Six o'clock, six o'clock

Verse 1:

A few hours ago she was standing here
Just watching the stars in our eyes and the lights as the tides
disappeared
And I could feel I could say what I want
That I could nudge her and call her my confidante
And now I'm back alone with just my shadow in front
six o'clock, six o'clock
