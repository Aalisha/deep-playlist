(Incarnation I:)

Learn to admit the Machine's emanations
Act of initiatory chivalry
Learn to see the dramas in the sky
Act of terrestrial abnegation

You are not one of them
Not the same breed
You always felt out of place
Join your true scene

You want blood, not peace
You want shouts, you want tears
Not wisdom
Some Divine in their afflictions

(Incarnation II:)

Learn to stand apart from all profane dogmas
Act of final mind revolution
Learn to not care about their punishments
Act of war and liberation

You are not one of them
Not the same breed
You always felt out of place
Join your true scene
