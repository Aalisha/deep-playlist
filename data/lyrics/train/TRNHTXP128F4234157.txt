You better watch what you're doin' baby
You better watch yourself
The way you've been actin' baby
Must have your mind somewhere else
Not lookin' where you're goin'
Keep crossing over the line
You're bound to lose control baby
It's just a matter of time

You're going to take the highway
Take the highway down

I know that you've been mistreated baby
I know you've been hurt
...
