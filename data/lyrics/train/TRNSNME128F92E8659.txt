Well uhh,???? is macaroni and cheese
Before I start, I gots ta umm fart, no I gots ta uhh sneeze
Not, I gotcha trippin, yippity-doo-da-day
Shucks, I'm makin bucks so umm hip-hip-hooray and then some
Cos I'm a powsy wowsy ace boom coon
So shout "wa-bap-a-loo-ba-bawa-bam-boom!"
Drayx up for sure dang, now that I'm flexed
My a-efx'll quote, when the bridge fell down
And i'ma good ship with the lollipop
Left town so yiggity-yack, you booga-loo black
Oki doki, oopsy daisy, cos I'm krayzie like that
But it's the cat got snuffed, or mr.red and his crew
So roll a spliff and rub-a-dub and then ya make beef stew
Troop, I got the hoolahoop, baby woop, dooby-doo
Lassie boy, you made a mess, now go and get the pooper scoop
Oops, I wibble-wobble-wobble-wee while I make
But hocus-pocus and yippy-yi-yo, yay for dray and...

"klap your hands now" (x3)

Bon voyage, look out below cos umm
I got my socks on, the popcorn, the hubba bubba, yep gum
Skippity bum, you think I don't know the time
Well it's half-past a cow's ass and I'm a real bad ass
Yeah, shitty-bang-boom-bang, yo who rang?
Abra-cadabra, jimminy crickets, set the wrists to my slang
