The air tears at my skin 
Robbing my veins of the life
I'd hoped to have
You killed a part of me tonight 
And left the frozen air to finish the job
Now I realize 
The cowardice you kept behind your bloodshot eyes 
And awkward frame was calling the shots
And I was left depleted
Grinning like a retard who thought you were there 
When you had retreated 

I'm slowing down into a shallow circle 
While my heartbeat fills the gaps 
Between sporadic and failing gasps
I'm face down in the mud 
My eyes still bruised and purple 
...
