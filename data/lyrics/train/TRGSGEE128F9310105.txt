[Intro]:
"Very important"
What? What? Yo, Louis fuckin' Logic. (Celph Titled)

[Verse One] [Louis Logic]
If this was a live show I'd probably get dragged from the stage
Handcuffed and caged for cursin' and spittin' at 5-0
I'm on a mission to find folks to victimize
Sadomasochists wishin' to die slow listen to my flows
The torturous
I'll see to it you're finished
Leave your unfortunate seeds in an orphanage
Even if your image dictates
You love the way a dick tastes
You'll get tossed from a big stage
Put your hands down dick face
I didn't tell you to raise them
I started underground and then I fell through the basement
Misplaced soul like I had to sell it to Satan
And amidst the hellish arrangement tried to tell him to change it
So make irrelevant statements, say that you sell your tape
And say that your 12" played on your favorite well listened station
I'm waitin' for celebratin' your folded career over a beer
I know where you live, wake up and smell the fragrance

[Chorus] [Louis Logic] (Celph Titled)
Heathenous (Cretinous)
Reasonless (Savages)
Treasonous activists
(Greedy and ravenous)
We face off (Wage war)
And beat up on pacifists
(He's the compassionless)
And he's the antagonist
Diabolos!

[Verse Two] [Celph Titled]
Yo, who the fuck else you know
That'll run up on your block strip
Like an insane Christopher Columbus and start conquering shit
Celph Titled's that nigga, and he ain't playin' dog
I thought I told you that we blazin' niggas 'till they skin fall off
