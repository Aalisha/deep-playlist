The games, the games we play
I quit
'Cause I'm weak, I'm all too weak
Like an old man waiting for the right time to die

I was hooked on a beat
In my mind on repeat
I was singing a melody
Don't know where I've got it from
Then I thought about you
I found your heart on the floor
Beating like never before
Found out your heartbeat matched mine
We're fragile like a baby's spine
Together we turn water into wine
