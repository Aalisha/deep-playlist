So the aliens have landed
They'll be moving through you and I
And as the family disbanded
They dragged the sadness into light

No more tears, no more pain
Only things to keep you sane
It's only fun

And in the distance there's talk now
Everyone wants to go home
I hope you know you're not leaving
For the night has just begun
