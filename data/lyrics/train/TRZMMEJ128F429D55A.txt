This is how we rollin
Swollen on a saturday
I had a way to chill hard
3 I'll broads wanted to hook up
So I looked up, tajai and snupe
Call 'em up
Aye, yo what's up? 
We need to troop to these hoe's house.

[tajai] yo where they stay at? 

73rd and lockwood

[tajai] what? 

But the cops good

[tajai] ohh aight

So don't trip
Niggas ain't sweatin
Plus they wont flip if you don't say nothin

[snupe] yo, it ain't no thing, I'll bring the glock

Just in case these niggas on her block
Don't wanna throw thangs. . .

[snupe] yeap
[tajai] I'm wit it, let's bounce!
