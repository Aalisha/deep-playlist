The weatherman says, "Goodnight"
The Empire State Building's turning off it's lights
The refrigerator stops and suddenly it's quiet

I never noticed the ceilings were so low
I never saw all the cracks on the window
I never saw myself as sentimental but here I go

Without you I've been standing 'round you like a statue
Laying on the floor, thinking about you
I talk to myself like the crazies do
Otherwise I'm great, what about you?
