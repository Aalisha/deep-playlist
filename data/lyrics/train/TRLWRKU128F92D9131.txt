Every breath he takes he takes with style
You can only have him for a little while, but that’s alright
He can break your heart when he holds your hand,
And make you want to change your plans for just one night.
And when he takes you in his arms,
Something else besides his charm holds you there,
Somethin’ that you can’t define,
That’s got a grip on your mind, but you don’t care.

He’s the sexiest man alive
What a sexy man
