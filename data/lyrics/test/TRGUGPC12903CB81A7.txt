It seems I'm always lookin' for something I can't find
Love that's true and lasting to ease my troubled mind
Just when I think I found it and new light starts to dawn
Darkness closes in and love is gone

Chorus:
Here to stay then blown away and gone like the smoke
From a fast mail train rollin' down the track
...
