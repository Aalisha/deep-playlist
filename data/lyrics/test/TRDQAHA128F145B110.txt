I heard that she hurt you…she broke your heart
They said that you just broke down and cried (I couldn't believe it, boy)
‘Cause you were the lover (Casanova)
God's gift to this world
And no one girl could ever tie you down
At last, the shoe is on the other foot
And I know just what you've been going through
‘Cause I'm still here waiting for you!

Chorus
