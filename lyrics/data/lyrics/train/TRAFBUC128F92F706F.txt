Since the first day we walk the earth
It's time to redefine a woman's worth
Where there's love
We don't know what we're capable of

Watched my mother as a little girl
Easily carry the weight of the world
At least I knew for me she'd always try

And these footsteps I will follow through
'Til I can't take no more

Feel me breathing, now I'm alive
If you ask me to walk through the fire
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
A woman's gonna try

I'll bend, but I won't break
Even not, though I make mistakes
I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
A woman's gonna try

As long as there's love
I'll try
(A woman's gonna try)
As long as there's love
I'll try, I'll try
(A woman's gonna try)
