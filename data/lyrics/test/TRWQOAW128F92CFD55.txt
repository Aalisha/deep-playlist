Ancient architecture of the dark ways buried in time
Re-birthed start the master plan of evil design
Genocide of the weakness, the artifact falling into their minds
Demonic rites seep from the depths of hell's confines
Then I stand in solitude as I watch this chaos destroy
All the false ways of life this world employs
Denial of life I view before my eyes
Desolation like a wind swept plain makes room, watch the evil arise
Cannot help but see what lies ahead
