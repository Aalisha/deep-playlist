It's only doubts that we're counting on fingers broken long ago
I read that with every broken heart we should become more adventurous
if you banish me from your prophets and if I get banished from the kingdom up above
I'd sacrifice money and heaven all for love
Let me be loved, let me be loved

And if my brain quits well I guess then that's just it
And if my hands stop working you can call me lazy
And if I get pregnant I guess I'll just have the baby
...
