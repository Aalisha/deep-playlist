Gone fishing for compliments
On hollywood and vine
I'd come to your party
But i haven't finished mine
Talk to the doctor
He turns acid into wine, and

I am an angel
In the city of angels
Nothing cuts too deep
Yes i am an angel
In the city of angels
And i live the biggest sleep ... Oh oh oh

I'm off to chew the fat
Where all we in-crowd chew
Hang loose at the Oscar show
And at the yacht club too
...
