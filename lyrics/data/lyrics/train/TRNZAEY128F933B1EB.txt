no one knows
no one sees the fear inside
and no one prays
no one feels the pain you hide
and no one hurts
no one tastes the tears you cry
cause no one cares
no one heard you say goodbye
cause i have been waiting for the day
when you'll see i'm right by your side
cause you know i will not be denied

i see it
and i hear it
i taste it
...
