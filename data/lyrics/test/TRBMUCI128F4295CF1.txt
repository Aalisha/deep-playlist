You're my size I need to try you on
Someone in between the right and wrong
Through everything you kept your wings apart
Through everything you scared the sinners
And when I've had enough

She drains me
When I'm empty
She helps herself
She takes it all
In too deep
She's spilling over me
In too deep
She's spilling over me
Don't wanna have it all
