God save the Queen
The fascist regime,
They made you a moron
A potential H-bomb

God save the Queen
She ain't no human being
There is no future
And England's dreaming

Don't be told what you want
Don't be told what you need
There's no future
No future
No future for you

God save the Queen
We mean it man
...
