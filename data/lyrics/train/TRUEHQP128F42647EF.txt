It's three a.m. in the morning
The train whistle is blowin'
It sounds like some lonesome song got in my soul, in my soul
My baby split blank and he won't be back no more

My baby thinks he's a train
He makes his whistle stop, then he's gone again
Sometimes it's hard on a poor girl's brain, a poor girl's brain
I'm tellin' you, boys, my baby thinks he's a train.
