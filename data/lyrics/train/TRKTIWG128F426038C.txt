You can't change without someone's shadow
'Cuz then it's gone
when you still shine
You can't change to solve somebody's name
Don't blink until you're made

When all destroyed, broke all in Hell,
and you don't need what you could steal;
I'm feeling like something I don't know that's wrong
And I know the sad in my heart
...
