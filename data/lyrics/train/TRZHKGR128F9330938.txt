She came up to me and she said,

Catch you later, baby, I gotta split,
I got a habit, I just can't quit.
Catch you later, baby, I gotta split,
I got a habit, I just can't quit.

Just biting my nails.
Just biting my nails.
Just biting my nails.
Just biting my nails.

Sound system plays a Renegade tune,
Pretty woman and a big full moon,
A handsome man, look, a diamond ring,
How he wishes he had that thing.

Just biting my nails.
Just biting my nails.
Just biting my nails.
Just biting my nails.

He's got a finger in her painted lips,
Oh he's got a hand upon her African hips,
...
