Hey yeah, oh yeah
Do u see?

Do u see what I see? Yeah yeah
Do u see what I see? Alright
Do u see what I see? Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Never say never, now I know better
Always said, I'll never fall in love, oh no
I never felt pressure till I got with you
Now I finally found someone, do you, do u see?

Do u see what I see?
A future, a family, you and me, baby
Do you feel how I feel?
