I am thinkin' about something
Oh, yeah
Let's do it

Every now and then you feel
Like jumping off the deep end
Pack a few things head to New Orleans
Commit a few sins

With a good rockin' daddy
That can rock all night
Make you feel good
Make you feel alright

You don't do it, baby
But you think about it

You wanna spend your life, your love
And your money in the fast lane
Let the good times roll
Body and soul, ruin the family name
...
