I know I've got it. anything you've got.

I'm all or nothing. run from this prison we created.
in our lives. get me out.
It's just another. way into the cheaper way of life.
get in line. set me free.

follow the trends of the needy. they'll make it easy on you.
I'm here with the worst of them. waiting. watching. for the time to strike.

all you sinners. come out. come clean.
