Distract everyone and they won't get to the bottom of this oh yeah
Distract everyone and they won't get to the bottom of this oh yeah
The'll never know what we've done as long as we keep them dumb and useless oh yeah
Distract everyone and they won't get to the bottom of this

Yeah
They got away scott free again
It's plain to see
Oh yeah
They'l take their secret to the grave
When will we question them

Distract everyone and they won't get to the bottom of this oh yeah
Distract everyone and they won't get to the bottom of this oh yeah
The'll never know what we've done as long as we keep them dumb and useless oh yeah
