It's just a bad movie, where there's no crying
Handing the keys to me in this Red Lion,
Where the lock that you locked in the suite says there's no prying
When the breath that you breathed in the street screams there's no science
When you look how you looked then to me, then I cease lying and fall into silence

It's just a life story, so there's no climax
No more new territory, so pull away the IMAX
