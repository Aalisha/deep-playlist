Galloping through the morning dew
There's only one thing that I want to do to you
And it's true that I'm going to do it soon

Galloping through the morning dew
There's only one thing that I want to do to you
And it's true that I'm going to do it soon

Rory, Rory ride me Rory
Rory, Rory ride me Rory
Rory, ride me slowly
Ride me raw, raw, raw
