Waking up in panic
A room not hot or cold
Afraid to fall asleep again
My other side will unfold

I am on the edge of sanity
Far out in a hazy, troubled dream

I've scored the morning
A crimson red thought
Someone is struggling
With the battles I've fought

Sleeping in the traffic
Red lights turn to green
Blinding painted white lines
Moving in between

I am on the edge of sanity
Far out in a hazy, troubled dream

Time and time over
It's always the same
Reckon you know me?
Are you playing my game?

Me is my own worst enemy

In a room of frantic fools
Waiting for a juicy blues
I present my guitar song
Scratching strings with tones too long
They see of with tired eyes
Hidden coughs, 'he's full of lies!'
Cigarette smoke and black tar stains
Darkness feasts on my remains

Please save me

Out of darkness into light
Still there's no salvation in sight
Seven wishes, what's the first?
Seven wishes, quench your blood-thirst
Killing has no consequence
In a world that makes no sense
Blow the brain that brought this up
Blow the brain that thought this up

Please save me

Lady in the doorway
With a face that's so kind
Caressing smells
Twisting my mind
Magical evening, and
She's got the glow
...
