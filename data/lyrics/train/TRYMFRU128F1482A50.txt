Summer's almost here and the evening's getting warm
Screw my head on a different way
Hug my pillow and try not to count the days

Winter's gone away and the mornings aren't so cold
Rub the sleep out of my face
Hug my pillow and try not to count the days
Get your face out of my brain

I don't believe in being brave
Ba, ba, ba, bah
...
