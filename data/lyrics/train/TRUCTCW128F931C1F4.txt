I'm jumpin all over this track like a trampoline
You can call me the master of seen and unseen
I'm like a glad-lock zip, makin MCs turn green
And ever since the age of 7 was a hip hop fiend
Sendin a shout to the bad seed, my man Dupree
representin Diamond district all the way from queens
Woulda finished up the album but I bought the play station
Now we sit for hours playin 4 mcs an education
I release stress with my ball point pen
Making it scroll from left to right and back again
Representin for the league 7 women 2 men
Cuz we got 9 players on the team a.m
Not players in the sense that we sick for style
It's like I bounce on funky tracks with the lyrical style
From the field to the studio the game stays on
From the present to infinity my vocals stay strong
