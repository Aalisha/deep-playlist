All the streets look the same 'til I'm fumbling for change
Light on the porch like we had arranged
Home street home, it cheers me
Pat my pockets for the key

The boys and I have been throwing back glasses in big stone houses
Waiting glazed for the man to rouse us
Those two in despair
After this round we're square
Yeah, we're square
