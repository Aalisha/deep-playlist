I like to watch things... like to watch things grow, and to take things slow
I like to take them in with the starlight and the moon on a cold night
Oh, I’d like to see them stay

Like those days when we must walk this world alone
As the purple sky turns grey and the world grows cold
 ...and the world grows cold

...
