Someone's standing in a welfare line
Or off the freeway with a hungry sign
Someone's stressing 'bout to lose their mind
I gotta be thankful, thankful

Someone just became a single mother
Someone just lost a sister or brother
It's so important that we love each other
And be thankful, thankful

I've gotta take the time to say
That I'm thankful, thankful
For every single breath that I take
I've gotta be thankful, thankful

Someone's sitting in a prison cell
Wasting away in their own personal hell
Everybody's got their own story to tell
...
