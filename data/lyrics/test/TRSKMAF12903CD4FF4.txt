(Ring me up now
Come on now, quit bullshittin)

[Chorus - Brother Ali] - 2X
Sunset never seemed so long
Five and the sky's still goin strong
Jewel and the crown keep holdin on
Never let it go 'til it's all gone

[Verse 1 - Brother Ali]
I glide across the surface with my head held high
Shoulders pushed back, I'm convinced I'll never die
Got a squint to my eye like I can't take the world in
Too much beauty to behold by one person
Wear the sky around my shoulder like a tailor made cloak
Create or decorated with my never fadin hopes
My same old skin like the robe of a King
Gold, platinum bling happen to grow from my chin
...
