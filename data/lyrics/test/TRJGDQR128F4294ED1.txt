Well one bad stud moved in my neighbourhood
Well one bad stud moved in my neighbourhood
He's big and man I know he ain't no good
He don't wear no hat, and Lord he don't wear no shoes
He don't wear no hat, and Lord he don't wear no shoes
He just hangs on the corner singing old country blues

[Chorus]
Oh well, one bad stud
One bad stud
One bad stud
