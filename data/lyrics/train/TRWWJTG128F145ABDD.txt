Set me on my destination
Point me the way to my position
What's the meaning of my mission
I have made my decision clear

I don't need another reason
I don't want anymore prime time
I have made my decision
Not for the first but for the last time

I'm setting on slow
I'm building it up
I'm letting it go
The pressure will blow on time
