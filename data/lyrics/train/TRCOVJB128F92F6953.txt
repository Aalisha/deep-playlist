Turn around, watch me move
To the ground, I bring you fool
Listen to the smallest sound
Wake up now, you cannot hide
You made mistakes, it's time to pay
Foolish boy, is what they say
So back up now, and take your fall
Listen to your conscience call

I am your conscience baby
I follow where you are
You don't believe it baby
