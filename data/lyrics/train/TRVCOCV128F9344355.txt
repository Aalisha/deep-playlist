Trying to ignore him
Trying to have self control
When that tounge slips just once
It's in his eyes

Thank you...

Silence by energy
Push me down
And the likes to come again
Here to make you listen to them
Treated to many times
The eye for eye has left us blind
This creature of demise
Repaid all the time
