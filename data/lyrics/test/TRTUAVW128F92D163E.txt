I forgot about the time that there was somebody in my past,
I feel time has passed so quickly since I took the photograph.
Thanks for the memory that doesn't fade in my heart.
Look at us smiling in the photograph, you can see the secrets behind the fake smiles.
Thanks for the memory that doesn't fade in my heart.

The past was destroyed by you, I'm not going to forget our truth was shadowed in the darkness of war.
