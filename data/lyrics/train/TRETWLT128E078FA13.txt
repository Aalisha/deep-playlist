Hate me with everything
I'm better off without your animosity
I'll even sleep better at night, at night

I won't believe in you
Reminded me of everything you put me through
Now everything just feels alright, alright

I feel so betrayed, mistaken
I create another day
You'll be gone tomorrow
Lie to me, you're faceless
