I'll do my time and I won't argue
A broken glass, a portrait of you
I play on keys of barely in tune
Forget the reasons, I won't resume

It's not me who wanted fame
Well, I just needed to

I cash my life and lost my ID
Well, apathy is all I see
Leave the numbers all behind me
You are all, I've got inside me

Well, I don't need to be encaged
Well, I just need to rearrange

Well, I can't see you anymore
And I can't leave right out the door
Well, after all that we've been through
Well, I can't be with or without you
...
