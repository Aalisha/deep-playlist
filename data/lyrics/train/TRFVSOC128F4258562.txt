I toss and turn, your presence disturbs me
Seethe and burn, you ignite me
You move away but not too far
You move away but not too far
I need to know just where you are
'Cuz I keep track of my friends
And I keep track of my enemies
Who is who, who is who, it changes daily

And you loved her truly yet you loved her cruelly
You loved her truly but you loved her cruelly
You love her

I see you icy blue
Cold and indifferent
No emotion, no commitment
I see she and she sees a red red sea
Bleeding for life, now she's bleeding to death
...
