Well I'm waiting in the wings with all the strings
And things that help me makeÂ  the music
Just another curtain call before I fall
Into you arms again, my beauty
This guitar does not lie
The great deception is not my achievement

The spotlight falls upon the fool
Who sings of love then acts so cool
And then calmly smiles
