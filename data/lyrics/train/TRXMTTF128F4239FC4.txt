The world is the future
A whore to a strong man
Our weakened feet will try
To dwell in a lie
They tell me we're losin'
Our talent of using
The dead mans' deed as guide

We praised in the name of God, no never again
We saw the death that raped the blood of all those men
We praised in the name of God, no never again
We found the thought that plagued this world
It was strong and blind...

The weaker must die
...
