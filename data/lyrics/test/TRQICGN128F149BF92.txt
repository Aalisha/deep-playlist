Jamison

If I was the sun way up there
I'd go with her most everywhere
I'll be the moon when the sun go down
Just to let her know I'm still around.

That's how strong my love is, darling
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is
That's how strong my love is.

I'll be the weeping willow drowning in my tears
You can go swimming when you are here
I'll be the rainbow when the tears are gone
Wrap you in my colours and keep you warm.
