Little bands chillin' out, lookin' for jump starts
Stealin' from the big boys, makin' all the hit charts
Little bands cry, stay home and smoke dope
Can't get a deal and done walkin' the tightrope

Just another band you blow
Just another song I know
Oh, and away you go

Talk of that man, start lickin' his numb nuts
Crawlin' back home to think up a new haircut
We're the last of the breed that's why we're the Moistboyz
