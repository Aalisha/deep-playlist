Something's happening here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

I think it's time we stop

Battle lines bein' drawn
Nobody's right if everyone's wrong
People speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

Yeah, stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
