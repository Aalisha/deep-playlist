I hope you know what your doing to me here
What your doing to me me here
Take some resonsibility for your awareness of the levels on which we lie
I'd hate to believe only to find that I'm wrong
I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong
I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Don't act that way it's unbecoming just do what you do
Do what you do, do what you do, do what you do, do what you do

I only know that you're the one that always makes me feel it
It's nothing that you do or say it's just the way you are
If I could bottle what you got then life would be too perfect
I'll take it as it comes, any way you choose to give it

I challenge you to make a wrong move
A wrong move, a wrong move
Even when your acting the fool I cannot see through you
