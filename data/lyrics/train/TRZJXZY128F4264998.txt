I'm waiting for the bus to come
I'm lying on a bench
Thinking of a book I read
And wondering what it meant

I hear footsteps coming closer
It's an ordinary man
He comes up to me, shakes my hand
And asks me, who I am?

I am paralyzed, I can't talk or move
What could I say?
And before I have the chance to think
I tell this man my name
I tell this man my name
