Nothing can stop me
So bad do I feel inside
Get my hat, I'm checking out
Cause you and your friends
Really hurt my pride

So unexpected
You shot me down
With all the fellas
Standing around, yeah

(CHORUS)
Please don't go
That's what they'll be saying
Please don't go
But I'm not playing
Cause nothing can stop me

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
