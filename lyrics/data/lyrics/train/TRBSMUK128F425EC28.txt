Baby, life was good to me
But you just made it better
I love the way you stand by me
Through any kind of weather

I don't wanna run away, just wanna make your day
When you feel the world is on your shoulders
I don't wanna make it worse, just wanna make us work
Baby, tell me I will do whatever

It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
Baby, nobody, nobody until you
