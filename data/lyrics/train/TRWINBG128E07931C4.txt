So many people
With nothing to do
Hundreds of buildings
That block out my view

Watched by a tramp
With a hole in his shoe
Standing alone
On the corner

He's thinking that work
Is all a big joke
While he looks in the gutter
For something to smoke

And two hundred kids
In one red minimoke
Scream down the street
Fully loaded

Day in the city
Oh, what a pity
