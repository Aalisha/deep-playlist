I can hear their song from miles away.
It's carried in the wind.
Its melody is sung to me in miracles.
The sun rises over the sea.

When I hear their love song.
I don't understand.
From out beyond the shadows.
I can hear it calling me.

Honestly, if I'm honest with myself.
I've cried myself to sleep.
Crying out, 'Oh God, where are you?
Can you hear my scream way up there.
Through the clouds, in heaven?
Do you even care?'
And honestly if I'm honest with myself.
I hate the song they sing.
It's like salt on an open wound.
But I can't get it out of my head.

This melody kills me.
It's out of key and foolish.
But I think I might just like it.
If I could just get past my pride.
I turn my head and look away.
