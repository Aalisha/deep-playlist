Don't even say it, baby
'Cause your words cut like a knife
Don't even think it, baby
'Cause I can read everything in your mind

You just don't know how much I'll miss you
Maybe a thousand years or more
So don't tell me that you're leaving
Don't you walk out that door

There's no bridge I wouldn't cross
There's no river that's too wide
If you leave me, I would search for you, baby
Nothin' could keep me away

Don't you deny it, baby
Holding back love can cause you real pain
This is our one chance
So don't lose it, baby
