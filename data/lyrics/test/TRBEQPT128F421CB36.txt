Sometimes I feel so alive
Sometimes I see so clear
Just like the way we always were
So young and free from fear

I lose my fear of war and dying
And all the clouds just disappear
Only my mirror sees me crying
Each time I lose another year

Wouldn't it be a drag to be like you?
Settling down and having kids
And telling them what to do
Well I'm gonna stay

 (19 forever)
Yes I'm
 (19 forever)
I'm gonna be
 (19 forever)
Yes I will
 (19 forever)

We can do magic in these times
