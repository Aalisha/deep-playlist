Desire
When your desire
It has been found
You'll be running far away
When your desire
It has been found
You'll be running far away

You're telling me its in the trees, in the trees
It's not, it's inside me now
You're telling me it's on the ground
It's all around
Well it's not, it's inside me

You're telling me it's in the skies
Well use your eyes
It's not, it's inside me now
You're telling me it's Mother Earth
Some sign of birth
It's not, it's inside me, uh huh

Desire
When your, your desire
