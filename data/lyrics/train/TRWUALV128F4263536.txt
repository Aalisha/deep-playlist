Don't you give me give me give me your borrowed time
Don't you give me give me give me your recycled line
Who do you think you are?
You must think you're something

Don't you give me give me give me you're here to help me
Got to get with the program, I don't need no charity
I don't need shit and you ain't nothing

And if I made a perfect world you'd be gone
Don't give me give me give me your misguided help
Don't give me your nothin', I can do it myself
Well I don't want shit and I don't need nothing

Don't you give me give me give me your look of concern
I don't need your meddling when you gonna learn
Well you ain't shit and you ain't nothin'

Well I just made my perfect world-oops you're gone
Well now you know what it feels like not to belong-so long
