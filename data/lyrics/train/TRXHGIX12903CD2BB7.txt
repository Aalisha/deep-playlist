Originally by Stiff Little Fingers

Inflammable material is planted in my head
It's a suspect device that's left 2000 dead
Their solutions are your problems
They put up the wall
On each side time and prime us
And make sure we got fuck all
They play their games of power
They mark and cut the pack
They deal us to the bottom
But do they put back?
