I used to sit for hours as a kid
And dangle my feet from an old flat bridge
Seeing myself in the water below
Shatter my image with the rocks I'd throw
Shatter my image with the rocks I'd throw
Long time gone and a long time ago
When I shattered my image with the rocks I'd throw
The world is cruel and people are cold
Now they shatter my image with the rocks they throw
Shatter my image with the rocks they throw

I'm far from perfect but I ain't all bad
