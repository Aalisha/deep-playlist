Do you feel disturbance?
A disturbance hits the news
You can't dismiss it or ignore it
And you've waited so long for it
It's the winner's turn to lose
(We can't wait another day)

In Paris and Geneve
In Frankfurt and Berlin
In London, Rome and Lisbon
A crisis will begin
Do you feel anticipation?
Do you feel you're being used?
It's the resurrection showdown
It's the winners turn to lose

Let's go all the way
There's a target to destroy
Let's go all the way
There's an army to deploy
Let's go all the way
You're free to make a choice
Are you ready?
