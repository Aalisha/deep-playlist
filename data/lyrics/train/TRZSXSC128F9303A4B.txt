Who is following me, who is following me
Should I run, should I hide, should I act like a different man
Will I ever face my fear, who is following me

Standing in the shadows - I just don't know
Reaching for the light - just give me a sign
Take this empty spirit - where will I go
Throw away my pride - what will I find

Who is watching me, somebody's watching me
Get so close and lose it all, get so high and then I fall
...
