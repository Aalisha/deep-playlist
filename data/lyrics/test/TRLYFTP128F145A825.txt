My hands are in motion
My wheels do not change
My pain I turn into heat
Inside these flames
When time has no meanin'
Where seasons don't change
I dream with the heart of a thief
And I don't feel no shame

There's an island
In my soul
There's desire
Burnin' deep down, down below

Dance demons
Lose control
This is a metal a metal tango
Dance demons
Don't you know
