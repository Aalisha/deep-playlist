Lady Fantasy - Lady Fantasy -
Lady Fantasy - Lady Fantasy - Lady Fantasy.

Lady Fantasy -
Time for me to patcli up the harm that you've done.
Don't belong to me

so there's no use in trying to be number one.
Why must you be the one
who keeps giving me heartache all the tim
Inventing sweet illusions and steadily poisoning my mind.
Why make my life a misery
why do you want to make me pay?
Don't try to make a fool of me
...
