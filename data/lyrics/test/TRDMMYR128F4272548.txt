written by B. Setzer

Well, my baby and me went out late Saturday night
I had my hair piled high and my baby just looked so right
Well, pick you up and ten, gonna get you home at two
Your mama don't know what I got in store for you
But baby that's all right we're looking as cool as can be

We found a little place that really didn't look half bad
I had a whiskey on the rocks and change of a dollar for the jukebox
Well, I put a quarter right into that can
But all it played was disco, man
Come on pretty baby, let's get out of here right away

We're gonna rock this town
Rock it inside out

We're gonna rock this town
Make 'em scream and shout

Let's rock, rock, rock, man, rock
...
