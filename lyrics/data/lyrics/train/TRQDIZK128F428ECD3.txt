I know that life can break you down
Making you then breaking you
'Til you feel like you're losing the fight
Well, that's alright, honey child, stand your ground, yeah
Ready, aim, fire
Ready, aim, fire
In Jesus name, we're gonna go higher
You better get dressed to face the enemy
Ready, aim, fire, yeah
If you wanna win this fight you can't get tired
Get up, put your war clothes on
Take back everything God gave to you
Get up and put your war clothes on
The darkest hour's just before the day
We're gonna win this fight we're in
'Cause the weapons that we're gonna use are not carnal
