In the beginning, I believed every word that you said,
Now that you're gone my world is in shreds.
Oh, you loved me and left me,
You took all the things that I needed so bad,
I'm standing here wondering where is the love that I had?
Oh, give me silver, blue and gold,
The colour of the sky I'm told,
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue.

In the beginning, yeah,
There was something of love that was mine,
Now that it's gone, whoa, I'm cryin'.
