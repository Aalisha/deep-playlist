Now Mohawk John knew he did wrong
When he went and killed some men
They sent for the marshal to bring him in
They sent for Marshal Skin

He rolled into town,
And pulled his cowboy hat down
Cause everyone knows a skinhead,
Skinheads aren't allowed
(skinheads aren't allowed)
In Mohawk Town

The sun was high and his mouth was dry
So he rolled up to the saloon
He ordered himself some red eye
He knew he'd meet John soon
Checked out all the Mohawks
Sittin round the bar
He knew he found the Mohawk town
And John couldn't be too far
