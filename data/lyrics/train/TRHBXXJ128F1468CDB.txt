(Sax intro by Jon Smith)

I got my wife a charge card
Just the other day
I owe five hundred dollars
Just for yesterday

I said, "Honey, here's a present
Go out and shop around,
buy you a couple a-dresses,
browse around downtown"

She did just what I told her
Bought one, two, three
Came home lookin' silly
Makin' goo-goo eyes at me

Mastercharge, I'll break an' bury her card
Mastercharge, I'll break an' bury her card
Mastercharge, I'll break an' bury her card

Oh yeah, charge it!

Said, "Did you get your dress?"
"Yes, one or two"
I needed me some shoes,
I needed some jewelry, too"

Two hundred dollar dresses
I could-a made, I can't sew
It made me so mad
I could call her a so and so
