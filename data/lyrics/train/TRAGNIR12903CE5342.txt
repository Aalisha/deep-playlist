I welcome you all to my world
A journey down to my true soul
And maybe you don't like what you see her
I welcome you all to the home of the Black Empire
Black Empire

The abandoned house of insanity
Twisting your mind forever remains
The castle of pain
Eventually we all will burn
And evil will rise from the dust

Enter the gateway - annihilation of all the light
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire
Enter the gateway - dogs of Hell will rule the night
Enter the gateway - and the Black Empire

Beyond the darkest room, the invisible hell
Ghost in black will attack
...
