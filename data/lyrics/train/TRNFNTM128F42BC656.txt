Just when you thought it was safe
Shake, shake, shake

When I hit town you the party can't fail
I'm hittin' 20 on the richtor scale
Gotta hundred million people, spillin' coffee and stains
On your brand new shirt, ooh that reminds you of me
When you feel your gums flap, it's Aaron's rap
Watch yourself, I'm a rearrange your map
When your hands shake baby you ain't gettin' old
Its only Aaron Carter here to rock and roll

When I join hands I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the guys and the girls I
Make, make, make
Make 'em drop it down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When I join hands I
Shake, shake, shake
All the things in my room I
Brake, brake, brake
All the people out in Cali say
Not another earthquake
Drop down
Shake it down, break it down
Here we go

When I drove by
I'ma shake the foundation
Rock the formation
What's your graduation
Photos flyin' off the walls
It's amazing, oh no
Trouble with the bass vibrations
Brace for impact
Of my new track

Take cover 'cause
We're comin' through like that
All the other
Tracks are wickie wickie whack
