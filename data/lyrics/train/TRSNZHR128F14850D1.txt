Do you feel like a chain store
Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around, bored?

Your ears are full but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are

So, give me coffee and TV, history
I've seen so much
I'm goin' blind
And I'm brain-dead virtually

Sociability, it's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
