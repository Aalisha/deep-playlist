I'm flyin' to South Carolina, I've got to go there this time
I'm flyin' to South Carolina, I've got to go there this time
Woman and tell me, Texas, about to make me lose my mind

Long distance, long distance, would you please give me a credit call
Long distance, long distance, would you give me please your credit call
Walk up to my girl in South Carolina, who looks like her hands done squalled1
