"Bring back that child," she said
Spare me the price of freedom
Cold is my baby's head
Blown by the wind of reason
Even the rage behind
Cries out to see

Pay for the crime of feeling

When all your pride is dead
You must be scared instead

A quiet word is my Proposition
A promise made of a fierce day
A body bleeds for this coalition
