We are gifted to be scared
We need stacks of weapons to survive
Marching for religious reasons
Marching on and on to save our lives

When will it have an end
How can we live in harmony
How can I understand
The way things gonna be

Take me far away and set my spirit higher
Take me far away and set my soul on fire
And I pretend to understand
Whatever comes I'll be there for you
