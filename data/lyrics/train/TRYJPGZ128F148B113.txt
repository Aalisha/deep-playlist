I've done everything as you say
I've followed your rules without question
I thought it would help me see things clearly
But instead of helping me to see
I look around and it's like I'm blinded

I'm spinning out of control
Out of control
I'm spinning out of control
Out of control
(Go)
Where should I go?
(Do)
What should I do?
I don't understand what you want from me
(Know)
'Cause I don't know
(You)
If I can trust you
I don't understand what you want from me

I feel like I'm spinning out of control
Try to focus but every thing's twisted
And all alone I thought you would be there
(Thought you would be there)
To let me know I'm not alone
But in fact that's exactly what I was

I'm spinning out of control
Out of control
I'm spinning out of control
...
