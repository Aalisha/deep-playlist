All the dirty fingers picking up finds
Bruised with a motherless childish mind
To be kind in the line of design
Without a prober subject

Got all apologies, signed up to steal
Prednisone body, topic of ill
For the chill and the thrill of the kill
I see my woman calling

'Cause I licked a little skin like a fear in my bed
Spilt all the toxic cream of my dead
To be bled or fed in the spread
Of equal wrong talking

Spoon me like a stereotype, rigging the race
Believing in a feather, particular face
With the grace for the trace to embrace
The frontal feel falling

I think I'm ready to go
...
