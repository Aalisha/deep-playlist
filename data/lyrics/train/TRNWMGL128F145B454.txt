Eurasian eyes are watchin' me
Like a river, o you flow through me
Eurasian eyes are runnin' still
Whispered moments cut the chill
When eurasian eyes are watchin' me

Do you feel the passion in me

Cos I'm the one that said I'd never care
For someone like you
Now I'm the one who lacks the eloquence to say

(To say) that when the world is cold
With no one to hold
I can only see eurasian eyes
love won't lie
â€˜cause the truth would cry
...
