Hey Joe, let me make a few suggestions
Don't move too fast if you want to make connection
Time out for a little conversation
Can't hurt if you're looking for a sweet sensation
Hold on, I'm a lady who knows better
Don't play no games if you really wanna get her
Fools rush a while, it trace so easy
Lay back, and make sure you don't go jumping the gun
You gotta walk before you run
Don't count on two before as one
Don't burn your bridge, don't jump your gun
Jump the gun, jump the gun, jump the gun---
You gotta walk before you run
Don't count on two before as one
Don't burn your bridge, don't jump your gun
Jump the gun, jump the gun, jump the gun
Jump the gun, jump the gun---
Hey boy, you better ease up to it
Move up close, leave enough room to do it
She'll tell you if she's really good and ready
