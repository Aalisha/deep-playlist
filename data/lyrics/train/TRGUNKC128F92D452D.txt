It's too late (too late, too late)
Said it's too late, yes it is (too late)
My love is gone away to stay (too late)
Don't you know it's too late now
Listen, children, I wanna tell you this
It's too late to cry (too late to cry)
It's too late to cry now (too late to cry)
My love is gone away, yes she has (too late)
Wo wo (too late) she has (too late)
