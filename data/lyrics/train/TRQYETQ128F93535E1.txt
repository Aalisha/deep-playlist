[Chorus:]
He can work it out [x3]
Jesus can work it out
He can work it out

[Verse 1:]
There may be somebody here and you really been going through
You been tried in the fire and you don't know what to do
Look to the hills from with cometh all your help
As long as you got Jesus you don't need nobody else
