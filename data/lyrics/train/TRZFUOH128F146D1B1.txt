Child of mine I know that you're hurting
And I've seen you try to soldier on
I am here to lift away your burden
And I will hold you till the pain is gone

So today I promise forever
And tomorrow I'll say it again

You ought to know that I am here
You ought to know I'll be here
To love you, just to love you

Through all the pain and through the years
I'll be the one to dry your tears
I love you, I love you because you're mine

You would give it all to know the answers
And I know you've heard this all before
But I'm just here to help your heart remember
That no one else could ever love you more
...
