Hippies are squares with long hair
And they don't wear no underwear
Country Rock is on the way
I don't wan't music, I won't pay (?)

Dictators can't swing (?)
Make you dance and sing
Cause no oil spil (?)
You don't know us, but you will!

We're the members of the master race
Got no style, and we got no grace
Sleep all night, sleep all day
Nothing good on t.v. anyway

Gasoline shortage won't stop me now, Oh no!

We've reached a higher spiritual plain
