Get it up niggas, get it up X4

Hook: X2
on the road to riches imma get it up
my grind is relentless imma get it up
my shine is ridiculous imma get it up
imma get it up, imma get it up

Slick P:
Fresh out the box like a pair of nike airs its slick
for the green like sebastian telfair
the shields in this bitch
we seek and destroy
your boy got a mind like sigman freud see the lawyers and the haters got me paranoid
but i see the finish line so im going for it we the streets choice,
we dont need no awards
you can clip the wings and we still gon soar
u lame as niggas aint spittin for shit dump truck niggas you garbage pale kids
got my swisha in my hand and my 5th on tuck
one thing on my mind and thats gettin it up

Hook
