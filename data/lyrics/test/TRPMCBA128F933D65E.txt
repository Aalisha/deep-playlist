i woke up this morning
to a voice in my head
it said it's time to get a job
it said it's time to more ahead
it's time to do what's right
it's time you get a life
it said go to the closet
and picked out some clothes
make a healthy breakfast
and a cup of jo
it's time to do what's right
it's time you get a life
