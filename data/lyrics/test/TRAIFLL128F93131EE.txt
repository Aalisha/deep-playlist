I think i´m falling in love (I think i´m falling baby)
I think i´m falling in love (I think i´m falling baby, with you)
With you (I think I´m falling baby)
I remember the first day that I saw you
I felt theres something about you I already knew
So how was it baby that we never met before
Cause now that I know you girl
theres nothing I want more
I think i´m falling in love (I think i´m falling baby)
