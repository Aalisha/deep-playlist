My dear, there is no danger
Can't you see they turn blind eyes
To we swift and spotlit strangers?
Oh, before the rush is over
We will be revered again
While the victims still recover

Oh, if we run this light
Take a little life
No one will care at all

Oh, we can burn it and leave
For we are the beautiful thieves
No one suspects at all
No one suspects

Oh, are we running towards death?
I have met him times before
