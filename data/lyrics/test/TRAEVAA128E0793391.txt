I Know That You Want Me
But Maybe you're Shy
You'll Never Know If You don't Even Try
it's now or never
You Know It
All I Need Is A Sign
Boy You Know The Feelin Is Right

Oh Boy Oh Boy Oh Boy You Know The Feelin Is Right
Oh Boy Oh Boy

Boy You Better Help Me Out
There Is Something You Should Know By Now
Yeah I Been Watching You
I can see it in your eyes
Tell Me That You Feel this too

Gotta Let It Go
Just Let It Show
don't Care About What Our Friends Will Say

I Know That You Want Me
But Maybe you're Shy
You'll Never Know If You don't Even Try
it's now or never
You Know It
All I Need Is A Sign
Boy You Know The Feelin Is Right

Oh Boy Oh Boy Oh Boy You Know The Feelin Is Right
Oh Boy Oh Boy Oh
