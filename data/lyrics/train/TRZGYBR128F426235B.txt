We've changed, a new change of season
Autumn came, we went, I went insane
Never was winter so cold, no
Look away from the homeward road

I'm feeling love in a daydream
Making love first morning light
Walking slowly in the summer rain
Alone I lie, fantasize

I'm falling in and out of love
I'm falling in and out of love
Slip inside my dream, dream away with me
'Cause I'm falling in and out of love
...
