Oh, these eyes just cry every night for you

And these arms, these arms darlin'
Long to hold you once again
The hurtin's on me, yeah
I will never be free, no, no baby

You made a promise to me, yeah
And you broke it, girl, you broke it
Oh these eyes, oh, ooh, ooh
These eyes, these eyes, these eyes

Oh, oh, these eyes watched you
