Excuse Me Shorty,
Got Somthin To Say,
Just Tell Your Man, Things Have Changed,
He Can Love Ya, But iM Your Lover,
On The Low And Nobody Has To Know!

i Know You Got A Man But iT Dont Stop,
Out Front Follow Me Till Ge Get To The Spot,
i Love iT When You Get On Top,
iM Your Lover, He Can Treat You Like He Loves You,
But You Know That iM Your Lover,
i Can F**k Your Like No Other Thats Why iM Your Under Cover
iM Your Lover,(iM Your Lover)
iM Your Lover Girl!
iM Your Lover,(iM Your Lover)
He Cant Do You Like Me,
iM Your Lover,(iM Your Lover)
Let Me Show You What i Be,
iM Your Lover,(iM Your Lover)
iM Your Loooveeer,

And There You Are, Sitting All Alone,
When Your Man iS Working Late, Who Do You Call?
(You Call Me)
Yo' Body, Be Sexy And Fitted For Me Girl,
