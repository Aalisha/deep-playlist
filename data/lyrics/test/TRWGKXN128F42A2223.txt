Ever feel kinda down and out, you don't know just what to do
Livin' all of your days in darkness let the sun shine through
Ever feel that somehow, somewhere you've lost your way
And if you don't get help quick you won't make it through the day
Could you call on Lady Day, could you call on John Coltrane
