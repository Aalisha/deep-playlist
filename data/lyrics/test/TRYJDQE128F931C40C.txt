Feel, feel, feel

Feel so real
I feel so real
I feel so real
And I owe it all to you

Oh, I feel so nice
With you here by my side
If I just do the best that I can do
It seems that's enough for you

The little things mean so much
A smile or a joyful touch
That push that keeps me going strong
To know that I belong

And I feel so real
