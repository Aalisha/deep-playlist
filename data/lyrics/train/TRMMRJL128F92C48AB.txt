So, I was thinking about what I'd write to you
It's been three days since I heard your voice
And I ain't been right without you

A one night stand and a photograph made it's way to you
I took a chance, paid the consequence
This is why I'm writing to you

What is the big surprise?
Is it too late to try?
Go ahead and cry
It was just one little lie

I hope that you don't mind
I'll make it up this time
Is it too late to try?
It was just one lie

Baby, I think I owe you one
Every time I come around you're ready for the letdown
Here I sit alone, it was my fault
I know if I was you, I wouldn't take me back
Just let me down slowly, please
