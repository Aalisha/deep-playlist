The puritan filth, where ivy grows
The poisoned tear, the thorn, the rose
The sin, the pleasure, the sexual urge
Is what I choose for my last dirge

This is the day I'll die
The scent of lust, my last goodbye
Devotion and distress - love and tempting flesh

Thousands battles I have fought
Like a falling Ceasar now I rot
The night of the long knives - The weakness of our kind

A humain messiah carring the cross
Still to this day they follow an icon - I can't believe it
Do you believe in the afterlife? - I don't!
An eyeball in the mouth of the snake is pouring poison

Every day I'm lost and found
Torn and beaten to the ground
...
