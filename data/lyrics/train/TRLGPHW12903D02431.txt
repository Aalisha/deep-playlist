"Shallow Waters"

In the middle of the forest wild
he.s kneeling in front of a pond so wide.
Staring into dark and silent waters
he joins the stream taking the hand of other.

-See how your brothers
lie in waters
if you just let them hide their tears!

Shallow waters
eating brothers
darkest whirlpool
let me pass!
Stream of sorrow
wide and narrow
let this sad soul
pass your halls!.

Shallow waters
eating brothers
darkest whirlpool
let me pass!
