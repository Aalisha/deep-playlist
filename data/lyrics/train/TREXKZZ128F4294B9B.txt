I have the tendency to totally depend on you, it ain't right.
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, it ain't right.
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, it ain't right.
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, it ain't right.
I have the tendency to totally depend on you, it ain't right.

I have the tendency to totally depend on you, it ain't right.
