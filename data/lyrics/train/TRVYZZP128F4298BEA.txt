I'll end it all and jump in the bay
Cause I must atone for all my mistakes
I've been a fool mistreatin' you and I'd say
Losin' my temper once a day
So I'll take a walk if my mind let me out
I thought of my faults and all I put down
I've been a fool mistreatin' you and you'd say
The closer we are we get so far away

Here we go again miles away
So far away
Here we go again miles away
So far...
