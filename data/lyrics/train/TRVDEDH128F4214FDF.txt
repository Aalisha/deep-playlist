Stick it to me baby
My loving father I showed him no pain
Taste of Eucalyptus dances and shakes
Mother Love Bone - mama papa talkin' to me
Love breeds like rabbits I'm gonna set you free now
Tell me about your dream
Chartreuse regalia and purple pie petes
You dance Electra and night becomes day

Got my mama in the kitchen
