Making small talk 'til there's nothing left to say
Make believing it's just another day
My heart keeps telling me that come what may
There's something going on

Look and smile in the usual way
As impling that everything's okay
I'll be a fool, let my heart be lead astray
There's something going on

*****
Chorus:
Keeping our cool, treading light
