The homeade scars on my arms are slowly fading
Just as your fingernails are setting in to begin a new chapter
So sink in as deep as you canand I will do the same
We can share one sensation and ignore the flourescent riddles
In your eyelids and you surrender
It is something that I never intended to risk
