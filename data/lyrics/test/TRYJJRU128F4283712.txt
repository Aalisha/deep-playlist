My head is sore
I'm a tortured man

am I encased in this devil's plan?
I'm in pain
I've been rearranged
my conception of love is new.
Why am I running
runing away from everything that I wanted to do?

Too much love and I don't wanna lose it

- I don't wanna lose it -

don't wanna be lonely like before.
All that I wanna do is be madly in love with you
you
you

you
you
you
- I don't wanna lose it -

you
you
you
you
you
you.

Escape
escape from this tickertape
...
