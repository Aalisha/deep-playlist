Black star whenever you're ready
you're much too far away!
By now your soul seems steady now crawl to the cross

Meanwhile time takes a turn
-I'm feeling damned when you make it burn
Let's testify you're born to die
-You speak the truth and so do I
Don't give it away
-Don't give it away
don't try to nail
don't you try to nail
Don't try to nail!

Black star whenever you're ready
you're much too far away!
