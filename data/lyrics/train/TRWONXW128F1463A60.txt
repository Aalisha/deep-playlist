What's it all about today,
when everything has gone this way
I try to see the logic here,
but all I see is fear
I dig for answers deep beneath,
hold my hands out to sense the heat
The way this all goes down,
I can't find release
How much more of this will be
Won't you simply set them free?
I can't take it
