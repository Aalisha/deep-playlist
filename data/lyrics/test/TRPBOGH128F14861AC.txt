Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go (higher, higher)
Here I go, go, go, go, go
You gotta get me to the world on time
You gotta get me to the world on time

The minute you walk in the room I break into a sweat
My hands begin to shake so bad I can't light my cigarrette
Then you start walkin' towards me and my cool comes all undone
If I could get my feet to move I'd turn around and run

My pulse is beatin' faster
