Ive followed my dreams as long as I remember.
No matter the pain, no matter the rain-fall.
hoo-ooo-ooh

The road has been so long. So uncertain.
Looking back at what weve done,
Chasing devils on the run,
Its a kind of emotion, second to none.
Reaching for the sun.

This is love! This is life!
This is good! This is great!
This is all that weve believed in!

All this time, all the tears,
All the prayers, all these years,
Weve waited on this feeling

Together! Together! Were coming undone.
Together! Together! Baby, We R One!

Ooo-oh-oooh

Life can be so hard, when you feel lonely. yeh!
