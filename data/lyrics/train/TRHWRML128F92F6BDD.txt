Call me the rapscallion
A rogue rhyme sayer single-handed battalion
Thoroughbred pedigree like a black stallion
The pale horse couldn't come close to pose a challenge
And rappers pale in comparison to my styling
I'm dropping knowledge while they narrow minds popping violence
I listen for truth, all I hear is a calm silence
I'm looking for proof all I see is my mom's smiling
Beaming proud 'cause I stopped buggin and wilding,
Everyman is an island --
Everyman is connected separated by six degrees
Walk the path of enlightenment down the road on we ease
By inches the gaps squeeze approaching our destinies
Breathe out in a cycle that we share with the trees
And sway aimless like a branch catch the rhythm of breeze
Always going but never knowing where fate may lead
Listen to my elders remember to take they head
Even when you smile meanwhile somebody else bleeds
And rose gardens get infected by weeds.
Never admire desires over necessities
I take time to balance out all of my wants and needs
Keeping time, I tap my left hand on my knee
