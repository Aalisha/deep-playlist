His saintly robes removed
Pushed face down upon the floor
Legs kicked apart, hare-ass in the air
A fistful of hair yanks his head back
He supposedly pardons us for every sin
But can Jesus forgive those who desecrated his body?
Incarcerated inside a Roman prison
Jesus would soon find His feminine side
They parted his buttocks like the Red Sea

Carrying His cross as blood ran down his leg
The bitter taste of asthetic discharges upon the palate
Imprisoned disciples witnessed the irreverent crime
But the bible will never acknowledge the debauchery
In lock-up he was unable to spread the holy word
Because irreligious penis' clogged His immaculate windpipe
The guards laughed at the Messiah's screams
No angels came to bring Jesus deliverance
