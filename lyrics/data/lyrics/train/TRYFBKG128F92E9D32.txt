Sometimes at night, when I am afraid
I cover my eyes, cover my shame
So here in the dark, broken apart
Come with Your light and fill up my heart

Oh great light of the world
Fill up my soul
I'm half a man here
So come make me whole
Oh great light of the world
Come to impart
The light of Your grace
To fill up my heart
