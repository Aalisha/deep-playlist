It seems we've made no progress within the last 12 years
because deadlines and tests and fucked up kids
have transformed high school into a house of fears.
And if the budget keeps blocking sunlight we can't help these growing trees.
And I doubt that the integral of blah blah blah is what I fucking need.
So I'll take my pencil, break it on my head.
There's no use in knowing how long Calvin Coolidge's been dead
If you're not getting real education go complain
because we deserve all that we want.
Term papers declare them useless, I'll get them off the net.
