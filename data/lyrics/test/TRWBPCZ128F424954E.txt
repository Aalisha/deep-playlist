For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given
and the government shall be upon his shoulder
and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor
the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace

Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end
upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it
and to establish it with judgment and with justice
from henceforth even for ever and ever, and ever, and ever
...
