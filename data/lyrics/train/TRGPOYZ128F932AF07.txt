We're setting sail
To the place on the map
From which no one has ever returned
Drawn by the promise of the joker and the fool
By the light of the crosses that burn
Drawn by the promise of the women and the lace
And the gold and the cotton and pearls
It's the place where they keep all the darkness you need
You sail away from the light of the world
On this trip, baby

You will pay tomorrow
You're gonna pay tomorrow, yeah
You will pay tomorrow

Save me
Save me from tomorrow
I don't want to sail with this ship of fools, no, no, no
...
