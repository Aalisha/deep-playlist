You open up the door with negative aura
You say future is murky indeed...
I'm sick of hearing your gripe.

Open up the door with negative aura
If you never change
I think There is no way life fizzle out

You open up the door with negative aura
(I'm fed up fed up fed up)
You say future is murky indeed...
I'm sick of hearing your gripe.

Open up the door with negative aura
(I can't keep up whit you)
If you never change
I think There is no way life fizzle out

If you are at a loss as to what to do.
