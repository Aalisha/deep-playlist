I want to explore you, I'm gonna get under your skin
So you can feel me running through your veins
I want to examine every inch of your frame
The pressure points that cause your joy and pain

Our love goes under the knife
There is no room for doubt

Now I'm inside you, my hands can feel their way
Further inside than I have ever been
Now I can really mess around with your heart
...
