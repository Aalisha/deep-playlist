When I came home to you
You were not there for me
And I waited all night long
Then you called me on the phone
And you said you were not coming back home
Because of rumors that you heard
My tears rolled slowly from my eyes
When you said my love was all a lie
"Don't listen to what he said", she said
These things get me upset 'cause you know my love is true
And all these rumors that they've spread
Should never have been said 'cause I've been faithful to you
I've always been true to you
Doing you wrong is something I wouldn't do
But honey, don't be a fool
Can't you see they don't want me with you
Now you say that you're not coming back home
