Love comes from the most unexpected places
In someone's eyes you've never met, and once they get to know you
In someone's smiles you can't forget
and if the music plays on in your mind
Take all the love you can find
And if love takes you in
Take all the love you can find
And it will come again
Love comes from the most unexpected places
