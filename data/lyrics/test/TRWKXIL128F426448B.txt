Some people think that she's one of those mink-coated ladies
They say she wakes up at one
And makes the paparazzi run till dawn
She wines and dines with argentines and kuwaitis
After she sips margaritas on the white house lawn

Chorus
That's not her style I can tell you
That ain't my woman
It's just not her style I can tell you
...
