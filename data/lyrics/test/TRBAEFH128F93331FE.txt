You better look out cause
Suspicious eyes are watching
Don't let them see us

I know that you and I
Should not be seen here talking
I kinda like the razor's edge

I always?
You like to walk a tight rope
I work my show without a net
It never fails, I dive
Into the deepest ocean
Not knowing if I'll sink or swim

Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
Oh, oh, over my head, oh, oh
