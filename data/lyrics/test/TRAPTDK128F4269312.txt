[by Schirenc]

Lifeless they are prowling
Dark deserted streets
Raw are their faces
Close is their sense of smell
Shadows of the past life
Marked their facial expressions
Forgotten are emotions
And only hunger remains
Silent they are reeling
Bodies cold like ice
Lost in a dream
Bones wrapped out in proud flesh
