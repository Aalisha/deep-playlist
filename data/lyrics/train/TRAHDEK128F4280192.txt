We've had enough
Of the what you coulda
What you woulda
What you shoulda done
To avoid the unbeatable
Dodge the undefeatable two

We've had enough
Of the what you coulda
What you woulda
What you shoulda done
To avoid the unbeatable
Dodge the undefeatable two
We've had enough

And we're prepaired for war
prepared for the tow to tow, so let's go
prepared for the head to head, nuff said
We about to put these little punks to bed
One slap, kick ass, bitch slap, four
These little punks aren't ready for war
These little bitched aint ready to ride
And it's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Lights out one tag, two tag kaboom
Let 'em feel the pain, don't count 'em out too soon
Let 'em hit the mat, then pick 'em up on two
Suffer, pain, hurt, you're through
Over, Done, bodycount tally
Last call, move on 3D finale
Told you all we come to settle the score
The talkin ends now, it's time for war
