She had a rag top Eldorado tuck-in-row pleat
She picked me up in Colorado and put me right in the drivers seat
I said I got no money, you know I got no job
She said, "I tell you what honey, let's find a place to rob"

I told him do what I say you'll live another day
Nobody's gotta get hurt

It was a crime of passion
She took me by the heart when she took me by the hand

A beautiful woman and a desperate man

Well I thought the thing was over she was counting the cash
