Y'all got to feel me on this
Every ghetto feel me on this
Alright

It's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me
Can y'all feel me when I say that?
Yeah, I'm telling you it's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me, yes
And I'm still in the gutter, man

Lord, give me a sign and let me know
When you blessed this life of mine
'Cause it's hard hustlin' in these streets, oh yeah

Lord, give me a sign and let me know
When these old bill collectors
And my baby mama will quit stessin' me
Somebody sing, "It is bad"

It's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me
Can y'all feel me when I say that?
