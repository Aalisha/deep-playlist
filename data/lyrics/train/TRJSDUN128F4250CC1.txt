Now watch!
The grand deliverance opens up like cuts in the skin
It'll show the roads and take you where
you've never been returning and burning
Feel the barriers explode from the barrel of aggression
It's time to reload
This organic ammo moves faster than these eyes can see
Those bullets kill the distance in just as fast as speed can be
Returning and burning
Feel the barriers explode
From the barrel of aggression
It's time to reload
Black - the ace of shades
Strikes through the veins of the lame
The face of the target is selfdestruction and its tongue speaks your name

Deliverance - The soul explodes
