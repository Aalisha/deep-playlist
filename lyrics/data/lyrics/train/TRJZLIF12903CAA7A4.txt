Yeah yeah yeah
Girl money
Girl money
Girl money

I was sittin' alone
But not very long
She had a weakness for comin' on strong
She was licking my fingers
And drinking my booze
She whispered sweet nothings
I said 'Babe, is it true?'
What'd you say? - Show me yours & I'll show you mine
What'd you do? - Ordered a bottle of the finest French wine
Where'd you go? - I was heading for heaven when she took the wheel
She took me to the cleaners, she knows how it feels

Out all night
Time to get started
Saving all week for her bedroom party
Dollar for her drink
Dollar for the honey
Burnin' a hole
