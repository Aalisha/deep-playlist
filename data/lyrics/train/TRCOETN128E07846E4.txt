I can't go on this way forever
Closing my eyes and just imagining
I'm loving you
When I'm close to you it feels so right
Can't sleep at night
But if I try to stay away can't even
Make it through the day
No longer care if it is wrong or right
I wanna love you, baby, through the night
Till the morning light
Can't stop imagining the tenderness of your caress
Couldn't stop if I wanted to
There's nothing left for me to do

Please, love me
