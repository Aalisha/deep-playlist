I got out of bed
And came here for adventure
I stepped on a stone on the way
I took off my shoe
And a dog came towards me
Wagging his tail happily

Dog, if you could speak
You'd know what to do
Simply turn around and run
Dog, if you could speak
You'd bury your bone
And you'd show me the way back home
