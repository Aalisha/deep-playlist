Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
Stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of a gentle race
This world is seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
But, all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
Though, by a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Whoa-hoh, whoa-oh, yeah

Yes, yes

Oooh, oh baby, baby, I been cryin'
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, there's no denyin', there's no denyin'
Oooh yes, baby baby, I've been flyin', oh yeah
Lord, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin', no denyin'
Here's another one to ya

All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
...
