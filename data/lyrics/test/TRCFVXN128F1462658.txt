Mmm yeah, put your funky dancin' shoes together while
I brought to you my funky sounds. Ahaa, we ain't gonna
play this song forever. Everybody, come on, gather 'round.

I'm gonna blow your mind. (I'm gonna blow your mind.)
I'm gonna blow your mind. (I'm gonna blow your mind.)
I'm gonna blow your mind. I'm gonna blow your mind.
