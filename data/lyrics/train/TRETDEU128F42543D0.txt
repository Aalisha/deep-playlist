No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart
(Yeah)
No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? In love, baby
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby? In love, baby
Girl, you know you got me, got me
With your pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
You can't stop me once I start it
Can't return me once you bought it
I'm coming baby, don't got it
(Don't make me wait)
So let's be about it
No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart
Baby, have some trustin', trustin'
When I come with lustin', lustin'
â€~Cause I bring you that comfort
I ain't only here â€~cause I want yer body
I want your mind too
Interestin's what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on girl, yee haw
Come on!
