Tonight I'm letting go
Tonight I'm falling free
And I can't wait
For weight to fall from me

The clear blue sky can't stay the same;
Sometimes we need the wind and rain
I saw you shut your eyes
Don't be afraid

And I'm here to break you out
I'll take the wheel-
You don't have to drive
Just disconnect yourself
Open your eyes

Don't stop for a second
Let the weather change
The sun's shining right behind the hurricane
Now that we're spinning in the storm
Together, not alone
...
