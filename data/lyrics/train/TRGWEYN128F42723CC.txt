When you're on top of the world
or it's got you down
when you're flying through the air
or you're crashing to the ground
when you're searching for the light
and it's nowhere to be found
just phone me baby
And i know we'll be the same
the air won't tie you down
i won't ever be the broken wings
that keep you off the ground
but when you start to see
i will be the sound
just let me baby
I only wanna be the one you love
i only wanna be the one you want
come and get me baby
let me loose inside your soul
i only wanna be your every need
i wanna be the girl in all your dreams
i'll do anything to be
the one you love
Baby you can tell me everything
the secrets of your heart
...
