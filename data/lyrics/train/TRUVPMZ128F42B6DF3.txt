Now I'm completely disgusted with myself
Look at what I've become
My addictions
Are now leading the way
I need help
So go take all my pictures from off your shelf
And go tell everyone
My ambitions
Have all rotted away

Puff Puff Puff Puff Puff Puff
Now you're hooked on that stuff
Puff Puff Puff Puff Puff Puff
Now you're hooked 

So turn up the music and go scar your lungs
