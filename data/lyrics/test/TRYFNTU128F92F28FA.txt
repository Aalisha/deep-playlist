I pray to God for His blessing to consent slaughter
Your seven ounces of brain holds 2 percent water
Literately your dried idea belongs under your arm pits
Full armed spit. My palms slick with this engraved
Vakill in quotation's the nicest
After I come fuck this liquid hell
Only hoes that's giving head is getting flotation devices
Digest words to kill by
Auto-pilot my technique so even if I sleep on my own shit it's still fly
I'm Gods only begotten renegade angel; saint-sinner
Make anemic hemorrhage, I can draw graphic scenic image with paint-thinner
Let the bullshit stop to a screech with hot lead
I beseech hip hop heads til the tooth brush is obsolete
Many fuck around and catch a reach flip top head
I set respectable trends
Til the sickest emcees blueprint my testicle skin
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks to your chin

Bow down to an entity none of ya'll nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand
Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud shall roam the rest of your natural lifespan
Bow down to an entity none of ya'll nice than
Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand
Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands
Cause the darkest cloud...

I'm voicing oral crucification with a mouth full of nine inch nails
Conceptually blazing in trails, with your skeletal remains and entrails
Impaled, snug and cushy
My hip-hop status is c-section (why?)
Cause I'm a cut above you pussies
