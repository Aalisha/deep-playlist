Hey boy, take a look at me
Let me dirty up your mind
I'll strip away your hard veneer
And see what I can find

The queerest of the queer the strangest of the strange
The coldest of the cool the lamest of the lame
The numbest of the dumb I hate to see you here
You choke behind a smile a fake behind the fear
The queerest of the queer

This is what he pays me for
I'll show you how it's done
You learn to love the pain you feel
Like father like son
