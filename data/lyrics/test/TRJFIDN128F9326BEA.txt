(You better think again)
Yeah

(Verse 1)
Looking inside, digging in deep
Holding on tight to all that is me (No one takes me down, no one takes me down)
Don't you think for one day, that you can kill me
I'm not a pawn, I am the king (I'm not going down, I'm not going down)
I am the king (I'm not going down)

(So you better think again)

(Chorus) (2x)
You make me, you break me
You build me up and tear me down

Just let me go.
