All the night her dream
passes by my bed
undeniable, and all she said
she wrote the letter

hard to find love
since you arrived here
harder to find the love
then pull your body near

She wrote the letter
down

She wrote the letter
down

I know I know I know
you felt a change in my heart
I know I know I know
the planets ripped you apart
...
