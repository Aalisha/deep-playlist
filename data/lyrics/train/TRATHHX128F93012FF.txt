Forget me, Forget me not
Was a lot, Hurts a lot
I was blown away when you left
I lose time with this dream that I follow

When you sit next to me
I fell off, I fell down
The stars could change direction for you
Hurts a lot, Hurts a lot

Oh Sympathy, I understand
An Empty Heart, An Empty Hand
If I could break your heart of stone,
Would you be mine, Would you be mine?
