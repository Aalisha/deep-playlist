Feel the presence of me, risen from behind death
Invoked by lovers' touch, seduced temptating lust
Pulled back into this world, in that, their breathtaking flesh
Take form in woman's womb, reborn! By faith to fulfill

When you have come to the end, will you stay or go on?
When you have seen the light shine, will you end there or try
To seek a deeper line? To fill the hollow inside?
You just watch your moves, cause I am back from the grave!

Lazarus returned from the velvet deathzone!
