I will not give in to what the TV sells
The bullshit news and the lies they tell
Convince us that we're lost
They try to sell us maps, we'll buy at any cost

Just really what is going on?
I'd like to find out myself
But I might need the help
So can you come along?

Poke out your eyes so you can't see
Casting shadows
