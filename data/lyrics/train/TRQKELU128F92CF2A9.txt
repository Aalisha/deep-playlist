There was a time when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe

Would sit in my room
Because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry

Now you say that you've made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Cause it may seem hard to believe

But

I'm doin' just fine
Getting along very well
