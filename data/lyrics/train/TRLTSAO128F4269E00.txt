What's that sound?
(That's rhythm)
Everybody round
(Got rhythm)

There can be no beat
(Without rhythm)
Makes me wanna move
My feet
(That's rhythm)

It's in my bones
Anytime my music carries on
I feels like rhythm

If you like to dance
(Get rhythm)
This is your chance
(For rhythm)

I can't keep still
...
