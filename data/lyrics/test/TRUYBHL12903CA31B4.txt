I used to live inside
of a raging storm
Now I'm praying for break
in an entering
You don't even
lock a door
The winter's not cold anymore
God I miss it
God I miss it
God I miss
Tingling tantrums
A neverending laugh vortex
Instead of
Collapsing in tries
Oh we're just chemistry run amok
If I take some more will it be enough
for me to hold on
to this
