Do you think I'd say anything 
Do you think I'd just come out and say what I feel 
We've had some sticky moments 
We've talked ourselves out now and everything's real 
And each passing day 
Is one day to much 
You take it out twice on the people you touch 
And each passing Hour 
Is time with no end 
Is this the something we're unable to mend 
Do you think I could sit here 
And talk about the things that go on in my head 
I've sorted things out now 
Faced up to it over and over again
