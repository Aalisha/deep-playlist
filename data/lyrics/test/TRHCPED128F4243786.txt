You're gonna lively up yourself, and don't be no drag

you lively up yourself 'cause reggae is another bag

you lively up yourself, and don't say, "no"
you're gonna lively up yourself 'cause i said so!
Hear what you gonna do
you rock so, you rock so, like you never did before, yeah!

you dip so, you dip so: dip through my door
you come so, you come so, oh yeah!
you skank so, you skank so: be alive today!
You're gonna lively up yourself, and don't say, "no"
you lively up yourself, big daddy says so, y'all!
