[Written by: L. Rutledge & W. Dane]

Steel eyes stare back at you
Held by his gaze he's healed you
Gripped by terror for now you see
The talisman shall hold the key

The blind prophet shall breathe fire
Foretelling dreams of past
And visions of your death
He lies shackled in the mire
And beckons to your cries
Dreaming of your dreams

Corrupt eyes filled with hate
...
