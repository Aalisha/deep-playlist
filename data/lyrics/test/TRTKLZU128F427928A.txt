I can't believe all the things you say to me
I just can't believe all the things you say
I'm standing straight, I see no malice in your eyes
I'm just standing straight and in time I'll realise

Ain't that ghost of love, ain'that ghost of love
Ain't that ghost of love, it's you he's thinking of?

Forward in step, there is no time to sit adn wonder
