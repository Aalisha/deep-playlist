There you go, again and again, baby, startin' with the things that just wouldn't end it
I don't know why we can't get along; when we first started out nothin' ever went wrong

I love to hear your voice but your choice of words just blows my mind
And I'm not foolin' 'cause I don't believe in what you see involvin' me in all of your schemin'
