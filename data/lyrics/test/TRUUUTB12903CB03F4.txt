They live despite attempts to stop and destroy our dreams
They'll wish they never raised their hands to be our enemies
Fight through crowded halls of hate between these tears aflame
And show a love resting inside this heart of me

I know, crucify my heart
Because i am not letting go
I know everyone else is dying

Death no longer frightens me
I am a heart of gold
I'm not ashamed of my life and its legacy
This is right for me

I know, crucify my heart
