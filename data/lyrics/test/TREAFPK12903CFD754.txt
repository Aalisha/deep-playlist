Thoughts blow around in your head,
Like a wind that pretends,
There is boundary,
No boundary, no boundary, no boundary

Slipping now to light confusion
Skimming the time as you lay
somewhere in between
can't touch in between

Sleep now, approaching a landscape
Driven by engines of time, engines of time, engines of time, engines of time
Daylight far away
Where in the world will you go
...
