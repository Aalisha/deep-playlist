Drop me off right here
I can go no further
It seems life's too hard for you
How come I feel like hanging around to win
When it seems you always lose
When you're stuck in the middle
With rejections again
It's time to call your reject friends
And meet me at the bottom of the wishing well range
And talk about an hour of change

And it seems so bad
Yeah, it so bad
Can we rescue ourselves from the former lives we had?

Is it too late?
Is it game over?
Will it get better?
It's better or will it

'Cause
Willy don't got an eye
Willy don't got an eye
He lost it on the Fourth of July
He don't got an eye
...
