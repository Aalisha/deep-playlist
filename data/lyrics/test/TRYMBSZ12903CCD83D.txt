Shake that thing Miss Kana Kana
Shake that thing Miss Annabella
Shake that thing Miss Donna Donna
Jodi and Rebecca

Woman get busy, just shake that booty nonstop
When the beat drop
Just keep swinging it
Get busy
Get crunked up percolate anything you want to call it
Oscillate you hip and don't take pity
Me want fi see you get live 'pon the riddim weh we ride
And me lyrics a provide electricity
Gal nobody can't tell you nuttin'
Caw you done know your destiny

Sexy ladies want par with us
In a car with us
Them nah war with us
In a club them want flex with us
To get next to us
Them cah vex with us
From the day we born jah ignite me flame
Gal a call me name and it is me fame
It's all good girl turn me on
'Til the early morn'
Let's get it on
Let's get it on 'til the early morn'
Girl it's all good just turn me on
