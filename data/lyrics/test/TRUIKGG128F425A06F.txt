That's word, we pray, pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray

All my life I wanted to make it to the top
Some said I wouldn't, they told me no but I didn't stop
Working hard, making those movies everyday
And on my knees, every night, you know I pray

I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray

Now I just think that you can do whatever you want
I'm bustin' these rhymes, making this money and I won't
Forget my people or my town or my ways
And on my knees, every night, I'm still gonna pray

That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray

Time and time and time and time and time again
I kept on knocking but these people wouldn't let me in
