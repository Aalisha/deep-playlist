This is a curse

The flies are out for their feast of shit
Can't hardly see with the swarm so thick
How can, how can I love anything and everything
In a world so quick to piss all over another's plate?

How can I sleep? When, when did their blood
Pump through my tank and burn the sky?
It's in my lungs as I slowly die away
