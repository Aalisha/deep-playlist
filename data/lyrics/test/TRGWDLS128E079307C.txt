(David Z & Bruce McCabe, 1998 David Z (BMI)/Ryan Cory Music (BMI))
Second guessin' first impressions
There you go again
Rushing off in all directions
Since I don't know when
All day long you're building walls
You're building walls all day
Putting ceilings on your feelings
When they should fly away
(following is not sung in Jonny's version but is included in lyrics)
Don't you think it's time you quit it
