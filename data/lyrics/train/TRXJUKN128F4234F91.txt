Well grade school never meant that much to me
I started smoking at the age of 13
Back of the class that's where we'd hang around
But they could not bring us down
And now they're on the run
Little Johnny's mad and he's got a gun
Just kids having fun
You can't deny
No alibi
I saw you back when you were just like them
I know it's true
