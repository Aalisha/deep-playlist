Back seat over the wing
And I'm the happiest hot potato on the plane
Yeah I'm looking I'm looking it's beautiful
I think I wanna go and live out there right now

Oh stewardess can you fix me some Mercury

The city below me shines
I guess I'm part of Detriot's shining dream
The ones that forget that I was ever here
The one that's going to forget that I had ever been
