There was a time when we were noble soldiers
Fearless and wild, a fight just to survive
Reformed our troops, one flag one worlds united
Under the sun the powers came alive

The sound of our cause, the meaning of life
Beyond stars and skies
Now raise your hands and let it all come out

Bring the Hammer Down
Slam it down to the ground
One flag, one world united

Templars, fight or fall
...
