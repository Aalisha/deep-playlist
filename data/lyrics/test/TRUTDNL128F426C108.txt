Let's whisper things into your ear
making sure to discard what you hear.
What you know is safe, but she seems to have played this game.
Stay on the base and you'll see it's not worth you taking the blame.

She looks so pretty that it's such a pity
That she won't be needing help for this beating (RIGHT NOW)
She looks so pretty and it's such a pity
That she won't be needing help for this beating

This city is weeping
Things are not what they seem
What is your warm blanket
To me it's everything
All under, sleep safely
The safest kind of dreams
Not knowing it's over
One day you'll hear me sing.
