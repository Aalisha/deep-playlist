People seem to let me know
My little window seems so fogged and cold
Children are taught to love and hate
In the eye of the night, a tear's embrace
Is there really sunshine
It's not clear to those who feel pain
It's so easy speaking, faceless, taunting, precious
Say it, live it, feel it, jealousy

Crosshairs are locked and you load as you mount the attack
Half way across the world a stab in your back
Every single step that I take you're a humanoid glue
And you say, "You're an asshole, you're stuck up, you're prejudice, you fucked my girlfriend, ya drunk!"
But listen, at least I'm man enough to be real, oh so real... 

It's jealousy
The deadliest sin of them all
Ain't it great, it's jealousy
...
