Seems like a heavy load
Anti-depressants lessen episodes
While the West End boys in their hand-me-down clothes
Brag about fights under her street lights
She walks alone the long way home
And oh she's a troubled soul
Oh so troubled but nobody knows.

Looks like his armour's old
Carrying chinks that his father used to own
And when he hits the bottle it definitely shows
He's a Machiavellian in a rebellion
I wish I could see how it would so follow
And oh he's a terrible state
Oh so terrible, drowning in hate.
