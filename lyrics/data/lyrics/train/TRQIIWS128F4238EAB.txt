Intro:
Whooo! Oh no (oh no)
I can't have it no(i can't have it no)
I can't have it no,
No, no, no, no, no

Verse 1:
Yo, if it wasn't for my name,
Wasnt for the fame,
Would you wanna be my main, squeeze baby?
If it wasn't for the hype,
Would you have the time
To have an interest in my life?
I don't think so baby
If it wasn't for the diamonds and the pearls (diamonds and pearls)
Would you wanna share my world? (my world?)
You need not say a word
Here's some questions for your mind (for your mind)
Do you love Rastafari?
Or even Rasta for your life?
'Cos if its all about the hype, girl
I can't have you in my life

Chorus:
'Cos I'm that same roots Rastaman yaw,
You did'nt want in your world (ain't a thing changed)
Remember you told me before,
I'd never come to nothing else (never)
I never change my lifestyle at all,
Still yet i've seen the world (my eyes have seen)
So tell me why should i give u all,
And have you as my one and only girl? yeah
