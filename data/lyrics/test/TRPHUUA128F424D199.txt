Why do I pay you to insult me and make me feel like shit
I can't believe I've worked this hard to let you benefit
For every slice that I get, you get two slices more
You've become my pimp and I've become your little whore
It goes around in circles, the torture never stops
You get all the earnings and all I get is props

Wipe that smile from off your face
You're in court without a case, and you'll get nothing
