(Eric Carmen)

She was just an average blue-eyed
Golden high school dream
An illusion nothing real could ever touch
Funny love seemed so much more intense
At seventeen
When I knew she'd never love me
Half as much

I recall the desperate vow I made
I must find a way somehow to win her heart
I've got to make her mine

Gonna run away
Till I prove that I'm a man
Gonna run away
Be the best I know I can
Got to run away
Got to find my space and time
And I cannot rest a day until I make her mine
