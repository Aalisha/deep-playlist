Dogs in the backyard
And the flies are on the wall
Thunder and lightning
But the rain don't ever fall
If there's a flower in this desert
It's your picture on my wall
Ibe dat baby I'm going to make you
Queen of all

Chorus:
This is not a movie
Not a dream
What you see is what you get
This is not a movie
It's for real
