I drink Gatorade man, uhh, what?
Heav' Diggy y'all, Gruff, whattup Gruff?
(Whattup?)
Quite, huh, say what? Uptiggy y'all, they ain't ready, uhh

Yeah, Heavy not a think about romancing you
But my man's tell me I ain't got a chance wit'chu
What a nigga gotta do to get a dance wit'chu
Get dipped, take trips, fly to France wit'chu?

Now, I'll be there to keep you warm when nights is cold
Word to God, I swear I'll give you something to hold
See you be on my mind 'cause you shine like gold
To think that I've been knowing you since we was young years old

Whattup miss? C'mere, give Gruff kiss
Drive a nigga crazy wearing stuff like this
Boo you hot, like the Campbell Buddha spot
I'm the man to hell with that damn dude, you got

Used to see you summertime, Grant's Tomb a lot
Me and all my mens smoke boom a lot
