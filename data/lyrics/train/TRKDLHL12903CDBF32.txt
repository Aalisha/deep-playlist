Forgive me for running off to find the one thing I have to do.
Each night you can fall asleep assured that someday I'll be coming home to you.
These constant reminders in everything I see.
The chance of a lifetimeâ€¦what a great place to be.

Oh Amy, don't hate me, for running away from you.
Oh Amy, don't hate me. I'm still in love with you!
