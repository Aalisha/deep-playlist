Baby, baby, oh yeah
I got the story listen up, listen up, listen up

I got this story about this player named Jimmy
He used to get down for me
Whenever he wanted I told him he could come, get plenty
He got the remedy

My bills was paid he kept me laced
[Incomprehensible] fell in love instantly
Then I got the call one day, they told me Jimmy's on his way
The penitentiary, and it's no mystery

Now he can't come around, no more
He's locked up for 10 or more
I could have just flipped your door
