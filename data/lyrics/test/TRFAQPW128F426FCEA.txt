Everybody's laughing
Everybody's having so much fun
Putting so much love and care
Into this special day
Everybody's giving
Giving from their hearts unselfishly
MaMa's making everyone's favorite recipe
I wish we had

Christmas forever
Let's stay together
I pray we never
Let Christmas slip away
Now don't you want
Christmas forever
Let's stay together
I pray we never
