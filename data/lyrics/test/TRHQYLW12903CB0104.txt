A summer evening on Les Champs Elyses
A secret rendezvous they planned for days.
A sea of faces in a crowded cafe
A sound of laughter as the music plays.

...
Jean-Claude was a student at the University
Louise-Marie is just a world away.
...

He recall the night they met was warm with laughter
The words were music as she turned away.
...
I'll meet you at midnight

Under the moonlight
I'll meet you at midnight...
...
