Goodnight my love
Bless your heart and sleep tight my love.
Goodnight.

Never thought that I'd
Ever want to be leaving you.
You're the dearest girl I've known
And there's nothing that I own
That I wouldn't want to give to you.

But late last night after we kissed goodnight
And I started home.
I met a girl so sweet and caring
And so very alone.
And then I gazed into her eyes
And knew how much she wanted me
