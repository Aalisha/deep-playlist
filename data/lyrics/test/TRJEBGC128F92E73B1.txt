Who's gonna make up my dyin' bed, when I die?
Who's gonna make up my dyin' bed, when I die?
Who's gonna make up my dyin' bed? Who's gonna make up my dyin' bed?
Who's gonna make up my dyin' bed, when I die?

Who's gonna take my soul to heaven, when I die?
Who's gonna take my soul to heaven, when I die?
Who's gonna take my soul to Heaven? Who's gonna make up my dyin' bed?
Who's gonna take my soul to heaven, when I die?
