When am I gonna hear the new stuff, it better sound big.
One day you're gonna buy my lunch for this, From the other side.

I'd rather steal than foot the bill, I'd rather die
I'd rather steal than pay the bill, I'd rather lie
We stand like giants we are, we are the same size
I'd rather sleep than work this week, I'd rather die
We are like convicts we are, we do the same time.

Call the cops, there's a break in.
All my ideas someone's stolen.
