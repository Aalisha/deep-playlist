Watch your back now!

I used to trust you
You used to trust me
Such a oneness we patiently phased
I used to follow you
You used to follow me
You used to stare at me with overreaction
With overreaction

We have nothing in common
(But the psyko orgasm, yeah)
We have nothing in common, no
(But the social orgasm, yeah)

So, don't want to live this again
It's too much for me
Too much for me, too much for me
Too much for me, too much for me

So, don't want to live this again
