When I first met you got a feeling that I'll never forget
An animal attraction I know
We'd be bad together but the make up sex as good as it gets
And I just want to say to you

Every time that I hate you
I love you
You're more than I can take can't get enough of you
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can't let you go
And I just want to get enough
Every time that I hate you
I love you
You're the part of the pain that I love too
It doesn't matter what you're saying
I can see right through
You love to hate me too (You love to hate me too)

Every time we fight I feel like breaking up but I know I can't
No one ever gets me like this
