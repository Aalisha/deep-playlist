One: E-Swift

I stop by the club, cuz it ain't shit else to do it
I'm on the guestlist, it's E-Swift plus two
Stepped to the bar, cuz, it's a bad habit
Open mic night, so, the Liks gots to grab it
Check the mic, it sounds tight so
I guess we might rock the motherfucker all night yo
The niggaz went wild, the hoes went crazy
We dropped the microphone than we Swayze

Two: J-Ro

Oooh don't I sound great when I down a black eighth
My style is much hotter than the enchilada plate
My name is James but the girls call me God when I'm humpin
I should get a gold medal for broad jumpin
Rappers, talkin bout, back to the old school
You never shoulda left in the first place fool
Now everybody wants to be a prophet
But I won't quit rhymin bout my dick so get off it
You put a rhyme together but I only dismantle it
So gimme a high-five cause you juts can't handle it
If rap was a swimming pool I'd climb to the top
Plus a triple-back, hand me the mic and watch the belly flop
Dagnabit, I got a bad habit
It don't matter where I'm at I seen a booty and I grab it
So niggaz step back before you get lit
I'm a grown motherfuckin man and you can't tell me shit

repeat 2X
