Let your wall fall down
Let your wall fall down
Let your wall fall down
Let your wall fall down

I look into your eyes, see that you're afraid of something
But you don't want to leave if there's no place to hide
But how are you going to breathe with your head in the water?
Everybody dreams if they dare to look inside

So let your wall come down
And some love come in
'Cause the time is now, to stand together
Let these words ring true
Let the light come through
Let it shine, oh, whoa

We can leave the sorry world behind
Never stop believing 'cause the time is coming
Believe it in your heart and in your mind
