Love through prisms, life through craft
break it down to competing parts and broken hearts
oh no, start again

Wake up walking in fields of glass
it breaks with each step, see where you were
but don't disturb- no way to get back there

This is a room with a view see everything for what it is
we want to do what we want forever
