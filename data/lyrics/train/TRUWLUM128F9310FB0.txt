Sylvia Moy, Brian Holland, Edward Holland, Jr. and Lamont Dozier

Oh, this old heart of mine
Been broke a thousand times
Each time you break away
I feel you're gonna stay
Lonely nights that come
Memories that flow
Bringing you back again
Hurting me more and more

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside
Cause each day that passes by
You got me never knowing if I'm coming or going, but I

I love you
