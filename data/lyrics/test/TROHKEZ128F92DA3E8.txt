I hate's to see that evenin' sun go down
Hate's to see that evenin' sun go down
'Cause my baby she done left this town

If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
Feel tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack up my trunk and make my getaway

Saint Louis woman with her diamond rings
Pulls that man 'round by her apron strings
'Twern't for powder and her store-bought hair
The man she love wouldn't gone nowhere, nowhere

Got them Saint Louis Blues; I'm as blue as I can be
Like a man done throwed that rock down into the sea
Got them Saint Louis Blues; I'm as blue as I can be
...
