In a time of fear and confusion,
silence charging the air
The sunlight is gone, darkness lives on
in the heart of the dragon's lair

Lost in a world of illusions
No trace of the missing ore
Stealing our souls, we're out of control,
knocking at death's door

All our beliefs fading into ashes
Heed the words that we pray

For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
...
