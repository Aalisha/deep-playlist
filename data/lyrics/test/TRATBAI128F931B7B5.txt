You need to get some
You need to get some
You need to get some
You need to get

'Cause everybody is havin' fun
Everybody is havin' fun
And everyone keeps
On askin' me, yeah
About all the things
That we've been waiting for

It's not just you, it's not just me
It's not just you
We're dealing with everyone
Hey everyone

Deliver your money
Deliver your soul
Deliver your freedom
