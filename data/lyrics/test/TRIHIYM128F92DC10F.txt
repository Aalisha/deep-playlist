Gotta fight, gotta strike
'Cause there's no turning away
From what you don't want to know
Gotta see, gotta be
If they're all going astray
Don't let them take you in tow

You're a one-man shift in the weather
You're the woman who just won't sell
Climbing up and ringing the bell

Ooh, you're gonna make your mark this time
Ooh, you're gonna set your hope on fire

Gotta leave, gotta bleed
You've gotta stop lying still
...
