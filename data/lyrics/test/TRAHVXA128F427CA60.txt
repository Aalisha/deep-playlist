Oh my heart is yours
My body for you
And my entire soul

My eyes see you
My lips long for yours
So why am I not with you

So give me another minute to run away
Give me another minute
Just give me another minute to flourish

So give me another minute to run away
Give me another minute
Just give me another minute to forget
That I'm not with you
