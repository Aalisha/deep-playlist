Can't fight! There's no escaping the facts
I tried to help but I failed
To solve the problems so much
Of good intentions

I want my wasted hours back
And I want my head to clear
And I have this bad taste in my mouth
From late nights and bad films

Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
Get up! Recover! Cause you'll never dance again!
