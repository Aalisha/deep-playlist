Well, we're in the thick of it
Better get a grip and get it on, get it on
We're in the thick of it
Better get a grip and get it on
Better get a grip and get it on
Better get a grip and get it on
Get it on, get it on
The world we live in is so hectic
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it
So hold on tight and we'll just make it
