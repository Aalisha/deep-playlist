I'm sitting here lonely like a, a broken man
I serve my time doin' the, the best I can
Walls and bars they surround me
But, I don't want no sympathy

No baby, no baby
All I need is some tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burning oven
And, when my time is up, you'll be my reefer

Life gets worse on a God's green earth
Be my reefer, I got to keep smokin' that thing
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

I said now baby, let me smoke it
'Cause I feel good, yes, I feel good
