I just can't get enough (I just can't get enough)
I just can't get enough (I just can't get enough)
I just can't get enough (I just can't get enough)
I just can't get enough

Tell me, who is this?
There's somebody that I see
I got to, get to know you
You know I want you for me

You're so beautiful
Wanna know inside
Mysteries, killin me
I can no longer lie.

Let me tell you I'm ready, (I'm ready)
Ready for love (Ready for love)
Willing and able
I can't get enough (I just can't get enough)
