Been searching for some answers
To the questions I should know
There's an angel up above me
And another down below

They offer me the world
But I don't exactly know
If these visions here they come to me
To stay or finally go

And I'm caught between two angels and a dream
One is pulling at my heart while the other rips the seams
Caught between two angels and a dream
And I don't know where to go

That's a vision of a kingdom
And is twice is black as night (black as night)
They're no brighter than the sun
