It's raining so hard
Looks like it's going
To rain all night
And this is the time
I'd love to be
Holding you tight
I guess I'll have
To accept the fact
That you are not here
I wish tonight
Would hurry up and end
My dear

It's raining so hard
It's really coming down
Sittin' by my window
Watchin' the rain
Fall to the ground
This is the time
I'd love to be
