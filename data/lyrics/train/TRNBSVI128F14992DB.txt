Take me to the Matador
He will know just what it's for
He will help me with my life
He will open ev'ry door

When the bull is in the ring
I need all the help you can
And the Mariachis sing
With the lonely mandolin
See those people shout out loud
Give me more and give me more
And I'm thinkin' to myself
Take me to the Matador
