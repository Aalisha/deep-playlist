Bitter youth angry youth we are pissed off and we will fight back
society tells us how to be i want no part of it
how to act, what to believe i want no part of it
conformity i want no part of it conformity - it's not for me!
I want no part of it no! we won't be a part of your society no!
we won't be a part of your society no!
we won't be a part of your society no!
we won't be a part of your society no!
we'll fight back, we'll fight back!
