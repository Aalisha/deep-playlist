There was a guy
An underwater guy who controlled the sea
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge from New York and New Jersey

This monkey's gone to heaven

This monkey's gone to heaven
This monkey's gone to heaven

The creature in the sky
Got sucked in a hole, now there's a hole in the sky
And the ground's not cold
