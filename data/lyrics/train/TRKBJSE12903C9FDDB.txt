I can't believe You're here close to me
It's getting hard to stand but I don't want to leave
Your beauty stands out
Like a bright light shining through the clouds
It's overwhelming just to be with You now

I can't stop, I can't stop falling in love with You
I can't stop, I can't stop falling in love with You
Your love is in my heart tonight
