Lock me up in a room somewhere
Get me out of the open air
No perception of space or time
And no peace of mind

Shut me out of the wind and rain
Shelter me from the hurt and pain
No temptation to lead me on
Now that you're gone

Won't you come to the rescue
Take me to the promised land
You've got the power to show me
Love is at hand
With you right here beside me
Dancing barefoot in the sand
Close your eyes and take me
To the promised land

Bolt the windows and close the door
...
