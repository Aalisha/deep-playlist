I have not tasted bread for weeks 
Snow is what I eat and drink 
My saga the saga of hunger and need 
The father of my father ancestors of my kin 
The skald told the story of my house 

Here I lie like a dead man 
A weak wreck of no worth 
At the Crater of the Valkyries 
The angels of Odin my master 

Take the dead home from battle 
To Valhalla 

Here I am as a nobody 
Awaiting the beating of wings 
Of the godly women who fill the sky 
Black wings on their shoulders 

Helmets hide white faces 
They will take me to Valhalla 
Not as a warrior 
Hall of Od 
Skald I be 

Skald through the runes 
Let Fate decide 
If you shall live or die 
...
