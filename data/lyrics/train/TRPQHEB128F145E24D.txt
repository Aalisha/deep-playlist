Every road I take there
It leads me back to you
And they'll be no turnin' back now
I feel it comin' through

And I can't keep holdin' on
'Cause I'm not that strong
(And) you're burnin' in my soul
The closer I get
I can't let you go

Out of nothin' at all
I can't face this world alone
And baby I'd die to make you know
I'd do anything for love

Out of nothin' at all
Baby I feel it all again
I'm fallin' deeper within
To the light after the fall
