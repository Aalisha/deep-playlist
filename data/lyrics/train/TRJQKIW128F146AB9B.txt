I was lost with out a purpose,
here alone with out a reason
you appeared right out of the blue
you offered me a manshion
more than a pocket full of Gold
More than just the riches
you cam and rescued me

chorus
I will always love you
with always my heart
cause i knew you love me
right from the start
