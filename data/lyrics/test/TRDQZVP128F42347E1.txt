My Destiny
I have always dreamed of this
I'll admit that there was something I missed
wondering if it is for real
every mistake every wrong turn
everytime i lost my way
led me to this
moment of bliss tonight

with you, finally I can break free
with you, it's all changing in my destiny
dream come true, its so funny now that I see
how different life turned out to be...
