Remember when this meant something.
It was more than popularity.
No open minds or open hearts
We've never been farther apart.
Tolerance does not exist
One's difference meets your fist.
Fake facades and drama queens, they don't know what this really means.
Not a fashion show or a trend
This nonsense has to end.
