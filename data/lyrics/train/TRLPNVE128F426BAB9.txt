i know that it is freezing
but i think we
have to walk

i keep waving at the taxis
they keep turnin
their lights off

but julie knows a party
at some actor's
westside loft

supplies are endless
in the evening
by the morning they'll
be gone

when every thing is lonely
i can be my
own best friend

i get a cofee and the paper
have my own
conversations

with the sidewalk and the pegions
and my window
reflection

and i start polish in the evening
by the morning looks like shit
...
