[DJ Quik]
You want to see a young brother from the Compton tip check a grip
Well keep lookin', because the see-A-M-E-O track is cookin'
Like a big ol' pot of neck bones, we'll tend to fire up
Because a young brother like the Quik is gettin' wired up

You know my offbeat style is flowin' all the while
I'm showin' suckers, they can't get none of this
Let alone some of this, I'm a musical genius
And if you fuck with my roll {"Face, down, HUT HUT HUT HUT!"}

I beat yo' ass as if uh we was playin' Tecmo Bowl
I'm a producer if a rhythm is dope I choose it
And I hope you know I'd rather +BE+ dope than use it
I was a Player in the Penthouse and now I'm uprooted

A young scallion in them khaki suits and booted
With a 40 in hand I'm a take a stand
I'm lettin' em know they can't fuck with the one man band
And if a soft sucker want to know who's to blame
I let 'em know - Quik is the Name
