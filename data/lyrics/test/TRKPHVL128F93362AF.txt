Oh God, here it comes again
Here's that memory
Breaks my back
And when I figured it out

Yeah, I thought I'd get by
Here it comes
Blacken the sun
Bury me alive

Save me from myself
Save me from myself
Save me from myself
Save me from myself, myself, myself, myself

Turn around, throw it all away
Turn around until it all breaks down
...
