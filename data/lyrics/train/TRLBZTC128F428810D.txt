Yeah.
Now in my lyrics I kick this shit that the critics debate to
but I still create the shit that the brothers relate to
cause it's simple, but I'm no simp, I'm lettin you have it
to the temple leavin a scar MUCH bigger than a, pimple
You want the rubber from a gangsta boot to your grill?
Come take a ride with me and witness the thrill
of an ass-whuppin, issued by the brothers in the khaki pants
Some think I'm too light to fight, so then they'll win but I grin
when I sail to your motherfuckin chin (MMM)
So suckers keep walkin until the po-po is talkin
in plain simple english; no wait in plain simple slang, no jivin
Fuckin with me is more lethal than drinkin and drivin
or try to figure the flow I deliver
Punk it makes you shiver when you think I'm takin two to your liver
The D-to-the-E-to-the-motherfuckin-A with a vengeance
A side of Quik that you ain't never experiencin
I'm stutter steppin with crap on the low and I flow well
Intensifyin with every line, cause I show and tell
My backup is backin, never leavin me lackin
With Double or Nothin, KK, D, and AMG and we're stackin
up sales - for motherfuckers just like you
(For a punk motherfucker with a punk motherfuckin crew!)
Yo I know you peeped that you just can't creep
It's too steep so take a leap because we roll too motherfuckin deep
