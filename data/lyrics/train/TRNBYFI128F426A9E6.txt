You lived on Vine Street
I lived at home
The music was all that we had of our own
No satisfaction, no dance in my car
But I had the keys to the world in my beat up guitar

With my beat up guitar
You and I will ride away
From the town that rocked the nation
Philadelphia, PA

Kensington Station, we sat on the tracks
I wrote you a song
The one you knew it was flat
You laughed when they told me
You won't get too far
If you spend the rest of your life with that beat up guitar
