Soulful dress
I’m gonna put on my dress
With those pits above the side
With that, tight thin waist
And that low neck line
Lord I’m going to the party
Gonna have some fun
Gonna shake and shout
Until the morning calls
If you wanna keep your man
You better keep as sharp as you can
I’ll be at my best
When I put on my soulful dress
