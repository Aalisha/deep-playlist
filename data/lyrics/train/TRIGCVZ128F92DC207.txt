Don't believe these angel eyes
They will hurt you
Don't believe this lovely smile.

Her love is radioactive
Don't get too near to her
'Cause you don't know that she's the nuclear bitch
She'll burn your hands and break your heart
She'll hurt your precious soul
You won't recover
It's an open wound

She will contaminate you
