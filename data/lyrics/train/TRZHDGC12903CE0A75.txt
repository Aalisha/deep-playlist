I'm a hopeless
A hopeless romantic
I'm a hopeless
A hopeless romantic
just a hopeless
A hopeless romantic
I'm a hopeless
A hopeless romantic

Regretfully, remorsfully,
Threw it all away for pride,
For pride,
To make it worse,
To make it worse,
See you now,
Only with candles
To feelings inside
Inside, inside
And i can't hide,
Deep inside
And i feel like I'm reaching
And i feel like I'm gasping,
To breathe air,
And only you can resisting my love,
And i feels like I'm fallin
And i feels like I'm drowning
But you don't care,
Feels like I'm drowning like the titanic
One day you gonna fell me,
Even if you never understand it,
And you can find another friend,
Be single,
Find a boyfriend,
Even if we never speak again,
Forever i'll be loving you
Maybe it's better way i left alone
Here we are on this telephone
and you ain't moved on
...
