Verse 1
Remember the time when we used to play yeah yeah
Knock down ginger and we braid hair
Drunk slush puppies every day and
Now you're not around
A trip to the sweet shop oh was a treat
When your mama gave us 50p
What happened to those good old days
You ain't here with me

So how you been?
I know I haven't seen you
I heard you were working
Not as much as you do
Just keep trying
Maybe I'll come and see you
You know I'm gonna be here
