Tonight the stars are dancing to the song the angels sing
I hear Your whisper on the breeze
And every sound echoes the rhythm of Your heart
As I begin to fade into this lovely night, I'm alive

'Cause our worlds collide
I'm lost in time, heaven kisses me tonight
Your heart with mine, it beats in time
