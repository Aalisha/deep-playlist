Wooo!

Don't walk, don't walk, don't walk, don't quit
Don't walk, don't walk out of there
They need you armoured
And sure, you could still do with a friend
(?) of every bitter end
Than picking at stitches and overusing metaphors like
Dark harbourzz party scene
How they make it see the customs, but the customs won't fit
And you don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't walk out on them

Do you still think of quiet spaces as airport lounges?
Are you sleepwalking to stay in shape, cause when you're round we'll celebrate

I guess we'll cool it with air
Well perhaps a taxi, traffic taking over Times Square
...
