You've got some nerve I never knew,
What with the world we gave away in front of you.
I see it all
Much clearer now.
You're just a phase
I've gotten over anyhow.

It's over,
I'm not giving in again.

We're loyal like brothers,
Just us versus all the others.
You the one for
You the one for me?

I trusted misleading
Promises worth repeating.
How could you do this to me?
