It's strange all the ways
We suffer everything in trade
Like the trails we impose to disappear

Find I've strayed from the course of least resistance
Losing sight of the prize like a faint and distant scar
Forced it down with the rest
Of the bitterness and humility not less
Than the air we simply breathe and sterilize

Say a prayer for me I'm still haunted and so starved
...
