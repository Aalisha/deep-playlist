Desolate sands of eternity
Ever descending down the precipice
Deadly dryness desert domain
Sent the silent pestilent breeze
Consume the dreams and prophecies
Of the so worshipped mortal god

Colossal monuments to the empire of madness
Enslaved masses bow to idols of gold
Decayed tombs of royal divinites
...
