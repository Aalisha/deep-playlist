Would you stand up for me? 
So I can see everything
What's making you scream? 
Are you breathing? 
Is it what you're seeing? 

[chorus]
Come on
Don't spend your whole life waiting for your whole life
Thinking that it's over
... are you breathing? 

When you gave up on me
Were you happy? 
Could you ever be? 
Was is making you mean? 
...
