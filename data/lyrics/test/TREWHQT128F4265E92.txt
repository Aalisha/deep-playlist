Hey, hey, hey, uh, yeah
And whatchu know about a Sweetback love?
And whatchu know about a ladybug love?
Hey Aya, tell 'em 'bout love

Guess I wondered where it's been
A search to find a love [Incomprehensible]
It's come back to let me know
I found it in my heart and in my soul

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
I was caught up in a hazy love, you see
It's come back to let me know
Got a thing for love and I can't let it go

Love is the word, have you heard, it's superb
It's got groove, it's got style, it's got feeling
Love is the word that I've heard
It's so hard to describe what it is that I'm feeling
Ivana, you tell 'em bout love

Some people go around the world for love
