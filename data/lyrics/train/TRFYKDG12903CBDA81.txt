Ha, ha, eh, eh, eh, eh, get out my face
Check it, Mobb shit, bitch, Lynch Mobb mane
Eh, eh, the Lu-Luniz, 3 Times, me Ager Man
Bart, let me turn up the heat man
Dig it the M.O.B., baby, I'm so hurt
Fa sheezy, Fa sheez
I fold the cash then I hit away
Just a thug for the money, no love
Hit 'em up wit the blast
Put him in a bag and wrap him up
It's all business, so when the picture come
Bouncin' off yo' head don't take it personal
Money makin' needs no rehearsin'
No nigga will come wit disrespect
And leave wit they head on they shoulders
Mobb, killaz connected from block to block
Re-caulk the glock, reset the dot
Heatas Beamers repeat from Turf achievers
We take action verses talk is cheap
You gonna believe us time to floss wit me
Cut off the weak, you won't deceive us
Let us merchandise an murderise
Any and all many will fall
It's just an O.G. call, made from the B
When I step up, I bet you, Mr. Sick is gonna get to creep
I gets to blastin' ass dip they bodies in the bag
I hope I get to lastin' in this game of cash
It's paraphernalia, not paranoid
You fuckin' wit a pair of boys
That'll pump yo' body full of lead
And watch it swell up like we got no conscience
'Cause it ain't no spraya like the one I got
Claimin' you just a playa but the fakas I sock
Surround yo' weave head fuckin' wit the weave head
Get left wit P head, I bet you violent click
Talkin' all that lip when you was wit my click an get shit
Head split an ass kicked in, chin shattered
And nobody could recognize you when they found you
And they still don't know who downed you
This shit is deeper than you think wit a straight face
Lay down an come up off them cavy case slow down
Better pump yo' brakes, don't know my click from a can of paint
These niggaz won't last when I buck one in that ass
And hit the gate, I seen two more escape
It ain't no room for no non-ass soldier niggas
And it's amazin' how the heat bring out the hoe in niggas
When pistols blazin
It ain't no room for no non-ass soldier niggas
And it's amazin' how the heat bring out the hoe in niggas
When pistols blazin
Cashin' 'em like fresh over fresh
I'm in the Benz massagin' a bitches my rivalry
Rushed out to get some ends build the twins
Nigga, I love them bitch half Benz strugglin' off that gin
Hoes at the bus stop wanna get in
But they foot soliders not swangin' like a Nova
