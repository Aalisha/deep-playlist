Walkin' down by the river
Water running through my knees
(Ahhh)
River, oh river moves so free
(Ahhh)
Oh mighty river endlessly

Oo mighty river
I would love to be like you
Oo lonely river
Has not got the time to say

I was born into the city life
It's all that I've ever known
You know it's rough gettin' round this place
So crowded I can hardly breathe

You can only see about a block or two
