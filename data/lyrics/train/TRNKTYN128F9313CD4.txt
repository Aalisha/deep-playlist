No better word than from Your lips
No perfect life than what You lived
No greater gift, no not one

No brighter star has ever shined
No better hope for all mankind
No higher mind, no not one

And no one has ever known this kind of love You've shown

There has never been a greater love than Your son, no not one
And there will never be a name above, no not one
And with His life You have forgiven us, hope has come, hope has come
