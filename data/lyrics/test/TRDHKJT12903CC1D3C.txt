Kelly and I meet secretly
We stay out of sight
When we're in each others arms
We know it isn't right

We are so in love
But he loves you too
How can I tell my best friend
That I'm in love with you

He's told me of your sweet caress
And of your lovely eyes
Just how long can we go on
Telling him all these lies
