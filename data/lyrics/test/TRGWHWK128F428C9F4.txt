when I start making love I don't just make love. I be stroking
that's what I be doing.
I be stroking
I stroke it to the east
and I stroke it to the west

and I stroke it to the woman that I love the best.
I be stroking
let me ask you something.
what time of the day do you like to make love?

have you ever made love just before breakfast?
have you ever made love while you watch the late late show?
well let me ask you this
have you ever made love on the couch?
well let me ask you this
have you ever made love on the back seat of a car?
I remember one time I made love on the back seat of a car
and the police came and shined his light at me
and I said I'm strokin'
that's what I'm doing
I be strokin'

I stroke it to the east
and I stroke it to the west
and I stroke it to the woman that I love the best
I be strokin'
