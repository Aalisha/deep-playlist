Twenty-seventh wagon full of cotton
Was parked outside my chicken shack door
I kept my crib covered up in satin
In case my baby came around for more
Now I feel, Daddy, somethin's not the same
'Cause there's weeds, and there's rust
And the roof won't hold the rain

Chorus:
I remember better days
Lace in every window
And roses 'round the gate
Now they've chased away all my friends
...
