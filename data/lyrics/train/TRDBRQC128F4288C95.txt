People everywhere seem to think
I won't survive, one day I'll sink
Well, I guess
I value less what they think
Than the song that I sing
And the hope that it brings

Oh... It's a song, a song of love
And to me your heart is a choir
Life is the song
And the theme is love
Give me my share and I'll get by

I can never seem to achieve
All that the world tells me I need
...
