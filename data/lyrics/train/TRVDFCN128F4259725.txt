Guess what! Summer's arrived I feel the world's on my side
The Brooklyn Bridge stretches below me
A billion souls all dying to know me
Well here I am! Loaded with promise
And knee deep in grace
What I want is here on my face and
I feel like I own the whole damn place

Hey Manhattan! Here I am! Call me star-struck Uncle Sam.
