Every time I asked you to be truthful you lied
And when I lost my temper you cried
Crocodile tears and spoke double talk
It's the same old alibis and stories again
I redeye there to meet you and then
All you ever give me is double talk

You think that love means cope
Your life is like some daytime soap
Where all the dialogue is just double talk
Well I've got news for you
This little drama's through
'Cause I can't take no more of your double talk
Your double talk
