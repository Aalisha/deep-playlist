We tried to work this out, pushing harder and further. Till it's too much to take in.
As a matter of fact i'm doin well, with your plan of attack just to bring me down to your level of insecurities

I light this match to watch you burn.

So stay away
It's over from the get-go, I'm asking you to let go. so take a break

turn the page (the final chapter)
as the fight replace the laughter...
And so the story unfolds.
As a matter of fact you didnt make a sound, and your plan of attack was to hit the ground.
