All the money in the world ain't never gonna make you happy
All the money in the world ain't never gonna set you free
All the wealth you can steal and hide away ain't never gonna bring you no kind of security
When just about everybody else in the world wants to burn down your house and steal all your money
Ain't life a drag when you got it all
Then you gotta find out it's not what you wanted after all
Ain't life a drag when you got everything you want
And just about nothing you need
