I've had enough of this small town bullshit
I'm not stayin' in school
I'm makin' good dough workin' with my brother
Cleanin' out pools
I'm going out to California
And man it won't be long
As soon as I get my license
Color me gone

Oh knock it off Johnny
Man, your livin' in your head
You ain't even got a car
And those chicks don't believe a word ya said
But you're doin' all the talkin'
So I just keep quiet
And this'll probably go no where
But I can't blame ya for tryin'
