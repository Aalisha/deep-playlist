Uh huh
I had a load in the dryer, I was waitin at the laudrymat
Sittin on top of a washin machine
I could hear the sound of a quarter tumblin round
I'd left in the pocket of my dirty blue jeans

I reached in just to pull it out
Never thinkin how it'd burn my hand
It rolled over by the payphone
Ain't it funny where it chose to land

Maybe it's a sign, maybe I should call
To see if everything's alright back in Omaha
Maybe you were right, maybe I'm to blame
Maybe if I try real hard baby I can change
I could do what you say and just grow up
It might be worth a shot
But then again, maybe not
