Quick kid quips, so harsh and cynical
Touches stricken cold and clinical
What a transformation to behold
I don't like this new, I want the old

It's not the words that make it final
You've said such things before to rival them
But it's how you say them now that's changed
Cold but sympathetic all the same

You'd like to convince me that I'll be better off
So you go on and I'll be happier
I'll be happier
You go on, yeah, you go on
You'll be gone and I'll be happier
...
