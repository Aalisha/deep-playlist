Trying to forget about the thought of moving on
But I'll try and I kept waiting
Trying to move on without you feels so wrong
But I'll try and I'll keep waiting for you

I know it's only been
In the back of your mind since we said goodbye
But I swear it's been so long
Yesterday's so far behind

I can't decide what to dream tonight
It makes me so afraid that it won't come true
So let me lay here
And waste the day with you

Can we start all over again?
Would it be easier until then?
