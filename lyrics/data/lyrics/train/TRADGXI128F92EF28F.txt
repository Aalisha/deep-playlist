Get me out of here.
This isn't slowing down.
We've hit black ice and lost control.
We're spinning faster now.
Tell me are we flying? Are we falling to the ground?
If tomorrow doesn't come, did we die for nothing?

Recounting past events has helped reveal that you don't give a damn
about the days when you would live the words you wrote.
Not the person who you were; I hate the person you've become.
You inspired. Now expired, it has died for nothing.

Some stop feeling love for all the places they come from.
A person I will not become.
A jaded liar, unforgivable.

Some stop feeling love for every word that they once sung.
May I never lose my youth and If I do, may I be forgettable.

You said you started up this home
because you didn't like the way these kinds of things were run.
You've said you understand the work it takes to make us grow.
If you had then where were you?
