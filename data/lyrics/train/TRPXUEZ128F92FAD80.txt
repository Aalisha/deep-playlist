So, you see
You’ve got me back again for more
And it seems
Your song is in my head
This is war
Mystery; how I could feel you breathe me

I was sure you would keep
Every promise; you would keep
Every word

Well,
I try to put your stories in line
But nothing adds up right

For every 99 times
You looked me in the eye,
You looked me in the eye
And swore you weren’t lying
Well, I was so blind
I never saw the signs
