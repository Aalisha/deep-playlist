Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We were young and drinking in the park There was nowhere else to go
And you said you always had my back
Oh but how were we to know
That these are the days that bind you Together, forever
And these little things define you
Forever, forever
All this bad blood here
Won't you let it dry?
