Another late night drivin around
We're losing sunlight so we head downtown
To woodward off charlotte street
The old place that we used to meet
We were young and we lived it up
But those nights never lasted long enough
Looking back we were so na√Øve
What happened to the days we shared our dreams

If I could go back now
I wouldn't change a thing
Oh, it feels so good
To say

Guess we made it this far
Guess we're doing alright
Looks like we made it out alive
Yeah, we made our mistakes
But we followed our hearts
Even though we drift apart
For always, forever
Weathered yellow still frames in my head
...
