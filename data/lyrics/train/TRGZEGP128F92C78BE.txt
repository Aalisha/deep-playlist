I want all you skinheads to get up on your feet
Put your braces together and your boots on your feet
And give me some of that old moonstomping

Get ready, we got three million miles to reach the moon
So let's start getting happy now
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Now, before we reach the moon, fellas
We got to make sure that everthing is spic and span, alright?
We got to make sure you, shine your boots, brush your teeth
Because the man on the moon look different from man on the Earth
