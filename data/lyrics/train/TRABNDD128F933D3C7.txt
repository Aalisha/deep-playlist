I think I know a way
Around this mess we're in
But you'll have to think about me for a while
Like your long lost friend
Cause you see, I see right through you
Past the smile to the truth that's hard to hold
Like the secrets of your rival
That paints them like a fool

You look just like a million dollars
But I think that you're nearly almost spent
And you're dying on the inside
You're lying on the inside
But don't fall apart
...
