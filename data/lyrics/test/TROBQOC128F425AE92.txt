Lights, out of the darkness
What did you see?
What did you see?
And I, I don't see the likeness
Im trying to see
Im trying to see

If you believe me look in my eyes
As you delight me dont' breathe a sigh

Im caught in the reason
Im caught in the reason
You wanted a reason
You wanted a reason
For all the things I said
Its out of the question
Its out of the question
Right out of the question
Right out of the question
I'd rather stop being dead

This is the only thing I know
...
