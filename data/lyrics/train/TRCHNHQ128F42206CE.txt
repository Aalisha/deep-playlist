Endless days and nights alone
A free trade zone with the curtains drawn
And I’m a drunken mess winning bets on never seeing Boston again
I’m tired as hell about this off and on
And back and forth and home, then gone
And if I’m wrong then damn it, condemn me now, please
Cause I can’t breathe… without you
Without you
Without you… without you
...
