When my blood runs warm with the warm red wine
I miss the life that I left behind
But when I hear the sound of the blackbirds cry
I know I left in the nick of time
Well this road I'm on's gonna turn to sand
And leave me lost in a far off land
So let me ride the wind til I don't look back
Forget the life that I almost had
If I wonder til I die
May I know who's hand I'm in
If my home I'll never find
And let me live again
The longer I run
Then the less that I find
Sellin my soul for a nickel and dime
...
