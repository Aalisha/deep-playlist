Old James Dean Monroe
Hands out flowers at the Shop-n-Go
Hopes for money
But all he gets is fear
And the wind blows up his coat
And this he scribbles on a purfume note:
"If I'm not here, then you're not here."
And he says:
"Call me Miscreation,
I'm a walking celebration."
And it's hard to make a stand
Hard to make a stand
Hard to make a stand
Hard to make a stand
...
