Love Loss Hope Repeat
Carbon Leaf

Take a walk down town
And dream with me
We'll walk the parks and the empty streets
You know the seasons oughta be
Love Loss Hope Repeat

We're alone in a crowded room
Silhouetted in and ready to bloom
You know the seasons oughta be
Love loss hope repeat
Love loss hope repeat

And when then high wind blows everything
Like the lion attacking spring
I love you more than I'll ever let on
And that's a fault of mine I'm workin' on
I'm workin' on

Take a walk downtown

Remember the days that would never end
...
