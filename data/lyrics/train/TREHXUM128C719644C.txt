I want to touch somebody
I want to touch somebody for real
I want to change the world
I want to touch somebody
I want to take away their bad things for sure
I want to change their world
Just for the hell of it, just for the sake of it
Just 'cause I want it
And if I fall by the way-side
I am coming down with my hands tied
There is no fall after my pride
