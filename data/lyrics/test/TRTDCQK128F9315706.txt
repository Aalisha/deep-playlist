Well, I was sitting in my room playing on my old guitar
Thinking about you, baby acting like a movie star
When the telephone rang
They said you're at the local bar

So I jumped and ran as fast as a man can run
Don't know where but the night was made for fun
'Cause if I ever loved a woman, baby
You're the only one

So, let's Rock This Place
Let's Rock This Place
Let's Rock This Place
Till everybody says it's alright

Let's Rock This Place, let's Rock This Place
I want a whole lot of gimme, gimme
'Til the whole room shakes and shimmies
...
