Mother will look with me 
Father will pray for me 
Religion will wait for me 
Nobody waits for this long cant you see 

Doors will do for me 
What sinners could never dream 
Science is in your head 
Nobody hurts them selves but themselves can't you tell? 

Haters will love in time 
And lovers will feel their crime 
Patience is all you need 
That and the courage it takes just to be
