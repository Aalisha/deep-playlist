Is it really over?
Between us two
Then why don't you love me?
The way that I still love you
So many mistakes made
In so little time
Girl, I'm so regretful
I must have been out of my mind
I don't wanna live another day
Without you by my side
I don't wanna run anymore
(I don't, I don't)
Running out of places to hide
Ever since you went away
Slowly I've seen
That I shoulda got down on my knees
And begged you to stay with me
And what I'm feeling for you
Never could I try to hide
The fact that I adore you
...
