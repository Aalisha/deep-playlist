The dust had just settled
She's wonderin', What happens now?
I don't know where I am
I ain't never seen this place before

Am I dreamin'
Or is this the real world?
Your love's too good for me

Lay with me lady
You're drivin' me crazy
I promised you all my life
These things that sustain me
Oh how they drain me
But I'll never hang you out to dry

The sun had just faded
...
