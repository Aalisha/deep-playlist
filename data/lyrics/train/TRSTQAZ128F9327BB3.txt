I don't wanna fight anymore
I just wanna lay my hand on the side of your neck
as the words come rushing out in the night

I don't wanna fight anymore
I just wanna feed the spot on your hip with my tongue
as we dip into the rolling sea

Holy Rider
Sweet confider
Take me down to lay beside her
Holy Rider
Help me find her
I have lost my way

I don't wanna fight a
But there's so many things I don't do as well
...
