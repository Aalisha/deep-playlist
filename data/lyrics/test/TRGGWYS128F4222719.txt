Everybody wants a lover
Nobody wants to uncover
What may lay deep beneath a sometimes painful past
Wanna go without a care
Pull gardenias from her hair
I think of a time we didn't have a care in the world
Captivated by her beauty I knew it was my life long duty
She had all the grace and charm of a radiant queen

Chorus:
How do you talk without speaking? Yea
How do you hear without listening?
How do you live without feeling? Yea
How do you take without giving?
We keep it all inside?
