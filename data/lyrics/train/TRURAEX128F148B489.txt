Cause Heaven knows
Yeah
Tears run dry on a young man's face
Feel the glow of warm embrace
Been on a boat to the edge of somewhere
Searched for you almost everywhere
One more hill but you know I'll be there
No more pain left for me to bear
Cause now I'm almost there
Baby it's growing much stronger
From the day that you said
You were gonna be mine
From the way I was lead into your mind
Maybe love was making me stronger
From the day that you said you were gonna be mine
From the way I was lead into your mind
Everything comes to those who wait
