Doesn't matter... Doesn't matter...
Doesn't matter at all

Doesn't matter what your friends tell you
Doesn't matter what my family's saying too
It just matters that I'm in love with you
It only matters that you love me too.
It doesn't matter if they won't accept you
I'm accepting of you and the things that you do

Just as long as it's you.
Nobody but you
Baby, baby, baby
My love! For you! Unconditional love too!
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up and show you that it...

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
Cause I'm in love with the with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is your love for me.

Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
Cause I'm in love with the inner being
Doesn't really matter what they believe
What matters to me is your nutty, nutty, nutty for me.

You're so kind
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind
And you're mine
And I can't believe your mine.

Doesn't matter if your feeling insecure
Doesn't matter if your feeling so unsure
Cause I'll take away the doubt within your heart
