You can't forgive and you won't forget
We did something that we both regret
Mea culpa
I held my breath while you took your time
To tell the world what's yours is mine
Mea culpa

You don't need me
You don't need anyone at all
You've got what you desired
You lit the fire and watched the rise and fall

And in your eyes I could see my face
A non believer in a state of grace
Mea culpa, mea culpa
I see no reason for your complaint
You got the sinner and not the saint
Mea culpa

I can't say much, I can't say anything at all
You tell the story well then you retire to watch the rise and fall
Mea culpa
