I was reborn when I was broken
I wouldn't believe
I wouldn't believe
(no)
Been through a storm, with no use in hopin'
That you would come rescue me
Somehow your love set me free

Now I, I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime

There was a time when love wasn't chosen
And now I'm just gonna beg for more
Now I'm just reachin' out for somethin'
