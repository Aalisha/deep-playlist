Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurtin' People Like Me
People Like Me, People Like Me
People Like Me, People Like Me

Is it fair to say that I am stressing out?
I'm stationed in Iraq and they won't let me out
My homeys said I was stupid for even joining
My counselor said that my decision was disappointing

How she had good slate for good state colleges
And with my good grades it wouldn't have been a problem
But they don't understand just the power of significance
More than brilliance and certainly more than dividends

And if you ask me now, would I repeat it?
Would I fight in a war I don't believe in?
Well, the answer is if not me where the cancer is
They been doing this before Jesus of Nazareth

And after all this time it is still deadly hazardous
And Bush isn't really being all that inaccurate
When he says, we're winning the war 'cause it's staggering
But thats 'cause we're killing everybody that we see

And most of us soldiers we can barely fall asleep
And time and time again I'm feeling incompetent
'Cause my women back home, we're constantly arguing
And I must be crazy 'cause all I'm obsessing with is

Her MySpace and face book and who's commenting
I swear to God if she's cheatin' I'm doin' her ass in
I can tell with one look and it came to me
Sounding something like a song hook, sayin'

Heaven, is there a chance that you could come down
And open doors to hurtin' People Like Me
