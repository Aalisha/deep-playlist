Pretty people, pretty cars, livin' in the lap of luxury
But this precious fantasy
Seems so close when it's so far from me, yea yeah

Tell me, where to get in line
Show me, how to change my luck this time

People turn their backs on you
On the streets in paradise
When you're not the chosen few
It's hot as Hell and cold as ice
Every day's another fight
Livin' on the streets in paradise, c'mon

All that glitters isn't gold, promises and dreams can get so old
I know, what this game's about
People chew you up and spit you out, yeah yeah
