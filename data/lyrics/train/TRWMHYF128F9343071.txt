Intro:
Aye my nigga, do me a favor. (What's that my nigga?)
If u happen to bump into the streets
Can you please tell him I'm back? (oh okay I'll do that.)
I appreciate that (My nigga)

Na nana na, nana nana na (4x)

Chorus:
Well alright, okay
I've been gone, and away
For too long, a mistake
But right now, I feel awake
I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Feel like I'm back)
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Just like I'm back)
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (Feel like I'm back)


Verse 1:
Hey hey hey hey
I take it in
I blow it out
On the courthouse steps after they throw it out
Bentley waitin by the curb, I spurr it out
Doors don't open they self, the chauffeur get out
My exhale made ayething a foggy blur
I make my way thru the reporters and photographers
I take my lady's hand, I shake my attorney's
Slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey
Told the driver hold off before we pushed out
I let my window down and out comes a kush cloud 
Any last words? 
Justice has been served
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve
