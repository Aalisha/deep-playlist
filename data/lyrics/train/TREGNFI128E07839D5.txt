I see that look on your face
I see that look on your face
I see that look on your face, oh-oh-oh

The boys know what you're giving, you give the boys such a lot of fun
And by the way that you make a living you've got the boys all on the run
S.T.'s showing, you really got me going maybe you can give me a price
I wanna try it, yeah I wanna buy it, tell me would you treat me nice
Oh my legs are shaking, oh my heart is breaking
I'm just feeling like a boy
