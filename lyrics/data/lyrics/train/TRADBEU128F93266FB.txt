You and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we' ll fly away
Don' t you know that Rome wasn' t built in a day

In this day and age it's so easy to stress
'Cause people are strange and you can never second guess
In order to love child we got to be strong
I'm caught in the crossfire why can't we get along

'Cause you and me we're meant to be
Walking free in harmony
One fine day we' ll fly away
Don' t you know that Rome wasn' t built in a day
