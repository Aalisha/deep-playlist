Bloody murder, a violent scene of death
A bullet in the back of the head
Lethal shot, point-blank combat
Another life comes to an end
Executed, a hole between the eyes
Stare into the barrel of a gun
Bone implodes, blood pours out
One squeeze and the deed is done

Bust a cap, another drops dead
Seven minutes and I'll kill again
Pieces of lead, ripping through your head
This is a violent scene of death
