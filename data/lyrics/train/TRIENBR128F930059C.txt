My body will be set aflame tonight
Even though my heart will remain
It's cold as ice inside
I feel my fists are buried in the pavement
Helpless to the rotting cancer, sent to ruin my life

I awake to this anxiety, 
that every breath, every step might be my last

I feel i'm growing numb
A slight chill to my flesh
like one million knifes
stabbing a hole right through my chest

There is no comfort
...
