Did you ever get the felling you're being followed?
Are you not familiar with the Revelations of St.John
The final book of the Bible, prophesied the apocalypse
He forced everyone to receive a mark on his right hand
Or on his forehead so that no one shall be able
To buy or sell unless he has that mark
Which is the name of the beast and the number of his name
And the number of the beast is '6 6 6'
What can such a specific prophecy mean?
What is the mark?
Well, the mark is the bar-code
The ubiquitous bar-code that you'll find on every bog roll
And every packet of Johnnies and every poxy-pork-pie
And every bar-code is divided into two parts by three markers
And those three markers are always represented by the number six
'6 6 6'
And what does it say?
No one shall be able to buy or sell without that mark
And now what they're planning to do
In order to eradicate all credit card fraud
And in order to precipitate a totally cashless societyï¿½
What they're planning to do
