Ballard Ashley
Get In The Booth
5 x 5
All systems operational
I'm so alive
Everything is 5 x 5

Got me feeling like there's no gravity
trying to look at the space between you and me boy
just trying to get into your world

I need your smile to bring me safely back to earth
cause when you touch me, boy I'm in another universe
I just wanna stay here 'til the end of time

No matter where you are
baby your love is a guiding star
switch into overdrive
'Cause everything is 5 x 5

All systems operational
just give the word
I'll give you lovin' unconditional
