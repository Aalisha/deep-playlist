(Willie Nelson)
I'm gonna live forever.
I'm gonna cross that river.
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now.
(Kris Kristofferson)
You're gonna want to hold me.
Just like I always told you,
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

(All)
Nobody here will ever find me.
But I will always be around.
Just like the songs I leave behind me.
I'm gonna live forever now.
