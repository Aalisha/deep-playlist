I don't care what nobody says, we're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville, she's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says, no, she's gonna have my baby
I'm taking all I have to take because taken gonna shape me

People call us renegades because we like living crazy
We like takin' on the town because peoples gettin' lazy
I don't care what nobody says, no, I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk, but I love her like no other

And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we're gonna go
