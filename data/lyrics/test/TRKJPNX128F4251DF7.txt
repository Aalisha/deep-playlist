Got nowhere to run.
Got nowhere to run.
Ain't got anyone.

Wondering how come,
Good times got so glum,
Got so troublesome.

Give me luck, give me soul,
Give me feelings that I can control.
Give me warmth, give me sunlight,
Give me, give me love.

Let it sing, let it fly,
Let the shivers shiver down my spine.
Let it soar, give me magic,
Give me, give me love.

Desire is nothing without love,
It's all I can think of,
...
