Right here, right now
I'm looking back
To the road that I've been traveling
That brought me here
I remember Heaven, I saw Hell
And now the hour for my return
Is drawing near

Endless is the moment
As if time is standing still
Fractions of a minute
Like a thousand years
Countless are the memories
Of all I used to know
I'm ready to go

Big city lights
Are painting the skies
My mind is set
I'm raising the eyes
And by all means
I'm coming home
To Megatropolis
