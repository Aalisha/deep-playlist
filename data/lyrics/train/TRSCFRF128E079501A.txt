In the corner
I sit talking to a friend
But the message is clear
We'll face the end

The accusations
Skating on thin ice
Searching the window
Sure pay the price

Words in the wind
Can bring you down, down, down
Let them take you over
And you're a fool

I will concede
Something so true
You live in small talk
But it comes back to you

It ain't no white lie
It's a slap in the face
...
