Everybody's doin a brand new dance now
Come on baby, do the locomotion
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
Come on baby, do the locomotion...

My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier than learnin your ABC's
So come on, come on, do the locomotion with me...
You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby, jump up, hmmmm jump back...
Well I think youve got the knack

Now that you can do it, lets make a chain now
Come on baby, do the locomotion
A chuga-chuga motion like a railway train
Come on baby, do the locomotion...
