I come in last night about half past ten
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
So move it on over. Rock it on over
Move over little dog, a mean, old dog is movin' in

She told me not to mess around
But I done let the deal go down
Move it on over. Rock it on over
Move over nice dog, a big, fat dog is movin' in

She changed the lock on my back door
Now my key won't fit no more
...
