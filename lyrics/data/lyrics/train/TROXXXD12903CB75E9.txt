Tell her try your best just to make it quick
Woman tend to the sick
'Cause there must be something she can do
This heart is broken in two
Tell her it's a case of emergency
There's a patient by the name of Gregory

Night nurse
Only you alone can quench this here thirst
My night nurse, oh gosh
Oh, the pain is getting worse
