What was i saying? in one ear, and out the other
Fibre optic noises
Fracture lines and moisture
Call and response
Up to scratch, i sat tight, tied up in electrical tape
Shall i get out and walk? you call the shots
Enough is enough, im out of my face
And dragging my feet through the whites of their eyes
I'll burst into flames, and repeat
That's settled then
My lips are criminal, that's muscle memory
...
