Million years of evolution
Still not close to perfection
God how much time do you need?
Cause I'm getting impation
Release the source
And I'll find a way to alter my DNA
I'm on to you big guy
And I'm getting impatient

My red eyed friend
Time for us to part ways
My red eyed friend
Don't forget to write me

Why can't the demon in my head just help me?
Come back and burn al these painfull feelings
As you used to do before
(As you used to do before)
...
