I wok e up tired after sleeping in my car
At a rest-stop on I-95
It’s a wonder that I’m still alive 
The way some of these people drive
I came to get my kicks on route 66
Where gasoline’s cheaper than drugs
Yeah I came to get some bang for my buck 
In the land where they make their own luck
And I’ve got some songs about love, sweet love
In the box where some people keep their gloves
Keep their gloves
