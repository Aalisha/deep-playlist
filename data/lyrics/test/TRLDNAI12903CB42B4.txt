[Verse 1:]
They say that a shadow is a reflection of your soul
Searching for the starting line where the winds have blown

They say - that you can't even
They say - learn to know
They say - if you want believe
They say - let your feelings go

Shadow Winds - you won't receive
Can't conceive - what I believe
