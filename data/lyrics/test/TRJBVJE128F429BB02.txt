You can watch TV and watch the media
President Bush doing takeover
Kate Moss in ads for mascara
All my youth, the young offender

The bill payers, the drug dealers
Girls who are on magazine covers
The part-time jobbers at a call center
No career plans 'cause you won't go far

Put away change for Ibiza
And check your credit on your new Nokia

You can be a follower, but who's your leader?
Break that cycle or it will kill ya
