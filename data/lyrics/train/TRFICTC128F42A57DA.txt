Tell me, tell me I'm your man
There's a need inside of me
For love and understanding
Standing at your door and feeling in trouble
Don't turn away, baby, I'm your man

Hold me, hold me until I smile
I need to feel the touch of your hand
If only for a little while
Once upon a time we made a promise
Don't turn away, baby I'm your man
...
