Something happenin' here
What it is ain't exactly clear
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware

It's time we stop, children
What's that sound
Everybody look what's going down

Battle lines being drawn
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong
Young people speaking their minds
Getting so much resistance from behind

It's time we stop, children
...
