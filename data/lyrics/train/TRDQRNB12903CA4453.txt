Here I lie in a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time in a world of tears I slowly drown
Going home I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you, 
loving you, loving you

Tragedy
When the feelings gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning cries
And you don't know why
It's hard to bear
With no one to love you you're going nowhere
Tragedy
