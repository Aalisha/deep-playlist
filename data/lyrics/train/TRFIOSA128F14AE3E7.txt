Arise (arise) 
And awaken 
He is King (He is King) 
He is King 
Arise (arise) 
My soul Awaken 
All flesh is grass 
Surely is fading (surely is fading fast) 
Oh soon it's all gone 
And we'll fly away 
Oh soon it's gone, it's gone 

Oh You are the Maker 
The life sustainer (life sustainer) 
and everything comes 
Everything goes 
...
