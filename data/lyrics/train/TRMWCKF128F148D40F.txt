[Ricky Walters]
Ladies and gentlemen... and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure
that we are here to present tonight...
Slick Rick the Ruler! And MC Ricky D!
Doing their smash hit "Mona Lisa "
you know like the picture?
Anyway I'd like to take this time out
to bow before his divine majesty

[Ricky] Oh your majesty...
[Slick] Hmm?
[Ricky] Can I kiss your hand?
[Slick] Mm hmm
[Ricky] (kisses his hand loudly)
[Slick] Enough!
[Ricky] Come your highness. they await you.

[Slick Rick]
Well, it was one of those days -- not much to do
I was chillin downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store -- to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona -- what?
Mona Lisa (what?) *singing* Mona Lisa, so men made you.
YouknowhatI'msayin? So I said, "Excuse me, dear
my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money
