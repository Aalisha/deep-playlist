Pretty ballerina smilin' like no other day
Pretty ballerina about to
Say goodbye to all the questions made
Pretty ballerina with no one but her to blame
Pretty ballerina only person to find about in these days
Little Billy Joe is smilin' like no other day
Little Billy Joe about to
Say goodbye to all the questions made
And I say hey
Will I send my resume
For independent zoo?
