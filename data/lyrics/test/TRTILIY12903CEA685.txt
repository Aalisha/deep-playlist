Slipped into my shoes, checked out and I was unaware
Till I heard the news
All of the buses and the trains been leveled to the ground
I came to you as if I'd never have to see you go
And held onto you... and held onto you.

Where the main train runs
From London to the Underground
On a downtown line... on a downtown line
...
