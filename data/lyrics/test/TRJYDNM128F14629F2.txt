You've got all that is really needed
To save a dying world from its funk less hell

Stupidly I forced a smile
My composure was secure
I wore a silly grin from ear to ear
A smile they saw right through

Oh, but then like a streak of lightning it came
Filling my brain with this pain
Without saying a word this voice I heard
"Give up the funk, you punk"

Unfunky kind of UFO
(From the sun)
Here from the sun
(You've got the groove)
You've got the groove and we want some

We're unfunky and we're obsolete
(And out of time)
And we're out of time
Gonna take your funk and make it mine

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh

You could feel so much better
If you would show me how to funk like you do

You've got all that is really needed
Save a dying world from its funk less hell

Deep in pain I called the names
Of some funkified friends of mine
And they were on the road and gettin' it on
