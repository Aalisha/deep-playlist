Don't want something to believe in
Or I'll start driving through the red lights
I don't belong in the human race
All fighting for the fast lane
Within pool empty silence
Far away from all those undermining
Untie the noose that's always tightening
Till I can't breath

How do I escape everyone thou I try
I don't get anywhere then the voice in my head
...
