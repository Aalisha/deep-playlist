I JUST MIGHT BE
I just might be a pleasant dream, that will haunt you for all time Sometimes peaceful and serene, sometimes tearing at your mind
I might be that scent of perfume, on that pillow where I use to lay
I just might be the best damn thing, that you ever threw away
I just might be a soft caress, that you wish was still around
Just a little happiness, you were lucky that you found
I might be that one I love you, that you meant but wouldn't say
