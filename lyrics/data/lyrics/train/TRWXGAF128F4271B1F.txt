If I have send a message like a whisper on the breeze
Reckon it's no wonder that it never got to me
'Cos I'm down here in Kentucky, where the sun don't ever shine
The wind don't blow in a hollow deep as mine

Oh, if I raise my eyes and look straight up at the sky
I can see the clouds rolling by
Well, they're there and then they're gone
...
