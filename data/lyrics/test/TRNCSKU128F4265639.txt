Anthony works in the grocery store
Savin' his pennies for someday
Mama Leone left a note on the door
She said
"Sonny, move out to the country."
Oh but workin' too hard can give you

You oughta know by now
Who needs a house out in Hackensack?
Is that all you get for your money?

And it seems such a waste of time
If that's what it's all about
Mama, if that's movin' up then I'm movin' out.
