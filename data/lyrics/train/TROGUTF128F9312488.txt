Ladies and Gentlemen
Introducing
T-Nutty

[Chorus: x3]
Oh my goodness
T-Nutty is heated
He can't be defeated
I can not believe this

See nigga I'm heated like that
heater talking like walking thermostat

[Verse 1]
Imma make a simple statement
Here's the latest sense you waited
Congradulations you found the greatest
Dropping shit like I'm constipated
Consentrated on stacking my mail
The Populations got it cracking with sales
For my occupation I'm high with patients
If I'm not mistaken I'm leaving a trail
Following me now like All of me pals
If you refuse to do the opposite
Niggaz gonna hop in a gown
I'm lockin it down
On the westcoast ain't no stopping it
With the best flows got bitches jockin it
At the next show cuz I be rocking it
Ima the best Loc its my prorogitive
If I'm strapped with a glock and I'm cocking it
and ya not convienced I'm bout to get the victim
this is whatcha wanted
