So you feel that i'll leave you
that i'll change my mind and walk away
but i found you
so i'll bake you
a chocolate cake
do you know that i love you
by the way i look into your mind
i surrender my heart
with a teary eye
take your hands
and place them all around my ears
Take my heart
and hook it up to your face
we're as one
you and me
a silly man
So my dear
please forgive me
