Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Anytime you want it
Girl just get up on it

Ooh, girl you're so fine
Can I get a minute of your time?
I wanna get to know ya
Maybe later on up in my crib
I'll get to show ya
You're blowin' my mind
You're one of a kind
Heard you like to get your freak on
Let's get it on

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Anytime you want it
Girl just get up on it
