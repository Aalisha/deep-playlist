Ripped and torn
My temple of flesh I defile
Carnal scorn
Angels mourn as spiritual winds of malice blow

Celestial light will shine on me no more
Let the darkness consume me
Embrace the wisdom of the fallen from grace
I let it guide me
Confront me not with your righteous ways
His sacraments are forgotten
I brand myself in deepest spite
Towards everything that you represent

Mutilate - Self-hate
The soothing of a hungry blade
...
