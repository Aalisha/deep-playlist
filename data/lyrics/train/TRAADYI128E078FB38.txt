(Chorus: Mr. Cheeks)
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night
All my ladies and mens this evening
We can do this all night

(Mr. Cheeks)
It's my first night in this spot
I can't front people jump okay it's rather hot
I'm with my brother, while roll he went and got the mole
He said he'll meet us at the party, yeah we just did the show
Now all my peeps is on the floor and they bouncin
The Lost Boyz is in the house, they're announcing (announcing)
We getting lifted with these honeys that we just met
They're dime pieces but ain't slidin with us yet
We gots to get our stroll on, hit the floor once
See eye to eye, he's on his way, he's bringin more pound
No need for my team to front in profile
Two shorties flirtin with Freaky Tah and B-Wild
I see my niggaz in suit, and he's chattin with
This genuine fine ass man (ass man)
Yo kid, I love it when my mind is in the right mist
If you with me throw your elves up like this
Everybody now
