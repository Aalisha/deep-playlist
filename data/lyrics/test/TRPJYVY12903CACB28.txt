Once again your eyes
Make it hard to say goodbye
So I'll just keep driving
Where you wanna go
It doesn't really matter
As long as you are here with me
With me
With me

Whoooa
There's something in the air tonight
Something that makes me feel alive
And I said whoooa
What were the words that you said to me
That made me feel so special now

Once again your eyes
Make it hard to ask you why
So I sit here knuckles tight
Hands against the wheel
