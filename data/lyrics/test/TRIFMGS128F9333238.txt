*howls*

Who's that I see walkin' in these woods?
Why it's Little Red Ridin' Hood

Hey there Little Red Riding Hood
You sure are lookin' good
You're everything a big bad wolf could want

Listen to me, Little Red Ridin' Hood
I don't think little big girls should
Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone

*howls*

What big eyes you have
The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad
...
