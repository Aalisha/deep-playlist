I got my swimcap and comb and my paperback book that I'm almost through
I got my lipstick and mirror and my suntan lotion and my cam'ra too.
I got my beach bag full of all the necessary items for a day in the sun

And of course it wouldn't be like me if I didn't bring along -
Some sunglasses
mmm
to hide behind. Sunglasses
mmm
to cry behind.
Sunglasses
mmm
to die behind.
Dear
while I lie and cry and sigh and hurt and watch you while you flirt
