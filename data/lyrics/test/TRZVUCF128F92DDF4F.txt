It hurt me so
To see you cross the floor
Kissing her (kissing her)

You didn't see me
But I saw you and
It hurt me so (it hurt me so)

It hurt me so bad
When I tried to cry
To ease my hurt inside
But I tried in vain
'Cause the tears never came

I'm too hurt to cry
And too much in love to say goodbye
