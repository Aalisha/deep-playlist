little old man, little old man staring down the road
waiting on the bus, he's getting kinda cold
bus finally gets there, he got nowhere to sit down
and the driver said, "you can stand right here behind me or wait for the next one to come around"
and the old man says, "that's okay, i'll stand
i might look like a little old man to you
but i've been riding this bus for years and years and years
i don't even know where it's going to"
and the driver says, "you don't know where this bus is going to?"
old man says, "no, i don't, do you?"
driver says, "you don't know where this bus is going to?"
old man says, "i just want it to get me through
hey, i'm staying on the ride, it's gonna take me somewhere
staying on the ride, it's gonna take me somewhere
somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere"
