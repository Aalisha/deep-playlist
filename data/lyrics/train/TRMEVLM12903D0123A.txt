Oh my God
Oh my God
If only he knew
If only he knew
If only he knew about the world without the bullshit and the lies
We could've saved him.
They could've saved me.
But instead I'm here drowning in my own fucking mind
And I'll be damned if you're the death of me.

Blood and ink stain the walls.
Silently with bloodied knuckles, I carry on
Hoping it's not too wrong.
You said the nights were far too long.
'Honey, it's just the start of it.'

Oh my God.
If only he knew.
Oh my God.
If only he knew.
If only he knew!
If only he knew.

Just stand up and scream.
