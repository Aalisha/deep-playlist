Stealin' time, I've been stealin' time
But I don't feel guilty, cause the time was mine
I kept down low, kept down low
I walked right out, I had to let it go.

Stealin' time, I've been stealin' time
Forgot about everything and eased my mind
Stealin' time, I was stealin' time
But now I know it's time to cross that line.

I watched the sky, watched the sky
Every day I let the world roll by
Sun and rain, sun and the rain
It felt so good to know that magic again.
