Slut down, you got to treat them right
Dispatch the boys and leave her spread on site
Slut down, she's not the guilty type
She'll make her rounds
And call you moaning in spite

Daddies little superficial heart attack
(This emotional brat can't feel emotion)
Emotion I lack
Because your sex is a diversionary past time
(And your looks are only temporary)
Am I dead or sleeping?

Man down, just pull yourself upright
With your knack for class it'll be just fine
Man down, don't kid your self big guy
Impending doom is your calling in life

And how far is failure from the starting line?
With legs like that I see why
