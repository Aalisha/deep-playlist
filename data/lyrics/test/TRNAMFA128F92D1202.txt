Let's have a real good time, yeah, yeah
Some people don't know what it means
To have a real, real good time

Say it son, see I remember long time ago, yeah
My mother told me, she said son, son
She said son, son, son no matter where you go
Try to have yourself a real, real good time

So I thought tonight would be a fine time
For you and I to get together
And clap your hand like this
One, two, three, four

Have a real good time, have a real
We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a good time
...
