Hey baby, I guess you're wondering
What I'm doing home so soon
Naw, I ain't sick
It's just, this morning when you told me
You didn't feel like you were the most
Important thing in my life anymore
Well that broke my heart
So I had to turn around and come back
And tell you what I'm gonna do about it

I'm gonna light the bedroom candles
Take the phone out of the wall
We can lay around and talk for hours
Or maybe we won't talk at all
...
