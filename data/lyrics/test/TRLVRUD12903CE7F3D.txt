Just sit back and. Relax.
Listen to the 8-track
I'll dig you like an old soul record

Remember back in the day
When everyone was black and conscious.
And down for the struggle.
Love brought us all together.
Just sittin' back and talkin'.
Cultivating a positive vibe.
Blue lights in the basement.
Freedom was at hand and you could just taste it.
