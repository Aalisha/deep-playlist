I see that its not clear
For you good buddy so clean out your ears
So listen very closely while I pop my game
Cause my name's in the Hall of Fame

The K-U-R, the T-I-S
The first is the best I must confess
The B-L-O and the W
Makes you wanna catch the boogaloo flu

Now, If your name is Annie
Get up off your fannie
If your name is Clyde
Get off your backside
If you name is Pete
You don't need a seat

Cause i'm Kurtis Blow and i'm on the go
I'm rocking to the beat in stere-ery-ooh!

Now just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if your ready like Freddie to rock real steady
Somebody say, "Oh yeah!"
