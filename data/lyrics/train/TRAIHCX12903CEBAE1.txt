My girlfriend´s friend J. Arnell

Oh yes she´s looks so good to me Oh my she suits me to a T
You should see the way she smiles at me Everytime that my girlfriend can´t see
Oh well I know that it´s wrong But love keeps comin´ on strong
Tell me what can a poor boy do When his heart is breakin´ in two
Oh I´m dreamin´ ´bout my girlfriend´s friend
It´s been goin´ on since way back when
And though I know it must come to an end
I am dreamin´ ´bout my girlfriend´s friend
