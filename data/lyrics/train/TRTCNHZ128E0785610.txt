V.1
Sing to me beauty let your voice lead the way
And in your words I'll find the things I could not say
Oh how I've longed to write a love song just for you
But on my own I've found it's just another thing I couldn't do

Whisper the reason when the sun just hides away
How do the seasons know exactly when to change
Who on earth could find a language or a line
Or count the ways to best describe the beauty found in your design?
