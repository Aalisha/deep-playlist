Baby don't you wanna cry
'cause I really need to
and I really miss you
Oh baby I'm a lady
oh baby oh baby
Well you haven't got much to say
uh uh just take me to the garden
I know there's a way
See that woman sitting over there in the corner
she sleeps with many candles around her bed
once the night's getting old 
and you really wanna tell her
she'll find the light and run all the way back home
From mystic eyes she looks at you if she wants to
but never will they tell you what's ahead
and though she may be cold 
she doesn't wanna hurt anyone
she just wants to live a life of her own
...
