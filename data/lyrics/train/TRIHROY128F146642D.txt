Reap the wild wind
Reap the wild wind

Reap the wild wind

A finger points to show a scene
Take my hand, take my hand
Another face where mine had been
Take my hand, take my hand
Another footstep where I once walked
Take my hand, take it all

You take my hand and give me your friendship
I'll take my time and send you my slow reply
