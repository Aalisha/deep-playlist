And I knew you'd come walking up the middle of the street
Like a ball of fire giving off heat
And I was standing there in my lace of flames
My fingers on fire embers all around

As the walls fell your hands found me in the fog
I heard people talking in that secret dialogue
More's going on than meets the eye
And I'm trying to decipher the lies

Bah bah da da da
'Cause I was going under and you saved me
Now I owe it all to you
I was going under and you saved me

My bittersweet my bitter blue
...
