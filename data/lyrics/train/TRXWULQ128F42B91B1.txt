(Yeah, New Shit)

(Verse 1:)
I got plans for you and me
We both need to move on
Cuz you aint what i need
It took some time for me to find out
I didnt sign up for misery
And no we can't work it out
Things ain't the same way that they used to be
Cuz you don't feel for me no more

(Chorus:)
I got some new clothes, new kicks
I got a new crib, new whip
All your drama, I don't miss
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit
I cant believe I was with you
All the pain that i went through
I sing a new song, new hit
I'm so over you boy
I'm on some new shit

(Verse 2:)
