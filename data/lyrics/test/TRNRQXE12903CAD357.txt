Maybe I misunderstood
A part of your story
But I believe you're no good
I'd say you're even quite boring

Altough I pay you no mind
I can't stand you much longer
Still it's giving me time
And it's making me stronger

Man your life is a lazy mess
You don't relate to the things that I like best
I know you're idle and cheating you're fake and deceiving
Though everything always seems cool

Man I just want you to know
That when you're making me worry
