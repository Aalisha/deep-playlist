I was born to be with you
I was born by the way
Born to betray
I was born to be with you

I was born to be with you
I was born disinclined
Out of kindness or mind
I was born to be with you

I believe that everyone can find their perfect match
Millions are lonely, uninvolved and unattached
You can count me among them if you can find me at all
The man in the moon used to say I was born to be with you

I was born to be with you
I was born prepossessed
Of your worst and your best
I was born to be with you
