Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
This time it's forever
Nothing you could say will ever change that
Change that!

Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
This time it's forever
Nothing you could say will ever change that
Change that!

I gave you all I have
But you betrayed all we had
Today is gonna change
Today I'm taking it all back!

Save your breath
I don't wanna hear
