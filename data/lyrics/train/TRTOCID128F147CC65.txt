Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run

We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Nose to the wind
Shape shift
Feeling I've been
