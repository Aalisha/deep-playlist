I've got a gun and a pocket full of bullets
I'm gonna shoot you down
You've got a gun and a pocket full of bullets
You've gonna shoot me down

And then we'll both be too dead
To make love in the living room
And then we'll both be too dead
To have fun making the baby boom

I've got a gun and a pocket full of bullets
I'm gonna shoot you down
You've got a gun and a pocket full of bullets
...
