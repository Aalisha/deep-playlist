I was alright for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say 'hello'
And though you wished to me well
you couldn't tell

That I'd been
Crying over you
Crying over you
Then you said to so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying.
