Her mom says she don't want him calling
That house phone no more
Her dad told her that she should find her
Some new friends, stop always thinking about boys

But how can they possibly make her decisions?
It breaks her heart inside
Sixteen years old going through these transitions
They don't care about how hard she cries

He's just a boy, she's just a girl
Alone in this world
They're not too young for love
They'll run away together
So they won't have to answer to anyone
Who says they're too young for love?

Got a scholarship but he don't
Wanna go straight to college
'Cause she's just a junior and he's going to leave her
Her parents are making it worse

But how can they possibly make his decisions?
