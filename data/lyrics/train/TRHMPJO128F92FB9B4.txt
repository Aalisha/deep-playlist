It's not my style to crash and burn
But when you're daily in the firing line
There's not enough flowers for guns

If you're looking for love
You have to give love
And giving your love
Breeds only love

It's not my place to make you learn
But when you're blazing
In the heat of your own rage
Maybe it's time that you took

A lesson in love
...
