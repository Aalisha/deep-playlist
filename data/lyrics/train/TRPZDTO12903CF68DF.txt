Six years ago, a very hot summer night
Avenue A with my friends hangin tight
No future, no goals, and no destiny
Hangin on the corner for the world to see
Some friends drunk and some friends high
Laughing, talkin shit as the people walked by
Air was dense, muggy as fuck
Lower east side runnin amuck

Guilty by association
Judged by who I know
Can't keep all my friends outa trouble when they got no place to go
(2x)

Me drug-free in the midst of it all
...
