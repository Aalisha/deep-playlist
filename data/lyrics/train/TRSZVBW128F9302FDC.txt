A new winters coat and shoes for the wife
And a bicycle on the boy's birthday
It's just a rumour that was spread around town

But I'll be back by Christmas'
It's just a rumour that was spread around town
Somebody said that someone got filled in
For saying that people get killed in
The results of their shipbuilding
