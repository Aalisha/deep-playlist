[Trae]
I'm a asshole nigga, and I'm running the pack
I advise that you clear the set, cause I'm about to attack
It's been a lot of niggaz hating, on the shit that I'm bringing
But fuck what you talk, Guerilla niggaz perfect with aiming
I'm bout to lean on the market, trying to leave me for dead
Cause all that hopping fire with Trae, will get your bitch ass bled
So everyday it be the same, it's just me and my dogs
Back then I couldn't focus, I was blinded by the fog
And Donnie I ain't forgot you, ain't a damn thang changed
It's SK to the death, I'm still repping the game
So I'ma ride for the team, when I fuck up the game
And now the whole Spring Branch, fin to respect the name
And it hurt, when the judge said 1 to the 5
If they ever let you free, I hope I'll still be alive
Why these bitch ass niggaz, wanna see me a goner
See I'ma swing from the heart, and slip they ass in a coma
They don't want it how I'ma give it, I mean what I say
And I say what I mean, they bout to see me strapped with a beam
