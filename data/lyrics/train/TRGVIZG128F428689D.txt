I'm trying hard not to say what I really feel 
I wouldn't dare to 
Don't want to scare you
The truth is I'm still afraid to say three words 
So I sit tight-lipped 
Let me try to spell it out

Not sure that I've got enough letters to express what I'm trying to say to you
I'm holding out for the triple word score
But I'm sure that nothing could be better than me and you 
...
