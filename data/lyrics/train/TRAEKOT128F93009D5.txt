It's a chemical love
that shines deep within cause i don't know about
sentimental love
the kind that you find when you're open and out

a special kind of love
that soothes my sides fits me right like a glove
i never want to know
what real life feels like

there's a chemical reaction rolling through my mind
you can tell me that i'm crazy maybe i've been blind
but there's only one simple thing i'm trying to find:
peace down in my soul

there's a chemical reaction rollin' through my head
you can tell me that i'm lazy maybe i've been dead
but i've never found a better way or something said
...
