I shoulda known better not to wait around
Why did I come home, cause I hate it here
I shoulda known better not to wait around
I'm getting rid of my phone, and I made it clear
I shoulda known better not to wait around

Never did, never did I ever love anyone other than you
But secretly I always want to see you cry
So I push you until you do

Check it out
I shoulda never came, I shoulda never
Shoulda never came but you insisted for (you insisted for) me to (me to)
Crossed the line, didn't mean to
Take it back if I thought it'd make it work
Never did but I meant to, I, I, I give up...

I never did what you said that I did when I was gone for so long
