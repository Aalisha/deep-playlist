I can still recall the time
Sitting in the sand
And watching breakers
As they roll upon the shore

You just walked right up to me
Having asked around
You had no takers
To take you far away from here

Then I come along to hold your hand

Everything is up and it's all right
'Cause I feel the engine
Pulling us towards a new day's light
Everything is down and it's okay
'Cause I hear the engine humming
And it's taking us away
