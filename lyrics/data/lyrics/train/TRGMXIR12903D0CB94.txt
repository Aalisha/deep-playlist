Give it a chance
We can love again

In my crazy world
I gave you everything you wanted babe
You said you loved me
I Said I loved you too
Even in the craziest times
When we fault we made love
I held you closely
You opened up your heart to me

Time after time we dealt with it
This time I know were see it through
You'll always be the one for me
Baby girl I'm feeling you
Time after time we dealt with it
This time I know were see it through
You'll always be the one for me
Baby girl I'm feeling you


Oo oo we're moving to fast
Trying to get through
Like walking on broken glass
Just shoo and move
is all the things of the past
Give it a chance
We can love again

We can work it out
We can work it out
Give it a chance
We can love again (love again)
Give it a chance
We can love again (love again)

Don't be hasty girl
Cos when I'm gone you miss me
Don't try to push me
Cos you are my babyboo
Tell me what I've done
