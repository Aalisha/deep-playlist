Night after night, day after day
I pass by the house that once was my home
I'm lookin' for something to knock out the lights till the sun comes up shining like new
The chill in my bones just reminds me that life isn't fair and nobody cares
About lost souls surviving on hard knocks and vice
In a world just as nasty as your world is nice... baby blue

You don't know how much I hate everything about you
