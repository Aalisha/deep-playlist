I wanna thank you
For every time you tried
To get the best of me inside
How many times I compromised

I don't do this for the glory
Or for what people might say
I'm gonna do this my own way
Starting today

There's nothing that you can tell me
I'll show you I was born ready

And I say, ay yo
Rise up, let me see your head high
And if you're with it, put your hands up in the sky
La la, di di da, di di di, da di da
Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo, ay yo

And I'm gon' rock it to the fullest in this life
So I'ma give it all I got before I die
La la, di di da, di di di, da di da
Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo

Every woman has a purpose
Nothing happens by chance
...
