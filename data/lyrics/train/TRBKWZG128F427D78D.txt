I was hanging with some friends
In the parking lot one night near the summer's end
I leaned back against the glass
Of a car to watch all those speeding comets crash
It made me think about us

Truly truly truly I want you
Truly truly truly I do

You were lying by the pool
And the surface of the water was a lapis jewel
I dove in to make a splash
Woke ya from your dream nodding off out on the grass
It made me think about us
