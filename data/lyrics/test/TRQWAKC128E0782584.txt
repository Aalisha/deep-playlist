I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready lord
Walking to Babylon with my gun

I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready lord
Walking to Babylon with my gun
I want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready lord
Walking to Babylon with my gun
Brother Rasta is dead
Listen everybody says, "They shoot Brothers Rasta dead"
Bragging boys in blue
They shot him through (They shoot Brothers Rasta dead)
Tonight's the night
We're gonna have a big fight (They shoot Brothers Rasta dead)
