Let me tell you a story
About two kids in the city
See they both have a problem with life
And it isn't very pretty

There's a kid called Timmy
He used to be pretty witty
But then too many rides on the horse
Got him hooked and it's a pity

Cause now he's got a monkey
He's got a monkey can't fight it
Monkey
On his back he can't deny it
Monkey
He found a dragon that bites
A hole in his arm at night
Where all the money goes

Monkey, monkey on his back
Monkey, monkey on his back
...
