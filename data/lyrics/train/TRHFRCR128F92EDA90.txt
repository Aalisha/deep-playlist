Sweat drips in my eyes
Screams of lust we cry
Tonight, you are, everything
You're everything...
You're everything to me

No more as I wake
From this perfect dream...
I'll escape from Eden's walls
Can I not stay and live this lie?
For I must think only of myself

And to think that you will not be scared
Or surprised I severed all these ties
This is the end
...
