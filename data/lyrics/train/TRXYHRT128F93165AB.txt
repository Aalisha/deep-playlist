I see you, girl, walking over here
Can't look away
I see you left a trail of broken hearts
On your way to me

I try to not let it show
But I know that you know, yeah

You break me down every time you make a move
Without a sound, girl, you make me come unglued
And I don't know what you did to me
And I don't care what the doctors say

'Cause no matter what you do
I can't stay away from you, oh, oh
I can't stay away from you, oh, oh
...
