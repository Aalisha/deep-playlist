Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Look how long they brought us down here
Have us in bondage right through these years
Fussing and fighting among ourselves
Living down here it's like living in hell, I say
Get up and fight for your right my brothers
Get up and fight for your right my sisters
