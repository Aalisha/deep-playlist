I still feel the pain the darkness of yesterday
The clouds that held no rain
Illusions remain and memories mock the truth
But God can break these chains
This day comes but once I live or I lose remember

No matter where we've been
No matter what we've done
Today can be our once in a lifetime
For yesterday is gone
Tomorrow may not come
This moment is our once in a lifetime
...
