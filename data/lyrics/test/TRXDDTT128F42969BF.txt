Well, you know you're gonna have to steal it,
If you want your cake and eat it, too
There is no one less believin',
Than the guy who's been deceiving you

You got to pay the piper,
In the end you will be so much wiser
Got to use your best endeavor,
When you're kissing to be clever

'Cause it's a hard, hard lesson,
That you're gonna learn,
On the river of no return

You been burnin' all your bridges,
Like a child with forty wishes,
On the river of no return
