I don't wanna believe you anything you say
But I know it's true what I'm hearing from you
'cause the truth hurts
no babe, don't lie to me

Tell me everything I need to hear
dont' lie to me
No more little white lies in my ear

I can't control what I'm feeling,
it changes from day to day
But I know you're thinking 'bout breaking my heart and I cry:

just don't lie to me
...
