I don't know where to begin
Feel a cleaving in my mind
I can't get my act together
Buzz in my head is too loud
I know something's wrong with me
It's starting to burn out my soul
But I feel so weird in here
When you just sit, listen and nod

All my life
I've been trying to deny and deceive myself

Sense of insecurity
Restlessness
