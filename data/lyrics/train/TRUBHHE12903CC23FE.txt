Can I get away?
Get away from you.
Cos your broken edge is what told the truth.
Standing: in the corner you start facing the wall alone.
Shaking: you crawl away.
But by now you've been so consume.
You gave it up for a dirty dime a dozen now you're layin in the corner so lonely.
Locked up. Locked down.
So down and out.
