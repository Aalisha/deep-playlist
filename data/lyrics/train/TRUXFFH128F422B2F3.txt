Every night when you go out walking
Every step you take keeps me yearning for some more
Those green cat-eyes pull me down inside
And yo jelly liyups can't push me away, no (note: what the hell is a liyup? )

'cause baby, when we're alone
Everything's alright
And baby, right or wrong
Lemme give ya some lovin' all my own

That's all I want, you know it's all I need
You know that one thang that brings me to my knees
That's all I want, you know thats all I need
Is to call you
