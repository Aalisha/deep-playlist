Blessed are your eyes that have seen
And your ears that have heard these wonderful words
(Wolde wolde wolde wolde)
Yea, dem a fight against Rastaman philosophy

Yes their mind all dressed in dem pride and vanity

So don't let them fill up your vocabulary
With a whole lot of things and them no necessary
Yes, give us the teachings of His Majesty
One and all got to face this reality
Say we all got to face this reality
