I've got a reason
And it sounds like this
Everything has it's season
Well let's bless it with a kiss babe

I'll be there for you
I'll be your rainy day man
Everytime the devil laughs out loud
When we make our big plans

And you might come to realize
What you haven't missed yet
When everyone's searching for fortune and fame
It's been right in front of you all of the time

Everything comes round and round
What goes up must soon come down
Just remember this my friend
The next time that it looks like rain

I heard a rumbling
It was a frightening sound
We thought the world was crumbling
It was just our wheels spinning round

You might see more action
Born in another age
