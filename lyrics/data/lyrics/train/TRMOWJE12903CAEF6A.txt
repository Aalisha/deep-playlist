The challenger from a future time
sentenced to the past for a forgotten crime
They'll perish him for the perfect rights
down through the years past time and space

Through the stargate, time and space collapse
... fly above the mist
time ports them to their trash

The jury ends all the second breed
Robots, powered by piston steam
The spectacles fly into sea
New Eliminators of atlantis - B.C.

War spilled in the funeral times
Traited powders cross acid lines
...
