I can't explain what I don't understand
Time slipping through my hands
As the seconds turn to yesterdays

I think that in my world it's so serene
I'm driven by a dream
One night when we're alone again

Feeling's getting closer each day
This setting's now the right time to say

I just wanna lay down beside you
Be naked where you sleep
Sing you a love song
That makes your body weak

I can promise all of my tomorrows
My love for you today
I'll give you everything
...
