“This is the middle of the road”

Well since our separation you have taken up with thee
They tell you just how wonderful you are
Baby I have nothing but respect for you
I would never try to rip you off
‘Cause I know your heart still runs with mine
You're just afraid of getting soft

It's a long, long way to the middle
The middle of the road
Well, it's summer time in California
I never felt so cold
It's a long, long way to the middle
The middle of the road
But I still love you baby
Why don't you come on home?
