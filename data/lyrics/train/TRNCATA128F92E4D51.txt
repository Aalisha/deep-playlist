i'm looking for a reason why i see no shooting stars tonight
just a sign that everything's alright to quiet me, to quiet me
maybe all i hoped was wrong maybe all i dreamed is gone
maybe i was stupid all along for trying it, for trying it

but i believed in what you said
i trusted in your summer
now the leaves are turning red
and soon they'll all be coming down
how can i go on
if hope is what keeps me alive
and i'm so uncertain
...
