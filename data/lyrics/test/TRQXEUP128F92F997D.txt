Dirty old river, must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy, make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright

And I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Every day I look at the world
From my window
But chilly, chilly is the evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie, Waterloo Station
Every Friday night
