You're the wonder and the mystery
You're the melody that must be sung
We rejoice with all those who believe
You're the song that was and is to come

Glory is rising
Yeah glory is rising
Beautiful beautiful the sound
Of redemption's song
Moving through the crowd
Singing great is our god
Your children crying out
