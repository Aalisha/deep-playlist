It seems that my wounds have begun to heal
And so I return to my mark,
I brush by the grave of another man,
Oh but here I stand.this battle I command then bang.
My legs stumble and fall, shot, I've not been here before.

Why when I'm close to someone.must it always go wrong

I think that bullet just hit my heart, I'm bleeding fast it's more then wounded me,
I think that bullet dug deep, so deep, the last shot hurt, but this ones killing me.

So I bleed in the reach of the fatherland,
Ohh my uniform, it soaks up the mud, my red driven cause
As artillery falls,
