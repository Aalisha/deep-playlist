Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
Don't you worry, you be strong, help you get along
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
He don't deserve a woman like you, woman you are
You never knew that goodbye could hurt so much
Till the morning he told you he was going away
He lied to you, mistreated you, he even raised his hand to you
You weathered the storm, but ended up in the rain
It's driving you crazy, you're wondering maybe
Think it's something you did wrong
You carried his baby, but now, now, now, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?
You were so strong
The sun's gonna shine again, it won't be long
Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
