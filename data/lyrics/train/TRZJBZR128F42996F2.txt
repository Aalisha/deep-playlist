I feel things changing when I move
(Its a distance, Its a difference)
I'll cross this planet without you
(and you might call this a downfall)
Its one long night that I'm passing through
(Its a dark one what have I done)
Its one long night...

Don't turn your back on me now
You can't do this
Don't say you can live without
You can't do this alone
How did I end up like this, the lonely one,
Your greatest take down?

You take me down
