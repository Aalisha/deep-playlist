Say goodbye 'cause i'm leaving forever
i'm done walking over your coals
well, i'm tired of playing games
don't judge me

you think we changed 'cause we're playing this sound?
we change minds
while we're tearing it down
what the fuck is it you stand for?
i'm walking out while you're closing the door

fuck off

they polarize us with their h-a-t-e
everyone knows this ain't a democracy
can't cover up the negligence that we've seen
we lose 'cause you would rather die than be free

defense, ignorance
...
