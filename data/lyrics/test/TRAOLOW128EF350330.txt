What's the spring breathing jasmine and rose?
What's the summer with all its gay train?
What's the splendor of autumn to those
Who've bartered their freedom for gain?

Let the love of our land's sacred rights
To the love of our people succeed
Let friendship and honor unite
And flourish on both sides the Tweed

No sweetness the senses can cheer
...
