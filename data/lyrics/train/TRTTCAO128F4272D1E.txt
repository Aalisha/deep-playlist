Down, down, down, down, be-doo, be-doo
Down, down, down, down, be-doo, be-doo

He lives in my neighborhood
When he walks by, he looks so good
Wanna get to know him (oh yeah)
Wish that I could show him (I care)

I wanna love him so bad
You know it´s drivin´ me mad
¥Cause when I look in his eyes
I can see in paradise
So I can´t help it
I wanna love him so bad
(Love him so bad)
