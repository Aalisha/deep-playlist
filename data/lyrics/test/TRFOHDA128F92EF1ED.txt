When I picture your face before me I just see a scar
Yes I know when I swallow this medicine in the dark
When I picture your face before me I just see a scar
Yes I know when I swallow this medicine in the dark

I was staying with you forever despair is in your heart
Yes I know when I swallow this medicine in the dark
Yes I know when I swallow this medicine in the dark
