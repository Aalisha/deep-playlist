Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come
The Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine
Now Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day
...
