Your tongue is a dagger
And I am bleeding
My faded dreams were all for you

And with one word
And with just one word
Choking the life
I breathe my last
And with one look
And with just one look
You hold the key to this heart of glass

This is the withering
I'm aging years in moments
This is the path that leads
To my demise

Your tongue is a dagger
And I am bleeding
...
