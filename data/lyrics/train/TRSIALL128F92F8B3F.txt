Life has given me the, me the creeps
I need you to make, to make, to make me weak
I have made my world my own, I've made it my own
And I have never been so alone

I can't stop my brain from moving
In an awful direction Lord
I can't stop my hands from doing
What I don't want to do anymore
I've been wrong
I've been right
But tonight
I just wanna be yours

I'm planning this out
