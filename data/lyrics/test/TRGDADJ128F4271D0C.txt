I remember when I told you
I would try in every way
To hold you, and love you And kiss you and keep you Till my dying day
You just laughed
Said you found somebody new
Someone to make me Forget about you
And now you tell me that your new love
Isn´t true Like he should be
You say you´re gonna forget him and you´re gonna come back to me
But things have changed
I got me somebody new
Someone to make me Forget about you
I´m telling you
That it´s too late To say you´re sorry
It´s too late To say you´re mine
I have found myself a new love
And I´m gonna make her mine
It´s too late
