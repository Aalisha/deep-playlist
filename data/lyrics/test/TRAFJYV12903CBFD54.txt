Rushing up in the middle of nowhere.
Bulldog doing wakeup calls.
Dark morning bad wolfs are howling.
Ready set go!

Get a-moving, get a-rolling, hit the action.
Non stop hell ride rendezvous.
Speeding up can you hear us coming
through to your neigbourhood.

There's no safe corner Wig Wamania's everywhere.
Rocking through the air.

Back on the rodeo.
Back on tour extreme.
Losing all sense of sanity.
Back on the rodeo.
Chasing gypsy dreams.
Racing time on these nameless streets.
Back on the rodeo.
In the dare devil heat.
