Who is she?
this beautiful creature
insisting on being alone?
it would all make sense
if you could hear her on the phone:

hello, who's there?
oh no
how'd you find me
I gotta go
don't wanna hear
another lie
you tell me that you love me
and you promise that you'll change
you broke my heart
this time we're through
now say goodbye

say goodbye
say goodbye
it's too late to give it one more try
...
