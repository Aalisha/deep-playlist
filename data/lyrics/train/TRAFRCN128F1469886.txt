written by Julia Fordham

I want to call you baby
And you to take care of me
I want to call you baby, baby

God help me
I don't know what's right anymore
I'm robbed of reason in my blind
hurry to your door
Blessed is the blend that's racing
through my veins
And troubled is the mind that brings me
back to earth again
...
