Flash a smile
Like an alligator
Move her hips
Like a generator

All over town
Like an oil spill
If there's meat on the bone
She'll wag her tail

I'm checkin' out
To the heavens above
Punched in the teeth
Teeth by love

Punched in the teeth
Teeth by love
Punched in the teeth
Teeth by love

Construction work
It's silicone
Lights are on
But no one's home

She's painted blue
...
