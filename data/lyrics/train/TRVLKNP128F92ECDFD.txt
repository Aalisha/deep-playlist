One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go.
And if you will stay here with me
Then we will always know.

We will find out
As we change about.
Is this the last part?
Here is when we shout:

One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go.
These days await if we believe
I'll make it to the show.

We will find out
As we change about.
Is this the last part?
Here is when we shout:

And you could say, "Your love to me,"
...
