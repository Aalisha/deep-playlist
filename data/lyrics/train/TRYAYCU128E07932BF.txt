I like the feel of your name on my lips
And I like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss
And the way your fingers run through my hair
And how your sent lingers when you are not even there

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two hour baths
How you convince me to dance in the rain
With everybody watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Oh baby, Strong and wild
Slow and easy
Heart and soul
So completely
