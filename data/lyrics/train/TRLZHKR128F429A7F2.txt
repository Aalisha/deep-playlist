Searching for something
When I discovered you
You fill me up with fire
And I crashed on the rocks of desire
And you picked me up
With your hand
And made me feel like a man

And all this when I met you

When I was cold
And feeling shot through
With heartache I was naked
And then I fell true
But just as I was drowning
And blue
