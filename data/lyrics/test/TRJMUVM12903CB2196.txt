Here is salvation
Between vacant walls of sleep
An thus I carry the light
From the valleys of Sodom
To the Golgotha rise

Here is perdition
In front of wailing walls
I need it's stench to breathe
Fucking all it's sacred holes

Sulphur
Guide me through
These temples
Pulsing through

Lord
It burns
Throughout this darkness
The tender white
In endless black
It burns the world

Lord
Let them eat glass again
Let them chew it to tiny pieces
These are the greatest of all pains
...
