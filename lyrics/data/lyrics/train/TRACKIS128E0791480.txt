The blade of my knife
Faced away from your heart
Those last few nights
It turned and sliced you apart
This love that I tell
Now feels lonely as hell
From this padded prison cell

So many times I said
You'd only be mine
I gave my blood and my tears
And loved you, cyanide
When you took my lips
I took your breath
Sometimes love's better off dead

You're all I need
Make you only mine
(I loved you)
So I set you free
I had to take your life

(You're all I need)
