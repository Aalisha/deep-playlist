From the very first moment you caught my eye
You were like nothing i've ever seen in my life 
I caught your attention as you passed me a smile
You bought me a drink 
We talked for a while 
'bout amazing things 
Of what life brings
Then we kissed and said goodbye
CHORUS: 
I'll get over you 
Don't think you can get me down 
'cause i've been on lower ground 
...
