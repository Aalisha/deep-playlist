Yes, no, maybe
Is all I need to hear from you
As things go crazy
She's lost herself and lost to you
And now that nothing's spoken
She's out there on the ice again
She's breaking down slowly
Colliding as she holds your hand

You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know, who'll be there for you
You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know, who'll be there for you
