bling~~bling, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...
uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm...
flash back to a mid-west town... in a time of renaissance, an innocent child
saturdays and soul train
music feeds a budding mind
pain and glory on your FM dial
just a little girl in a big world (big world)
hiding in the shadow of the light
just a little girl in a big world (big world)
ohhh listen to the voice of your divine
moma, in that big o' lincoln
fryin' fish good to the bone
two baby girls ouu ouu she did it alone
did it alone, did it alone...
daddy in that big o'sky, ran fast
...
