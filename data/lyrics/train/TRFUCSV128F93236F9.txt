I call it preview
cause that was just a preview

I'm in my zone
I'm really in the zone
this place is full of plastic face
i call him sillicone, cone, yeah
and I think I miss my home
I think they kinda miss me too
but the love is really shown
no, cos I ain't talkin bout my family
talkin bout some real friends
...
