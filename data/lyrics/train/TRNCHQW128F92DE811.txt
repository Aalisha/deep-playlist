Bet you never had nobody like this
Had lipstick kiss like this
Girls come with the drop of a dime
But their candies ain't quite like mine

See I got this little thing that I do
If you were my man I would do it to you
Thanks for the drink but you better move
'Cause I'm up in here with two

And I'm the shit with the shit, shawty
I'm the shit with the shit, shawty
I'm the shit with the shit, shawty
I'm the shit with the shit

I know what I'm doin' with this shit
'Cause I'm the shit with the shit, shawty
I'm the shit with the shit shawty
I'm the shit

Mmm muah, mmm muah, mmm muah
Mmm muah, mmm muah, mmm muah

Now tell me what you really gonna do with that
Never seen a girl with an ass so fat
I'm not a striper but I dance like that
I'm not a striper but where the money at
