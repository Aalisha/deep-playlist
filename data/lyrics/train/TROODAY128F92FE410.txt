I'm gonna hold onto summer
As long as I can
Well, it's been a long hot summer
And I've got some news for you
'Cause it was a long hot summer
And i've made some dreams come
And I can't hardly wait
'Cause it won't be long now
Well, it's been a long hot summer
And I'm who makes that one girl mine
I'm gonna hold her
And squeeze her
And tease her
And keep her from the enemy lines
And I can't hardly wait
...
