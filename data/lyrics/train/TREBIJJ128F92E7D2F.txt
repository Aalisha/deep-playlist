why can't you see you torture me?
you're already thinking 'bout someone else,
when he comes home you'll be in his arms and i'll be gone,

but i know my day will come,
i know some day i'll be the only one

so now you wait for his spark,
you know it'll turn you on,
he's gonna make you feel
the way you wanna feel,
when he starts to lie,
when it makes you cry,

you know i'll be there,
my day will come,
...
