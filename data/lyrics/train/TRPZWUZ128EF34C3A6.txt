It's hard to have strength when there's nothing to eat
And it's hard to eat when you don't have the teeth
And how, when you lose the one thing you love
There's nothing below and there's nothing above.

I've been going through changes
I've been going through changes
I've been going through changes
With nothing at all.

It's hard to accept what you don't understand
And it's hard to launch without knowing how to land
