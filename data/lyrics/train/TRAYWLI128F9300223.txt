I'm gonna put it all behind me like
Nothing ever happened between us
Nothing ever took place between you and me, yeah
Nothin' ever happened

And if you see me walkin' down the street
I won't even recognize you
I'll just erase you from my memory
Put it all behind me

Because you are erased
All erased
