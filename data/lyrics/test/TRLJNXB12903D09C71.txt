All I want now is to be with you
Cause you know I've been everywhere else
Looking back at what you got me through
You knew me better than I knew myself

When I feel lost and I can't find my way
When words are at a loss I can hear you say

I'll be by your side, when all hope has died
I will still be around oh and I, I'm still on your side
When everything's wrong, I will still be around
