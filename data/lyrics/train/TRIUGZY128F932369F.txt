I came home this morning
Oh what a shock
When I found out my key
No longer fit my lock
Oh baby
You just go right back out there where you've been
'Cause while you were slippin' out
Oh someone else was slippin' in

I thought I was your fool
That you could count on
One was right there
When no one else is at home
But oh baby
I think I found myself a new friend
But while you were slippin' out
Oh Lord, someone else was slippin' in
