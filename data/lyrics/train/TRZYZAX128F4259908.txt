I can't ignore or hide away
You can't escape from the things that line our way
Take it, leave it, break it
Anyway you can't get back to yesterday

All I want, all I want to do
Is make you listen from now on
Stop what's going on, stop what's going wrong
You better listen from now on

Confidence, coincidence,
Call it a sin, it's just like people say
...
