Can't believe you're here now
Tiny dream come true
The answer to my prayer now
I'm so in love with you
Couldn't wait to meet you
Hope you like your name
I get the funny feeling
Life will never be the same

Safe and sound
You're here with me now
Like I hoped you'd be
Safe and sound
You're here with me now
And that's all I'll ever need
