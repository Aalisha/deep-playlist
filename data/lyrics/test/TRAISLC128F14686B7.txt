BETTER DAYS

Silver gray hair neatly combed in place.
There were four generations of love on her face.
She was so wise, no surprise passed her eyes
She'd seen it all.

I was a child, oh, about three or four.
All day I'd ask questions.
At night I'd ask more.
But whenever; she never, would ever, turn me away.

I'd say how can I be sure what is right or wrong?
And why does what I want always take so long?
Please tell me where does God live
And why won't He talk to me?

I'd say, Grandma what is love?
Will I ever find out?
Why are we so poor, what is life about?
I wanna know the answers before I fall off to sleep.
