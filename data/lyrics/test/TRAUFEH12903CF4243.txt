nihilistic conquest...
ravish your belief in god
heaps of carnage...
march through the path of scattered remnants
a gift for mankind that was heaven sent
the mortars of annihilation
these are your faithful...
dead from the writings of false scriptures
venomous supremacy...
spreads within the mind of the wicked
lust for retaliation after the fall of dawn
just to die in sight of the sun
brought to light... a cause unbeknown to them
...
