Long days and longer nights, they stretch like barren seas.
God only knows if we'll ever see home or if that home remembers me.
We have heard the sirens song and we have braved the hydras maw
A dream of glory gone too far to make a place in history ours.

Servants, strangers, heroes to ourselves
Hearts beat in rhythm as we sail
And I will not die forgotten to this world
Icons and vagabonds, the rulers of this earth

We are the dead
We are the homesick, lost and loveless
Left to live (cause we won't die)
Though stretched and broken we will rise
We are the deaf
But you will hear us sing again
...
