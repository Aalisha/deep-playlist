Denim, leather, thrash is what we are!
Bang your head against the stage
At baloffs command
Thrashing, smashing... posers on the floor!
We'll leave you on the floor, bruised and sore

Thrash is back!
Thrash is back!
Thrash is back!

Violence, mayhem, the crowd begins to slam!
Circle pitting maniacs, thrashing all around!
Louder, louder the crowd starts to scream!
Saying thrash is back with their fist in the air

Thrash is back!
