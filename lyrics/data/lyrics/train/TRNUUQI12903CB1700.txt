I need a little favor
I want some of your flavor
Come fill the space between us
It's time you sip on my Tres Rios

There's a bottle pointing right at you
Bottoms up, girl, you know what to do

Come on over, baby, I really need you
Touch me like you do, girl, I wanna feel you
Show me all your tattoos and drink my Tequila
Come on, take your clothes off, you really need to
Baby, do a sweet dance, I wanna see you
