These ghosts are good at what they do. haunting hallways floors imprinted by 24 years of footsteps. the ceiling is wearing thin and any day it could all give in. ideas based on cracked foundations. we hoped it wouldn't fall apart. but it's falling apart. it's fallen apart. wake me up and get me from this place. the devil seems happy to smile at me. i'll play the part the best i can but move on and leave him to his work at hand.
