Time is tight and money is short
River's up and the weatherman
He's calling for another storm

Pressure's on, the margins thin
Gotta figure out a fix for this awful fix I'm in
Oh mama, what am I gonna do?
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"

Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything, pray about everything
