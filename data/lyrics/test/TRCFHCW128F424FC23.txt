What what?
Where do I start, where do I begin
There's only one closet: I am Him
An Entrepreneur, doing my thing
What I call life, you're calling a sin
Into this session, confessions I bring
I'm one of the livest, minus the bling
Catch me, you can't call me stupid
My car won't start but I flow exclusive, elusive
Some don't get it
Want to talk back but they ain't got credit
Forget it, I found not to care what you think
As long as I tear it down; 
I can be younger, older, 
A whole lot colder
Hung as a horse, 
Trust I'm a soldier
It's not what I say, it's how I put it
...
