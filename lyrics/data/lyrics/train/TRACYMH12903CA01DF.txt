Cruisin' downtown
Shakin' her love
T and A talkin' to me
Felt my heart drop
Wheeled a dead stop
Girl has got me on my knees
Baby baby babe don't make me wonder
Won't you let me in
She said - see you later
Shot down
I'll be back again

Good love is all you need
But you don't wanna know
Cold blood is all you bleed
When it cools off - you tease it
