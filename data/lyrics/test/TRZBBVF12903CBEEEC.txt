You can feel the groove all over the world
You can feel the groove, yeah, all over the world
Gonna set this place on fire, really turn it on
Gonna take you higher, make you scream and shout
When we get started you can bet, there will be no standing around
Feel the music, feel the sweat, everybody's getting down
They feel the groove all over the world
You can feel the groove, yeah, all over the world
Gonna keep on movin' all night, keep it on the one
Gonna party till the daylight, till we see the sun
They'll be dancing in the rain, in the barrios, in the streets
If you think that they're insane, blame it on the funky beat
