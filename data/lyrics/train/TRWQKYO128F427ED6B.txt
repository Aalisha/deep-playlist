Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not home

I can see you
Your brown skin shinin' in the sun
You got your hair combed
back and those sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you
my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
...
