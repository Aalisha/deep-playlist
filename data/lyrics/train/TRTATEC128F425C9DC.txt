Um um well excuse me. Who is the nigga in charge over here? Who is the nigga in charge? Well I am the nigga in charge over here
Sack the quarterback to make a cheerleader cheer

I fix my funk like Thelonious Monk
Stayin' true to the game cause I ain't no punk
Never been a bitch so I don't act bitchy
Smooth on the vinyl like Lionel Richie

And for creeps who sleep you better ring the alarm clock
Don't dig what I'm kicking? You can suck on a warm cock
Originate trends, My rhymes they get paid
So making ends and beginnings

See, I'm never afraid
Of a pancake MC cause I'm flip when I sways this
Housin' motherfuckers like a real estate agent
Douse you with my lyrical liquid for this hip-hop era

So I suggest you fetch an umbrella for my reign of terror
Cause you can get your posse and your armored brigade because I am not afraid
Oh, cause I'm the type of nigga that you never forget
(What?)
And I'm the type of nigga that can shake my shit

(What?)
Cause I'm the type of nigga with nothin' to hide
What's your name?
Fat Lip from the Pharcyde and you know what's up

Well I'm dark like chocolate and flow like milk
Slicker than oil smoove like silk

Please give me some room because it's me you're gonna suffocate

The fly-ass brother is Imani the Great
You fuck with me I'll be the nigga who be slanging them dogs on
Arms like sticks hands like bricks niggas be be droppin' like logs
I used to be the nigga now the down with doin' dirt

Now I got your girl callin' when she's down with doin' work
