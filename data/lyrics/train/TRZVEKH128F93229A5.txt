There's a man dying on the side of the road
Won't make it home tonight
He was driving fast on a cellular phone
That's how he lived his life
While he was hanging by a thread
These were the final words he said

My girl turned sweet 16 today
She's beautiful, so beautiful
It might get rough sometimes; I hope she'll keep the faith
I wish I grabbed the chance to say to her
Life is too short so take the time and appreciate
