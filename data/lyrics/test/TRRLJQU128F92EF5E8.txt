Nigga we hustlers, we please our customers
Pay me or I'm a bust ya, this is my life
In the hood we funnel, dough by the bundle
I make a fucking ton folk, this is my life niggaz
Bentleys to Hummers, winters to summers
Ya can't take it from us, wit' all my ho's saying

Here without ya babe, I never wanna live without ya babe
I'm a G, we riding, we riding, we riding, we riding
Let's get to it G, we riding, we riding, we riding, we riding
Let's get to it G

This is how we do it G
I grind hard if anybody time do it's me
I'm from the hood mayne, where niggaz good slang
And they'll take ya head off for a lil' change

Was lower class, broke no cash
Had to get up off my ass and make this time pass
Wasn't fast, but it eventually came
I'm a G in the game

Street rich niggaz, born to get figgas
If you ain't starting on no team you fucking wit' us
Everything you niggaz done, I done done it twice
Me and my Hoggz nothing nice, this is my life

Nigga we hustlers, we please our customers
Pay me or I'm a bust ya, this is my life
In the hood we funnel, dough by the bundle
I make a fucking ton folk, this is my life niggaz
