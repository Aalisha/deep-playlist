A fly on the wall is looking at us
Staring off
It lays on the tongue from someone we knew
Hanging out

If there's a reason then tell me why
Has your lover left?
Try to speak before it flies
You've said enough

Arms open wide, say, "Goodbye"
You've had enough
Eyes on the road nowhere to go
Still lost

On the highest top there's life inside
...
