Lately I've been feeling
a little bit neglected.
When it comes to your ex-boyfriends,
well, I guess I'm overprotective.
But it's nothing personal
I just wanted you to tell me that you
care.

Lately I've been thinking bout'
stickin' my head in a toaster.
I never asked to take a ride
on this emotional roller-coaster
It's you that I want,
and lately it feels like you're not there.

Lately I've been contemplating
jumping in the ocean.
Sometimes even Spock would show
a little more emotion!
