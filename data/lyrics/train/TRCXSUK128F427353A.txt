When in Rome do as the Romans do
When in Rome do as the Romans do
'Cause girl you've gotta pad your bra
Then you're gonna be a real big star
He said, "When in Rome do as the Romans do"

You think there's nothing else I'd rather do
Than sit here and sell myself to you
Well boy you've got some world view
Thinking I owe my soul to you
When in Rome do as the Romans do

And I wanna say to you
And I wanna say to you
You should have tried for another's dignity
'Cause you're never, never, never
Never gonna get to me
