I feed on danger
My life is constantly at risk
The threat is just another step
I have no fear at all
I'm waiting for an ultimatum
Gonna get myself the next cold sweat

I'm high on sheer anticipation
Your finger on the trigger
I stand up

My body can endure any fucking thing
I keep turning the pressure up

My body can endure any fucking thing
