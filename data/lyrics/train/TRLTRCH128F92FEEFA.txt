Daddy, when I grow up I want to be a topless dancer so I can make lots of cash
Get up
Get it out
And groove it
In and out
And move it
Up and down
And all you got to do is
Everyone get movin'
And the rhythm will take the control
All the ladies are groovin'
All the fellers are ready to go
We're going out tonight
And it feels alright
Get up
Get it out
And groove it
In and out
And move it
Up and down
And all you got to do is
Get up
Get it out
And groove it
In and out
And move it
...
