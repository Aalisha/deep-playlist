Need, i need your love, like the flowers need the sun
To grow and reach the sky
Let us try to be as one
I need to feel your love, i need you deep inside
Put me on your rocket ship, and take me out of sight

I see stars
Can you see them too
I see stars
Can you see them
I see stars
Can you see them too
