It was the type of feeling that can't be explained
The way she moved her lips, the way it drove me insane
Now I'm left here in the wake of something more.
She made it hard to leave as she stood by the door
In a v-neck T-shirt and nothing more than
A single tear rolling down her cheek, whoa

Don't go away again,
I want to be more than a phone call at 4am.
Seems like every time you come back home
It's just to steal my heart and leave.

Don't go away again,
I want to be more than a story to tell your friends.
Seems like every time you come back home
It's just to make me fall again.

It's getting hard, I know, believe me I feel you
I can't fall asleep knowing you're not home
Is it too much to ask, can't you just pick up the phone?
