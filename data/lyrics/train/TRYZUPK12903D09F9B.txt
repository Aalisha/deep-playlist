I bet it feels so good, SO GOOD, playing it off like
you're so
misunderstood. you found your place in your comfortable
group,
hating everyone who's not like you. but tell me am i
wrong? you
stand back and tell us "YOU DON'T BELONG." sorry that's
not
your choice to choose, we'll never play by your rules.
i bet it feels
so good, SO GOOD, playing it off like you've got nothing
to lose.
