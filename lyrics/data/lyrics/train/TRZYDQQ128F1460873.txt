she got goose-egg power-chords
and a nasty 2&4
she can rock it
she can tap in 32
she can show you her tatoo
she can rock it

what good's a rock without a roll
it's a sorry lookin donut if it doesn't have a hole
she gets so hot she's infra-red
she can show you a position that's prohibited

she's got kisses like cocaine
she's got access to a plane
