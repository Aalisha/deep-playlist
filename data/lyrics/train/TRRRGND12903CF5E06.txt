Think you're about to forget what you do remember now
Pray just another style to express
Reach out for a brand new connection to crack da file you miss
Please don't tell me, don't wanna listen to
Your problem's not so big
but you know what
a real problem is?
but you know
You keep on fillin' my head with yr of bullshit, get da f**k out my way
Pray just another style to regret
Shut up, like I don't know like I don't know, you feel so f**kin' bored
Please don't tell me, don't wanna listen to
