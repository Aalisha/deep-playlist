She tries not to shatter, kaleidoscope style
Personality changes behind her red smile
Every new problem brings a stranger inside
Heplessly forcing one more new disguise

Christine, the strawberry girl
Christine, banana split lady
Christine, the strawberry girl
Christine, banana split lady

Singing sweet savages lost in our world
This big eyed girl sees her faces unfurl
