Owen, you're home
the sun set it on to the sky
With a long catapult
and the salt that he put to the side
And the tones he would push and the songs he would push to the side
When it all went a fuck in the snow that gets pushed to the side
Well your heart is a bush and it's talking too, with some size
When you already put all of the soot inside
They were already smushed with a calm steady push to the side
All that your heart finds
on with your own wife
...
