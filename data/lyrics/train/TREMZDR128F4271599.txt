Ride on these niggaz
I ride on these niggaz
I ride on these niggaz
(Ha, ha)
I ride on these niggaz

Let's get it

Super charger, the same color as PJ
(Yeah)
I got a champagne range
Big niggaz offed, I got a night-scope aim
(Bah)

Audio, video, you caught on tape
That's a way to get ya ass sent upstate
(Dayum)
In '9-AY, I took them trips down to Lauderdale
Back and forth, like Aliyah

Chances of gettin' rich is like one in a million
(Ha, ha)
Or more like two in a billion
Flashin' lights, my mind's playin' tricks on me
But the Minuteman still do tricks on me

Swear the feds just starin' at a nigga
You know, you feelin' ya heart fall into ya feet
Summertime niggaz still ridin' with the heat
Jeezy De Niro, Snowman Pacino
Real niggaz love me because I talk that lingo
