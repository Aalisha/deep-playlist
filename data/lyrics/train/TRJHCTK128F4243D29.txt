Everything Works If You Let It
Everything works if you let it.
Everything works if you let it.
Everything works if you let it.
If you let it in your heart.
Everything works if you let it.
If you let it in your heart.

She is the girl of his dreams, he wants her.
He thinks forget it.
He's got a pain in his heart
And he feels like cryin',
So lonesome for love he feels like dying.
Don't stop the dream, he can fix it,
I know he can.
He is the world's world's greatest
At the work that he does,
When he moves on down the line.
