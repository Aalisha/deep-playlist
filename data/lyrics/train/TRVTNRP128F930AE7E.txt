The moment you swam in your desperating hell
I was thinking of your fall in a desperate spell
"You're young and sane, the beauty'son
You've built your own world...' that I could break in an hour!
I've slept on iron, I've lied in misery
But I've never never caught a chance, a sign to get away
"You've got the richest soul and the purest mind"
I will never stand that, never, never!!!
Your desperation, you're desperation
Your desperation, you're desperation
Now think of this, you're my sickness
