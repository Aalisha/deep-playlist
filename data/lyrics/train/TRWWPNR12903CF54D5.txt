The body lay on fragrant earth under empty skies in an open field,
A shallow grave, unmarked, unnoticed, in crumbling furrows carved by rusted ploughs,
They will bury your empty coffin; they will raise for you a
stone,
They will know you fell in glory,
In the corner of some lonely foreign field,

Broken cloud, fleeting shadows, silhouettes are scattered
cross the sky,
The hollow laughter fills the heavens,
And echoes round a still and silent field,
...
