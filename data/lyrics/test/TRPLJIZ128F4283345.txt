If I could I'd like to be, a great big movie star
Overnight sensation, drive a big expensive car
I would buy you everything your little heart desire
These things I do, 'cause I'm stone in love with you

If I were a business man, I'd sit behind a desk
I'd be so successful, I would scare Wall Street to death
