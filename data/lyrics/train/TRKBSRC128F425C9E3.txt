Now in my younger days I used to sport a sag
When I went to school I'd carry lunch in a bag
With a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed

But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stand close to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch

Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock

I was on her jock, yes indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on pass

When I dream of fairy tales, I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter

I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shootin' for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
