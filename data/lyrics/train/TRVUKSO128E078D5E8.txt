I was fooled by your devil's disguise
I've been rained on enough
Now the sun won't rise
It seems I've been wasting my time
Carrying the weight of the world
And there's no end in sight

Now there's nothing for you
And nothing for me
I'm like a worn-out soldier
Running around incomplete
What used to keep it together
