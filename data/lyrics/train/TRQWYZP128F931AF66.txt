I cried all night long when I
Found out what your mama told you
My mama said, don't cry now, girl
I'm gonna tell you what to do

And then she said, don't wait
Til he makes up his mind now
Put down your foot and
Get him in line now

Let him know that
You can't wait around now
You've been his girl
For a long, long time now

My mama told me
Don't let him shop around
Oh, no, don't let him shop around
(Don't you let him)

You know a good man
Is hard to find now
Since you've got me
Just say no now

You know they say
That love is blind now
He's been fooling you
A long, long time now
