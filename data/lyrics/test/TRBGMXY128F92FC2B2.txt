The wind feels natural
The crook
On some black connection
From continent to continent crooks reign
But I guess you already know that
Volume Two of this joint
Lo

[Suede]
I scuba in Bermuda with new girl
While in Cuba receive a message
Wide screen view from Cheeba
Got girls for some interceptions
I detect a weapon, passport, chains
We smile chameleon
Catching G-11 land on Kawasakis willy-in
Look at me

[Cheeba]
Look at the Bronx, Brooklyn, and the Harlem
Black Connection
"Cheeba, you pulled Suede operate tailspin"
OK Flynn need guns with cajun lens
Need funds a million yens
Here goes again
Time to shock the world!
Top Co., Diana Ross
We set the feathers gloss
We jet, the flyin horse
Steal it then we
Shoot down the iron flies
Look up, with eye on top
The skies, the pirate skies
Kiss a story

[Suede]
Scar a feeble, throw the lassos
Black Connect at the Boscos
Hidin hollows and assholes
Matrix, bullets don't dodge slow
Untraceable grin gin pour
Palms is sweaty
...
