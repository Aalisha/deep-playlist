King Diamond)

A suicide, the birth of a Vampire
Deep in his lair, gasping for air

Spreaded wings
Fly out at sunset
So high above, back before dawn

Return of the Vampire
Leaving his lair
He's out for blood and it's yours
he will share
Return of the Vampire
Leaving his lair
He's out for blood and it's yours
