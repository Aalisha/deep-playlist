Ya mighty, ya mighty, ya mighty soul! Ya better lift up
They mighty, they mighty, they mighty souls!

Until their sight be long there shall be crying in heaven
They might be hungry, they might be starving in Delion
Oh ooh well, well yeah

Oh ooh why, why Jah (4x)

Man say…ya might, ya might, ya mighty soul! Ya better lift up
Ya mighty, ya mighty, ya mighty thought!

Weeping souls they know them not
Upon him bridge they will on day call

Water rights shall site they chant in the people too but they na see, na see
In a de valley the cars come from east, west, north, and south unto the mighty street
I see them…
