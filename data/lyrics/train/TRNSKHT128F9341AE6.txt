The clock is ticking and you need to get away
Paint the night with your hair spray
Your soul is restless and your life's a bitch
You're knocked down with your head in the ditch

Yeah!

You gotta get, gotta get out of here
The dark thought is your greatest fear

You'll never let 'em get to you
As a matter of fact
You think your life is jaded
And all your chances are fading

Oh Oh
Liberation
