Somewhere in your eye, that very special glow.
Something drawing me, to where, I do not know.
I never really thought that I would lose myself.
But now I'm going faster than anybody else.
You move without a sound, touch me with your hand
just like the rain that fondles every grain of sand.
This thing we're gonna do, it's just for you and me.
I'm gonna make it good, good as it can be.
Your kiss is sweeter now, your breath is getting warm.
We must take our time and last it through till dawn.
I wonder will it be? Oh, I expect it to.
There have been other girls, but no one else like you.
I feel a power here I've never felt before.
