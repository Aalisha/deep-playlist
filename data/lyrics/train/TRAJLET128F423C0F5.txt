Hmm, aahhhh
I see a red door and I want to paint it black
No colors in my life, you better turn them black
I see them walking by dressed in their colorful clothes
My happiness de?
No more will my grey sea turn a deeper blue
I cannot foresee this thing happening to you
No

I see people walking by dressed their summer clothes
I see them strolling by, my happiness?
Turn it black
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I said I know baby
Everything is black I know
Since you been gone
Eveything is black before my eyes
Baby eh
Everything is black I know
Turn to me
And help me see again baby
Help me walk once more
And help me talk again, walk again
