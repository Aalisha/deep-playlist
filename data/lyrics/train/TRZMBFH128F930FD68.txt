Little things mean a lot, oh yeah
Little things mean a lot, yeah whoa

When I wanted someone to give me the world
You accepted me and smiled
And let me know that you were my girl

And when I wanted fancy things, gold watches, diamond rings
You gave me your hand
'Cause only you could understand

Oh, little things mean a lot
Appreciate what you got
If you give all what you have
It's forever we'll last

Don't sit around and wait for all
The great things in your life, sweetie
Little things mean, little things mean
L-l-little things mean a lot

Giving me the best doesn't mean
Giving me happiness
I'll be satisfied with anything that comes close
