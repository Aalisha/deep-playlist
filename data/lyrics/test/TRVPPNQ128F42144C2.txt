As you pack your things to leave again
I feel it, wanting you to change your mind
Or maybe it's good that you go tonight
There have been many times before but somehow
We find reason why we shouldn't go our separate ways
Then go and cause eachother pain
This can really be the end, how do I erase
All of this love i have inside, i can't bare to see you cry
And as the door began to close on us
Do I just sit and let you go
Or do i call out for you
I'm so confused, tell me what to do

Chorus:
It's so hard to say goodbye
Dry your eyes
