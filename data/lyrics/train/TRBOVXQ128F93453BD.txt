How you gonna explain this one?
Whatever would you say to your friends?
Nobody's gonna rewind this one
Because there's no easy way of making amends

However did they justify this one?
I wonder if it's money to home
Because the political offical might have fiddled it a little slow
But unfortunately nobody knows

Are you unaware?
Could it been that you don't care?
You can't just kick your heels and wish it away
