The sun was barely coming up,
my heart was all but slowing down.
but I could barely make out the sound.
It was my personal symphony.

Striking the chords for only me.
There was a coursing all through my veins.
Another chance to get away, oh!

Until this empty place is filled, I'll keep pretending.

Hey! Wait! Knock me down, and I'll get up again.
Oh! Pain! A remedy that can erase your sting.
I'll keep holding, and I'll keep trying,
I feel this fight, it is slowly dying now but i feel painless.
