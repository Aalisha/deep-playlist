You know what
It's time for you to surrender your love

It's not about what ya wanna know
The time is right that's for sure
It seems so silly but you complete me

Your hanging back just to see
Is another girl better than me
Looks so pretty she's the kind I lead

What is it you're looking for
I give you all you want and more
It's not tricky it's what it is what it is

So just surrender your love baby
Surrender your love
Surrender your love baby
Surrender your love, uh uh no
