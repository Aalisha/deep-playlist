I see the west, I'd ask you to open your eyes
and guess, I've never had an answer that's right
for this, I'll tell you in a little while

Save the kid, you're looking for a reason to try
I guess, the impetus is there in your smile
and yes, we'll do this in a little while

Kids on overload
think you're coming home
The kids on overload
they think you're coming home
I don't know what you know
I don't know what you know

I see the west, I'd ask you to open your eyes
and guess, I've never had an answer that's right
for this, I'll tell you in a little while
