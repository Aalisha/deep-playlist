Every time I wake up here upon the kitchen floor,
And I find that you're all gone.
When I look up all I see is just how far
You have led me down.

Awake at night, I don't feel right unless you're here,
So I take it too far.
But in my brain you're here again, I close my eyes,
You might fake it all.

I know that you're not the only one. You aren't the only one.
I know that you won't wait. I have to crawl back home.
Can you look over just one more time?
Would you look over one more time?
