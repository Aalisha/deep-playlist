Which lie is the one that will take me?
And which war?
Generations of wage slave data
Family stories they said don't matter

When the last breath burns in the throats of Bhopal
Will I feel the blade when they bury them all?
Hiding from us all this time
Ghosts flickering in and out of my mind

Dead end streets we walk by
No retreat, staring at the sun
Dead end streets, the blast shadows are waiting for an answer
All this time, I'll give them mine
