Scared of losin' all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
With ripples and the rhymes
And he asked, "Will I see heaven in mine?"

That is just the way it was
And nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
They say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
"Will I see heaven in mine?"
Ohhhhhhhh
