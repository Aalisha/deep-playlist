We storm ahead with swords'n shields
For victory we ride
We fight the world on these battlefields
To re-erect the pagan pride

We draw the blood of those in our way
It's 'victory or die
With pounding, raging fury we slay
Now christian hounds will pay

Charge ahead, no retreat
No mercy, noone shall live
To us there is no defeat
No remorse to give
...
