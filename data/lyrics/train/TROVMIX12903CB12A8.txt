It would be easier if You were just a thought in my head
Simply something that I once read
A belief needing my defense

And it would be easier if You were something I once knew
A hope just to hold on
But You're holding out Your hands

You came to take us back to the start
You came to touch the hardness of our hearts
You gave us truth that truth is who You are
