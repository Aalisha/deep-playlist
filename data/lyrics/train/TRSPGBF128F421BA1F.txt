Are you living free? 
That the creation itself, will be liberated, 
From it's bondage
To decay to glorious children.

Nothing's the same as when we were abandoned then.
We've tied a rope to one end to alleviate the stress, 
And pardoned all your attempts at wisdom let's we all forget.

Let's we all forget about you now.
Running around again.
Making it all worth seeing.

I'll never be complete till, 
We take what's inside and turn it back again.
