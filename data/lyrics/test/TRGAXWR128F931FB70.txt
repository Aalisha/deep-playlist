Tell me what will become of the youth of today
In a culture blind to it's own decay because
We're all caught in the big swing of things and
The knot's cinched tight by a bunch of little strings.
What is happening to us? -We've lost our way
This creature of appetite is bound to devour itself one day.
We should make a home in the storms eye
People come together and survive.
