Today may be a never ending highway
And yesterday a half-forgotten smile
But I can hear tomorrow singing
From around the bend

It's just another dusty mile
And I've got dreams to spare
And time to spend
Time to spend

So I'm on the road
Travelin' free and easy
Travelin' on
Gotta get on

Well, I gotta get on
Gotta fill my life with living
Just tell everyone I've gone
...
