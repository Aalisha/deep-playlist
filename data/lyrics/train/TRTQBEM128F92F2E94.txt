If your heart is filled with love or hate
Find yourself a way to reach out for
Testing your life, easing to get it
Find yourself wasting your time

Sometimes we won't eat to break on through
Your acts of life, the careless mood to show
It can be cruel, it can be hard
Live out your life, show some emotion

You got to live it up
Let it show to the top
You got to live it up
Let it show to the top
(Ah, aha, ooohooo)

You got to live it up
Let it show to the top
You got to live it up
Let it show to the top

Reaching out for love, fool, ain't no crime
Open up your heart and then you'll find
Best things of life, it don't hold back
