So many faces dance through my mind
I don't know which way to turn
Take all the memories and keep them inside
They say i'll live and i'll learn
If it was true would you tell me?
If it's just lies would you hide?
All of the things that they've taken
On this Solarspherical ride

Give me the pieces one at a time
I lost them all in the end
Do you believe me? What would you say?
If I said the light I could bend
You took a chance on the future
