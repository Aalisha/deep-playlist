Impending hunger ravens fluttering
thru a stormy ominous horizon
awaiting for the flesh impaled on iron stakes
summoning the rites of the hatred gods of mars
bestial revenge for the oath of the throne
legions of mass murdering ride
revengeful inherits towards to clash
driven to devourer the enemies heart
envenomed arrows crossing the skies
yet it falls eminent death ascends
drink the wine of pure vindication
spilled from the enemies veins
...
