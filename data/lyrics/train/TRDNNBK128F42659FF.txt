I've missed all my calls this morning
the coffee may still be burning
I'm in a yellow taxi 
racing down to LAX
boy you'll be next
and I can't wait
I'm ready baby ready baby yea
I'm moving around and I want to get down
I'm moving around I'm on my way
The jet is fueled for Houston
I'm coming for you for you for you
I didn't bring my enemies or my worries
I'm on my way to you 
The pilot say we're climbing
