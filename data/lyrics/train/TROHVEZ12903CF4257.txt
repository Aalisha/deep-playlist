Seen through these dreamless eyes
Blind buildings startle the sky
Silhouettes as the dividing world
Guarding the eternal secret
Where is the flame towards you
And who do you answer to
My lies are always wishes
Lies that make me
See beyond the rationale
We accept the fate that nothing is meant to be
We are the least connected
Stay tuned to the last original

We're like layers to reality
Things only you can see
At all peace and normality
Inside the core of his sanity
