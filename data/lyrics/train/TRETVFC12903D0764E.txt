These lights, they burn my face, it's always the same in every new place
And I'll take everything I have learned and make sure you know this is something I've earned
I've waited these years just for their heads to turn

And this beat in my chest makes me know I'm blessed
The voices I hear makes me know I'm not alone
This is called my home, this is where I belong
And I'll always know where I'm from, it's this feeling that keeps me going on
