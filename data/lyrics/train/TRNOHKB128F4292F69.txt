There's a sad, young wife
Never had a life
Her mother said she'd married young.
And her husband's a fool
Never listened to
All the things she's never done.
So she packs up that ol' Ford Fairlane.
She's had about all she can bear.
A suitcase, a hope, and a hard rain.
She's gonna find it all somewhere.

On the road
Where the night is black.
On the road
Where you don't look back.
There's a white line in the distance.
Where it's goin' nobody knows.
If it's anywhere, you'll find it
On the road.
