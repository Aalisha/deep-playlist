INTRO
Things bad now but trust me them could get worse
Unless of course we come together and do something first
And all mothers just gwaan pray cause it a go tek a lot more than a politician to save the day
VERSE 1
When the youths dem need a buss give them opportunity first
Cause if them siddung and a lust it nah go safe fi none of us
And all the guns weh used to rust a go rise up from the dust
Police and soldiers haffi duck when them hear the guns a buss
War a gwaan in Iraq, meh nu have nuh time fi penny that
Me a watch the youths dem pon the block a rise the SK and the Glock
It nuh safe gi go a shop, even pickney dem a drop
Now tell me what we gonna do about that?
HOOK
A long time me did a warn dem
Say the youths dem need fi eat some
Food a that can calm dem
Dem never listen when dem hear a shot a drizzle, well here comes the storm then
When the thunder start roll and get out of control we can't disarm them
