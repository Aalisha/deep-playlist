(feat. Nedelka Prescod)

[M. Sayyid]
made out of everything
steady I'm ready
petty rappers
frontin gun clappers
a&r sellin you cars
sellin you stars
round trip ticket to mars
so I picked it apart
spit it, hit it, get it
pivot, swivel and dribble
twist with the sparks
touch this
rush off with crutches
churches and hushes
while I'm rollin dutches
past the ruckers
make a flow in my head
push the clutch
