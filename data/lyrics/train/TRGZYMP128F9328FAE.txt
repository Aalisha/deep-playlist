Let's dispense the formalities,
If it's all the same to you,
If you can tell a lie without thinking,
Save your breath for dirt.

Why don't you stand by my side?
"Why don't you get a life?"
Why don't you leave me to rot?
"Cos it's the wrong time",
Why do you go out at night?
"Cos I'm not satisfied",
Then you should leave me to rot,
"But it's the wrong time".
