I was the one to call the shots
Dream my dreams hard and slow
Answered only to my self
Never giving up control
Until the one day that brought me to my knees
And I would never be the same

I laid it all down and let it go
To lose it all, to lose it all
It took a step of faith to say goodbye
And everything I had I left behind
To find true life
Well all I longed for I found finally
At the end of me
