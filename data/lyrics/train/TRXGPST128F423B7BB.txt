She's so hot, she's so fine
I thought it out a thousand times
It's dangerous, no fear
What she wants I got right here
I'll bite 'n' howl and tear her to bits
She's the one to scratch my itch
Oh yeah she's my pill she's my fix

Give me one more night
Heartbreaker
Down on your knees
Heartbreaker
Just one more night
Heartbreaker
Is all that I need
Give me one more night
Heartbreaker
Down on your knees
Just one more night
Heartbreaker
