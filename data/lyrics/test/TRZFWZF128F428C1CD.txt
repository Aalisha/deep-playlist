Ooh la la la, ooh La la la
What I want from this life only God knows
I wanna rough cut brother kinda macho
Who put rings on my fingers, bells on my toes
And when you give it to me boy you make me sign ooh la la
Take it down low, teach me all the things that I don´t know
And you don´t rush baby take it real slow
No one minute man
This girl right here is a marathon fan
You gangster boy with ya magazine
What ya packing down their your baggy jeans
Your faschin you swag like you want to play
You´re flaschin your swag like you just wann to play
You know just how to blow my bubble
Got me so hot boy you in trouble now
Come and give me what I need
Don´t stop till you hear me scream

Ooh la la la la
Just how like it baby
Ooh la la la
You finger lick my pages baby
Ooh la la la
