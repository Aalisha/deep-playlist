giving all that love
got me off drugs
got me swigging you like whisky slugs
when you sigh, so do i
when i'm not back home, she's alone
can't seem to see why i have to roam
if you die, so do i

glace the earth side
through the dark i
mantra-size your name

i let go
i forgo, to have you
for my own
...
