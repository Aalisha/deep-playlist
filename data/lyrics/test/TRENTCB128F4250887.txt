"My beloved one, my heart's chosen, now lay buried among all of
the people I have truly cared for. While insane with grief and
hatred I honoured my lost love with a moment's peace, before
I called on my horse to ride away and seek the evil one.
I rode in rage for what felt like a day, when I came across a
pack of fleeing orcs. As I dismounted my horse and set my feet in
the rainy mud they came raging for me, wielding their axes in the
air. I slayed the two largest of the orcs, but the smallest, in
fear of my raging sword, told me of where to seek the Evil One.
As my failed predecessor I would find my foe on the highest
mountain, upon a throne of bones. My goal was now clear, and the
Dark Lord would soon suffer my beloved's fate..."

Finally I stand before my nemesis
Burning hatred's flowing through my veins
I raise my sword in a silent greeting
With fury my battlecry sounds

Spawn of darkness die by my hand, paint my sword red
You shall suffer my beloved's fate
Die now bastard you have destroyed all that I lived for
...
