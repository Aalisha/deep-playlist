My future seems so full of life
And brighter now than it has ever been,
But somehow I just can't allow
My shell to crack
And let the sun shine in...

Today I feel so sick
Today I feel comfortable with this

If I should die before you
I'll always be around to guide you
In your center you'll find me
And in the sky as a star still shining

...
