Down by Okkervil River slow silent thick and black
I stared into the water and the water it stared back
The night it fell from tangles of the branches on the shore
As it had on Okkervil River before

We made ourselves an altar, we lit our nightly fires
And the smoke lay thick and smothered, all the skunk cabbage and vines
Where Gods were born and Gods lay down to die
