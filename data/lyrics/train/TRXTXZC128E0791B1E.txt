There ought to be a way,
For us to learn to live as one,
But the vicious games you play,
Well, they're not my idea of fun.
A dozen times you lied,
A dozen times I took you back,
Always hoping that you'd change,
But I must face the facts,
Because there you go again.

I am as trusting as a child,
A helpless fool at your command,
You can be so savage and so wild,
Or maybe more like underhand.
