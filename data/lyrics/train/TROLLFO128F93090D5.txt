Verse 1:
I say my doctor
And he told me
There ain't no way around it.
There ain't no magic pill.
He said, "I looked for years
And tried but I ain't never found it,
No way to fix your ills."

So I've come before
The great physician
Where I know the medicine is
Strong and free.
Only you an cure this
Crossed up condition,
Yeah, you know the very thing I need.
