Sometimes it's coming over me
Like a warm rain
Sometimes it's coming back to me
Like a memory
Just like the heat in endless winters,
The cold of midday suns,
It is the longest way a man can go,
Sometimes it's more than I can take...

Last night i spread my wings
Upon two worlds colliding,
And in the monstrous distance,
The world came down on me...

And now I'm soaring on lost latitudes,
Navigator with no chart,
Looking down on all the colors,
That separate the day from night.
