"Some people came here to party
Some people came here to pray
Some will stay until they're sorry
Some'll be sad to have to go away
Some people came here to listen
Some people came here to talk
Some people don't know how much they've been given
Some people thank the Lord for what little they've got

But there's just one thing you've got to tell them
Tell them one you've got to tell them all
Because there ain't nobody so bad
That the Lord can't save 'em
Ain't nobody so good that they don't need God's love
And there's one thing you've got to show them
Just one thing you've got to let them see
It don't make no difference what else that you may be wanting
The love of God is the thing they need
It's the thing they need

Some people came here on business
