A National Acrobat

I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I've lived a thousand times

The unborn child that never was conceived

When little worlds collide
I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories
Are cast into the never ending well
