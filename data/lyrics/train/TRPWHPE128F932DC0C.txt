Don't care, won't go nowhere
I'll stay home
And make a little mess

Two hearts colliding
Well it's doomed
You're gonna get yourself in a mess
Hopes and expectations leave you
Ever so confused
Go your way and I'll go mine
So we'll never ever have to cross

Once upon a time I'd say
Rest your feet and weary head
Close your eyes and make yourself warm in my bed

Once upon a time I'd say
Rest your feet and weary head
Close your eyes and make yourself warm in my bed
