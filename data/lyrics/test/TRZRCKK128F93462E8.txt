obviously something's got to be done
I'm such a drama queen every time we meet,
and you don't give a shit.
a junky, an addict, a slave for your love
but I'm not in love
I'm just obsessed with hearing you say
"yes please Markus come to me".

I'm high on you and on drugs,
it is the worst combination of addictions.
