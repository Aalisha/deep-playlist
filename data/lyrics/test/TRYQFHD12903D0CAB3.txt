Mississippi Queen, If you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen, She taught me everything
Way down around Vicksburg, Around Louisiana way
Lived a cajun lady, we called her Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes were'a gettin' their kicks,
Buddy, beg your pardon, I was getting mine!
