Let's turn this up a little bit louder, yeah, yeah
Keep singing along as the night gets longer
Let's turn this up a little bit louder, yeah, yeah
Keep singing along as the night gets longer

Let's keep it moving
Keep our feet up off the ground
We hate to leave
But we'll be back around, yeah

These are the days that we will always remember
Chasing the night to make our days better
These are the days that we will always remember
...
