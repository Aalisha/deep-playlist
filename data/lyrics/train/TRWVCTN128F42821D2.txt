Midnight, I'm a-waiting on the 1205
Hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the line
Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the Queen of Hearts knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you
Laying out another lie, thinking about a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do to keep me away from you

Baby, it makes me feel so bad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
