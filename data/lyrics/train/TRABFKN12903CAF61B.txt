Hips swaying, lips lie
Like clockwork, she's in control
Of all the right guys
And I'm still waiting

Fitting nights with a car alarm
In her high tops with her favorite song
She's showing off the way she walks
It's on

Take me, show me
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
The corners of your empty room
The trouble we could get in to
Just fake it for me
(Whoa oh, whoa oh)
Disregard the footsteps
And we'll never tell a soul

Tonight I'm finding a way
To make the things that you say
Just a little less obvious
