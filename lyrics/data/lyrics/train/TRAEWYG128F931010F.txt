You said it folks this guys clever
He got extra dope rhymes and punch lines forever
His stuff will catch in no time if his production guy was better
And theres nothing I like better then new battle lyrics
My favorite jam secret agent man you have to here it
I heard he got a fad review in a mag or two
And now the majors want him that would suck if that was true
There ain't a cat half as fat as lou and that is true its stayin in me
Or dudes with punchlines on major lables sprayin any
He even answers all his emails if he's got a chance at all
He told me icons real name is vinny
Maybe when he's getting chased by a bunch of sweaty face record snakes
With chansaws and machete blades in pursuit like leather face and jason
He'll be the first kid who dont forget his place and sustains placement
Anyways hit me up on my email if you disagree or wanna spit a free
I said pray for the sunshine warmth today
But the cold rain cloud gon wash the sun away
You know this guy cries child but dont you weap
Cause mother son even goes to sleep
I said pray for the sunshine warmth today
But the cold rain cloud gon wash the sun away
You know this guy cries child but dont you weap
Cause mother son even goes to sleep
Well isnt this poetic faithfully
Theres another emcee with major label fever next to me no
He'll make a disco record
Louis Logic the next thing to grow into a classic?
