It's already Friday
And soon it'll be Friday night
And if you've got something planned
I suppose I'll understand
But give me half an hour
And I'll meet you in the gardens
I'll probably be waiting under the rotunda if it's raining
And somewhere near the see-saws if it's not

We can wander round the football ground
As the sun sets on the grandstand
If it gets a little cold there
We can hold hands in the goal square
...
