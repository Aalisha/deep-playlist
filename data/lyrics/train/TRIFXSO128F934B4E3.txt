Left here long ago
was passing through the years
I was waiting for the day
chasing a distant star
while the sun just slipped away
Lost my way long ago
was running in circles
I was drifting through the night
tracing a fading star
moving slowly out of sight

Lost my way, I lost my way back then
now it seems I’m lost, it seems I’m lost again

I left here long ago
was someone else back then
I left here long ago
