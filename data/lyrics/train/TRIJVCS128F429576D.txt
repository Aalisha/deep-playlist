No no no, da da da da
La la la ohh, hey

Member when at first I seen your eyes
Captivated, touching me inside
Went threw all the small talk to be with you
Took my time tryin' to get it back

If I could understand
(Understand)
What called you here, it's for my good
That I have you near

Oh love, love is so complicated
The way that I feel about you
(About you baby)
Make me wanna change my attitude

What I feel this here can't be real
(Can't be real)
I think I'm gonna chill right here
'Cause I wanna be with you

I long to kiss you girl, along your spine
Give you mine, keep it souls replied
Unplug the phone girl, it's just me and you
Submerge in two, the deepest part of you

If I could understand
(Understand)
What brought you here
