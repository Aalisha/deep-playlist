So many times I've been lied to, blind to
The ways of the world I've been lied to, blind to
I never understand how this master plan speaking man to man
Could ever give a damn
Hypocritical stance don't make me piss in my pants
You never care unless there's money to make
I'll never sacrifice, I got no time in my life
To fuck around with something that I know is fake
You want to sell your soul, I'll never sell my soul

You never understand exactly what kind of man that I am
'till you wear my shoes
You think I envy your life but you never realize I always live the way that I
choose
Feel so much regret but you never let
That make you live the truth
You point fingers and lie, the harsh truth you deny
...
