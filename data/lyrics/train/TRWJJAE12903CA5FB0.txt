I got nowhere to go
There's no hiding place for me
I've used up all my connections
And I've got no guarantees
And I'm out on the street now
With a monkey on my back
I need somebody to help me
To get my soul back on track

Oh, someone to have faith in me
Oh, will somebody set me free
I'm living in a dream
In a scene of desperation
Living in a dream
Won't you come and rescue me
Living in a dream
