When I think about your lovin'
The Sunday evenings, the fun we used to share
Looking through the memories in my mind
Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now I realize that it's never over, it's only set aside

Oh, it's you, sweet baby
I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby
Only hoping it's not too late to try again
It's true, sweet baby
Ever lost and captured by your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side
