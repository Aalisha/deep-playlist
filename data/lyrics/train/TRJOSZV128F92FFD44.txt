It's a shame what happened to Jimmy
It's a shame that it happened to all
Just hangin' out and being a smart ass
They found him dying in a bathroom stall
But so what, that's how it goes
It's just a shame that they did it to him

It's too bad what they did to Sheila
It's too bad that they did it to her
Left her home in the early, early morning
They found her body in a fetal curl
But so what, that's how it goes
...
