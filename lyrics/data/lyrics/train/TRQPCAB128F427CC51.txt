Time alone has informed me
That there's no easy way out for me
No, no easy way out

Just like a film without a story
We dreamt of rain without clouds
And wild country
But then our luck just ran out

Now there's no easy way out
There's no easy way out
No release when we're down

I tend to frighten all too easy
...
