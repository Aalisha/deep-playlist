In a perfect world, in another time
In a far off place we wouldn't need to justify
Everything we are
And all that we believe
We could finally be
Whoever we both want to be
And when we can't be heard,
And when we can't be seen
I will call you close and
You will reach for me.

When all of the beauty turns to pain
When all of the madness falls like rain
As long as we crash and we collide
We will be gorgeous, you and I.

Through the window pane,
Through the bedroom door
This city wants to fight
But it can't touch us anymore
We have come so far,
We have shed our skin
...
