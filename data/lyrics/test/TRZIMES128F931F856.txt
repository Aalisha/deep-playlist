So why the sudden change
and what's this all about?
I know they speak your name,
but where's the sound right now?
I can't stop praying you'll hear me play.
I know that I'll be with you there someday.

So where the hell's my hope,
and why can't I just try?
You know I've lost a lot,
but I won't let this die.
I know I've got a friend up in the atmosphere,
and another reason not to fear the sky;
no, not tonight.

Can I pull out all the stops,
and get out of this town?
I want to make you proud,
but I really don't know how.
I know it's not helping to hear me say,
"I wish it was me in the car that day."
Though something made me stop and think of what you said.
