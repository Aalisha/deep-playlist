What different, Pete, about 69 that makes it so exciting to you?
Two-thousand people in a seething, roaring, shouting mass

All the people I know are - musicians
I revolve around music
That's all I know
They each got their own little thing that they like

We hustled our way in, everybody had long hair
We hustled our way in, everybody had long hair
We hustled our way in, everybody had long hair
We hustled our way in, everybody had long hair

It's groovy
It's groovy, I guess
It's groovy
It's groovy, I guess
Man, it's groovy
It's groovy
It's groovy

He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
