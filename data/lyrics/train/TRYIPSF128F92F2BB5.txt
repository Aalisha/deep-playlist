Hey sing a bad song
Get it stuck in your head
I'm singing along
Can't help it
Kids starting to whine
Exploding my mind
Satan get me behind
I'm saturated
It's closing in on me
It's closing in on me
It's closing in

If you see something don't
Say something to me
I'm a paranoid freak
Already
I'm a man on the brink
I've had too much to think
I'm a paranoid freak
Already

Joe, Average guy
