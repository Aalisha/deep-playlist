Let me tell you what I do when my day is over.
After picking the right clothes for about an hour.
Oooh, I'm turning orange from all the carats around my neck.
Tonight, I'm takin' out the bling and I'm dressed to impress.

I'm gettin' ready for my night out on the town.
I'm lookin' hot cause you know we are holdin' it down.
Rockin' high-tops and sayin' no to stilettos.
Cause I might get drunk off my ass and I don't wanna fall.

Out on the streets all the taxis are showin' me love.
Cause I'm shinin' like a princess, in the middle of thugs.
And at the clubs, the bouncers recognize my face.
So while your waiting in the line, we just enter the place.

Let's get this party started right,
Let's get drunk and freaky fly,
You with me so it's alright,
We gonna stay up the whole night.
