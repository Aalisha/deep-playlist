Well I wanna-wanna lotta-lotta lovin'
Well I wanna-wanna lotta-lotta huggin'
So baby can't you see that you were meant for me
I want your lovin', yes-a-ree.

Well I wanna-wanna lotta-lotta huggin'
Well I wanna-wanna lotta-lotta kissin'
So baby please proceed to get the love I need
I want your lovin' yes indeed.

Well, I want you, I love you, I need you so much
Why don't you give out with that magic touch
You send me, you thrill me, baby you're so fine
