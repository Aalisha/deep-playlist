Darkbound - awaken beyond...
Will I see my sorrow, tomorrow, alone?
Invisible dark - the omniscient comfort
Burning inside, forever long

Reflecting realm of the dead in your eyes
Washing away with drawing tide
Born of eternity, bringing on
The sleepwalker of daytime glow

Bring me the haunting game of pain
Let me feel the fierce again
...
