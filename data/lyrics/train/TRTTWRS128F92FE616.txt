I met Willie by the still, he was brewin' a batch
He had a short cigar and one last match
He was tellin' me 'bout his latest troubles with the government
He had child support and alimony
He was looking depressed and kinda lonely
Just tryin' to figure out where all his hard-earned money went
"Well, I'll be go to Hell", he said
"I got nothing but a Ford and a barn full of hay
If it weren't for horses and divorces
I'd be a lot better off today"
