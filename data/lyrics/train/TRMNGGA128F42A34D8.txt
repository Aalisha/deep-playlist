It doesn't matter
That you had the courage to tell me
The easy way out
Was to free up your guilt, laid it on me

What do I care?
If it didn't really mean a thing why'd you do it?
I'm standing here
Looking at someone who doesn't
Know they blew it, yeah

You should have lied
Cause' your stupid mistake
Made my world crash down
Now its goodbye
No you can't take it back
Once the truth has come out of your mouth
So you tried to be honest
But honesty blew it this time
