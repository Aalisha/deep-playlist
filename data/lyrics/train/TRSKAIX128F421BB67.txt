I'm wide awake with the sacred sun
Sending echoes out to distant places
I hear the watch ticking on your wrist
Sleeping beauty I could not resist you
My head is aching from yesterday
Feeling guilty must be on my way

There's a voice deep inside of me
It took me by surprise
Now I know where my heart lies

I'm crawling back for my life
Pleading to my love
I've been lost in my desire
I was drinking, wasn't thinking
And I'm sorry if it makes you cry

You call me up on the telephone
