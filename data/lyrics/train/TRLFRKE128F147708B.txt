Since you're gone
There is an empty space
Since you're gone
The world is not the same

I go back to the places we've been
Feels like you're still there
I live all those moments again
Wishing you were here

Since you're gone
There is an lonely heart
Since you're gone
Nothin' is like it was

There are memories all over the place
Bringin' it back all so clear
Remember all of those days
Wishing you were here
...
