If I keep moving
I can hold off the pain
I just gotta keep moving
Further, further away

If I stop talking
The sparks are going to fly
So I'll just keep on walking
And just keep quiet

I just feel like you're drifting out
Could I keep this tide from turning

If I scream and I shout
I just feel like you're drifting out
Could I keep this tide from turning
I will scream and I will shout
