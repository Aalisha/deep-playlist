There's a hole in the pumpkin
This must be Halloween
And if it wasn't one thing
This Dread would scream

There's a hole in the pumpkin
This must be Halloween
And if it wasn't one thing
This Dread would scream Ahhh

I'm telling you something
About this system
If it ain't one thing
Tis eleven others
Don't think I'm joking
S'not what I'm smoking
Just that the money not running
Ask Mamas and Papas

There's a hole in the pumpkin
This must be Halloween
And if it wasn't one thing
This Dread would scream

There's a hole in the pumpkin
This must be Halloween
And if it wasn't one thing
...
