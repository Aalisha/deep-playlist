Bring it to the table
All you're able to bring
Forever [unknown]
Don't you change a thing
Remove the label
Let it shout, let it sing
Though it may be painful
It's not going anywhere
Might as well have, face of the clock
Time is a block and we're building
Shake off the dust, scrape of the rocks
And help all of us sing
Words of this song, sing em all night long
...
