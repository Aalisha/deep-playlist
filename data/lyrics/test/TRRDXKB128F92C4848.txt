I'm just built like this [Incomprehensible]
Love-makin' is a zone, the rhythm, the music
The movement, wet, devotion
Are you focussed? Are you?

I can help you last forever
[Incomprehensible], connect
She says things to me like
"Keep me coming"

As the seconds turn to minutes
As the minutes turn to hours
As the sound of love is hollered
Time just keeps elapsing
And I just keep climaxing

With sweaty palms to say the least
You know just what to do to curl my toes
When she blows, there I go
I lose all control and there's no need for batteries
