Come out West and see
The best it'll ever be
I know you won't stay permanently
But come out West and see

Climb up on a rock
And stretch out in the sun
And close my eyes and let
My imagination run

I'm tracing your initials in the shining sand
I'm counting out the days till I see you again

Who knows what the future holds
...
