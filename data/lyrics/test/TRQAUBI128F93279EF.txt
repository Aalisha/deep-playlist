Tangled up and twisted and I don't know what to do
I'm living with Marie Antoinette,
She's living with a fool
Life with her majesty has got one golden rule:
No matter what she will let me forget
That I can't have her cake and eat it too

Pre-chorus
Bring me in and take me down
There's nothing I wouldn't do
...
