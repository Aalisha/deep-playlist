So long boy, you can take my place
Got my papers, I've got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way
To Yellow River
Put my gun down, the war is won
Fill my glass high the time has come
I'm going back to the place that I love
Yellow River

Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River, Yellow River
Is in my blood, it's the place I love
...
