When when you you come come to to me me me
Be ready ready, be ready ready, be ready ready, be ready ready

When when you you come come to to me me me
Be ready ready, be ready ready, be ready ready, be ready ready

I am so fly
I can fly higher than high
I can be many styles at the same time

You're now rocking with the best
Your Royal Highness
If you want a test then test me but

When when you you come come to to me me me
Be ready ready, be ready ready, be ready ready, be ready read

When when you you come come to to me me me
