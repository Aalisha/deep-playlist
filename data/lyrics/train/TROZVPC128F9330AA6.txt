I am looking around, laid down in my coffin
See faces with tears in their eyes
But hey wasn't (that) her?
and I also see the guy who used to hate me so much?

And I don't need mourning laments
To be sincere you can kiss my ass
If you had to tell me something,
I can do nothing, now I'm dead and gone

I'm singing proud my final song
Dedicated to the ones still living
I'm singing loud my final song
For the ones who have ears to hear
