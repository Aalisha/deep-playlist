Tell me master, what I am
What burden I should bear
A tool of virtue in your hands
Fulfill your darkest nightmare

Cry for you
Die for you
Cry with pain
Die... die, die in vain

Reveal the secrets of your mastermind
Show me your sign and light my way

Tell me master, what you play
Am I the pawn, a sentry
