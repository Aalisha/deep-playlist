--------------------

You promised me to meet, do you remember?
I know of a party. don't go without me.
don't you go without me
I still have friends, but most of them
send med postcards
at Christmas and summer saying
we miss you deeply,
but now we must go to move us to feed
and time doesn't care about us

you promised to return, do you remember?
maybe you have lost my number
