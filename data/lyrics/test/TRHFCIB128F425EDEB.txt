Hold on my enemy!
If you got it in for me
It's just fog and fantasy
We'll come to some understanding

(CHORUS))
I'm going to make this my own moon landing
I'm going to give this the best that I've got
You see right from the start we've been drifting apart
It's our actual standing
I'm going to make this my own .

I don't need no enemy
to keep me awake at night
No one 's gonna go for free
We'll travel very light
...
