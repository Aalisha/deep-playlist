Hi-Yo Silver! Away!
Horses come and horses go
But there's one that you all know
People greet him with acclaim
Silver is his name

Gimme the reins
There's pep in the veins
Onward, Westward-ho!
Hi-Yo Silver! Hi-Yo
Over the trail
Hill or dale
Swift as wind will go
Hi-Yo Silver! Hi-Yo

Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap, giddyap
We must prevent that crime
Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap, giddyap
We'll get there in the nick of time
Under the sky, we will fly
...
