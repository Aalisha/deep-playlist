The silent storm in my heartbeat
Is raging at the questions of soul
No way back, rising darkness
Blind angel in a night without stars

Lost in the silent dream
Of a lonely, broken love

The fall of hope, of illusion
Is hidden there behind the wild rocks
To reach the sun, warm my feelings
I'll rise where only eagles can fly
