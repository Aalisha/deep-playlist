I dream about stars here
I dream about bringing you a parade
We read foreign papers
Pretend we're hiding from an air raid

But I can't know
Why I always stutter

And she doesn't care
Breathe the same air
I don't have a hope in hell
Doesn't see
We could agree
This could be so blissful

And I will do magic
...
