So, I'm feeling much worse now
You're better, you're better
Your designer drug
Won't work, won't work for me

Connect to a three volt
I hope your battery dies
How could you run
On such, on such voltage?

All the same, I remain
The one to blame and I'm
Demonized, purified
Justified as you let yourself show

So now you'll love these screams, what's left of me
Don't speak
...
