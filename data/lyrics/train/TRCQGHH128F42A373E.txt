it's in my head
and nothing changes what's been done
if i regret not being there when the time has gone
when it's too late

no regrets no time to change
a selfish choice can take it's toll
a sacrifice might make the day
no regrets it's time to change
could i have done more
it's in my head

i hold my breath it's not too late
and i know that if i had another chance
i'd make it up to them
...
