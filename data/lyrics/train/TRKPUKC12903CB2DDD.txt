Oooh Weee! Oooh Weee!

Chorus

Can ya... Can ya feel it? (I can feel it)...
Parum pum pum
Can ya... Can ya feel it? (I can feel it)
Feel this drum

That's the sound of the man workin' on dat rhydum'
And we ain't gonna stop until yal workin' wid 'em
No time for standing for poses
Got to be movin' like Moses
And when that Funk comes together
You'll be holding ya noses
(Hands up) we da band, but we ain't plugging it up
(Stand up) if you can stand, you can't be sitting to
Rock
(Back up) back up if you not willing to ride,
Cause we going on a tour, (alright) where we going?

Fat, Fat Boys, way back, that's from the eighties
Fresh like Dougie, inspiration... we were babies
Get up on the stage, we go vocal, they go crazy
We got somethin' for the fellows,
This ain't only for the ladies...
