I cant believe the news today
Oh, I cant close my eyes
And make it go away
How long...
How long must we sing this song?
How long? How long...
cause tonight... we can be as one
Tonight...
Broken bottles under childrens feet
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I wont heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
And the battles just begun
