How did they find me?
How did they know?
This misconception of fate
I'm about to let go

Awake in a new light, I'm
Alone in this room
Heavy at heart, it may be a lie
You will not see me

It's a new day
(Why did they follow me home?)
It's a new day

One
More
Step, it's
Here waiting for you, now
Go
Slow, take your time

Leave
No
Mark
You lost your way
I hope you're watching me

One
More
...
