Goodbye Momma, goodbye to you too Pa
Little sister, you'll have to wait a while to come along
Goodybye to this house and all it's memories
We just got too old to say we're wrong

Got to make one last trip to my bedroom
Guess I'll have to leave some stuff behind
It's funny how the same old crooked pictures
Just don't seem the same to me tonight

There ain't no use in shedding lonely tears Mamma
There ain't no use in shouting at me Pa
I can't live no longer with your fears Mamma
...
