Can't believe the words you said your voice keeps hitting me in the head
I remember when you told me you'd never say mean things like that.
Thought you had your love in tact but I was wrong thinking things like that
Might be time to reconsider what my plans have been.

Cause when the girls walked by I could see that you never really wanted to be with me
Out the corner of your eye you were saying hi you're never satisfied.

You don't have a heart.
You don't have a soul.
