Introductory:

This is the first time I did this. Whoo! But Ilove it! (laughs) I just want to take you away a minute. This song I'm about to do today is like a spiritual song, it 's a piece of my heart. 
You see I'm the oldest of four-teen kids. Because I was the first one, mama said that may be king. So I went out and bought me a ring (laughs) But I found out later in life... that don't mean nothing. 
Even though I come from that great big o'l family with four-teen kids. For some reason I've never felt like I had anybody by my side untill I ran to these bad, bad, players and bad, bad, listeners. You know what i'm talking about. 
Name of this song is called " I Don't Wanna Be Alone" 
Listen...


I don't want to be, I don't want to be alone 
I don't want to be alone yeah anymore, well
I don't want to be alone well shut that door 
This is just a silly game girl
That we are playing yeah, well
