How can I remember what girl I will see today
If tomorrow she'll be gone?
Now I'm a pretender in a special kind of way

I've been living like James Bond.
The situation now will never change

Infatuation has gone out of range.
This is my life
and I don't want to see it die.

Bad boy
I wanna be a bad boy

If it means I will enjoy every day now.
