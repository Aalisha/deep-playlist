You walk around with your hands in your pockets
You talk too much but you don't like the way you sound

Things are better left unsaid, when you? re in love

Things are not okay but you insist to act that way
When everyone? s your friend
But still you? re in love with yourself

Things are better left unsaid, when you? re in love
