Darkness for centuries, war for decades,
after years of misery, still I remain the same
But after the loss of the love of my life
I have felt the pain for the first time

Forever you, my yesterday
through the coldest nights
Forever me, eternity
save me from this tragedy

Gift of eternity turned out to be... my curse
The lust for life, desire for love made me turn into.
