Woke up and I got the feeling
Nobody's gonna make it easy
Left out when I wanna be inside
As it's all goin' down


Your love is enough to feed me
Held up for another evening
Lord knows I could use the freedom
For waiting around when I need you


Who are we to fall to pieces baby
Worked so hard to see things through (see it through, see it through)
Who are we to question each other mama
