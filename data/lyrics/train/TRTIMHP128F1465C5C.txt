She was born at the rest stop on the Kansas state line
In the back of a Dodge in the summer time
Her momma named her Indiana like thier license plate
And with the hum of the tires on the interstate
She was cryin'
they left her at a Denny's up in Colorado
In a blanket with her name written on a note
That said, "Forgive us Lord for not takin' her
But this child has a better chance of makin' it
In someone else's arms"
And it's a crazy thing
Fate has perfect wings
All the way down the line
Angels working overtime
She was raised in a place called Cheyenne Wells
But she never fit in and everyone could tell
