Baby, you got me all wrong
And maybe I'm not all down and out
I'm high and I'm in

Don't you know who I am?
I'm the jaded one with pop insensitivity
When I finish struggling
we can make our way to the dance floor
and stand like strangers
in an elevator stuck between stories
I always find myself in the middle of your stories
...
