alan doesn't understand her
he only thinks in numbers
he only drinks in restaurants
where the girls are fully covered

and he can't trust his yearnings
and he doesn't like pretending
his tempers stretched so much by work
his heart needs gentle rending

he calls her the chocolate girl
'cause he thinks she melts when he touches her
she knows she's the chocolate girl
'cause she's broken up and swallowed
and wrapped in bits of silver
