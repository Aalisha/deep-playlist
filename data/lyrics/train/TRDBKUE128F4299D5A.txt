All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my breath
Will I find something in that
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
One by one hidden up my sleeve

Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keeping me down

Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
