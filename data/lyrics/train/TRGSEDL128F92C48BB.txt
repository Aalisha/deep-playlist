So go on and tear it up
Black and cold with the dust
'cause I believed in the Lord
But he don't show up anymore

If you can't trust the wind, who can you trust?
If you can't love sin, who can you love?
If I begin will you let me finish up?
If I fell down would you pick me up?
If I don't drink from a silver cup, like you,
Would you say so long, farewell, good luck?
