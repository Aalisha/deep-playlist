Daniel stares over LA
Tiny little stairs over his head
Out on the lamb
His lying's on the loose
King of the jungle
Running from the truth
(Don't look now, the light just turned red)
Tiny little stairs over his head
Now he's just sitting by the rainbows end
Not missing this place
Empty faces
Not missing anything
I know that for sure
His has never been good luck
