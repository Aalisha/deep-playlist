(Don't look now)
'Cause it is coming for you, it is coming for you
(Don't slow down)
It is around the corner, around the corner

(Don't hold back)
You got to give what you got, you got to give what you got
(Don't slow down)
You got to face the music

Face the music, face the music
Face the music, face the music
Face the music, face the music
Face the music, face the music

(No use hiding)
'Cause it will break down the door, it will come through the wall
(No good fighting)
