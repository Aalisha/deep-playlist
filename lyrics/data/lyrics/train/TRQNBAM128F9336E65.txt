And when you wake up on your own
you know i'll feel better
and when you sit there all alone
it's over

last call i'm gone
did you think you could lie forever
i've known for so long
still you tried to play the pretender
you always acted so suprised
(you knew it, you knew it)
and now i see through your disguise
(see through it)

and when you wake up on your own
you know i'll feel better
and now you sit there on your own
you know, you know that it's over
