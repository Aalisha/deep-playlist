They come to town when the war is over
Dirty boots in the middle of the night
Trolling the bars, hitting on the soldiers
Boys give it up without a fight
They say, "Hey, boy, how about your place?
I know you really want to take me home"
Drop the bags off on the bedroom floor
They make love with the lights on, saying

"I'm a carpetbagger, baby
I'm coming to your town
I'm going to treat you kind
I'm going to rob you blind
I'll smile all the time
