In my darkest hours of pain and emptiness when I had nothing to live for
You gave me more than I could ever ask and then persisted to give more
You said you knew I'd do the same for you and expected no gratitude
In turn I owe this simple thing you saved, by death I swear to you
For my enemies I have nothing to give but hate
For those who doubted me you're my enemies just the same
