I get so lost in your eyes
I wish that I could live here for a thousand lives
And your heart feels so wide
I just want you to get close so I can crawl inside

'Cause no one love me, love me, love me like ya do
You know I love ya, love ya, love ya too
You're still standin' in my corner if I lose
'Cause no one love me, love me, love me like ya do

And I'd drive all night
...
