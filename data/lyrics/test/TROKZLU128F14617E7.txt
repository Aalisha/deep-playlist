They wanted to break my back, wanted to hold me back from beeing free. 
 they had a part for me in society, but that wasn't me. 
 they gave me an early start, when they broke my heart i needed to see. 
 that if i wanted to be myself i couldnt be myself without me! 
 
 so here i am! 
 i stepped out! 
 to be free! 
 
 'cause with all that's left inside of me, with my back against the wall. 
 i can still decide what's best for me, i can still say all i want. 
 "now that im free!"
