Andi won't dance
Andi won't sing
Andi won't play
She sits in her room, hiding away, hiding away

She hasn't a friend
They think she's a boy, they leave her alone
But what they don't know
Andi has dreams, all of her own

Yea, she wants to be a lady
Can anyone see?
That's she's trapped inside a little boy's body
She's waiting
For the dream of her life
To be a lady
