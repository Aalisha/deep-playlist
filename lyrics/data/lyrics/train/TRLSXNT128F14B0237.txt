I can see it in your eyes
No more tears, no alibis
I'm still in love with you
There's so much I gotta show
I will never let you go
But still I know for sure

Come take me by the hand
This summer never ends

And I want to know that you believe in love again
Please tell me now it's not the end
'Cause this I promise you so true
The summer belongs to you
