You might think there's nothing left but ashes
In a box on a table at Crosby's Bar
But there's more than meets the eye
You didn't leave us when you died
Your spirit will live on in what we do and who we are

Aunt Betty's gonna tell us stories 'bout the family
Daughter Susan is gonna sing your favorite song
Cousin Perry will spend the day
Tellin' tales of the blue and gray
And the Cajun will keep pickin' all night long

We'll be putting down the brisket and tequila
Down in Kerrville with the Seekers of the Shade
