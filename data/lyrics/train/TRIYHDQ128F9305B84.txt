I'm gonna run it down to y'all
Tell them anything you wanna now
I ain't nothin but a nasty gal now hey hey
I said you said I was a bitch now
Didn't ya didn't ya
You said I was a witch now
I'm gonna tell them why I'm gonna tell

You used to love it ooh to ride my broom honey
I used to love it ooh I used to love to
Ride the range with ya baby
sing the song sing the song
I ain't nothin but a hey hey
nothin but a hey hey
I said you said I was an evil wench oh
didn't ya didn't ya
You said I was an alley cat
I'm gonna tell them why I'm gonna tell them why
You used to love it oh when I'd scratch your back baby
I used to love it when you did it
When ya did it to me real good
