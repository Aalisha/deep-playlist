All I wanna do is have a little fun before I
die.
Says a man next to me, outta nowhere.
This apropos nothing. He says his name is William.
But I'm sure it's Bill, or Billy, or Mac, or Buddy.
And he's plain ugly to me.
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life.
He's drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shiny Lexus and Buicks
Back to the phone company and the record
store too,
Well, they're nothing like Bill and me, cause

All I wanna do is have some fun
...
