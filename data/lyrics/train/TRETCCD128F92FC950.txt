[Verse 1:]
Her name was Lupita, I met her at school
Real sophisticated, kind of preppy, but cool
I wrote her a poem, it captured her heart
It put me in a friendzone, but that was a start (see)
I started noticing her in a-whole-nother light
Was the inspiration for every love song I would write
Dreams, I hold on t'her thight, I tried to prevent
Not liking her I tried to pretend, cause her and I was just friends
And it's a thin line, emotions I bottled them in
Just a foolish love jones, what this probably is
Captivated by her lips, everytime I conversate with her
Wanne make her mine, what I'm waiting for, I gotta let her know...

[Chorus: x2]
She's driving my crazy, feelings starting to show
