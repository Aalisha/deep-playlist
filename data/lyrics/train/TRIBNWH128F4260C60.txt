Are you a shy?

Were in the door, I get a smile from a fly boy
He seen me before and makes his move like a fly boy
I'm sick and tired of them fly boys
It's bye bye boy

I'm in a lounge, I get a wink from a bad boy
He comes around all puffed up like a bad boy
I'm sick and tired of them bad boys

[Chorus]
Cause I got my eye on this other guy
Back in the booth with his boys, he's all mellowed out
And tonight I don't mind be a shy boy
So I gotta know
Are you a shy boy?

I'm by the stage, I get a look from a rock boy
He's got the shades on indoors like a rock boy
I'm sick and tired of them rock boys
