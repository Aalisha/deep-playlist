Well I know you said, I never helped you anyway
And I guess I know, I never should have trusted you
Sorry to remind you of the promises you've broken
Wouldn't want to dwell upon the lies

So many times I heard about, what I should do
So many times I've read about what you want me to do
So many times I wonder if you realize I don't care about you
