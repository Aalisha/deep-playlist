Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
(Typical girls in the typical world)
Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
(Typical)
Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
Bump (Gangster)

Honey, honey see me
Behind my Gameboy
I got game girl
It goes easy
Let go your shoulders
My popsicle is so sweet, see
slam back that sparks
Don't hesitate
And you'll believe me
Ya bitch believe me, ya

(Bdeded, bdeded)

Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump
(Hey there you go, there you go, we're fine by…)

Bump
(Too much rump in the trunk)
Bump, Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump,
(It‘s rainin' it's pouring, the typical girls ain't snoring)
Bump-Bump
(Typical)
Bump-Bump, Bump-Bump,
(Rump in the trunk)
Bump-Bump,
Bump, Bump-Bump,
(Rump in the trunk)
(Typical)
(Rump in the trunk)

Now mingle shake from every angles
Regroup the hood
Gonna start by the spangle
Like Kama Sutra
I hit from every angle
Free to speak but first
Cos' your thoughts untangled
What's the look why your face all menaced
Let me to stand still
But your whole crew's tangles
Cut them off shangle
Dangle
Fuck you
Get me?
Got it (Got it)

It comes straight from the hood
Critique my music
Call it pop/rap/rock/funk/fusion
It's too confusin'
