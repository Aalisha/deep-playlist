She says I never listen and I'm not attentive to her emotions
I say she's got tunnel vision, only sees it her way
So we never can work it out
She's all ready to give up and move on
I don't think she knows how I wish sometimes she could read my mind

If she knew how bad I wanna make this work
How my love belongs to her she wouldn't be able to walk away
If she knew how bad I gotta have her close
If I ever let her go I wouldn't make it a single day
She would never have to ask if, if she knew how bad

I've got it, gotta find a way to tell her how I feel before it is over
I guess I could have done things better
I never should have let it get this far
