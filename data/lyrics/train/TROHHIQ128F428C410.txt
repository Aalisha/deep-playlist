Cover your blackened eyes, and forget about this mess
If I haven't destroyed every little thing...
We could leave in the middle of the night
With the worst behind us
WE'll smoke these days away until the day we die

You better stop before you hurt yourself
These words are bullets, have you caught one yet?

Don't give me those sunken eyes
This train is racing my heartbeat
...
