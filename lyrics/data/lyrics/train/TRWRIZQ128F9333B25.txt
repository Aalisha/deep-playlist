(Paul Craft - Cadillac Holmes)

Sittin' here thinkin'
'Bout you and me
It's a cryin' shame
'cause it's plain to see.

You make me love you so bad
You make me love you so bad
You make me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good.

You smile like an angel
Lie like a rug
You wouldn't change if you could
'Cause it's in your blood.

You make me love you so bad
You make me love you so bad
You make me love you so bad
Too bad you're no good.
