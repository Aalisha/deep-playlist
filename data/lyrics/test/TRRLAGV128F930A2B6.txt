Yo 1 question, where U know Me from?
On 40 Duce, got cought with that loaded gun,
Sereal scratched Cop Killa U know tha gun, only fear I had wouldn't know My Son. Would of told My Son, who tha hell could doubt Me, rather see Me in a cell then they tell U bout Me.

In DC yo, they cought Me sippin (drunk), at tha light 1 howard night they cought Me slippin, couple shots, took off skippin, co-operate nah My name ain't Rico (U got Me fucked up!)
Look Chico, Killa tryin to duck tha repo, racketeering, steering + tub prodigo.

What up Amigo, yeah key pasa, New Yetty is My City Mi Casa.
Sqeeze? calm down, no need, nada.
They're desert apple pie, peach cobbler.
Get tha cool whip, I keep tha tool gripped, got guns that's longer than a pool stick, the front gate, tha backyard & pool sick but when tha Jewels drip I'm a fool Dip.

Strip club in tha crib not just a pole, lights flash mirrors up, disco ball (tha whole shabang) & I just go ball,
Act skitzo ya'll, dude 7ft ask how I get so tall.

(Hook:)
Somebody better pray 4 em B4 I get feed up & I lay 4.

Calm down, Wooh-sah
Calm down, Wooh-sah
Calm down, Wooh-sah
Calm down!, Wooh-sah

Uh!
