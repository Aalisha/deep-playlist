When I'm looking deep inside myself
And I search in vain
How I've tried to be like someone else
But remain the same
A wasted life

I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)

When I'm sitting deep inside myself
And it causes pain
Think about in the times I've tried
But I've failed in vain
My life's sometimes
Between the line

I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know

I want to know (I want to know
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
I want to know (I want to know)
