Yeah, hey, hey
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams will take you very far, yeah
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah

What you see on nights so clear, hey
In the sky so very dear, yeah?

You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be
(What you could truly be)

Shining star come into view
To shine its watchful light on you
