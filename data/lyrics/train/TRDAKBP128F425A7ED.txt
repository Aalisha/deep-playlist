I've got a lot of juice
I need to put to use
Let's bring this highway down

I'm going from Z to G
When it should be A to B
Nose so low it just scrapes the ground

Can't you see me over taking?
All the while I'm salivating
Won't you let me
Push a little thrust up you?

She loves riding around
In my black devil car
I can't hear a sound
Because her foot's pushing down too hard

And white angels cry
For her black devil heart
She wants me to stop
She should never let me start
She should never let me start

Talking to all those pretty girls
That I meet around the world
Her name was Gina
You should have seen her

She had the greenest eyes
And with those endless thighs
I've put my hands through
Some misdemeanors

Can't you see me, I'm not choosy?
You drive a black machine
And I think you're groovy
Won't you let me
...
