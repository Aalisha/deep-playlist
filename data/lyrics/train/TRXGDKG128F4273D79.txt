Summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich and your mama, she's good looking
So hush little baby, there's no need for you to cry
One of these mornings you're gonna rise up singing
And then you're gonna spread your little wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning don't worry, nothing gonna harm you
