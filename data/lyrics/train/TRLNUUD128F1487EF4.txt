One more chance and i swear i'll get it
Call out your vultures.
Sharpening knives in the deepest shadows
Run it by the council

We're stopping by to drop you in
And if you can't hold on
Get it get it... get it...

We took the stage and we stole your show
And if it's all you've got i'll
Get it get it... get it...
