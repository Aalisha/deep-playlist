I've got a secret nobody knows
I don't want to keep it but I can't let it go
I've tried to tell you so many times
But I could never tell you, baby, what I feel inside

Baby I'm lost for words when I see you everyday
I Try to make myself heard but you take my breath away
I get tongue-tied, shy, hands are shaking
Speechless, heart slowly breaking
Oh oh baby I'm lost for words

Brown eyes & blue skies playing on my mind
How long must I go on keeping my feelings inside
...
