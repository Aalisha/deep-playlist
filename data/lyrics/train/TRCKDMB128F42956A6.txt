I know the way that I have picked apart at you
And i know the way that I've had less than you're used to.
Lets try to find a way that we can work it out.
Don't say what I cant bear to hear.

Don't say goodbye yeah yeah
Just one more try yeah yeah

I know the way my insecurities can grate.
I'd hate to judge myself against my perfect mate.
