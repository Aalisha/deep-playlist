I don't want to lose you, but even a fool could see
Everyday your love is slippin' a little bit further away from me
So I'll be the one to say good bye 'cause your hearts already gone
Pack my bags take the midnight train unless you say I'm wrong

Change my mind, say you couldn't live without me
Say you're crazy about me with a look with a touch
Change my mind, I'm lookin' in your eyes for the love we left behind
It's not too late to change my mind
