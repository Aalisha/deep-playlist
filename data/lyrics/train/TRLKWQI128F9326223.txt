Up on the hill lies an old broken house
Memories built, frozen by someone else
I can sense you're still there, there waiting

A ghost roams the land
Shedding tears across the grass
The blades grow with sadness and flowers never last
They're wilting away and die waiting
You sense there's danger for the butterfly

Oh my love, if only you'd come and take me
Paint me with life and bail me out of this plight
...
