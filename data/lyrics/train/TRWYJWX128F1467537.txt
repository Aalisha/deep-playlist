It's not fair what they put me through
Please tell me what I'm supposed to do
Why do I get myself in this situation?

There must be some logical
Answers why I rob the cradle
Can this be love or just infatuation?
Oh boy!

Little girl come out and play
I got some candy for my baby
It's your sweet sixteenth birthday celebration

Thank heaven for Little girls
who grow up in a most peculiar way

You might think she's too young for me (Little Girls)
You know I always say you're as young as you feel (As you feel)
Yeah, I might be crazy 'cause I like them so young (Little Girls)
