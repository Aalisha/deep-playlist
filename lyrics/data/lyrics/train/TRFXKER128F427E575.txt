From my past life a vision comes;
A girl is falling
There she awaits me, calls me on
And she cries;
"Help me to release my soul
trapped inside with no control"

As She awaits me, my dream unfolds
I try to reach out
And still She sees me through mist and cold
And still She cries;
"Take me home to your world
Free me from this demon's hold"

A girl from the land of control
Waiting for release from this hold

Memories burn no control
Visions unfocused cannot hold
...
