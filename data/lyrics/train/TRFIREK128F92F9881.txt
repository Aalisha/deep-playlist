Cannot get a grip.
Living in a distant unconcerned cycle of shit.
The rats are closing in, while the flesh crumbles just beneath the skin,
Without trust, fear consumes the mind, without trust,
Fear consumes the mind, how can I trust you,
When you can't even trust yourself,
You get all high and think everybody is talking shit,
You grab a gun or a knife and all you want to do is kill,
A genius of manipulation and extremely paranoid,
Writhing in all its sickness.
