Trees will make a forest
Trees will make a boat
These are all the harder
Words you have to know
If everyone's a structure
Where their own saviour sits
Then I'm a little red house
But no one's living in it

Cars are little blood cells
We are oxygen
City is the airways
Suburbs appendages
She was feeling lonely
...
