He hoped to be remembered as the one
Who told his men to turn back and go where we'd begun
Roses are the flower he would prefer
Scatter all his ashes on the pier

Genova Heights, Genova Heights

Are hard to leave, are hard to leave

You didn't know that you thought was good
And now you're back in the neighborhood
I see you and I never should
