Help! I need somebody
Help! Not just anybody
Help! Ya know I need someone
Help!

When I was young was so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone and I'm not so self-assured
Now I find, I've changed my mind and opened up the door

Help me if you can I'm feelin down
And I do appreciate ya bein' 'round
