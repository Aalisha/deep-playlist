All is fair 
I'm trying to make you notice me but you don't care 
You play me like a broken game of Snakes and Ladders 
Or cards or piano or a record that's been thrown in the trash 

I like you 
I've liked you since I saw you walking down my street 
I like your little vibe and your clothes and feet 
And your hair and your eyes and your 
nose and your face and your life 

I know your name 
And I've got your number 
I don't wanna save the world 
I just wanna waste some time with you 
We're both so young 
We might as well face it 
I don't wanna change nothing 
I just wanna waste some time with you 

Three blind mice 
I may as well be asking them for stable advice 
...
