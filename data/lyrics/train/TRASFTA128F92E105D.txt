One eye in the sun, one in the night
Sleep tight, sleepwalk like honey, honey
Oh my, capital I LOVE U
Put it in a letter honey
I could kiss you underwater
I could in the rearview mirror
XO, took my heart and crossed it
Set it down and lost it
Set it down and lost it
Say it again...

Get the guns out, get the guns out
Get the guns out, get the guns out
Get the guns out, get the guns out
Your love is a deserter
Your love is a deserter

One eye in the sun, one eye in the night
...
