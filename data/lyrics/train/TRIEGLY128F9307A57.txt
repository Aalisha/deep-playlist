(Fonz)
I don't know what you goin thru lately
But you stressin it and its drivin me crazy
You wont even make love to me lately
Somebody told you they was havin my baby

(Vee)
I heard it all I was gettin my nails done
She was braggin how your record when platinum
You were crushin on a leather couch
You were out there trickin with that chick all up in my house

Did you sleep with her
Did you sleep with him
He works at my job
She was just a friend
Saw you at the club
Well I saw you too
Fingerpointing me
Fingerpointing you

(Vee)
She knew it all even talked about your tattoo
Tell me how you gonna say it wasnt bout you (wasnt me)
Saying how you like to suck on toes
She knew all the things that you know that only I should know

(Fonz)
You played the role I was workin in the studio
Gettin paid while you gave up the botty yo
Another brotha is gettin all my time
You was out there trickin
when I thought that shit was all mine all mine
