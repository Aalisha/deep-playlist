Somebody tell me
What has this man got
He makes me feel
What I don't wanna feel

Somebody tell me
What has this man got
He makes me give
What I don't wanna give

On solid ground
I feel myself sinkin' fast
I grab a hold
But I don't think it's gonna last

I'm slowly losin' my ground
Slowly sinkin' down
Trapped by this thing they call love
Oh baby

(Hooked on this thing called love)
