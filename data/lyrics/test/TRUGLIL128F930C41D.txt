The air is steam and fire
A lift-off to negate defeat
A victory imperfect, there's always more
It's all we've ever longed to reach
And all we've ever longed to see
Someday, somewhere
On a highway to the sun
With marvelled eyes, with blinded eyes we'll watch
The holocaust of our wildest dreams

From here to nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
From there to somewhere (somewhere, somewhere)
From the seas to the highest heights
From the moon to the lowest lows
From a spark to a raging fire
From the heart to the sateless mind
...
