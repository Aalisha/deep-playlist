Why do I daydream, why do I get my hopes up at all?
I've been living this Walter Mitty life for too long
Somebody save me, I'm a prisoner of my own fear
Sometimes fantasy is the only thought I can bear

My mind is a dream-filled balloon, dripping dreams into my shoes
And I'm too afraid to move to face the real world
And when I fall, I fall down hard, when will I ever learn?
Don't take your dreams to heart, you'll only wind up getting burned

Well, maybe I'm lazy but circumstances always knock me down
So I'll just lie here, never get up off the ground
But maybe it's crazy to sit and think of all the things I wanna do
What's the use in dreaming when dreams never come true?

And when I fall, I fall down hard
When will I ever learn?
