Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker

So it's on and on and on

It's heaven and hell, oh well, yeah
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning

The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on
Oh it's on and on and on
