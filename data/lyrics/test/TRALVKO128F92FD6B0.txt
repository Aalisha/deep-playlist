(Andy Sears)
 
 Synthesised, programmed and synchronised
 Detailed, computerised--no room for error
 Specified, labelled and classified
 Free mind has 'paralysed imagination'
 
 Educate, break down and formulate
 Dictate, Don't speculate, --Don't be a failure
 Parasite,--Know, sense, think, read and write
 Translating black and white, Hungry for logic...
 
 Stand fast--
 Take a look at yourself
 In a moment realise
 We are thinking today
 Take a look, take a look
 Take control of yourself
 For a moment realise
 We are thinking today
 Today, today,--take a look!
 
 Doters of the silicon
 Enslaved by self-design
 Dependant on the life-blood
 and body of their sun
 Each cry for understanding
 Begins and ends at the grave--
 From cradle to grave
