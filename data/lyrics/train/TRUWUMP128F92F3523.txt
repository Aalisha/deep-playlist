'Ariel, listen to me. The human world, it's a mess.
Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there'

The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake

Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?
Under the sea, under the sea

Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore, they work all day

Out in the sun, they slave away
While we devotin', full time to floatin'
Under the sea
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll

The fish on the land ain't happy
...
