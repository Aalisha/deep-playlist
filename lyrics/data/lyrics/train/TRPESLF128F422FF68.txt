I'd sing a song for you
You know I'd even change my tune
I'd pull you up
When you drown in the water, baby
I'd jump the highest mountain
Swim across the ocean blue
Could never imagine you
With another, baby

Bridge:
Am I having a breakdown?
Am I going insane?
You do me then leave for another girl
I wake up every morning crying
You're not there

Chorus:
I get the feeling that
You're looking for a new beginning
You change your mind every minute
One day you want me
Then the next you leave
It's never-ending
...
