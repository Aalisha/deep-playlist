Freak me baby (ah yeah)
Freak me baby (yeah just like that)
Freak me baby (c'mon... c'mon)
Freak me baby

Let me lick you up and down
Til' you say stop
Let me play with your body baby
Make you real hot
Let me do all the things you want me to do
Cuz tonight baby I wanna get freaky with you

Baby don't you understand
I wanna be your nasty man
I wanna make your body scream
then you will know just what I mean
(then you know what I mean)
24 carat gold
Don't want the night to grow cold
I wanna lick you up and down
(And) then I wanna lay you down
C'mon sexy

Let me lick you up and down
Til' you say stop
(Everytime I think about Your Love I want to lick You down)
