Every time I see your hair falling across your face
Want to get down on my knees, pray to you, yeah
Every time I see your hands hanging loosely at your side
Ten long fingers, I just want to run and hide

Is that the way it feels for you?
Is that the way it feels for you?
Is that the way it feels for you?
That's the way it feels for me

Is that the way it feels for you?
Is that the way it feels for you?
Is that the way it feels for you?
That's the way it feels for me

Every time I see your lips, every time I kiss your cheek
I know that soon you'll be gone and I won't see you for weeks
How do you think that makes me feel, knowing that you're out there
Wondering where you're going and wondering who you're seeing

Is that the way it feels for you?
Is that the way it feels for you?
Is that the way it feels for you?
That's the way it feels for me
