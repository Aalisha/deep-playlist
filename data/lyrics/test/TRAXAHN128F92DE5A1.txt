(Verse #1)
Tyrone:
There’s something in the air, and it doesn’t smell so good
I wish I didn’t have a nose, I’d remove it if I could

Uniqua:
You’re not kidding, it smells real bad, it’s a really awful smell, the swamp is super stinky...

Pablo:
And I don’t feel so well!

Uniqua:
Well, we gotta get this message through and to the other side
There’s only one thing we can do, hold your nose and say “P.U.!”

(Chorus)
All: P.U.! Look out! P.U.! Watch out! P.U.! Better jump! P.U.! Sure is stinky!
