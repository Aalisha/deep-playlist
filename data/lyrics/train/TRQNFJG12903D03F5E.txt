She was sittin' in the corner of a cafe
In the burnin' heart of downtown Sante Fe
Pickin' on a Gibson
and singin' "baby, can't you see"

She was buzzin' like a battlefield tracer
She was grindin' the gears on a pacer
I said, "Sister Bloody Mary,
Won't you do a little number for me?"

She said I'll sing you any song that you wanna hear
Just pull up a barstool and buy me another beer
Take me away, take me away from here
