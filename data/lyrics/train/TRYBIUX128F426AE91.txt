Our love knows no limits
And our love knows no bounds
Hear it ring through the hills and canyons
Isn't love profound?

It shows us the life that we know we can live
It teaches us how to forget and forgive
It gives us the harvest from sweet mercy fields
It rescues, it nurtures, it calms and it heals
