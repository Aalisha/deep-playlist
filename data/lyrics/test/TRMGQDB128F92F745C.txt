Summer, it turns me upside down
Summer, summer, summer
It's like a merry-go-round

I see you under the midnight
All satins and bows
High shoes with the cleats a clickin'
A temperamental glow

But then you let me go
I got a hold on you, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you tonight
I got a hold on you, I got a hold on you
I got a hold on you, yeah that's right
