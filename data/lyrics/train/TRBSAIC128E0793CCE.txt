Out of all the boys, you're not like the others
From the very first day, I'd knew we'd be lovers
In my wildest dreams, my darkest desires
Would I declare to you your love takes me higher

Just when we both thought our lives were set in stone
They shone a light and brought us together

We are two in a million
We've got all the luck we could be given
If the world (the world) should stop (should stop)
We'll still have each other
And no matter what (no matter what)
We'll be forever as one

Its a crazy world where everythin's changin'
One minute you're up and the next thing you're breakin'
When I lose my way and the skies they get heavy
It'll be okay the moment you're with me
