All I saw, not in me
Nothing left, I can see
What you are, What you've done
And I cannot be myself

Fill me up with your words
What you came here for
Fight me, Fight you, Fight everyone!

For I now know exactly what I'm in for
Deny that I never was what you cared for

(I) This can't be
(Power)Same as me

Watch me break inside I am an outcast to myself
