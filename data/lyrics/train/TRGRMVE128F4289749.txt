(Henry Paul/Van Stephenson/Greg Jennings)

Whirlwind running through my head
Wasted words that people said
The wind is howling at my door
I don't listen anymore

The darkened sky blocks out the sun
Still reeling from the damage done
If I go out and chase that wind
I might not make it back again

Let 'em whirl, who am I to say
You gotta do things different
I know a better way
Let 'em whirl, there's a child in everyone
Who's got to ride the storm out
To see who'll they'll become
...
