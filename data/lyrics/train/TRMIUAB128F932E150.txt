I moved when I see it,
You've gotta feel it, oh,
Troubles with the TV on,
Feel so devastated,
And activated,
Oh come on,
Come on lets see some action,
I say its no secret,
So don't you keep it,
Come on and get on the floor and just:

Break it out
Get it all out
and start freaking out
Just so we can
Make it out
Get off your feet and
Make this count
Ooh

Oh friends
Please excuse me
