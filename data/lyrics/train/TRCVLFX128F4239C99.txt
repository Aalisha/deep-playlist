Some man say dem a rider but dem a slip saddle
An claim say dem a dally but dem a wiggle waggle
So dem want yuh bend gal don't help dem out
Gal dont gaggle

An if yuh buck dem a road an dem a buss maggle
Just chat dem wid yuh fren gal an giggle
Cause a yuh have the upper hand right yah now
Gal yuh never gaggle

Yuh never gaggle suh him caan tell himfren nutten
A him flop himself and dat a big suppen
Tek on big heavy wuck an nuh know nutten
Check say yuh soft, yuh nearly wine off him suppen

Bwoy see di meat an start dream bout mutton
Mouth get watery an a move like glutton
Slerp pass yuh neck a stray pass yuh belly button
Bwoy what a suppen, yes what a suppen
