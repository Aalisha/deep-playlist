And through the grief and pain, I'm half insane
I give an inch you take a mile
You throw away the key, ignore my plea
You cut me down without a trial

(You keep me hanging by...) hanging by a thread
(You keep me hanging by...) leaving me for dead
(You keep me hanging by...) I heard it when you said,
(You keep me hanging by...) "Keep him hanging by a thread"
...
