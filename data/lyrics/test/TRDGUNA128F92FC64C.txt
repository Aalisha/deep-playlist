First I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you
By my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinking in how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad
Look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me

Oh now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried
To hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
