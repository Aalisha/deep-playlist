Walking through the empty rooms
The halls and lawns where children used to play
I can write the storyline
From secrets of the past
Looking through the doom and gloom
The chapel where you bent your knees to pray
I can feel a heart resigned
From love that's meant to last

Now I know what you've been through
The tears you've tried to hide
Let me prove my trust in you
...
