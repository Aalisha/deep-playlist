Nocturnal poetry:
Dressed in the whitest silver you'd smile at me
Every night I wait for my sweet Selene

But still...

Solitude's upon my skin
A Life that's bound by the chains of reality
Would you let me be your Endymion?

I would
Bathe in your moonlight and slumber in peace
Enchanted by your kiss in forever sleep

But until we unite
I live for that night
Wait for time
Two souls entwine

In the break of new dawn
My hope is forlorn
Shadows they will fade
But I'm always in the shade
Without you...

Serene and silent sky
Rays of moon are dancing with the tide
...
