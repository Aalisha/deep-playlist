Ohhh yeah wohhh yeahhh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Girl you gotta know what you're doing to me,
When your giving me that sexy thing, dontever change what you do with your body,
It feels so beautiful and its so right,
This girl shes goin on with us every night,
I can't hold back so its one in the hole,
You can just call me, get down tonightwit' your love.

Sweet lovin' honey,
Girl it funny got me open wide the word to my dollar bill,
Thats where I'm putting my money girl you know...

You'll never stop bomb diggy diggy when we get jiggy,
let me piggy back ride on it all night long,
While I'm singing my song,
All through the hoodie hoodie wanna get that goodie goodie,
You'll never stop bomb diggy diggy,
Bomb bomb diggy can I get some,
Of your bomb diggy,
Jello jello goodie chocolate puddie,
Wanna get a little bit of your goodie goodie,
Goodie goodie.
