Jane became insane
Na na na, na na
Na na na, na na
Jane became insane
Na na na, na na
Na na na, na na

She's a high class fella
There's something 'bout her that you don't understand
She got me raffled up and ready to go
She got everything under control
She got everything under control, control, control

I see her and then she starts to undress
With a smile that you will never forget
Comin' down with the clash to connect
She was out and now she's out for success
...
