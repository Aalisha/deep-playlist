I just can't believe you're gone,
Still waiting for morning to come
When I see if the sun will rise
And the way that your by my side
When we had so much in store
Tell me what is it all reaching for

When we're through building memories
I'll hold yesterday in my heart, in my heart
They can take tomorrow and the plans we made,
They can take the music that we never play
All the broken dreams, take everything,
Just take it away
They can never have yesterday
They can take the future that we'll never know
They can take the places that we said we would go

All the broken dreams take everything

Just take it away
They can never have yesterday
