I keep listening, very quietly.
You're discussing, your philosophy.
There's a long list, of what's wrong with me.
And you go on talking endlessly... now.

What's the problem?
What's the question?
What's the answer?
Where's this heading?

You keep talking.
Where's it going?
If there's an answer I don't know it...

Please,
You're killing me.
Please,
You're killing me with all these questions.

I've been trying to get along with you.
