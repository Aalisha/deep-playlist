I won't walk away from you, not like this
I have unfinished business
We went away for a minute, I know
Two years and a minute I suppose, here we go

Back on this journey again
For worse or for better, we came to make amends
With ourselves, our friends and our families
This is for them now

I've seen a lot of changes
(A lot of changes)
Within ourselves, within our scene
I'm not trying to rearrange things

There's only one way, I can say this
(I can say this)
We've come back for the crown
It's time to claim it
