Left a good job in the city
Workin' for the man ev'ry night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin' 'bout the way things might have been.

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin'.
Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of pain down in New Orleans
