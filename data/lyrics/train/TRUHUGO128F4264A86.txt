I remember eyes that shined
As they looked so hard back into mine
Now it's just a memory
So I'll set you free

I hear you through the wire
The words all sound like noise
What happened to the fire in your voice
Don't try to hide the distance
It's just too big to ignore
We work it out like business
It won't work anymore

I remember eyes that shined
As they looked so hard back into mine
Now it's just a memory
So I'll set you free
oh-oh, I'll set you free

Still sometimes late at night
Moonlight comes into my window
I can make believe it's how it used to be
