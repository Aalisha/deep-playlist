Courtesan has sung
And Nadia says the crowd's too young
And Amber says she hates guitar

The Courtesan has sung
And Nadia says the crowd's too young
And Amber says she hates guitar

Think of the scene where a washed-up actor
Wipes the makeup off his wife
And says
Morticians must've took you for a whore

The Courtesan has sung
And Nadia says the crowd's too young
And Amber says she hates guitar

The stranger finds you in your home
Says, "Brother, your work's got no soul"
You say, "Brother, bite your tongue,"
"It is my soul that you have won"
