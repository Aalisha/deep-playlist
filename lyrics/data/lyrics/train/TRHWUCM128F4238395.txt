This is a brand new problem, a problem without any clues
If you know the clues it's easy to get through

But you look confused and you dont know what to do
It's hard to get an answer if you havent got a clue
If you work it out tell me what you find

If the least you can do is show some restraint
Then the most you can do is get carried away

I can see that you look confused and you don't know what to do
