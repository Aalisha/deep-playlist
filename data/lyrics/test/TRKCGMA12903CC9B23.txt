Met him in the schoolyard, five years old
Told him I would love him 'til I'm cold
We held hands, we took walks
My first kiss was at the docks

Where his dear old daddy works
We stopped by to bring him lunch
To say hello, to say goodbye
Was so sweet, I wanna die

He laid me back upon my bed
Lifted up my tiny head
Put his lips upon my neck
Gave me just the sweetest peck
...
