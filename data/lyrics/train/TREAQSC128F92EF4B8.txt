In the night, in the light of the day.
Between the night, in the light of the day.
Between the night, in the light of the day.
Between the night, in the light of the day.

In between the night, and the light of the day.
Between the night, and the light of the day.
Between the night, and the light of the day.
I'm better off in the shade.

My hair, touch you up, and I feel
Behind a disguise.
My thoughts are lies.

Can't talk 'cause my lips are sealed.
I'll never be heard, if I'm not sayin' a word.
Though now, no explanation will ever do.
No special location fit for the truth.
Can't talk 'cause my lips are sealed.
My hair, touch you up, and I feel.
