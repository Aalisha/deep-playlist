Original:
Making promises I can't keep
Do I show, up empty
Should I beg for your mercy?
Do you know, I'm glad to be

Do you hear me when I weep?
Cause I search, I search for peace
If I should die within my sleep
So you know, hold me

Do you hear me when I weep?
Cause I search, I search for peace
If I should die within my sleep
So you know, hold me
