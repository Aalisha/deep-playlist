Hearts break too fast
When the sentimental
Won't stay, won't last
When it's love at first sight
So why are my convictions
Blinded by your spotlight

Can't breathe, can't sleep
Cause the medication
I'll kiss goodbye to my reservations
I know theres other fish out in the sea
Not for me
I want you

If I can't have you
Then I don't want anyone
I don't want anyone
If I can't have you
Then all the damage has been done
Baby
We can break these rules
If you wanna have some fun
If you wanna have some fun
Think of all the love that you would lose
If I can't have you (If I can't have you)
