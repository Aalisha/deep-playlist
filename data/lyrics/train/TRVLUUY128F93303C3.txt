Okay, here we go...

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Don't let your deal go down
Come on

Mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm...

There's a murmur going 'round
It's a low kind of moaning sound
I don't know where this blues come from
It's just a death rattle on the tongue
It's a scream inside a void
Or a howling wind outside
Well, I can't ignore this feeling
Lord, it leaves me so unsatisfied

Come on!
Yeah

I'm a child in a hostile land
Crying for a mother's hand
And I'm marked by color, wrapped in skin
Tied by history and original sin
