Day in, day out
That same old voodoo follows me about
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you
And darling, I think of you, day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle, one possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
...
