You're so meaningless and forgettable
You gotta figure it out
Figure it out and let it go

You wanna bury us with the bones
Now tell me what the fuck do you know
You're gonna hide behind those words you say
But don't think that I don't know

We wanna bleed for more
We never wanna get old
We don't wanna get lost in the fashion
Come on

You wanna bury us with the bones
...
