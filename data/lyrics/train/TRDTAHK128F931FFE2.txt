I never had a love to call my own
I was about to give up
And then you came along
Just to have your tender kiss
Thrills me for days and days

I don't care what nobody says
I want you for always
Now that I found you
I want to stay around
So make me yours, make me yours

You already captured my heart and my soul
Now I want you to take full control
I need the love that only you can give
...
