I say Clap Your Hands everybody
I say Clap Your Hands come on
[x4]
Come on, come on, come on ...

I've got to move on cause it's a saturday night
(cause it's a saturday night)

Everybody around gotta step into the light
the beat is risin'
and the night is still young
you put your hands into the ground
listen to the sound
can I see the magic in the air
...
