You must plan and you must train
For the battle you don't want
To defend what you love
That's how the war begins

So when you walk away
Leaving the killing fields
You will be soon aware
What you have lost

Peace is impossible
No matter what it seems
Someone's killing someone
Even in your dreams

You can't give them a reason
