Warrior, show me the way
Warrior, show me the way

Show me how you got to be so strong
Want you there if ever I'm wrong
Oh warrior, show me the way
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

I've been thinking about you since I began
Give me time, I'm doing all I can
You've been stealing my attention all day
I hope to get you coming my way

Everyday it gets better
You fought battles and you never let up
