Exotica Rose
Works the shows in the evening
Exotica Rose
Works for dollars and dimes
Exotica Rose
Nobody knows her secret
Wherever she goes men shout
"Hey Rose got the time?"

Exotica Rose
Dances in beads and in satin
Tall and bejeweled
Don't be fooled by her mystery and spice
Her Tangos fandangos
Her grace unmistakingly Latin
You can buy her a drink
But don't think she's a girl with a price
