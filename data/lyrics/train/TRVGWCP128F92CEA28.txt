i pictured a place that is and always will be heaven 
to the eyes ears nose and mouth 
but most of all my dying heart can soothe and regain its love and affection for all 
but especially you 
there's a special place knowing no end 
to me myself and whatever i become 
this thing inside that ticks away 
ticks slower with each coming day 
...
