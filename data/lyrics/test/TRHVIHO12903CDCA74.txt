Slither around with a crown
Dress in white to fool the crowd
Venom spewed out of your mouth
Sugar coated it goes down
Broadcasting - your own creed
On the inside you're full of greed
Glittering - dynasty - neo tower of babel
Praying on the weak and hungry
You take all they have
Televise every single cry
"donate now to dry your eyes"
