Do you enjoy the distortion?
Stomp box yourself to the ground
Do you enjoy the distortion?
Mad fuzz give birth to the sound

Are you singing
Oh, fascinate me
Just fixate the distortion
Don't complicate me
It's so easy like this now

Do you enjoy the distortion?
It's amplifying my brain
Do you enjoy the distortion?
That overdrives you insane

Well are you singing
Oh, fascinate me
Just fixate the distortion
Don't complicate me
