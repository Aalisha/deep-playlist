I got it all figured out
I know just what it's gonna take
And ain't nothin' that can't be put back
Together when it breaks

All I need is a plan, a place to begin
And a way to understand
How to put back the pieces again

Don't need another sunny day
What good would that do?
Don't need another rainstorm
Try to wash away these blues
