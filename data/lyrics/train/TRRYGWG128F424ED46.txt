walking in the hallway terrified and feeling like a
worm in the dark, laughing in the classroom, tripped
up on the stairs and the teacher doesnt know who you
are hey... fuck you tough guy. standing in detention
people staring, hung beneath a picture of mars
swimming through the garbage, pushed into a locker and
the blood really started to flow on my shirt and it
hurts and its worse now, hey... fuck you tough guy, no
...
