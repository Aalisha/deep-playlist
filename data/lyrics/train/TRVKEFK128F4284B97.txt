Chorus:
I won't give up, my path is clear
I'll take your hand
Walk to the Promised Land
I won't give up, my path is clear
I'll take your hand
Walk to the Promised Land

Oooh, I'm walking in Love, yeah
In Love all around me, say now

Oh, the choice is getting smaller, yes
Oh, it seems the battle lines are
Oh, they're being drawn
Oh yes, I think it's time we became Love Warriors, yes
Oh say, I know that if we get together
We can win this race
Oh come on and be strong, yes

Chorus:
