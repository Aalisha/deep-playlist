We came like a bullet from the valentine
Like a man who was running from the rest of time
I can't move now
You're all doomed now
All these things ruined always was a good time
The emergency I haven't got a lot of time
I can't hear now
I must leave now

We have the right to succeed
with the fear I'm in
you have to push me in
we have the right to succeed
but the fear I'm in
you'd have to push me in

yeah
yeah, yeah
yeah
