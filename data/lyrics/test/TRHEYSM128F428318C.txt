Pick me up been bleeding too long
Right here, right now, I'll stop it some how

I will make it go away. Can't be here no more
Seems this is the only way. I will soon be gone
These feelings will be gone ...

Now I see the times they change. Leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take. All alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can. Does this make me not a man?

Shut me off. I'm ready, heart stops
...
