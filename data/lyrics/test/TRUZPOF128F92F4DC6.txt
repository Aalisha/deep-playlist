I'm the singer you're the song you write the words I'll sing along
We're gonna make it to the top and baby we won't stop
I know a young boy who's strong
I'm the stars you're the sky close together we'll get by
We won't hear a word they say we'll just do it our way
And I know we'll show 'em all someday
