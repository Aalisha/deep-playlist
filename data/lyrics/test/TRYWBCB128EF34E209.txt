I met a girl
She's from my world
Now she's gone
She had to run
I want to go
Where no one else can know
Leave it all behind
Where no one else can find
Just like a setting sun...
Just like a setting sun...
Just like a setting sun...
Just like a setting sun...
La la la la la la la
Just like a setting sun...
Just like a setting sun...
Just like a setting sun...
...
