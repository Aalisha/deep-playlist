Frozen soil... A dim moonlight
I've been.on this glorious ride
Raise the arms in victory
I've seen... on this glorious night

I've kept my eyes open wide
Through my dream I was given a hint:
"My sky is darker than yours, my star is brighter than yours"
A glance to the moonlight shadow reveals the runes of yesterday:
"I am of Astral Strain, my sky is darker than thine"

Die... die... die!
I... I...I... despite
Destroy!
...
