It's words you forget to anniversary songs
Bottles bite back your tolerance wrong
Your good intentions count for little anymore
If you're sorry why wage war?

I'm not fully convinced
That something wrong with this
Could another point of view biased and untrue
Tear me away from you

Will you be my valentine
If I'm a world away
