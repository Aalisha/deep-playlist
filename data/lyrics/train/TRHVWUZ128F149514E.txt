Stop, what's that everybody
Stop, what's that everybody
What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down
What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down

Welcome to the world of a kid named Mikey
Who had only one reason to be hated be Whitey
Raised on a farm outside of South Bend
Where they hated on him 'cause he was African American

But three years later, Mikey was the town pride
Basketball Mikey went and got himself a full ride
Earned his acceptance on the hardwood floor
And that's something white America would never ignore

Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's goin' down
Stop, hey, what's that sound
Everybody look what's goin' down

What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down
I wanna know just what's goin' down
What's goin' down I'll tell ya what's goin' down
You wanna know just what's goin' down

Take a look around
Everything is comin' down
Do you hear the subtle sounds
Of our morality slippin'

People on the go
We'll be reapin' what we sow
Yeah, we say we want to know
