Ladies and gentlemen
Children of all ages
It's me, Jeru the Damaja
And I'm here to present to you today
The bullshit
Yes, this is the bullshit, the extreme bullshit
The absolute bullshit
This is the bullshit of bullshit
This bullshit is so bullshit, I NEVER wanna hear this bullshit
on the radio
Or in my children's ears, cause it's bullshit
You know? So, as we talk about the bullshit
and what bullshit is
I'ma drop the bullshit on you right now
You know, the bullshit goes like this
