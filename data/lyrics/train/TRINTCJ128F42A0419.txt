Ao!

What were you thinkin'
When you went down?
It's kinda funny
Since we always stuck around

Yeah!

What were you doin'
What went so bad?
You and me togheter
And everything we had

Run into a future
Try not hiding from my past
I'm looking for tomorrow
And the next day just as fast

On... ly one...
...
