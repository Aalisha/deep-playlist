We're gonna get ready!
Time to roll on the street
Getting off the grey?
move on not take believe
I'll be the captain of the ship
'Cause I've been here before
When my heart was ill
Now I've come back for more
We gonna get ready (2x)

All I've ever known
Is take another swing
I gonna bring it home
...
