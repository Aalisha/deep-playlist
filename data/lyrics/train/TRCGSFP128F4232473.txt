Build us a vehicle
Set us a course
Pick up your sickle
Get on board

We're all going on a trip out
We're all going on a trip out
We're all getting, all getting out

Out with the daggers
Off with the gloves
There is so much
That you can loath

And I can't stop thinking about it
And I can't stop working it out
It doesn't come much bigger than this
You see a point and you make a wish
Everything tragic, take it away
...
