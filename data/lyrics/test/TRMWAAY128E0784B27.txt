Seeing through a hole in time, looking at this world of mine
All the words we've had to say, all the dreams to light the way
It's been fine though we've been apart
But it's only just begun

Far away from home
But baby, I'm not alone

Lift me up
Turn me around
I'm gonna get my feet off the ground
Lift me up
Turn me around

Lift me up
Turn me around
I'm gonna get my feet off the ground
Lift me up
Turn me around
(Turn, turn, turn, turn)
