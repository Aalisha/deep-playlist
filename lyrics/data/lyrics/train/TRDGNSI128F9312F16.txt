The way that I get around
The things
That I'm afraid of
Is just to pretend
Some day I will
The way that I get around
The things
That I am scared of
Is just to pretend
There is a pill

Someday I'm gonna take
The biggest pill ever
And then I'll be high
As a kite
I never took a drug
I never drank no gin
But I've never been
Quite alright

Alright, ok
Don't fight
Just stay

The way that I get around
What's less than entertaining
...
