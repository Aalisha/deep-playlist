Try Me On for Size

(Annette Tucker/Jill Jones)


I'm not a dreamer, I'm a do'er
your hopes for escape are gettin' fewer
I know what you need, baby, you're gonna see it my way,
I know you're shoppin' around but don't pass up
this good thing you've found.
Stop your lookin' baby what you want is standin'
right in front of your eyes.
Try me on for size
