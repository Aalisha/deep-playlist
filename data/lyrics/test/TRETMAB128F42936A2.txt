All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places
Worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going no where
Going no where

And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression
No expression
Hide my head I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow
No tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the bestI've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
'Cause I find it hard to take
...
