No Trace of Shame
Ulysses Siren

Screams of terror, as the world decays
Extinction of mankind, is just a matter of days
Learning the truth the behind your back
Come forth as lies
Supporting leaders of this kind has only left us...
Destined to die!

Recollection, dreams of despair
Only to awaken to constant nightmare
Fearing the end, "How long will it last?"
...to ignite our conclusion of a nuclear blast
