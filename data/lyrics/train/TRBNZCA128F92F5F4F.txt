Oh x8

If the world stops turning or my legs stop working
Then I'll still feel alright
If the photos fading or my memory keeps erasing
Then I'll still feel alright

'Cause it's strong, and it has taking me over, over
I am lost and I need to be found

I'm lost in Emma-Lee, oh
I really like it, but I'm losing control
Emma-Lee, I'm scared
I kinda like it 'cause I feel right at home
Oh, Emma-Lee

Oh x8
