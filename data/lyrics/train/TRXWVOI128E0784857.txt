It feels like Spring again
You sprung this on me and then
It feels like Spring again
But I guess it never really ends
It just comes around again
And I collect all the cards that you sent
But I could not say
If I should stay
I might not even
Even remember your name
Oh what a shame
Oh I'm a bad valentine, a bad valentine
I'm a bad valentine
...
