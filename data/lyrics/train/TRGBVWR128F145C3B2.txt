[listener]
yeah when you get up today to find me not around your place
crying realising the events of days past
years creeping by and the minutes are forever
deep impressing depressing into your heart
asking the whys and hows contimplating the start of your end
remembering late nights with friends breath grasping for the sides
reaching for a platue that spins not
i'm so sorry i would not have meant to go
but i hope you know that through all the sorrow and hurt that im better
i know it sucks to hear how all yall are better
ill try the hardest while im alive to get the most done
it doesnt make any sense though when death takes you for a run
its hard to keep the memory of me locked deep into your arteries part of the leak
just can't believe through all the acomplishments and memories that none of it matters
the world keeps going life keeps showing how minute it is in the grand scheme of this
so when tomorrow comes and you have to wake without me
