If she were any other woman
I wouldn't be going home right now
I'd stay out a little while longer
Put another coat of paint on this town

If she were any other woman
I'd go home just to keep the peace
But I've found she's where I find it
So that's where I wanna be

If she were any other woman
She wouldn't have this hold on me
Ain't no woman like my woman
So there ain't no other man I'd rather be
...
