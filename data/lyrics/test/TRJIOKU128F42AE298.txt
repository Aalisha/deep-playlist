Fire descends from on high in the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride and ride on Mount Zion
Rub me the wrong way, taking the highway
Rubbing sticks together but your fire's man made

Capitalize on hot air, soar like an airplane
Yearn to rise in the sky quick high like cocaine
False pride is suicide but you've got nothing to gain
Babylon's buildings raise like flames

Drowning in their champagne
Explosion pulled the pin in the hand grenade
Soul stain blowing up in your own domain
Fire crackers oh and ah but they never maintain

Fires burning, flames are dancing
Don't burn the house down Lord
Heavenly fire only resides
On an alter made from the ground

Fire descends on high
In the shape of a lion
Burn the sacrifice of pride
...
