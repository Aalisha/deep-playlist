Hey, what do you want from me?
As far as I can see
There's really nothing you get for free

Hey, are you dense or just unaware
When you know the one that's there
Could care less if you even breathed

There's nothing up my sleeve
Yet I'm the one deceived

Swallow your pride and choke down the pills
Keep it inside and drink to your fill
You push it aside, still waiting
For your ship to finally come ashore
Just one more drop in the downpour to ignore

I know there's a heavy cost
If compromise isn't tossed
Your dreams can be completely lost

Still afraid of change
And I'm the one to blame

Swallow your pride and choke down the pills
Keep it inside and drink to your fill
...
