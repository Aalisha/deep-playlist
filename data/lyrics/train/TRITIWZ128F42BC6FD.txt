Baby if you really love me
You had better understand
That the silver in your pocket
ain't no measure of a man
And though the fortunes of our fathers
We aspire to rise above
When you're born into a breed

Got a bad guitar and a simple song
you're a rich man's daughter, look at what you've done
You went and fell in love with a poor man's son
Baby you were born in splendor
To a house of wealth and fame
Your mother was a spender
And you grew up on a stage
