Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow the Sun)
 Del Shannon
 
 No one will understand what I've gotta do
 I've gotta find a place to hide with my baby by my side
 She's been hurt so much, they treat her mean and cruel
 They try to keep us far apart, there's only one thing left we can do
 
 CHORUS #1
 We gotta Keep Searchin', searchin', find a place to hide
