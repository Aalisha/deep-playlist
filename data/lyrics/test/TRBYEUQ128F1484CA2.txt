Silver shadow
Glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see

(Verse 1:)
I remember gazing on this quiet night
The stars were bright as they could be
Wonderin' if things would ever go right
And if there was a spot up there for me

Then one star got brighter by the minute
Strange that it seemed to have my name written in it
I reached for the star and it kissed me with it's light
It made me cast a show that was silver and bright

(Chorus:)
Silver shadow
Glowing shadow
Shining brightly
For all to see

(Verse 2:)
