They preach to the choir
Always in the permanent daylight
They toss paper tigers
From their perfect porcelain skylines

(Listen for the sound)

(As it all comes crashing down)
As it all comes crashing down

(Listen for the sound)
For the sound, for the sound
(As it all comes crashing down)
As it all comes crashing
...
