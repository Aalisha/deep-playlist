[Intro/Hook:]
Dead dead dead dead
Kill kill kill em all
Kill (leave em lyircally)
Dead dead dead dead
Die die die, die, die, die, die

(Get em!)

[Verse 1:]
When I hit em with the rythem nigga chill em to the bone
I kill em with a lyric n them niggas gettin gone
I can never finish a song, cause the competition never hold on that long
Flow faster than the minutes go on my phone
He wicked lyrical criminal, I'm on my own
The sickest individual, ya'll might know'I'm
I blow a niggas mouth out, all I show em, is I'm a monster, beast, runnin through like the Nephalif
N I'm fuckin up the best'a them
Okay nigga, let's pretend that you a bullet proof vest, n I'm an automatic weapon then
N that chest you call yourself protectin is your title
But when I'm releasing this heat, it's vital, ya die
Goin against me is suicidal
