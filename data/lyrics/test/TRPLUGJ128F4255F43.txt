Wait
The fact you did it
But don't admit it
Won't make you innocent
Fate finds you wicked
And turns you victim
For everything you have done

So justify the reason to kill
(Reason to kill)
I bet you will
You're fooling no one but yourself
But yourself
I wish you well

Oh what tangled webs we weave
When we practice to deceive
I know you well
I know you well

Actions and motives
Bear the cross
Wear the crown
There's just some evil you can't bleed out
...
