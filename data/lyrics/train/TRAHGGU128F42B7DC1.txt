Here we are sharing this moment
Oh, here we are, don't waste this moment
Believe what you feel and know that the feeling is real
Can't you see, we have all the time in the world for love?
Make it last forever, make it last

Take your time, don't try to hurry
Just take your time there's no need to hurry
'Cause love's on its way, why don't you stay here with me?
