I raise my head so slowly
Throw an arm in the air
And I turn all the lights down
And enjoy the despair
I did not feel this happening
I did not see this coming
No I did not predict this at all

Look at me bleeding
With my heart in my hand
But I just can't believe in
What I don't understand
So turn it back
Turn it back to the day before

I have a fear of flying
