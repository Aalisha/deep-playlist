Guess what I'm done writing you songs
You'll give up your job at the bank
Proving money's not fun when you're gone

So this is the first verse
It's not very long
But I'm ready to move on

Guess what I'm done writing your book
The ending got twisted around
But for all the hell that it took

The electrical wires
They'll hum in the walls
In the room that I rent now without you

I've got friends who la la lie
Will help me pull through la la lie
La la la lie

The spaceman that can't get high
I'm coming back to my girl by July
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right
...
