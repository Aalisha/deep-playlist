Outside the factory gates
For hours sit and wait
For you to turn around
And show me there's a way

I am a stranger to the life
Enchanted by the wonders of the night

I stepped into the dark
With all the broken hearts
I'm searching empty streets
Distant and apart

I am a stranger in this life
Haunted by yesterday's desires

When we meet again
You'll know I am to blame
...
