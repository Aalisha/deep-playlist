Do you wanna dance
do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance
do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance
do you wanna dance
Do you wanna dance
do you wanna dance

Do you wanna dance . . .

When can you get into the feeling
That's comin' thru the floor
can you feel it in the air
'cause you know it's always there
Makes me wanna dance some more
