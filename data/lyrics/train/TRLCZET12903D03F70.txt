Rain came down in endless sheets of thunder
Lightning bolts split pine trees down to the roots
In the shadow of the Astrodome
With a hurricane coming on strong
We used to hit the streets and go swimming in our birthday suits

Skiing in a bar ditch behind a moped
13 stitches on the corner of a sardine can
We were dirt poor Houston kids
Our whole family living on the skids
But we always had a nickel for the coming of the ice cream man

Mosquito truck blowing up DDT
Barefoot heathens running wild and free
Air raid buzzer at a noon-day scream
Living in a dream
