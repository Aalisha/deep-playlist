Oh dear,
What can I say
I'm high here
Up and spinning away
From a kiss of a thrill to be filled can someone hear me

Love, what do you say?
Your mystery winds me up to be playful
Here goes my curious sinner within is someone listening
I hope no one is listening

How do I slow down
I can relay to my heart now
I've thrown what i've known isn't love for me out?
I'm running on empty

I've gotta find some way
...
