All by myself
I was fine
No one else to remind me
Of all my pain inside
You looked at me
And I knew
You would be
The last thing I needed in my life

Oh I need you
Girl I need you
But I know it's gonna hurt
'Cause your love is gonna tear me apart
Oh I need you
Girl I need you
But I know we shouldn't start
'Cause I need you like a hole in my heart
