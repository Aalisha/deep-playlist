Change channel I am bored again
Take five and restart the game
I suggest a different approach
Remake the world with a devilish touch
Evolution is too slow ghost
Relax and sit back I am your new host
Fantastic elastic all things can be spastic
No room for bore press enter and store
We live in small shells put that on a shelf
E.S.P. for all big and small
Saga-lore mature splendor
Ragamuffin saga-puffin all you can snort
Electric eyes for sparkling flies
