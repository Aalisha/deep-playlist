Yo, niggas be askin me "yo 50 who you got beef wit?"
I'm a tell yall niggas who I got beef wit
I got beef wit any nigga I can't make no money wit
If I can't make no money wit you, fuck you nigga
G-Unit nigga, that's what'sup cause I said that's what'sup

[Tony Yayo]
I get money, money I got
So it's a 100 grams or better when I'm going to cop
I never hold the toaster cause I use my little soldier
And my down bitch as a holster, like I'm supposed ta
Heavy pistol sales for living
My gun rip through lungs and tear through tissue
While I'm out for the ends, you out for a rep
That's the same thing that have yo mama in a black dress
See me in a black lex, hard-top
My mink drop-top, fresh out the carlot
I got the gift of raw pugilist speeches(?)
So I'm gon sell like the box office features
Niggas in the hood can't see G-UNIT!
But deep in they heart they wanna be G-UNIT!
Cause we got them three b's: benzes, burners and bitches
And plus we on the road to the riches

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You can say what you want about me
As long as you don't get in the way of my money
