Lead: Carroll

Blood spilled upon the sands of time,
the years passing by take their toll
Atrocities of ages gone, their tales forgotten and old
Another wicked tyrant reigns in terror,
another city falls
Through thousands of years and millions of deaths we learn nothing changes at all

Lost from memory
Abandoned... by time
Through ages of depravity
Abandoned... by time

Though we thought the time was done when man preys on man like beast
Man is just an animal, its hunt for power will never cease
The ones who rule use you as a tool to meet their ends
Their hunger never sated,
their bloodlust infinite
...
