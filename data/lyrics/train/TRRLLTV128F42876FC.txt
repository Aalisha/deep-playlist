I'm gonna give you all (all the love I've got)
All the love I've got (all the love I've got)
Woah, all the love I've got (all the love I've got)
Woah, woah, yeah (all the love I've got)

I need you by my side
I need you to be my guy
So won't you please, please be true
And darling, if you do

I'm gonna give you all (all the love I've got)
All the love I've got (all the love I've got)
Woah, all the love I've got (all the love I've got)
Woah, yeah, yeah, yeah (all the love I've got)

Treat me right when I'm wrong
