Palm trees, green leaves
colors in the fall
happiness of spring
a sun ray, peaking through a, light rain
sharing a nightfall feeling pleasures pain
a sunrise a night gone
perfect scenery a perfect background song
your melody your harmony
the beauty of your song
to the point I can't respond

hook:
This how I feel when I'm around you
sky would fall without you
...
