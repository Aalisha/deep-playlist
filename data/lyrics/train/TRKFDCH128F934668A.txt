Only you can judge me
Only you can save me
You even the score
It's never enough until I'm back on the floor

Only you control me
Only you won't hold me
And I can take more
It's never the same until it's just like before

Every hope
Every dream
Just comes crashing down on me
Every truth
Every scheme
Just keeps breaking up around me
