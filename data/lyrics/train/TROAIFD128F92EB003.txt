It seems so dark now
Can't find which way
Knowing there were more when you first started
There's nothing that's been stolen that I can not replace (1 Peter 5: 10)
Fear is just a distant memory
When you find love surrounds you

Before you open up your eyes
Know that I'll be there
I'm always right there
Before you walk across the fire
Know that I'll be there
I'm always right there
