The pain surrounds
I watch it rain
I watch it trickle down
I feel so clear
You let it out
I watch it disappear
I don’t quite know
Just where it ends
Just where the water flows
And I can’t quite see
Just where it was
Just where it use to be

And I can’t believe in nothing
Or anyone that I can’t see
You know it’s better than it’s ever been
And that’s good enough for me
Your love was bittersweet, bittersweet, bittersweet, it’s bittersweet
...
