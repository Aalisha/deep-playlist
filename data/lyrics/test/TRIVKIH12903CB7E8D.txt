We lived in a dogfish eggcase
you could barely call it home
A sorry little lot no roof on top
But the fish left us at home
Try a little more said the girl next
door it's time to roam

Mad Lizzy Crumbs blind cobblers
thumbs were a sight to behold
She was a rum old slapper and we always
tried toget her pants off when she phoned
Left her cap by the sink it's not what you think
Oh take me home
