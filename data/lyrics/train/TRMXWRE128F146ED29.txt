You know, you must take a look at the new land
The swimming pool and the teeth of your friend
The dirt in my hand
You know, you must take a look at me

Baby, baby, I know that's the way
Baby, baby, I know that's the way

You know, you must try the new ice cream flavor
Do me a favor, look at me closer
Join us and go far
