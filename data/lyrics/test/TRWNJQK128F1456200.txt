Timothy Leary's dead.
No, no no no, he's outside, looking in.

Timothy Leary's dead.
No, no no no, he's outside, looking in.

He'll fly his astral plane,
Takes you trips around the bay,
Brings you back the same day.
Timothy Leary.
Timothy Leary.

Timothy Leary's dead.
No, no no no, he's outside, looking in.

Timothy Leary's dead.
