Oh it happens every now and then
Along the banks of the Potamus
When me and the boys gather some toys
And take care of a little bit
Sometimes it's crazy
Sometimes it's hazy
Sometimes it takes all night
In need of perfection
Bring your protection
Cause baby it'll feel so right
I don't remember the town
The town with the big bass sound

We're goin' down
To Riverside Drive
We're goin' down
To Riverside Drive

She's faster than the speed of sound
About the fastest thing I've known
...
