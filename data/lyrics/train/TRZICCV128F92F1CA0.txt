January 1, I got a lot of things on my mind
Looking at my body through a new spy satellite
I try to lift a finger but I don't think I can make the call
So, tell me if I move 'cause I don't feel anything at all

So carry me, I'm just a dead man lying on the carpet can't find a heartbeat
Make me breathe, I want to be a new man, tired of the old one, out with the old plan
