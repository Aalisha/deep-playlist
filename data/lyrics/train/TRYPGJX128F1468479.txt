I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to except the sea

Who can I believe in?
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force, who do I phone?

The stars are out and shinning
But all I really want to know
Oh, won't you show me the way everyday?
I want you, show me the way

Well, I can see no reason
You're living on your nerves
