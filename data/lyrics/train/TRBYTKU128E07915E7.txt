One two one two
She's trapped
Gonna need some help
What you think about that
One two one two
She's trapped
Gonna need some help
What you think about that
One two one two
She's what
Gonna need some help
What you think about that
One two one two
She's trapped
Gonna need some help

She sits in her armchair
Looking into space
Looking for a reason
To find her lifes place
Feeling a little bit sad
But not really all that bad
Searchin' for a dream
A dream that she's never had

She knows
She should get it (But it ain't that easy)
Her life
Kinda full of it (Cuz it's all to sleezy)
She's going out of her mind
(But she still can't hide she can't leave her life)
