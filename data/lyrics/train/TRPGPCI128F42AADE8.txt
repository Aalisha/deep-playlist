Must've been the way that you touched me
Could've been the way that you looked
Must've been the way that you loved me
Could've been the way that you cooked

But I need you, need you bad
Yes I need you, need you bad
I'm in pain when you're not around me
I'm in pain when I'm not around you
And I need you, need you bad
