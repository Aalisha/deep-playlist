Your very best friend, he just lives in a swirlBut you can help him, 'cause you know his girlAnd then you go, you talk to figures here and thereIt is so nice, to see just how you care...
You shot your arrows, and you played your witYour friend says "thanks, I'm very happy todayWithout you, this candle couldn't have been litBut I must go, I'm now back on my way!"(Don't you stand, don't you stand in my way...) chorus: And in the end: Again you're on your own And in the end you feel so fucking alone Cupido - you don't know how I understand you Cupido - is there anybody who can love you?
