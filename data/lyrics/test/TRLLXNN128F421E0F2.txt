Call.....

Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Is it all over my face?
You've caught me love dancing
Is it all over my face?
I'm in love dancing

Passed out in a shady hotel room
With a hooker faced down in the restroom
The cockroaches in hypnosis
Sippin' what's left of spilled mimosas

That hotel was so cheap
I should've brought my own sheets
He wanted it and I wanted to
What's left to do I paid for the room

I'm greasy, grimey, two-timey
Butt-sniffing animal
And if I want it I get it
I'll eat that ass like a cannibal

I don't care If you think I'm dirty
I am dirty, learn me
I masturbated till my KY faded
Unh, I'm exhausticated

It's all over your face
Tell me how does it taste?
