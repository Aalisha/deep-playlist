Time: 2: 15, the AM.
Place: Ronardo's "Boom-Boom-Room" on South Street.
I'm a hot blonde and it was a cold night.
This is my story. I ain't ashamed to tell it.
I was hungry, tired and lookin' for love.

I was just a pilgrim in the hot pursuit of love.
Wandered from disco to disco,
that's all my life was.
Suddenly you danced up against me.
It felt warm and smooth.
I knew in an instant
that you were my moment of darkest truth.

Oh, my knight in black leather,
hold me tight and love me forever.
Rings on your fingers, love in your heart.
Knight in black leather, we'll never part.

Only you can shine the light
on the dark side of my mind.
And your evil sweetness
leaves a trail of lovers behind.
When you crush me to your heart
I feel just like a queen.
