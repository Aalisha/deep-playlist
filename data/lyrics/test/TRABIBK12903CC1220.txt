Alright Dave.
So where is this place anyway?
Well it's in a secret location,
You just gotta ring this number.
Right. So who's gonna be there?
Well I dunno.
So what's it all about then?

It's a rave dave (x4)
Just lots of people in a room
Spreadin love and listenin to choons
It's a rave dave!
So what do I have to do then?
Just have a laugh and stand around,
Bob your head round up and down,
Stomp your feet upon the ground
To the kit drum as it sounds,
Throw your hands up in the air
And maybe give a little cheer,
Go to the bar and get a beer,
Go speak to that dude over there.

And then my friend will sort you out,
Cos that's what raves are all about!

'Ere Dave, see that bird over there?
She is proper nice!
