Defender of this heart
You loved me from the start, You never change
Through the highs and lows
As seasons come and go You never fail

Day after day Your love will remain
Faithful and true, You are good

You are God with us, You're victorious
You are strong and mighty to save
For Your word stands true, there is none like You
And when all else fades You remain

When troubles come my way
You guide and You sustain, lead me, I pray
