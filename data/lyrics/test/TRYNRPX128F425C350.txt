Don't understand why you can't see through me
My heart is one, calling out to you
No other love can give you what you're needing
No one is there like I am for you

He'll never change your life
He'll never change your life, girl
He doesn't know you like I do
He don't know you at all

All I can ask is your time
Just a little of your time, baby
All I can ever want is a chance to prove

I'm tellin' you, my heart wants to be there for you
Your heart, is it someone there?
My heart wants to be there for you, love
My heart wants to be there
