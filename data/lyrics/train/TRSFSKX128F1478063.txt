This is a seasonal affair
So be there or be square
The invitation said so
So just let that ego go
And watch it strike back like a boomerang
Scared stiff and not sure how to deal with it
You're a legend in this room
Only in this room

Oh goodness me
Oh goodness my mind has slipped
And wiped you away from it
Same shit, different day, same shit
Same shit, different day
Now let's, let's backtrack and back it up
We have a whole lot to prove

You hike your skirt
And pull your shirt down
To give those gents what they crave
Because as you say
You love to save
