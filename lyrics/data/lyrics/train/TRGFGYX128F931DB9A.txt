You'll find it hiding in shadows
You'll find it hiding in cupboards
It will walk you home safe every night
It will help you remember
If that's way it is then that's the way it is
If that's way it is then that's the way it is
If that's way it is then that's the way it is
If that's way it is then that's the way it is
