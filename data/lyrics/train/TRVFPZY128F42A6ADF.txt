*sigh*
hmm... its hard to imagine
I gotta try and work my way up out of this one
The clock is ticking
Tick tock tick tock tick tock
Yeah, this can't be happening to me
ya know?
whoa

Just like Eve done to Adam(you got me)
Temptation so strong I don't want to even fathom(you got me)
I'm in quicksand with cement shoes(you got me)
And like Lucille I'm singing the blues(you got me)

(Girl you are)You're my water
Like my money
You're my sugar
(You got me) You got me
say it, say it, say it yeah

Girl your love flow through me
And I can't keep my hands off you
Girl you taste so damn sweet
You got me

See you are the reason I haven't turned my TV on(you got me)
And you are the reason that I don't listen to love songs(you got me)
