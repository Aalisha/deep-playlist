How deep is that river? How deep is that river?
I don't wanna know where it's coming from
I don't need to know where it's going to
Before I place my trust in You
I just wanna know, how deep?

God said to me what He said to the tree
Grow up towards the light and one day you'll see
My son Jesus, what did He say?
Love the Lord, your God and God will show you the way
Do unto others like you wanna be done
Look deep in your heart and know that we are one

Singing, how deep is that river? How deep is that river?
I don't wanna know how fast it flows
I don't need to know if it's safe to swim
Before I put my trust in Him
I just wanna know, how deep?
