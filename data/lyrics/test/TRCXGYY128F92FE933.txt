-CHORUS-
Listen to rhythm of the wheels go 'round.
Hypnotic sound of the driver, on this old train.
I'd like to be in Tennessee, 
but they don't want me. 
I'm an outcast. 
This train's my home.

I just caught the 904, don't know where she's headin' for, or been. If I don't get caught by a railroad guard, i'll sleep
tonight in a lumber yard in the next old town she pulls in.

Listen to rhythm of the wheels go 'round.
Hypnotic sound of the driver, on this old train.
I'd like to be in Tennessee, 
but they don't want me. 
I'm an outcast.
