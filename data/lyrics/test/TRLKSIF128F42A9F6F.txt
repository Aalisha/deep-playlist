I'm a ship, I'm a ship, I'm a ship
Out on the sea
None of my love
Floating wild come back to me

So I write you a letter, I'll write you a letter
With this here pen
Don't make me wait, don't make me wait
'Cause I'm your friend

I'm in love with the garden
That is down the street
And the earth is a warm thing under my feet
And the earth is a warm thing under my feet
