Well, now she don't need to see the sun ahead
Don't need that help from God above
If you're losing her don't be sad
'Cause she will offer you heart attacks

She's tired of problems that you caused her mind
Tired of all those lies in your freak show
Tired of being alone at night
Being the lowest cat on earth

So Gloria steps out from the prison
Gloria's no longer the wasted disco girl
You've been dreaming about
Gloria, alone now forever
Gloria, away in the air now
Gloria, she's no longer your slave, no, no
