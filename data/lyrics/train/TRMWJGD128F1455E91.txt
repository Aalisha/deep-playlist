Well, I met her out at Murphy's restaurant
She said, she was fresh from the farm
And I remember thinkin' for a country girl
That she went pretty well armed

We sat there talkin' by the lobster tank
I ordered her a slow gin fizz
And when them chicken fried steaks arrived
She said, I like living like this

So I made her the queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
Times she's run off and I've got to trail her
Dang her black heart and her pretty red neck
...
