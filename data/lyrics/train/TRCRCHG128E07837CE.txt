My intuition tells me
That this relationship's not working
But we pretend we're better off not knowing
Only to realize we can't go on

Tried to tell you
But you didn't wanna listen to me
Say things we don't wanna admit to
But it's no good, 'cause it's time to walk away

I can't explain
My reasons anymore
The talking is over
And now I'm out the door

And if I don't look back
Then I won't see how much I hurt you
I really hurt you
And if I don't look back
It doesn't mean I didn't love you
I didn't love you

Please don't ask me
'Cause I can't take the way you're looking at me
