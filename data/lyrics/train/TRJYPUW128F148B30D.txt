Dirty little mind
Dirty little mind
Dirty little mind

Well I licked her clean from head to toe
I took her down for the count she was ready for more
And you know she's got a dirty little mind

I have to strap her down to keep up with her moves
She's got a dirty little mind

She's got a dirty

Dirty
Dirty
A dirty little mind
A dirty little mind
