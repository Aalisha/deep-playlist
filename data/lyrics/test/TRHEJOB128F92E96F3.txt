Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And listen, if you can't say anything real nice
It's better not to talk at all, that's my advice

We're parting, you go your way, I'll go mine, it's best that we do
Here's a kiss, I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
...
