The time has come to say goodbye
I'm asking you to please don't cry
The time to me won't be so long
To know you're happy back at home
Someday we'll meet again sweetheart
We'll meet and never more to part
Someday we'll meet again sweetheart
Don't cry, so please don't break my heart
So goodbye now, don't be blue
