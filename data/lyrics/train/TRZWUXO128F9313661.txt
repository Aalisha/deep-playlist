(Amy):
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

(Amy)
I'd rather be at home with ray
I ain't got seventy days
'cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

(Amy)
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
(Now rocking with the best Amy baby)

(Amy)
