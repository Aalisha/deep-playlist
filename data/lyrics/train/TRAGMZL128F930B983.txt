Down at thompkins square park
Where the locals are pumpin' up on passion
Taking it a bit too far
Reaching into fury
Someone's talking to you
Finger on the trigger
Everything is in view mr. pastey
Dead man such is life
Isn't it just something that somebody said?
Meet a wicked woman
Take it a bit too far
Demons in your mind, love
...
