We fell in love underneath a michelangelo sky
we saw the same things in the shapes of the clouds rolling by
a blanket of leaves and the soft summer wind
feeling the heat of the sun on our skin
that's when i learned how to fly
one kiss and you painted a picture of heaven
it's there when i look in your eyes
i swear i can see forever
underneath a michelangelo sky
One kiss and you painted a picture of heaven
