You left me with a problem
Now I know what it's all about
You took my heart and split it up
Now you know what it's all about

How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?
How do you feel my love?
Do you feel it as I walk away?

Who knows what kind of pity for
Excuse you from yourself
To justify the misery
That you put yourself within

How do you feel my love? Ay my?
Do you feel it as I walk away?
