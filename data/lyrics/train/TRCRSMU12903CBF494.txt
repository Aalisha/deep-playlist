Ooo, when will it ever change?
Ooo people, tell me when will it ever change?
I can see bells of freedom
I can't hear them ring
I see this premonition
Nearly happens every night
I see this premonition
It happens every day
I can see it when they work
I can tell by the things they say

My sisters and my brothers
On the streets all over town
I can see people dyin'
There's hatreds all around
Ooo people, will it ever change?
Sometimes I hear the bells of freedom
But I never hear them ring
...
