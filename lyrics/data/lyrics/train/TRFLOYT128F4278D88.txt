O yeah

I'm raisin' she's a cow
The way she's looking at me now... wo-o!
When conversation comes my way
I say i go to church to pray
You know, almost every day
That's when she walks away

O yeah?!
So you want to talk about it for a while
O yeah?!
So you went to school to relearn how to smile
O yeah?!
She said i had a dirty dream, she said come on
O yeah?
Well, o yeah!
