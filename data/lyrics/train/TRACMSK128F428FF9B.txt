19 Minutes

19 minutes since u hung up the phone
I'm already seeing the dark shadows growin'
I wonder what're u doing right now
Do u hurt like I hurt?
19 hours and i can't fall asleep
I've turned all the lights on
But the shadows are creepin'
All around the room that was our secret space
I can't breath, I'm incomplete

Look what u've done baby
look what I've become
I'm just bleedin', I'm bleedin'
And it doesn't stop
...
