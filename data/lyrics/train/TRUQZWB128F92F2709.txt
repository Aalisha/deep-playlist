Where is my someone who'll always understand?
The person who'll give everything, just to take my hand
What if I never feel it, what if I never know
And what if it just gets easier to spend this life alone?

Rollin' with the punches, hope my black and blue don't show
Put the bright in my eyes so no one ever knows
How I feel on rainy days or what I'd do to have always
...
