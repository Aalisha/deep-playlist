I'm ready for this love
I'm ready for this love

I? m on my way over to deliver
A message I need to give to you
It? s what you? ve been waiting for
Yea, baby, it's finally coming true

Resisting your arms that tried to find me
I started to realize you? re true
I left all my broken hearts behind me
No tears to blind me, I? m not scared anymore
Now I run to your door

'Cause I? m ready, yes, I? m ready
Baby, I'm ready for this love
'Cause everything I? ve been dreaming of
Baby, it? s this love

Don? t need a telephone to tell you
Won? t send a letter in my place
I want to be eye to eye, yea, baby
I wanna be face to face
