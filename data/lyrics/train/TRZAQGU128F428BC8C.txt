Eyes
Boring a way into me
Paralyse
Controlling completely
Now
There is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city
Burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn it, I'll burn it, I'll, I'll, I'll burn it
