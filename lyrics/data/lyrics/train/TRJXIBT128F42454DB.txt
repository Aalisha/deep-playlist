This blood that's in our veins it,
Carries all of these mistakes that we've ever made,
When we're not thinking straight.
Don't remember every name,
But it seems like every face is back at the place,
The same place they've tried to escape.

Tonight's a party for the misfits doing time. (woah)
Not giving up, just getting by.
Sticking it out through hardest times.
Tonight's a party for the misfits doing time.
Just standing in this crowded room,
Still makes me feel alive.
