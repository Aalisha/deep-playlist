The days of old
And all the stories from our shores
Have gone away
and won't return for evermore for
A brand new craze around that's making all the waves
It teaches you how not to act and how not to behave now

Tell me why should I
Turn away my eyes
From where I reside
To only find that all my time is wasted

They're not ever gonna listen
Not until you react
So perhaps there is science in violence
I don't ever wanna listen to all of that's
