About as subtle as an earthquake, I know
My mistakes were made for you
And in the back room of a bad dream she came
And whisked me away, enthused

And it's as solid as a rock rolling down a hill
The fact is that it probably will hit something
On the hazardous terrain

And we're just following the flock
'Round and in between, before we're smashed to smithereens
Like they were
And we scramble from the blame
...
