Hide your face forever
Dream and search forever

Have you ever been for sale?
When your isms get smart
Oh so selfish and mindless
With that comment in your eye

Do you think that you are hard?
Really harder than the other
Man, you're acting cold
If you are not in charge

Don't split your mentality
Without thinking twice
Your voice has got no reason
Now is the time to face your lies

Open your eyes, open your mind
...
