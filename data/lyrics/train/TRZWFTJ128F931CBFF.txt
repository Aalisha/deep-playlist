Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy

I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy.

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off 'cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies sa y they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any kid n' play

Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music, white boy I can't hear you, say it,
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
Play that funky music, white boy it, come on
Yea, a
little bit louder

now come on, come on
...
