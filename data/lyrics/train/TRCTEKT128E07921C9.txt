I'm sitting waiting on cloud nine, sitting here waiting on cloud nine
What do I have to do man?
Tell me what is going on, tell me what is going
If I remain strong I'll go to Heaven where I've been

She comes to me with open arms
She's an angel, she's an angel
We float away but she brings me back
Did I do something bad? I ask myself

Thrash, bash, kill myself, eat a bunch of trash
Thrash, bash, get some cash and spend it on some drugs
Explode into a million pieces so no one can find me
Because I'll be on cloud nine, cloud nine

Going out of my mind, raining down on cloud nine
Nothing I can do man
...
