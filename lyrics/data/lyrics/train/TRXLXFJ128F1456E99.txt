Hey
I don't sell it
I don't deal it
I don't buy it
Don't have to steal it
Got your blood running through my veins
I ain't crying for your pity
It's a shame

It's blood money, blood money
Blood money, blood money
That's to blame

You can spend it
I don't want it
It won't pay for my sins
You can deal her
She don't count for much
She's your mistress
She's your lover
She's your mother 
She's your wife
She ain't even spare change in your life

It's blood money, blood money
Blood money, blood money
Blood money, blood money 
Blood money, blood money
That's to blame
It's a shame
