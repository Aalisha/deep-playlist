In time, you'll find that it's so calm and serene
But not for now, it'll smash into your dreams
Hey, hey

Inside your mind, you keep everything so clean
But not for now, you're so keen to fill your dreams

If you want me, my feet are planted firmly in your garden
Unattached, in awe, oh, I'm ready for super stardom
If you want to, we could bounce along the road
Like no-one else does

Unavailable to see what'll happen to me
It never happens to me
Oh, and this means nothing to me
