You can always recognize it
Like you recognize the faith
Once you've got it you won't lose it
And it doesn't run away

You can push it from your mind
Never give it any time
Say it isn't what I need
But it's like holding back the sea

Love comes in and fills up everywhere
Love comes in and fills up everywhere
...
