But when I get home, gonna stay till the end of the day.
Waited so long, but I stay till the end of the day.
But when I'm gone I'll be trusting you again.
Working all night.
Making it right.
Trying so hard, so hard, so hard to be something, you'll keep
Playing these games.
I'm going insane.
I know, I know, I know it's never what it seems.
