I’m like a jackdaw
Cawing at your back door
Scratching at your windowpane
Hey throw your window wide
And taste the April night with me again
Girl we been veering
Backwards disappearing
Down into the murky deep
Baby come on
We’ll be a long time gone
That’s time enough for sleep

And hey now don’t run and hide
Your little heart away
If it’s gone
We’ll sure never find it
Pining for lost innocence

Our hammers beating hard
Against that old facarde
...
