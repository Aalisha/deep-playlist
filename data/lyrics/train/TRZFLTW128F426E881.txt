Jackson on a high hill, mama, Natchez just below
Jackson on a high hill, mama, Natchez just below
(spoken: (unknown))
I ever get back home, I won't be back no more

Oh, my mama's gettin' old, her head is turnin' gray
My mama's getting old, her head is turnin' gray
Don't you know it'll break her heart, know, my livin' this-a way?
