Hooray for Hazel, she put me down
Hooray for Hazel, she made me her clown
Hooray for Hazel, she's up to her tricks
Hooray for Hazel, she's gettin' her kicks

Hazel's been in love with many a guy
She tells them that she loves them and then says goodbye
Hooray for Hazel, I'm now on her list
I'm just another fool that couldn't resist

Hooray for Hazel, she put me down
Hooray for Hazel, she made me her clown
