How did it get so late, where did the night go to
Strange how it slips away when I'm with you
I know it's almost two, I know you should leave, but wait
I've thought it over and there's something I gotta say.

Chorus:
Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right
Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light
It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone
...
