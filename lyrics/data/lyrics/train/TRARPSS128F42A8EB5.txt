I offer little resistance, it's a pitiful existence
Your industry is polluting me
And my mind and I can barely find the time to read the signs of
Things to come, that's what they want
You know that's what they want
Another song won't change a thing
A revolution I could sing
That never changed any fucking thing

Your contempt and disregard for human rights outrage us all
(I keep tryin', keep tryin, that's all I can do)
You've made a mockery of justice with your systems and your laws
