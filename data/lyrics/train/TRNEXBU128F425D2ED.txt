Well I got stones in the passway
And my room seems dark at night
I got stones in the passway
And my room seems dark at night
I got pains in my heart
And they've taken my appetite

When I first saw you I heard the angels sing
I thought of Adam and Eve and that love thing
Oh, I was blinded by the light and I just couldn't see
Papa hidin' up in your apple tree
I really hope you're satisfied
I just came back to say goodbye.
