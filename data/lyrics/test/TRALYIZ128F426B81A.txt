Sunset, it's a hundred and three
Your daddy ain't home
And your momma's asleep
Let's go, it's a full moon night
Ain't coming back till the morning light.

Got an itch, gotta scratch, gotta bounce, gotta dance
From the front to the back, head down to the track
Let's go to the place where the beats are best
I wanna feel the sweat running down my chest.

C'Mon Bounce with me,
Everybody say Hey Oh, Hey Oh, Hey Oh
Bounce with me
Everybody say Hey Oh, Hey Oh, Hey Oh

Bounce with me
All the ladies say Hey Oh, Hey Oh, Hey Oh
Bounce with me
All the fellas say Hey Oh, Hey Oh, Hey Oh

Come and get some
Come and get some
Come and get some
Come and get some
Gotta get it (get it)
Gotta get it (get it)
Gotta get it (get it)
Gotta get it (get it)

Sweet thing with the cinnamon tan
...
