Mining for a sacred lode
Drilling into untouched stone
The world has done enough to me
The horror now I'll never see

Got to fight off grizzly bears
Got to eat, so I grab a few hares
Got to struggle to survive
That's the reason I'm alive

I know I left you hurting
Disappeared with no goodbyes
But I heard the snowcats calling
I'm alright, baby please don't cry
...
