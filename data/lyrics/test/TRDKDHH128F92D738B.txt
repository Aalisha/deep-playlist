It sue is cold here in Chicago
The wind can cut you like a knife
Another day, another dollar
What a way to spend a life
She was young and I was restless
Left my home in Ole' Virginia
And my Blue Ridge Mountain girl

Chrous

And I can see her standing by the window
And there's nothing sadder in the world
Than to see those green eyes, all red from crying
...
