I've been working so,
I've been working so,
I've been working so hard.
Why you bring me down?
Why you bring me down?
I've been working so hard.


You'll be smooth,
I'll be smoother,
Smoother than silk.
Let honesty remain my virtue,
Motherin' is my milk.
To push strong 'til the end,
Because the stress is the life.
Keep on pushin' like a player,
Guess you can't see our strife.
We're in this together 'cause there's no place to run.
Man's built the gun, that's why I'm chasing the sun.
You wanna walk how you walk?
Then watch me try to stay how I stayed,
I can't be swayed by the man.
I love my shorties with my heart,
I'll always lend them my hand.
Teach my children about the seeds you wanna take from the sand.
Gotta maintain motherfucker,
Gotta stick to these plans,
'Cause this globalized village made it all-out war.
And hip hop will be my wings,
And enough men needing to soar.
I see more guns than children being born everyday.
Another mother'll have to weep because you'd rob her's away.
I guess you're never gonna figure,
...
