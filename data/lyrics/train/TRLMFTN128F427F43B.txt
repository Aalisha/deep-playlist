[Verse 1]
My gators walk through shake joint doors
And I wear em' when I stomp these broke ass hoes
I stepped on stage, silk shirt and a fade
All the bitches gay and a pimp got paid
Fuck snake skin cause that shit cheap
I keeps the motherfuckin' gators on my feet
Milano's, sell em' just over a grand
With pimp stick in hand, I'ma take command
My gators and me close as can be
We done pimped plenty hoes, my gators and me
We ride around together, mackin' forever
And we ain't fucked up if we caught in bad weather

[Hook]
My gators
Wha-what-what-what-wha
My gators
Wha-what-what-what-wha
My gators
Wha-what-what-what-wha
My gators
Wha-what-what-what-wha
