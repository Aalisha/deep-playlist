sirens are screaming
i can hear em' coming down hard
it's time i was leaving
warm up my getaway car
i know you'd like me to stay
but if i do they'll haul me away

i won't go easy
after all the time i've done
i've been shooting freely
under the table and above the sun
but maybe i wont mind
a chain gang with you in line
