Ooh yea, well I really admire your political views
You personal philosophy reflects your high I.Q.
And I am impressed by the way you think everything through
Baby you're so smart I know
That I could really learn a lot from you, yea you

Well you've got quite a brain but I've got half a mind
To show you what I want to do to you
With all respect your intellect takes a back seat this time
It's the physical attraction that turns me on

There's just somethin' 'bout you body
That makes me want you all the time
Oo, I want your body but all I get from you
Is a piece of your mind, there's just somethin' 'bout your body

And your body talk don't take no genius to see
