where can i turn for comfort?
where do the cold days end?
where has the sunshine gone?
where do our two hearts blend?
where has love gone and hidden?
where must i go to find?
the more i shun romance,
the more love is defined
indulge me
pick a dozen black roses
lay them at my feet
buried in golgotha
amongst the dead's elite

blink one more time and eden will be gone
buried in red hair of fire
drunk on eyes azure blue
...
