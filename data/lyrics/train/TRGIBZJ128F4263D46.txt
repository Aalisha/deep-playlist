Alright alright
Put your hands together in this place
Yeah yeah

Here we are, let's get on one accord
Leave all your problems on the outside
To be consumed with the Holy Ghost fire
Open up your mouth and lift the name of Jesus higher, say

Are you ready for your blessing? Are you ready
Are you ready for your miracle?
For the chains that come from the enemy
Are utterly destroyed when the praises ring, so say

Hallelujah, thank you Jesus
He's exalted forever so let the praise begin
Lord I love you, no one above you
Just put your hands together and let
Let the praise begin
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know it might be tough to get yo praise on
Trials of life been crushing you all week long
If you don't have a reason to praise him let me give you one
He gave you a brand new mercy with the rising of the sun, say
