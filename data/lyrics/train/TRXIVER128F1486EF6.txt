I can't take it
I've been workin' myself to the bone
Just to make it
To the moment that we're all alone

In my mind I pull your body closer
Every second feels like a day
In my mind I'm lying next to you
It's just a minute away
A minute away

I don't care where it ends tonight
That's right
It's all about you
Givin' it up until the morning light
That's life
It's all about you

Can you feel it
...
