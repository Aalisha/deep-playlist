All you kids get out the back door
I've never seen her this bad before
She took all her favorite things down from the window
And broke 'em all over her clean floor

It's Saturday at the mansion
The oldest boy walks with a slouch
The young ones are wild in back of the house
And she gave up and went back to sleep on the couch

Something as simple as boys and girls
Gets tossed all around and then lost in the world
Something as hard as a prayer on your back
Can wait a long time for an answer

When I was little I'd stare at her picture
And talk to the mother of God
...
