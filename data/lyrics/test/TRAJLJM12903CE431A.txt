Pull the string and I'll wink at you
I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to
I'm your puppet

I'll be yours to have and to hold
Darling, you've got full control of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips
I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips
I'm your puppet
