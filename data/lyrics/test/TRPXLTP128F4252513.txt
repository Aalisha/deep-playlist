Make 'em clap to this
To show our appreciation for your support
Make 'em clap to this
Thank you DJ's

Make 'em clap to this
Make 'em clap to this
Make 'em clap to this
Make 'em clap to this

I came in the door, I said it before
I never let the mic magnetize me no more
But it's biting me, fighting me, inviting me to rhyme
I can't hold it back I'm looking for the line

Taking off my coat clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking it until I hit my last note
My mind'll range to find all kinds of ideas
Self esteem makes it seem like a thought took years to build

But still say a rhyme after the next one
Prepared, never scared, I'll just bless one
And you know that I'm the soloist
So Eric B, make 'em clap to this

Make 'em clap to this
Make 'em clap to this
Make 'em clap to this
Make 'em clap to this
Make 'em clap to this

I don't bug out or chill or be acting ill
No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric B easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
