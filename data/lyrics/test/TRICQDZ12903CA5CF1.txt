Got a feeling it's a fever it's a fire
Talking trouble take it down into the wire
Once chance two chance
It's a lie
It's old and old and old and worn out
Light it up for real and watch it work a way
Got no memory of ever being made
We'll take heart, take heart anyway
Your own, your own, your own are not now

Light it up
Light it up
