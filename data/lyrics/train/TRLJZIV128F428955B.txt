Overgrown, overblown!
Nod if you're near, can you hear this
Signal if you feel it, you're feeling it
I see the fire and it's faceless
I hope you came here to embrace and not escape it

Tell me if this hurts, if you've heard this
Tell me if it hurts is it worth it
We can go to hell if you can teach me
I finally found my voice and I'm speechless
It's tough to chew, but we can power through

Yeah-oh
Yeah-oh
Yeah-oh
Yeah-oh
...
