From peaceful moments to inferno
Early years passing through your mind
The expected world, now coloured in red
And within seconds, your soul is blind

I hear myself scream
The panic's chasing me
This is no dream

I'm not supposed to be here
I've never felt such painful fear

Aware of my flesh, is this for real
