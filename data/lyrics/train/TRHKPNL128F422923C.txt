[Everybody get down to this]
[Everybody get down to this]
[C'mon]
[Everybody get down to this]
[Everybody get down to this]
[C'mon]
I can't believe it but the writing's on the wall
And I know we gotta do what's right
If we don't take a chance the moments gonna fall
And we've only got tonight

Can't you see that you and me
Ain't got nothin' in our history
But we could be lovers tonight

We're gonna shout [shout] the party down
Got the time to celebrate
Everybody shout today
And we can shout [shout] the party down
Everybody do it right
And party away tonight
