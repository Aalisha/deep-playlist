People let me tell you
I work hard everyday
I get up out of bed
I put on my clothes
'Cause I've got bills to pay
Now, it ain't easy
But I don't need no help
I got a strong will to survive
I've got a deeper love
Deeper love
Deeper love inside
And I call it
Pride
A deeper love
Pride
A deeper love
Pride
A deeper love
Woah
It's the power that gives you the strength to survive
Pride
A deeper love
Woah
Now I've got love in my heart
It gives me the strength
To make it through the day
Oh, love pride is have respect for yourself
And that's why I'm not looking for
Hand outs, charity
Welfare, don't need
Stealing, dealing
Not my feeling
No back stabbing
Greedy grabbing
Lying cheating
'Cause I've got a deeper love
A deeper love
A deeper love inside
