It seems just like yesterday
Was the first time that I heard you call my name?
Since then so much has changed
I'm still the same man that I was before
Knowing that I could be without anything
Scares me away from being alone
Now that I know what's going on
I can look back and see you
I made you wait as I turned away

If I could rewind
And watch all my life
Just pass me by
I could see you
If I could rewind
I'd take back the lies
And all of those times
I hurt you
