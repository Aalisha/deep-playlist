Drivin' in the fast lane
Pedal to the floor
Lookin' for some action
Gotta have more
Head out on the highway
Red light, Green light - Ready to go
Outta control

Movin' like a freight train
down the track
Full speed ahead now
Never look back
Workin' for the weekend
9-2-5 just gimme a break
I can't wait
Folks are home in bed - Boss is outta sight
Looks like another red-hot saturday nite
