Peace takes a taxi to the underground
I wanna love the world, but I don't know how
I blame it on the DJ playing all the fast songs
Ain't spinnin' anything I can sing along

So if you know the words, then try to sing along
And when you get the beat, grab a hammer, bang a gong
'Cause you don't got to fight or make yourself belong
To be a revolution, yeah
To be a revolution, yeah

If you wanna learn to play the rock guitar
Then throw down your guns, you gotta be a star
You gotta begin with who you know you are
