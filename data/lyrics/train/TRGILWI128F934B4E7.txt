I move in slow motion
And the world Is no longer at my heels

I wither and falter somehow
I wither and fall silent now

Sometimes I say too much
Even when there is no one listening

I wither and falter somehow
I wither and fall silent now

Hey, are you out there
Did you feel my sacrifice
Hey, do you see me
