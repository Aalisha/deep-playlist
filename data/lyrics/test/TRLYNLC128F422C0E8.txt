Running through the hourglass of time
Another day passes by
Turning into a sleepless night
Yearning for something I don't know
Tension inside me still grows
Until the new chapter unfolds

Seems no matter how hard you try
The thorn still burns in your side
Throughout this test that we call life
We win and lose everyday
