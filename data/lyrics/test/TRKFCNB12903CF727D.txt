Ain't holding out for a miracle now
Just holding out for the water
Across the bridge that will carry me down
To the Santa Rosa Spanish Quarter

And I know that I don't belong with you
And I know the pills stopped working for me, so
If you wanna set me up I'll fall on my knees and
Fix what I have broke

I spent my whole life looking for land
...
