Whoa mule, whoa mule
We're dirty but we're dreaming
Whoa mule, whoa mule
We'll both get there someday

All you ramblers, you silk tongue gamblers
Listen to my tale
It won't take long to sing you my song
Full of trouble and despair

So fair thee well, you troubadours
Whose pockets have no lining
I can tell you that all pastures stay green
But you know that I'd be lying

Whoa mule, whoa mule
...
