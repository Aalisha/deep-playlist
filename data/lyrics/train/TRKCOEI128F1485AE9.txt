Well well well look just what the cat dragged in
A foe not a friend in the end but a dealer in sin
I don't want apologies or guarantee you'll do it all again
Oh no no you can play those games no more
Well this time it's different, yeah this time you've pushed too far
Can't you find your dignity, you lost it with your honesty & shame
