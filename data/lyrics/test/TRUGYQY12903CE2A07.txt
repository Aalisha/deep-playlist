*police siren*

[Master P as cop]
Driver, slowly step out of the vehicle
Passenger, keep your hands up high
You don't have a right to remain silent
Anything I write in this report
is gonna be fuckin used against you, hahaha
Where dey at - where dey at, where dey at?

[Porshe - repeat over other vocals]
Life ain't easy (life ain't easy)
I know they comin for me (comin for me)

[C-Murder]
This ghetto got me strapped
I keep my hand on my nine, I can't depend on the one time
This ghetto got me strapped
I keep my hand on my nine, I can't depend on the one time
