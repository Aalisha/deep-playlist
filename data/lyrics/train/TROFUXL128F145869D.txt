Stories came like the wind
Joining every bridge in the wind
Ringing out footsteps
Calling out stell-heels
I give voice
I give breath
Count out evenings and stars
How fast can these things move on
Taking roots back to yourself
And the reason for fear was moving on
And on
Some time
Great times
Troubled time
Fire for the times
Ringing out footsteps
Calling out steel-heels

Promised land
Great times in commotion
Here come every day
It only lasts an hour
Unhappy the land that has no heroes
No! Unhappy the land that needs heroes
