EDWARD REEKERS:
In a dusty room on a stormy night,
Away from all the crowds,
I rise above the clouds.

Into a world once so bright,
Where now the shadows fall,
And a thousand voices call:

ROBERT SOETERBOEK:

Our future's in your hands,
Close your eyes,
Close your eyes,
And fantasize.

EDWARD REEKERS:

Can save them from the curse,

He's on a quest for the secret cure,
Across the burning sand,
To the edge of the fairy-land.
