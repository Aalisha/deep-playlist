Living in a cotton town when the Yankees came around
They say you're freedom bound, they say you're freedom
bound
Don't mean a thing yeah yeah yeah
Cos there's no charity for my girl and me
There aint no one free, there aint no one free
In Dixie Land yeah yeah yeah

Whoah stand up honey child you mean so much to me
There's no way I'm gonna be no whippin' boy
Whoah stand up honey child the truth is plain to see
There's no way there's no way I'm gonna be no whippin'
boy

Cos I don't need no overseer
And I don't need no night time tears
And I don't need no one to tie me down
