FUTUREMAN:
From the cities on the seas
To the skyways in the east
From the stations on the moon
To the planet of Neptune

I'm a sophisticated man
And you would say I'd understand
Is it a virtual design?
Are we launched into a time beyond time?
Space beyond space
We are lost here in this cyber world...
Is there no way out?

KNIGHT:
I don't understand your words!
They strike as hard as steel
I'm sworn to the sacred quest
On the isle of Avalon
