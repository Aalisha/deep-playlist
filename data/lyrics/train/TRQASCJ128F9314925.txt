Sometimes the night was beautiful
Sometimes the sky was so far away
Sometimes it seemed to be so close
You could touch it but your heart would break
Sometimes the morning came too soon
Sometimes the day could be so hot
There was so work much left to do
But so much you'd already done

Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise you
Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise you
