I slept with your best friend
And I think I'll go again
When I'm distracted, I'm so distracted
D'ya think this spells the end?
Of bodies on.

When I'm distracted, I'm so distracted
When I'm distracted, I'm so distracted

I slept with your best friend
And you're off the rails again
It's over-rated, and I'm still frustrated
You think this spells the end
Of bodies on.

When I'm distracted
Turned our bodies on a little for me
I'm so distracted
