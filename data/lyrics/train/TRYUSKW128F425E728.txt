Once in a lifetime You'll open up your heart
Maybe once in your lifetime
You'll swear to never be apart
You think your love's on solid ground
Then out of the blue, it all comes tumblin' down

Chorus
Who's gonna hold me tonight
When I'm feeling (lonely)
Who's gonna show me the light
'Cause I need to know
With all the things we've got
...
