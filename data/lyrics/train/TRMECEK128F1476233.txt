When only tears are falling
you don´t have to watch ¨big brother¨
to realize you´re fucking stupid too

don´t have to follow popstars, moviestars
just to haven an attitude

everybody is watching when I get down on my kness
that´s what they like to see

so I´m asking myself
will they bealive
lord set them free

I saw a kid running wild with a gun in his hand
such a shame

killing his mother, father, brother, don´t matter to him is just a simple game
he plays

watch yourself, there´s nothing that you cam do
you´re running out of time
ain´t no lie
they´re gonna jet to you
...
