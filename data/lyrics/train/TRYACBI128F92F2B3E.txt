Turn me up a little more
[Verse 1: Classified]
Yeah, yeah, I'm a scream at the top of my lungs (ha)
Spit shit 'til it's off with the tongue (yeah)
Get lit, ride off in the sun (what?)
So don't trip 'cause you crawl and I run, shit it's already done
Back with the flow, the show, the magic
Went from hat tricks to uppin my status
Yep another classic, hard to believe
Poker face on with a card up my sleeve
They all said I never looked the part
But I ain't tryin to hear 'em like a pussy fart
And now they all searchin for my rookie card
Keep your motherfuckin hands out the cookie jar
Class is in session, check the scorecard
Yes I work hard like male porn stars
No the applause isn't necessary
You dyin to get into my show like a cemetery (ha)
[Chorus: Classified]
Turn me up a little more (more)
Fresh 'til we exit the door (ha)
Yeah, we breakin in your eardrums
Ready or not, here it comes (here it comes, here it comes)

Turn me up a little louder (what?)
Crank the amp to full power (yeah)
We do it every night and all day (all day, all day, all day)
(So), you better get out the way

We-we-we do it (fresh, fresh, fresh)
You better get out the way
