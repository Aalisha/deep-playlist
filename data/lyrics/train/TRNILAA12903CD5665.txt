You know that you can find me
On the way to Jerusalem
But I took a magic carpet ride
To a popular movie show
And that's where I found her
Was on the way to Jerusalem
She was hangin' on silver screen
A techni-color Michelangelo

Well I was rollin'
On the way to Jerusalem
I was headed for the Promised Land
And nothing make me go against the tide
But I took a little turn, yeah
Was on the way to Jerusalem
What's another day more or less
You pay your money
And you take your ride
