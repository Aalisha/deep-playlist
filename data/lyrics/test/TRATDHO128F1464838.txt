Crackin' walls inside my head
With a bottle full of rain
I promised to the coaster
I wouldn't tear it up again

Flick a peanut, break a glass
I wish I didn't sleep at Mass
And everything is closin' up
And yet again I come in last

I saw it in a dream
It was another time
And everything was blue
Everything was fine

And you were always there
And I could see clear
I was always yours
...
