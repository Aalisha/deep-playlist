Lately I've been winning battles left and right
But even winners can get wounded in the fight
People say that I'm amazing
Strong beyond my years
But they don't see inside of me
I'm hiding all the tears

Chorus:
They don't know that I go running home when I fall down
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around
