I can feel you breathing down my neck
It's only getting worse
Every kiss I hide
Turns into a curse

I don't wanna feel this way anymore
I can't remember how I felt before

You came out of nowhere
Into a nightmare
(Right through me)
You came out of nowhere
Suddenly
I'm breaking down

I can feel you beating in my heart
...
