Pack your bags
We're goin' far far from here
Tokyo rose, she blooms this time of year
Suzy, Suzy do you wanna come out and play
Tell all your friends we're leavin' here today

Well come on, come on, come on
You got your ticket for
We are Tokyo
Catch a train, miss your flight
Streets of love city light
We do Tokyo tonight tonight
