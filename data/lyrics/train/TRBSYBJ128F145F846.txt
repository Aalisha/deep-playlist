Oh I've been haunted by this old ghost before
I want to hear your voice you know it's been so long
well I could dance and wave you balance on the shore
oh it would feel so good to see your face again

I still sleep with the lights on
I still stay up late alone
I still love another one
I still sleep with the lights on

oh we both understand we got no way back
oh our love was strange in a strange land
and we got broken wings we were bound to fall
until the sun comes up you can hold my hand
