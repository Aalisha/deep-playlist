I'd wake up and make love to you if I had you
I would touch you so much but I'm not allowed to
What I hate is to wait but in this case I'm patient
I'm discreet, I'm not weak, I just need the moment

He wants me, he wants me not
I want everything he's got

If I leaned over and tried to kiss you
Would I be wrong after so long to kiss you?
Would you pretend we're only friends if I kissed you?
At least I can dream of you in a scene when I kiss you

On one hand we are friends
