Hey what's your story
Hate to see ya lookin worried
You know you can tell me
Cause I am understanding
Would you mind sharing
What's bothering your happiness
Turn that frown upside down
What's with all this madness

Is it somethin (somethin), somethin I should know? (Somethin I should know)
Is it somethin (somethin), somethin I should know? (Somethin I should know)
Cause I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
Then I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope
Yeah, well

If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to lean on
If things don't go your way
Use my pillow to lay on
If things don't go your way
Use my shoulder to cry on
That's what friends are for

I know it's a struggle
You gotta flex your muscle
