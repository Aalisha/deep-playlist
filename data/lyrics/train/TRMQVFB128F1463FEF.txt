Pardon my life, pardon my song
I hope you're not nervous, I'm not going to stay long
The one installment, I've made on your heart
Is not enough to cover what we're willin' to start

'Cause I'm a flat broke love
Lord I'm a flat broke love

I'm up or I'm down, never constant or sound
Empty my pockets full of grain
The friends that I've loved never feel I've been there
I've never left a grateful one

'Cause I'm a flat broke love
...
