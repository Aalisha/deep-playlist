There were no female pirates
Your friends are dressed like whores
And there's competitions to see what your winning
We got short skirts and yo ho ho!

We'll take, take, take it turns to get angry
Bury each other where we once balanced each other
I will wait for the moment to grab me
I remember, sometimes I would walk to your bus stop
And it wouldn't change a thing

I can feel the doubt still lingering
I can feel my cheap heartbeat
We got three good clubs in the heart of the city
I'll only get precious singing about your day
I'd barely call this singing

And I'm a lost ghost stalking out grammar school corridors
...
