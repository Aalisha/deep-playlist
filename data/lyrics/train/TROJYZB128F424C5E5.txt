She has done so many things
It's so surreal
She has seen so many things
It's so unreal
She has been almost everywhere
And tasted everything
She has been a dream since birth
Who could conquer everything

Night after night
After every single night
She never gave up!
Fight after fight
After motherfucking fight
She came out on top!

One rule, one way of life
Only, the strong survive

Never back down
Never back down
Destroying everything
Never back down
Never back down
...
