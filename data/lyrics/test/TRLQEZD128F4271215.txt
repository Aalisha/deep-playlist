Without dreams of hope and pride a man will die
Though his flesh still moves his heart sleeps in the grave
Without land a man never dreams cause he's not free
All men need a place to live with dignity.
Take the crumbs from starving soldiers, they won't die
Lord said not by bread alone does man survive
