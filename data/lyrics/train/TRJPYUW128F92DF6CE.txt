Hooy
here comes that man again
something in the way he moves
makes me sorry. I am a lady.

Hello stranger
you're a danger to the law and order here
they don't like men like you in our city.
You're too pretty cool and witty
you're a real bad company
I should have stayed away from you today.

Sorry I'm a lady
sorry I'm a lady
I would rather be
rather be
just a little shady
just a little shady
naughty dynamite
dynamite.
Sorry I'm a lady
sorry I'm a lady
have you got a light
...
