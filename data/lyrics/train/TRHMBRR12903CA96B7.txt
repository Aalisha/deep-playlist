I followed in your foot steps to find where you belong
I shared your darkest secrets to know where you come from
And the truth is in there somewhere, can't be that deep
How do I wash away your resistance?
For you I have to say to listen
Of all the lonely people, I wanna be loved by you
Of all the lonely people, I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be loved by you

I follow in your foot steps to see the things you'll see
If you have anything good left I wan't too set it free
