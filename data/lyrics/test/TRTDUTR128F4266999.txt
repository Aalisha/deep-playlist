Woke up this morning with light in my eyes
And then realized it was still dark outside
It was a light coming down from the sky

Must be those strangers that come every night
Those saucer shaped lights put people uptight
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark
I hope they get home all right

Hey, Mr. Spaceman
