The love between the two of us was dying
And it got so bad I knew I had to leave
But halfway down that high-way,
As I turned around I saw
My little daughter running after me

Cryin'
Daddy don't you walk so fast
Daddy don't you walk so fast
Daddy slow down some 
Coz your making me run
Daddy don't you walk so fast

It broke my heart to tell my little daughter
That her daddy had to run and catch a train
...
