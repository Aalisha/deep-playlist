Eyes – a thousand eyes waiting below the waves – Because above the rain burns
My past becomes a lie
Goodbye sense of awareness – I drink adrenaline like mother's milk, it soothes me
Remove all that I trust, all I'm ashamed for, state of remission, I feed of the vulture
I'm left breathless – The Battle is lost
One step takes a thousand miles – One black circle where I expected sun
One blind spot – One eye for a thousand eyes
Where I begun: underwater I'm reborn
I got stuck in the nether on a lonely cloud, while the heat burns my feathers
We're all homeward bound – With a roar I dive down and I greet the seas
