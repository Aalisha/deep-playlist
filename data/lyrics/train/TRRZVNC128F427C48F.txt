Crush, rush,
Crush, rush,

Rush, blush,
Crush, crush,

It's a crush, come to my place and take of your shirt, stay a while, (?) make you smile,
Crush, crush,
I'm need a rush,
You make me blush, I gotta crush,

You can getta way with murder, push me a little bit further,
You come to me with danger, then treat me like a stranger,
Got a crush, needa rush,
You make me blush, I gotta crush,
