From sunrise to sunset - Selassie
We know, Jah giveth on each I care (?)
Wisdom, O Jah

I've seen the sun overhead, shining bright - so bright
To you and you it feels so nice
Yes, I know, Jah made this light, light
I've seen the sun
I've seen the sun overhead, shining bright - so bright
To you and you it feels so nice
Yes, I know, Jah made this light, light

Well, I've seen it over Rome
I've seen it here at home
Seen it in the motherland
Even over England
