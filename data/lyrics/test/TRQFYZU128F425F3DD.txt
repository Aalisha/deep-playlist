Ooh yeah

Police and thieves in the street, ooh yeah
Fighting the nation with their guns and ammunitions
Police and thieves in the streets, ooh yeah
Scaring the nation with their guns and ammunitions

From Genesis to Revelation, yeah
The next generation will be, hear me

All the crimes committed day by day
No one try to stop it, in anyway
