I took my baby on a saturday bang
boy is that girl with you
yes we're one and the same
Now i believe in miracles and a miracle
has happened tonight
but if you're thinkin' about my baby

it don't matter if you're black or white
they print my message in the saturday sun
i had to tell them i ain't secound to none
and i told about equality and it's true
either you're wrong or you're right
but if you're thinkin' about my baby

it don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
i am tired of this stuff
