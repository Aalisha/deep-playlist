Momma is cryin' in the kitchen
Even the dog can feel the chill
She lays her head down on the table
Next to a stack of unpaid bills
Oh, Daddy puts his arm around her
He says, “Girl, your stockings startin' to run”
I know it ain't never been easy
But ain't it always been fun, fun, fun
We fell in love
And there's no way out
We fell in love
And there's no way out
Sometimes you just gotta laugh about it
We fell in love
And there's no way out
Daddy's cussin' in the backyard
