(Oho yeaheah
Who do you think ou are?)

(Who do you think you are?)

I'm rough and tough and all that stuff
I make ou dance and prance 'till you huff and puff
There's just no way you can get enough
Of me, your mister Big Stuff

I'm the overweight-er, prince dominator MC
Heavy D, constant weight gainer
And since I choose, the weight not to lose
I will stay this way so that I can bruise

MC's around, who front and frown
You go round for round, I go pound for pound
At the end of the party when you sayin' goodnight
Don't come to me and say: "Take it light", I'm your mister Big Stuff!

(Who do you think you are?
Oho, yeaheah)

I'm a quick rhyme shooter, rap rookie, recruiter
I always say could, never ever say coulda
I'm healthy and stacked, not a beast or all fat
I get applause and awards every time I rap

I love the way I am, I would never switch!
I'm the greatest entertainer since a porno flick
