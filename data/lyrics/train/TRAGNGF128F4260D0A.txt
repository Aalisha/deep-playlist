Brand new day
(Albert Hammond, Mike Hazlewood)

Lyrics
as performed by Albert Hammond

There's a brand new world around us
Lots of good news on the way
And for each and everyone of us
It's a brand new day

There's a brand new kinda meaning
To the words that people say
And for each and everyone of us
It's a brand new day

It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
