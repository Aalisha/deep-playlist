Wings of fire embrace me
Trying to analyze the signs on the wall
Still it means nothing
On the floor, with my head in my hands,
Trying to understand,
But there's no answers.
There's no answers.

Maybe, I should have figured it out
Maybe there's no sense at all
Just an endless path of dreams
Crushed down and destroyed by faith
I'm shouting out your name in my sleep
But you hear nothing

Her beauty, clean as water
...
