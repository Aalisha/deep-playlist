Hey, baby
Come over here and sit down
All I wanna do is explain to you how you make me feel
Is that alright
Listen

Let me tell you 'bout a few things that turn me on,
mmm
Just the little bitty things that make this love so
strong
Like how you push the hair back from over your face,
alright, mmm
Bite your lip when you want me to come and have a
taste

Make that face that you make when we're lovin'
(Ooh...)
Make that sound that you make when we're huggin'
You know what I need
Baby, do those things (Oh, yeah) that you only do for
me (Do for me)

Close your eyes like you do when you kiss me (Baby,
when you kiss me)
Send that face that you send when you miss me (You know
what I need)
You know what I need
Baby, do those things (Baby, do those things ) that
you only do for me (Do for me)
