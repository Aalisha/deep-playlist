Repeat 8x
(You're ready now)

When I met you, you were too young,
to hang around where the groupies hung,
to swing and dance where the swingers swung,

Well you're ready now, mmmm you're ready now,
You're ready now, girl, you're ready now.

You grew up fast like over-night,
you sure have changed, girl, you're out of sight,
you wanna swing and dance all night,

You're ready now, you're ready now,
You're ready now, oh, you're ready now.
