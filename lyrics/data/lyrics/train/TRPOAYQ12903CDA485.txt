Once upon a time
Not so long ago
Tommy used to work on the docks
Unions been on strike
He's down on his luck... it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day

Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love - for love
She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference
If we make it or not

We've got each other and that's a lot
For love - well give it a shot
Whooah, we're half way there
WOOOOAH Livin on a prayer
...
