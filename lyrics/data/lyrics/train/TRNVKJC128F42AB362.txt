Just like I said You're so easily read
Keeping the score When you know that you're so far behind
Remember what I said to you Only speak when you are spoken to
Open your eyes in the dark you can't see Lie to your friends
If you have to be open with them Please don't ask for help my friend
I've got so much blackmail to be sent

Today's ways
