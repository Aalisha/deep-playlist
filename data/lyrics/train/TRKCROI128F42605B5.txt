You come unraveled at the slightest glance 
I'd like to go but I can't take the chance 
Your crazy love's got a power trip on me 
Tell me something, show me how you feel 
Imagination gets the best of me 
Every breath on the edge is so surreal 

All I need is you to drive me insane because 
All I want is you to love me again and again 
...
