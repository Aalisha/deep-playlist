[Incomprehensible]
Queens, New York City

Microphone check one, two, one, two
East coast, west coast, this is how we do
Get your hustle on, yeah matter of fact
It ain't where you from, it's where you at

Microphone check one, two, one, two
East coast, west coast, this is how we do
Get your hustle on, yeah matter of fact
It ain't where you from, it's where you at

My name's Talik, I bust a new improved shoes
Livin' freshy '97, it's time to flip
Don't let me go, 'cuz I start to sweat
Then I smoke a eleven toke, why did it get?
Then I start lemon and top, more to get?
Got it, now I have it, time to wet
Up his crib, that's on the block
Niggas wild up in silence, they on the block

It's me Freaky Tah, I'm lookin' at you man
My man slide over there, yeah he pat you man
On you back and he be smilin'
Niggas, they be thinkin', they be wildin'
I roll with my nigga P, lover B
If you zonin' with him then you zonin' with me
If you peepin' at them, then you peepin' at me
I represent the L O S T to the B O Y Z, now now

Microphone check one, two, one, two
East coast, west coast, this is how we do
Get your hustle on, yeah matter of fact
It ain't where you from, it's where you at
