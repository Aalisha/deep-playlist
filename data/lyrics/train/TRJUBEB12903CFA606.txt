Later on
Later on i'll sing for you
and so it is
your parents tell you what to do

all day
and every night
you are ripping appart at the seems
im telling you
every one wants what you leave
its eventual
ripping appart at the

sing to me
and the quick of the night
as everyone sleeps
so walking with the girl
prom queen
she's leading me in
to all her fantasies
