Rush faster on the one-way lane
the answers so silent

Rusty gods in their machine-mind armours
grind our souls in the millstone of time
the "deathbed harvest" is a dead man's banquet
of mold ridden bread and black, poisoned wine

And we go... our step so silent
And we go... our blooded trace
the Jester Race

Calling our to the gathered masses
their answers so silent

...
