I'm the best thing since sliced bread, no Eminem
feminine? Nah.
Ms. sovereign? Yeah.
"That girl thinks shes so big and all"
But hold on Im only 5 ft 1Â !
I bring the fun bak
with every come back
sit back an' laugh so what you got a number
1 girl try for a clash shoulder
My paper cuts, soun' bwoy did ya rumba
don't have my own room
I don't even share
Just slept on a sofa that's the size of a chair
It's cool
but still it aint fair
but it's blue
so i don't really care!
when im on the train all my j's attempt to ride about
all my crazy days an' my lazy ways
or the days that i spend with my dames when im in a hazy faze

Chi-CHing its ms. sovereign da tichy ting,
Me Na Have 50 rings
But i Gots 50 things to say in a cheeky kinda way
