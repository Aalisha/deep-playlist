Milkshake (Remix)

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,
Its better than yours,
Damn right its beter than yours,
I can teach you,
But i have to charge!

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,
And there like,
Its better than yours,
Damn right its beter than yours,
I can teach you,
But i have to charge!

I know you want it,
The thing that makes me,
What the guys go crazy for,
They lose their minds,
The way i whyne,
I think its time,

(Kelis (LaLa))

Lala-lalala,(LaLa)
Warm it up, (thats discusting)
Lala-lalala,
The boys are waiting,
Lala-lalala
Warm it up,
Lala-lalala,(LaLa)
The boys are waiting,

(LaLa)

Boy's wanna know how my milkshake taste
See them fanstise when they look in my face
Want a slice of my icecream cake
Cream in the middle how many licks will it take
How u want it my flavor last hours
Once you've had mine your gurl was sweet and sour
Let me feel that candy cane
See if u can make my candy rain
