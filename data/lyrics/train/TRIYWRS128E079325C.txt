You can find a way to be my passion
You listen to the blood flowin' in my vein
You hear the teaching of the wind
Tell her what I'm like within
I can't find the words my mind is dim
It's better by you better than me

Guess you'll have to tell her how I tried
To speak the thoughts of hell so long inside
Tell her now I've got to go
Fight in the streets and guide the sword
Tell her the world's not much fallin' for
