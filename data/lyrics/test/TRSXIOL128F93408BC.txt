I can't take a broken heart
So this'll be another false start

I knew where you lived
So when I used to walked home from school
I used to go especially slow past your house
In case your bus would stop and you would get off and we could start chatting or something
But the one time that did happen I got scared and hid behind a tree

Deep breath, stay calm
Try and hide those sweaty palms
I can't get no satisfaction
I've got an itch I can't stop scratching

Another time I'd overheard you saying you were going into town
