Two blondes in a T-bird
Down on Sunset Boulevard
Oh Hollywood you're looking good!

Lights, camera, action
Yeah, I'm gonna be a star
Just like I knew I always would

My hair is long
I got my red reeboks on
Oh yeah I'm looking pretty cool

The Kid goes crazy
The Kid goes crazy
The Kid goes crazy
The Kid goes wild - in Hollywood
The Kid goes crazy
