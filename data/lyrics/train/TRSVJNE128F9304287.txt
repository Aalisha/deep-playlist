The moon has never shown so brightly
The heavens have never shed such light on me
It's so soon to be captured by your gaze
But your eyes have got me in a daze, hey

In time, we will see
The love we might find
In time, we will be
The place that we should be
So His love might find us
The Savior of our loneliness
Just in time
