I hope it's not too late
Just to say that I'm sorry, honey
All I want to do
Is just finish what we started, baby

Let's turn over a new leave
And baby let's make promises
That we can keep
And call it a new year's resolution, hmm

Oh, I'm a woman
And woman makes mistakes too
But will you, will you forget the changes
That I put you through

Oh, let's try it again
