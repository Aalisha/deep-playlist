Well this stone that I have swallowed
Isn't going down so well
And this road that I have followed
Is leading me to Hell

And you said it didn't matter
But I think you're a liar
Is this one of your talents
That stokes the very fire that burns you
Each time you try to live

And the earth will turn below you
The pressure is building
And something has to give
Oh something has to give

And when I build you a steeple
You say it's incomplete
'Cause you need the whole cathedral
