In the name of the wolf, Lupine pride
In the name of the wolf, I wear a skin of hide

Forrest mist coagulation lay around the fallen trees
The death is in the air, the smell of lycanthropy
I change into this form
A form not one of myself
Ravenous, for full moon's in the air
Jugular puncture as I sink my pearly whites into your neck
