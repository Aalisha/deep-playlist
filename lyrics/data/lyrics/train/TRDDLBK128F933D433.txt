Calling all angels
Calling all angels
Calling all angels, ooh
Calling all angels
Calling all angels
Calling all angels, ooh

There's trouble in paradise
My turtle doves changing wings
There's trouble in paradise
The birds no longer sing

Some devil told my angel
A lot of lies
And now my tears are falling
Like raindrops from the sky

There's trouble in paradise
The stars no longer shine
There's trouble in paradise
Cause she's no longer mine
...
