It's that feeling,
That someone
is standing behind you
and I turn around and there's no one there
and it's the sensation

that someone just whispered
I stil hear your voice but you're not really here
Your memory's like a ghost
and my heart is its host

I can still feel you just as close as skin every now and then
I'll find myself in a crowded room on my empty bed
there's a place you've touched,
with your love, no one gets close to

I can still feel you,
I can still feel you,
I can still feel you,
...
