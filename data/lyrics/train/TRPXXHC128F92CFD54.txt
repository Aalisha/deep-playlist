Dodging all the bullets that are flying past your head
Running for your life as they pump you full of lead
Ammunition meets the marrow falling to the ground
Just another casualty round after round
It doesn't really matter why I do these things I do
I need no rational for the things I chooses to do
Just some consolation for the shit you have to see
