I didn't see the signs posted on the road
Dead end gives way to the cliff that soars
And I lose control your face still looks bored
One, two, fuck you!
I won't change for you

Wrong way
This time it's going down
You say I'm immature
to hang around
Okay
Face-plant to the ground
I won't change for you
I won't change for you

Tonight I wash my hands of you
You set the bar I could not live up to
Tonight the light in breaking through
So thank you very little and send me postcards from hell
