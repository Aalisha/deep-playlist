I can't remember the time or place
Or what you were wearing
It's unclear about how we met
All I know, it was the best conversation that I've ever had
'Til this day I've never found someone
With eyes as wide as yours
I've been searching up and down this coast
Overlooking what I need the most

Did you notice I was afraid?
I thought I'd run out of things to say
Two more hours until today burns this away
And it starts all over again

The sky will never look the same again
'Til you show me how it could be
The sky will never look the same again
'Til you show me how it could be
