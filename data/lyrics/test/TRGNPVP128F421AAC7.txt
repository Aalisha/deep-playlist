You said this ain't over yet
I've said things that I'll regret
Won't be easy to forget
Scars take time to heal

Before another bitter word gets used
I was hoping we could call a truce

'Cause nobody wins, we both lose
Hearts get broken and love gets bruised
When we light that same old fuse
Again and again

Nobody wins, slammin' doors
We both lost this fight before
And I won't play that game no more
'Cause nobody wins
...
