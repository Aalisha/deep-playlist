Tinkerbelle, my winged friend, I think we got it wrong.
No fairy tale or happy ending, just prehistoric songs.
A crystal in my baby's eyes, I want what I can't love
So now I've learnt how to despise, I think I've learnt enough...

If blood is blood, then blood will flow -
That's all it does, that's all it knows
But I've one question, I want something,
I want more.
So flesh is flesh, an urgent fire
It drags you down, this cheap desire.

We all want something, maybe beauty,

Maybe more...

Absolution, constitution, leave it all behind
Take off your shirt, your worried face, and let me lose your mind.
