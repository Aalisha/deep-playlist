Lung of love, leaves me breathless,
Tongue of fool, lap me in enmity,
Four walled secret lies among the hessian,
And a flicker of the future,
Could've saved the cindered sister,
And I'm motioning still, they stand inside me,
And moments until, the one I leave.

Colourless I kiss her cold forehead I feel life,
...
