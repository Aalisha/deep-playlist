Kiss me like when I dream of you
Notice me, act like you have a clue
Flirt with me, act like I interest you
Like my eyes do, wish I could undress you

So I try to find the words
But I only suffocate
Then my palms, they start to sweat
And my shirt is soakin' wet

You give me the butterflies
You give me the nervous side of life
Don't walk by, just say hello, baby
