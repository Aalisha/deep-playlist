There’s only so many songs that I can sing to pass the time.
And I’m running out of things to do to get you off my mind (oh whoa).
All I have is this picture in a frame (oh ah),
that I hold close to see your face everyday.

With you is where I’d rather be,
but we’re stuck where we are.
It’s so hard, you’re so far.
This long distance is killing me.
I wish that you are here with me,
but we’re stuck where we are
it’s so hard, you’re so far. (so hard, you’re so far.)
This long distance is killing me.

It’s so hard, it’s so hard, where we are, where we are, you’re so far.
This long distance is killing me.
It’s so hard, it’s so hard, where we are, where we are, you’re so far
(so hard, so hard, where we are, where we are, your so far).
This long distance is killing me.
