Somewhere in the city somewhere in the room
A silent man a work undone a plan that went astray
Somewhere in the limetime of a yearning reverie
Words have lost their meaning on the frangle stage of fame

The sky is starless for the ones who have failed
Going nowhere nowhere to go
Life has no kindness for the ones who have failed
Going somewhere anywhere but home

Sky without stars
