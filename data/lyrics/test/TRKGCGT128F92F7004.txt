What are these feelings through me?
How'd you get these thoughts in my mind?
Everything that lies around me
Is a joke for me to criticize
You've taken everything from me
Taken everything that I need
And now that everything's gone
There's nothing left for me

Can't you see the ones in need?
This isn't over

I'm sick of all this pain
