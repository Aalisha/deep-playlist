My tears are fallin' 'cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say

Take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Please don't ever make her blu-u-u-ue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do-o-o-o

Aww, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Now don't you ever make her cry-y-y-y
...
