I know just what you're thinking
I know just how you feel
Something somewhere inside you
Say you can't believe it's real
So you're gonna play the game
All the faces and the names
And you know you're never gonna change
Fool for the night
And you don't believe it
Fool for the night
And you just can't see it

Running through the shadows
Like a phantom in the night
And as the curtain raises
You get ready for the fight
Say you want to even up the score
