When I'm all alone and I hear your voice
No other man can make me feel the way you do
I can't describe this feeling inside
I can't sleep at night ooh
Home is where you belong
That's what I tell myself when you're gone
Every night I say a prayer hopes you make it there
Anyone alone like me, I'm certain they'd agree
'Cause I can't sleep at night

Chorus:
Loneliness is my biggest fear
I wish the feeling would disappear
I can't sleep at night
Coldness is creepin' in
Need to feel your warmth again
