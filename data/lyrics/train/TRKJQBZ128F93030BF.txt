Take off your mask now, show me your face
Don't shun away without leaving no trace
What is your secret, you're bright as the sun
You got me begging like you're holding a gun

I want you, I need you
But you keep running from my sight
I'm yearning, I'm burning
Why can't you hear my prayer

Heal me, feel me
I'm loosing control when you're near me
Still I'm dreaming
You'll take my lonely nights away
