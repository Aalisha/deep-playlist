Young girl I can't fight you
Everybody wants to get inside you
Just want to remind you it's got nothing to do with you
Young girl I don't like you
Everybody wants to stand beside you
Just something to rewind to, it's got nothing to do with you
Didn't ya know? Time's a rodeo
Didn't ya find people out of line?
Didn't ya say I'm trying to behave
Trying so hard to
Young man terrifies you
