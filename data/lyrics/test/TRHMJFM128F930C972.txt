deaf, numb and run-down
fastened-seatbelt homeward-bound
landing checks and gear down
a ten-hour flight hits the ground
and all that i once knew is gone

eyes open wide,
dawning on wasted mourning hours
an aerial slide
and a led screen counting down the miles
here comes the time i...

gear up to take off
if anything is turning you off
next time, good son
don't look down while you leave the ground
head up, and...
swirl the downside world

now hours pass like centuries
and empty minutes feel like years
the engine rumbling in my ears
won't make the memories disappear

for family and friends, for passengers
a postcard's worth an open letter
we never met, we never will
they're scared and all i need's a thrill

all this is now so far away
and yet it feels like yesterday
when she was drawing lines in the sand
that i was holding in my hand
holding in my hand
hold it in your hand
