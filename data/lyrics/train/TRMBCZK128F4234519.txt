How are you feeling?
How does someone like you elude the moral quarantine
does your repression only server the greater lie
as you abuse and objectify
all the emotions you defeat you've got the world at your feet
because you think you've silenced all the critics of your misogynistic lies
but when you wake up from your reveries you'd better realize
you're a model of virility a specimen divine
as you deflower you empower the false ego trapped inside
and by the virtue of your "conquests" you've endeared yourself
to those who you hold in high esteem
