Harmony - is what we fake
Confirmation - we're lookin' for
Family - is our priority
Reputation - the major disease!

Risk - no, no ever ever
Native - is our success
We don't like to attract attention
To be average is our rule!

Security - is what be build on
Suspense - if the time is right
But once a year we dress up
Dress up to wipe out!
