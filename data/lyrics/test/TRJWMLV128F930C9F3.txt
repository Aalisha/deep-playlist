When did they come and where did they go
My thoughts, pure and white like snow
Here come the long and dark night of my soul
And now I'm all alone
There's a deep dark hole now where my love once used to be
She set me free
This is the long and dark night of my soul
Yes, now I'm all alone

So I've erased myself, replaced my mind, it's a clean slate
All I've felt and everyone I've ever known is gone
I feel a need to leave, just run straight into nowhere
There's nothing left in this town but self loathing
