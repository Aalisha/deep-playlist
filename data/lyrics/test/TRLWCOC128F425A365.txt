Goodbye to you my trusted friend
We've known each other since we
were nine or ten
together we've climbed hills and trees
learned of love and ABC's
skinned our hearts and
skinned our knees

Goodbye my friend it's hard to die
when all the birds are singing in the sky
now that spring is in the air
pretty girls are everywhere
think of me and I'll be there

we had joy we had fun we had
seasons in the sun
but the hills that we climbed were
just seasons out of time
Goodbye papa please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
you tried to teach me right from wrong
too much wine and too much song
wonder how I got along
