There's a cold breeze blowing from the north as the city sleeps
Rushing through the stone corridors of these gritty streets
Whistling against the window panes like a spirit speaks
That seeks to ring a change bringing days of peace to
It comes surging with a purpose uncertain
And cuts to the heart with a certain like urgence
The first ones caught by this gust were deserving
That's penetrated straight to the core of their nerve-strings
Hear the rustle in the leaves that we sweep along
Tremor as we crumble disbelief with the sweetest song
Endeavouring to humble every damn thing we breathe upon
