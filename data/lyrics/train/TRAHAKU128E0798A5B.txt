They can say what they want
But I don't hear thing cause
They can't read my thoughts
Or the secrets between
All of this time you where apart of me
Shining like a star in my galaxy

And I reach out trusting you there
Its like walking on a high wire into thin air
And I'm waking up to the dream
Its like bouncing so high on a trampoline
And I know that there's one thing
Between me and nothing
Baby, you are that one thing that pulls me through
So I'm giving it all to you
Giving it all to you

Could it be you and me
Can't stop thinking about
All of the crazy possibilities
...
