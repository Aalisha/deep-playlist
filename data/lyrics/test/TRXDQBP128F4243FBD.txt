I went to Blockhead Video
To rent a tape of people makin' love
Couldn't find no love in here
"It's a family store, see here!"

I Settled for "Faces Of Death"
But they'd rented it to some kid
I'm tired of the same old gore
Kick Butt Cable Network gives me more

All day
All night
Broadcast live

Gas
Fry
Injection
Die

Bring the pretzels, bring the kids
Have a party, have a beer
Phil Donahue got his wish
Executions on live TV

Here's your host, Kozy Kinkwicket!
What's your name?... You're 14?
And what are you being put to death for today?
