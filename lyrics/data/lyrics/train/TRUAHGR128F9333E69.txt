There´s a strip bar at the corner
Is a dirty part of town
And the streets are gettin´ hotter
As the Sun is going down

It´s been a long day
The longest day...
There´s a moonlight in the gutter(olu, kaba adi düzeysiz)
And a guitar on my mind for the city blues

I´d better slow down
Slow down, and follow the night
...
