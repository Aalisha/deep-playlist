I'd give it up and start all over if I could
Chasing back the hands of time
Praise my intuition, knock on wood
You could never change my mind

Though I stop a lot and wonder
How the tables have been turned
I used to think I loved you
But I still can't really say for sure
I'm liable to be curious till the day I die

For the best years of life with you
For all our mistakes
For the sweet love I hold on to
For experience sake
