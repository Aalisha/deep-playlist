Enough of this throat singing already
If you wanna sing two notes at once
Why don't you do like everyone else
Get a multi-track machine
Lay 'em down separately
Make a little harmony
Maybe a bass track
Like one from the Rolling Stones
None of this long lost art
This archaic stuff
Go out and make something

If you wanna make some dough
You oughta invest in my company
We're putting barcodes
On the fetuses
