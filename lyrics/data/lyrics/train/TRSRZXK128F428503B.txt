Evidence and Babu on the beat, for Souls of Mischief
So unique yo, yo Ope set it
I'm sharper than Clive Barker or Steven King when I'm authoring evil things
I'll smoke you like a Marlboro, but I'm a cheeba fiend, puffin white zombie
That make people dream of cities of gold
Around the world twice before I was 20 years old
Fuckin' slutty-ass hoes, and top-notch babes spending money uh-oh
Offerin' to buy me some coke
Listen baby I'm a lyricist, that's not my thing
I slang dope, but not pharmaceuticals super flow
Yeah numero uno cuz you know
The human cat scan wouldn't read your brain, they say "He's insane!"
Listen to my raps man
Colder than zero, I’ll freeze the rain, hail mary
We remain, don't care if we front page on the rolling stones
It’s in my chromosomes to hold my own, rock till I'm overthrown
I'm jack hammering, raps of stone
Walls and I won't fall
Victim, drunk like I'm awesome, incredible, federal
Like forty watter(?), hotter than an orgy, spot a corny nigga from a mile away
Yeah, Eastside Oakland, raised me that way,
I got my three eyes open
