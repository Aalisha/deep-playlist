One Day I Had to Punch up This One Yute for Tryin Make a Fool of Me
In My Hood there's Only So Many Opportunities
Look, I Carry a Tool for My Pride and My Jewelry
Now I Find Myself Stuck Serving the Community

See Me I Made a Change
I Didn't Expect No Fame
We Came From Practically Nuttin' To Thousands Screaming Our Name
A-List, Play list
Even My Mums Famous
I Would Do Anythin' for Some Source Stadium Status

See The Thing about Life Is That It's
It's Just Too Short
Leave The Best behind and Only Then You'll Find There's More to Life than You First Thought

Coz I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That It Would Ever Get Better
Coz I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That It Would Ever Get Better
See I
I Never Ever Ever Ever Thought That I Could Face This Weather
But Life
It Will Only Get Better
Trust Me It Will Only Get Better

Ha Ha Ha Ha

Haa Heeey
