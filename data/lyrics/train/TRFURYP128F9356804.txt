War, war, war, war
I want to declare a war
My fist breaks your porcelain nose
There are other things that hands can do
To create or to destroy
Mini gods and goddesses
First person singular
Set it off

War, war, war, war
Keep the past, the future is ours
Man made natural disaster
Blocking out all of the Sun
Supermen and Mitsi Turbo
Speed agility, super strength
Wipe the blood of those knuckles
Spark it, give me twos on that
