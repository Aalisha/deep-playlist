Well papa always told me that I'd be something in life
Somebody famous someone who would make changes like
A superstar actor or maybe a musician
A diplomat a scholar or maybe a politician then
Hmmm, a politician then
I could go to college get knowledge and make connections
Volunteer with the city and sit in on senate sessions and
Watch how they do what they do when they do it
So I could do what they do and pursue it
For the fame and popularity
For the money the perks the privileges and not for giving charity
Maybe even initiate into the secret social collective
So I could be respected
And dangle the string for the puppets to dance when I say
Talk when I say, walk when I say
Let they children cry while my little one's play
Let my parents live nice while theirs wither away
Let them work through the night while I relax all day
Uh huh, that's the way that I envision it to be
A politician it would be so infinitely lovely
Can no one get above me when I finally have the power
I could change they brain patterns with malathion showers
And transmitting low wave frequency emissions
Damn I can't wait for the day that I could be a politician
Damn I can't wait for the day that I could be a politician
Damn I can't wait for the day that I could be a politician
