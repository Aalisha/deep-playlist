Diabolical Summoning
Black pentagrams resurrect
as a dark treacherous death
reflects the eyes of everlasting disgrace,
a burning sky with dreadful shapes
Nocturnal sign of blasphemy,
sacrilegious prophecies
Reflections of forgotten fright,

Diabolical summoning

Sunken valleys of the dead
Desert of nocturnal tombs,
beholding occult prophecies
The aeons from the underworld

Diabolical summoning

See through the eyes of existence
Ritual of the ancient spheres
