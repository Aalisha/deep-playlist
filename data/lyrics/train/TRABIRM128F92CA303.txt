The blackest of organs lying on the floor throbbing and
glistening full of deep bitter wants
Dirty blood trickles gushes then torrents flow down to
the gutter where nobody knows
It clots and hardens under the weight of these mouldy
truths

Crawling down its black throat
All mangled and devastated
It festers and decomposes
...
