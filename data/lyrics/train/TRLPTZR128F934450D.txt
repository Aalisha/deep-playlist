The dogs are out singing songs 
Right here is the place to be 
If you talk with me all night long 
Tomorrow we might just feel free 

If you ask me what I'm hoping for 
I'll tell you there's no hope at all 
Just give me one more night to change 
With friends around I don't feel dead 
I'm not alone 

More money to spend on empty songs 
Created by bastards on dope 
...
