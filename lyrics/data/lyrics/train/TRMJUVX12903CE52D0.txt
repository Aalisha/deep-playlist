So it starts
With the kicking of your heart
The clenched fist of your will
If you'd love to rip this fucking place apart I'm right behind you still
What will you do now?
What will people think
Now that Christians bought up hardcore and Disney owns the punk scene?

Congratulations to you I guess
What else can I say
You're right I'm amazed you show up ten years too late
You sure as hell won't stay

This isn't defamation
