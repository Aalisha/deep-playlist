I wanna walk down 3rd street slow
Drive up and down the coast
Watching the sunset hang
while God puts on His show
I want a life outside my own
a stranger that everybody knows
i want to kill the ghost that haunts me
as i grow

But today
and every single day
just covers up my face
the earth is dark
but i can see the sky

Chorus:
tonight
i 'll leave myself behind
and run into the light
i am broken
but that just your type
