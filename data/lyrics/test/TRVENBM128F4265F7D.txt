Cooling out cooling out
Waiting for my lady got the special sauce that's why she's my baby my baby
My baby
And of course I'll do anything for her anything she wants
It's sure honey sure
Got a sharp mouth a sharp tongue gimme gimme gimme some
Don't take to that gimme gimme none
You gots to work and deserve it earn it to own it
Once you got it you never ever going to leave it alone don't take wise cracking or
Forgetting never been stood up
She does the stepping

My baby got sauce
Your baby ain't sweet like mine
She got sauce
Your baby ain't sweet like mine
She got sauce
Your baby ain't sweet like mine
Naw, she ain't as sweet

That's some funky lemonade you got going there babe
Is it special for me
Did you make it today
I'll always stop by if you like me to
I'll do anything that you could ever want for me to do
A kiss for some of this
A smile and it's done
Miss I'm your mister
