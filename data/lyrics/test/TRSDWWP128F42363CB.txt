Nervy push and wordy stagger
Blow up world in minor key
Step out wide, I think I'll back her
Reckon she'll get there ahead of me

Jittery aim and all

Bend out flat in face of aggression
See what you can take

Hey! Take that river back!
Put it on the shelf!

Sometimes I think we could fly the whole affair by FX
Moon, wings, the usual
