I want to bring it back home
I want to... okay
I want to bring it back home
All along that way
I want to bring it back home
I want to... okay
I want to bring it back home
All along that way

Well tell me
What I'm saying
Well tell me
I want to know
Well tell me
What I'm saying
Well tell me
Cause I want to know

Bring it a-round-round
And bring it all back again
Bring it a-round-round
...
