I will cut my tongue to end this here
As words to bullets and feelings to fears
You danced the night away, you stole my heart that day
I dare to cause this war, maybe i will die therefor

Yet i think it is my juliet story
Because you are my everything

but this beauty leaves the room
and my dream seems to be over
my tongue is not severed and the end is here
