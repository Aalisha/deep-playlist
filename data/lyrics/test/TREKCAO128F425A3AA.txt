Oooh, have you ever...
Have you ever loved, loved, loved

You keep running, running away
I know you can't run forever
You think you're heading for a heartbreak again
Just as you did before

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

CHORUS
Have you ever loved somebody
Can you learn to love somebody
When somebody loves you
Have you ever known that feeling
...
