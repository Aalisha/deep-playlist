I guess you've been worrying about my mental stability
I may seem unusual, but there is really nothing wrong with me
I tell you my secrets, but you think that I'm boring

Don't worry about me, I'm as sane as can be
Don't worry about me, I'm as sane as can be
Your eyes glaze over when I tell you what I'm feeling
Do I scare you? Do I annoy you? Do I make you feel uncomfortable?
