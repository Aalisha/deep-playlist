The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
Secret destroyers, hold you up to the flames.
And what do I get for my pain?
Betrayed desires and a piece of the game.

Even though I know, I suppose I'll show,
All my cool and cold like old Job.

Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage

Now I'm naked, nothing but an animal
But can you fake it for just one more show?
And what do you want; I want to change
