How we love, we love to hurt ourselves
How we live, we live to hurt each other
And how it feels when it's you who hates yourself
It's hard to care when it seems no one else does
And I know how it feels when all the pressure is too real
With all these bad thoughts in my head
I try, but I can't quite get rid of them

I've hit the bottom
I'm at the bottom again
Can someone lend a helping hand?
I've hit the bottom
I'm at the bottom again
