Well when I've had enough,
I'll get a pick-up truck and I'll drive away.
I'll take my last ten bucks just as far as it will go.

Ahh sometimes I'm easily fooled,
I take a painful step and I get knocked back two.
I do all I can and it's all I can do, but I'm true.

And if I had the choice I'd take the voice I got
Cause it was hard to find.
