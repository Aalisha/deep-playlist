You are blind
Deny the sun and light
Whose are the objections
From where come the doubts

Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked

Serenades of opposition
Absurdity, humans fate and hope
True reflections of community
Procreation of the gods and lords
