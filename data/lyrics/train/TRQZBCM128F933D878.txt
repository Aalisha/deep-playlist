[Chorus:]
Goooo low,
Baby I just wanna go low,
I just wanna go low.
Goooo low,
Baby I just wanna go low,
I just wanna go low.
Goooo low,
Girl I just wanna
Take your clothes off,
Put you in the bed girl,
Lick yo body real slow.
Gooo low,
Girl I wanna be sippin,
On yo sweet sweet water.
It's crunch time bout to give you that 12 play this is the 4th quarter.

[Verse:]
Some people sit rite there,
And can't say wats on there mind.
Some people wanna freak,
But some are just too damn shy.
With me that's not the deal.
Girl I sayy how I feel.
Wen I see somethin I like,
I'm gonna keep it real.

For instance you look like food, I wanna put you on my plate.
(Would you like that)
Sop you up with some biscuits,
And gon on eat you bae
(Would you like that girll)
Up until you make it rain,
Grab my ears && pull my face.
Tonite I'll be givin you brain.

[Chorus:]
