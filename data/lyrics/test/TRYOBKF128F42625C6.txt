Never know how much I love you
You never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a feeling that I just can't bear
You give me fever
when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Bless my soul I love you
Take this heart away
Take these arms I never use them
And just believe what my lips have to say
You give me fever
