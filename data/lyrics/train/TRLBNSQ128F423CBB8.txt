Black witches sing their verses
Of charms, hexes and curses
They tried to take out my eyes
But I don't have to hide

I don't have to hide, I don't have to hide
I don't have to hide from you
I don't have to hide, I don't have to hide
I don't have to hide from you

Black sunset's on it's way down
I've got to go out on the town
...
