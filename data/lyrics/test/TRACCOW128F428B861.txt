Wild life, wild life
Yeah, no telling what I might do
When I'm in the right mood
You know me
I'm all up in the party like a v.I.p
And everything is looking better from my p.o.v
Nocturnal animals, we don't sleep
And I'll probally forget you c.e.e
Lo green, I'm sweating like the amazon
A hundred degrees and that backs
House bigger than a family tree
So drop that thing like a fumble
Like ya talking to the king of the jungle
We got lions, tigers, bears, oh, my!
And every single ones

Turn up, yo
I don't want anyone bringing the vibes down.
So if you wanna wind down
Oh look what I found
A little something that will keep
You awake until the break of dawn
Don't be afraid to get rowdy

I'm not done yet
Pass me the bottle
It's 2am
Lets hit the throttle
...
