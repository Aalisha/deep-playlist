*Chainsaw revving for 4 seconds*

You got your invitation.
A family dinner, and tonight you will meet.

No need for hesitation, sugar.
We're gonna love you and it's all we can eat.

The steaks ala carte mama makes from the heart.
Pa's such a gourmet for gore.
Jammed eyes, bleeding herbs.
Banquet dining is worth dying for.

At the chainsaw - chainsaw buffet.
The secret ingredient screams.
You're my main course
at the chainsaw buffet.
Feed on man-eaters's cuisine.
At the chainsaw - chainsaw buffet!
