Well I pulled outta Pittsburgh a rollin' down that Eastern Sea board
I got my diesel wound up and she's a runnin' like a never before
There's a speed zone ahead alright I don't see a cop in sight

I'm takin' little white pills and my eyes are open wide
I just passed me a Jimmy in white I been passin' everything in sight
