Walls so white
Where your sorrows have a name
And day is dark as night
There's no remorse and no redemption
Close the door
Can you hear the crowd is waiting?
For a last encore

Screaming out for my attention

Chanting my name
Welcome all to curtain call
At the opera
Raging voices in my mind
Rise above the orchestra
Like a crescendo of gratitude
This is my song
...
