I've been working a long long time
Now I'm caught in a wicked bind
You offered love but I threw that out
I couldn't hear you I was too busy shouting

Like a laughing hyena run out of breath
I shot my rocks off 'till there's nothing left
It's an old old story I suppose
A heavy price for a heavy pose

Take care of me
Take care of me
Somebody should
I'm pretty good
