You always check yourself
In every mirror you see
Day and night
And it is such a shame
Your vanity is to blame
Oh why don't you knock it off

It is the pointlessness
That's got me loving less
I cannot handle that you're such a wannabe
You're caught up in yourself
And me, you don't even see

I won't be crying when I'm lonely
Sorry making sure I'll have a
Good time
Ain't nothing wrong when i'm alone now
