Girl, it's my pleasure to do whatever, whatever you like
And if you say it, then I will do it all night
You got me screamin' my my
M-m-my my, m-m-my my, m-m-my my, my baby

Girl, I wanna know if I wine you and I dine you
Will you wake up in the mornin' in my bed?
Don't you tell me no

From the bar to the car, we ain't got that far, no, no
To the boom boom room, got something for you, yeah
So hop off in this tub and show your boy some love
Baby, I just wanna thank you

Girl, I wanna thank you for the lovely evenin'
And I wanna thank you for the time we spent
And to show my appreciation
I wanna bang your back until the mornin' come

Girl, I wanna thank you for a lovely evenin'
And I wanna thank you for the time we spent
And to show my appreciation
I wanna bang your back until the mornin' come
...
