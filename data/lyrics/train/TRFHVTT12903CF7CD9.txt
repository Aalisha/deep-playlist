I'm gonna do it darlin'
I could waste time tryin' to figure it out
But I'm jumpin' anyhow
I've never been this far
Didn't know love could run so deep
Didn't know I'd lose this much sleep
Holdin' you close, chasin' that moon
Spendin' all night
Lovin' flyin' in the dark
Shootin' out lights, huntin' down dreams
Figurin' out what love really means
Baby givin' you my heart
Is a real fine place to start
