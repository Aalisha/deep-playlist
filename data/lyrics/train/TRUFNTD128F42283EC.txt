When I was a kid
I still see what we did
We were always on the run
It would seem
That you had a dream
That you could be anyone

I remember one day
An old man passed my way
He looked at me and he said:
Boy don't you cry
You reach for the sky
Boy you look straight ahead!

If you know what you want
And you know how to get it
Don't let any man
Let you forget it
If you know what you mean
You won't regret it
Dream On
That's what I say
You Dream on
Till love comes your way
You Dream On

And as time went by
As the many nights
...
