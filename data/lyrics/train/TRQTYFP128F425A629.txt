Gotta get back, gotta figure out a way
I'm losing, my senses to you
Where'd it go? The bluebird I should follow
Back home, but where is home?

Guess it won't amount to much
Won't be long before I crush
I'll stand in line

Don't believe a thing they say today
Seems we all get lost amongst
The pigeons and the crumbs

All alone, but I'm in a crowded room
...
