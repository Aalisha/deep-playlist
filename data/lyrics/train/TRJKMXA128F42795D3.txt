If I could achieve what I do with these

I wouldn't ask you for anything else.
Bring me closer
bring me closer
please
bring me closer.
I though we were friends
it never start

It only ends and I'm losing everyting I own.
You took me nowhere
you took me nowhere

You took me nowhere
you took me nowhere
