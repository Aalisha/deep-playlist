Well I don't know if I'm wrong
'Cause she's only just gone
Here's to another relationship
Bombed by my excellent breed of gamete disease
I'm sure when I'm older I'll know what that means
Cried when she should and she laughed when she could
Here's to the man with his face in the mud
And an overcast play just taken away
From the lover's in love at the centre of stage, yeah
Loving is fine if you have plenty of time
For walking on stilts at the edge of your mind
Loving is good if your dick's made of wood
But the dick left inside only half understood her
What makes her come? What makes her stay?
What makes the animal run, run away? Yeah
What makes him stall, what makes him stand?
And what shakes the elephant now and what makes a man?
