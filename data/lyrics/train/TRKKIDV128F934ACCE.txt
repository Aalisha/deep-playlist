Such suffering and sickness
From a moment of ecstasy
As your skeletal and noxious body ceases to live
With this ever growing infection
Death claims you

Diseased, you didn't know your lover was diseased
So hot to get laid, indulge in unprotected sex
The one you have intercourse with hosts a virus
Infections blood tainted with HIV
Passing the contagion on to you
You are now a member of the modern epidemic
Intact health was only a condom away
But you let your guard down for a fatal fuck
This terminal illness wears your body down
A virus destroying all of your antibodies
You are now so susceptible
A blood test of positive now revealed
Covered with skin eating fesions
AIOS hungrily grows at your immune system
Your T-cell lymphocytes destroyed
Fatal condition kills slowly
Too weak to move, breathe, or ever get aroused
Running ulcers and abscesses wrap your body
Quarantined to your death bed, you stick to your sheets
The disease has developed to a most sever state
Ashes to ashes, genitals to jelly
