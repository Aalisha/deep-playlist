Pitch black skies whip down the rain
That freezes your blood and makes you feel weak
The wind and the cold are bringing you down
You fight, you'll lose, you just don't know it yet

The never ending path you crawl is slowly killing you
You'll never ever ger back home, now you know it too

Every single step you take gets you closer to the bitter end

The never ending path you crawl is slowly killing you
You'll never ever ger back home, now you know it too
