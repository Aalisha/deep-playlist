You've got your favourite programmes
The bird, the dog, two cats
One of your babies will always
Ring on the weekend for a chat 

A beautiful garden
Too easily getting out of hand
How can you concentrate at all? 

On the high ground
You're there on your own
>From the high ground 

And from down here we can feel it
You can move the mountain with your pain
They all want to be near you
And then too soon drive home again
'Cause grief is like that
And you're like a captain on her ship -
In the end you stand alone
