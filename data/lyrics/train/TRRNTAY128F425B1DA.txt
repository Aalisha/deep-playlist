Big boss man
Won't you hear me when I call? (big boss man, ah, big boss man)
Yeah, big boss man
Won't you hear me when I call? (big boss man, ah, big boss man)
Well you ain't so big
You just tall and that's all (big boss man, ah, big boss man)

Well, you got me workin', boss man
Workin' around the farm
I wanna little drink of water
But you won't gimme some
