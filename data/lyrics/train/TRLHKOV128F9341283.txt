From the top ov the highest mountain
Prior to descent, my fall for Thee
My weapon is silence
I, bringer ov light to burn this goddamn Eden down!

Behold! I rise from primal silence
As a storm crushing dismal shores ov Acheron
My weapon is violence
From the mud ov the earth
Back to the womb ov Babalon

Sink in the stream ov woe
...
