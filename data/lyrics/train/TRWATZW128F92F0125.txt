I was always late, you never afraid
That we could be falling
All our friends would say that maybe we should wait
But they can't see what's coming

And to this day when everything breaks
You are the anchor that holds me

And that is why we'll always make it
How I know your face, all the ways you move
You come in, I can read you, you're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive
