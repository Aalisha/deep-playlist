What's keeping me, what's keeping me
God tell me what is keeping me
I thought I saw Resolution yesterday
But he just smiled and waved

What's holding me, what's holding me
Dear God, what is holding me
I thought I knew what laid in store
I didn't count on locked up doors

And all I know is something happened
The wind changed directions
The lovers cried and the birds flew away

Why did I stay, why did I stay

What tied me up, what tied me up
Like chewing gum my feet got stuck
...
