I wonder where you are.
Please don't come around tonight
'cause I can't stand to see you and I don't want to fight.
Gimme one more drink and I swear
I think I'll be ready to make the same mistakes again with you.

I finally figured out that you're not coming back
and I'm not going anywhere.
You were the one with all the faith how did you let it slip away? That's right, I'm blaming this all on you
and the little things you didn't do.
We both knew that you were stronger,
could have fought a little longer.
You didn't hold it tight enough.
You lost your grip and I slipped right through your fingers.
