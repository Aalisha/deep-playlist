In the dark lights, we come out and play
We are its children and we're here to stay
Running through the streets, hungry for strays
No invitation to take me away
I'm not cruel, but that's still what you see
Club to club, come see this city with me
Hungry for life, without your pity
I don't want it, but it comes anyway

Chorus
You go sexual city
You still can't say she won't start up a fight
