Take a chance, before it's gone
Throw me a rope or string me along
I'm nothing without you, this man is nothing without you
I know it's been a difficult year
It's been all I can do just to keep you near
I want you to know you're the star of my show

I sing these songs about you
It wouldn't be the same without you
I know you try to hide, I know you try to act tough

But take a chance on us (take a chance on us)
Throw your arm round love (don't give me up)
Let it pull you up tonight, take a chance on us tonight
But take a chance on us, (take a chance on us)
But I won't give us up (don't give me up)
