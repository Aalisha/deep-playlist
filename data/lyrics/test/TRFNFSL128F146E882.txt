Last night I tried but I couldn't sleep
thoughts of you were in my head
I was lonely and I needed you next to me
Life is harder since you left
I never meant to do you wrong
And now all is said and done
I hope you wont be gone too long, Nooo

Chorus:
Where do I go, what do I do,
I can't deny i still feel something,
And girl, I wish you could say you feel the same,
You've broken the bond, I gotta move on,
But how do i end this lonely feeling?
You've gone, I'm here, alone,
I guess it's time to grow
