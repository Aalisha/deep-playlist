So cold, in the night, where the river flows, where the river flows.
So cold, in the night, where the river flows, where the river flows.

Sail away, hey, I'm sorry; every day is a new day.

Hooray for love, hey, I'm lonely,
Trying to find a new way.

So cold, in the night, where the rivers slow, say the river's slow,
So cold, in the night, where the rivers slow, say the river's slow,
So cold...
