Wouldn't it be a change for you and me to stay at home once ina while?
We'd babaret until the break of day
I'll bet we've danced many a mile
I'll like to see a movie once more
They don't keep people staying up until four

Wouldn't it be a pleasant novelty to tumble in early once more?

Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day
Sleepy time gal, you've danced the ev'ning away
Before each silvery star fades out of sight
Please give me one little kiss
Then let us whisper 'goodnight'
It's getting' lat and dear your pillow's waitin'
...
