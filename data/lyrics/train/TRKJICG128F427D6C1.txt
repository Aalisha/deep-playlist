Steal a kiss
from your lips I steal a kiss
and want for this happiness to fool me
sea deep blue eyes
sea deep deep big blue eyes
and want for you always to see me

A trip to the heavens on angels' wings
Gabriel plays and Angelica sings
singing the praises of finer things
a trip to the heavens on angels' wings

Sweet treasured time
