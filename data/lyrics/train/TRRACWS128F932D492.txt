You may walk away in anger
Wear your heart upon your sleeve
You make act like it don't matter
Keep me laughing while you leave
But burning bridges won't get me back
If you change your mind some day
Why can't we turn this scene around
Before you walk away?

Will you be leaving, leaving me today?
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand
