The honeymoons over and the loves gone sour
Her nagging has got you down
But you picked the wrong way to deal with it
You chose to slap her around
When you exchanged your wedding vows
Nobody said "you may now fist the bride"
Now that the little woman went and got her gun
The love ain't all that died

Jealousy
She knows you can't live without it
The bullet's speed
