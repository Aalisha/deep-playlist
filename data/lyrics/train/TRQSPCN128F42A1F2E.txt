I was a P.F.C. on a search patrol, huntin' Charlie down
It was in the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big Marine, a giant, with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said "Wait"

When he came in close beside me, he said "Don't worry, son,
I'm here
If Charlie wants to tangle now, he'll have two to dodge"
I said, "Well, thanks a lot", I told him my name and
asked him his
And he said "The boys just call me Camouflage"


Chorus:
Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Woah-oh-oh-oh, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big Marine



Well, I was gonna ask him where he came from, when we heard the
bullets fly
Comin' through the brush, and all around our ears
It was then I saw this big Marine light a fire in his eye
And it was strange, but suddenly, I forgot my fears
