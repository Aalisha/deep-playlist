I need you girl
I couldn't live a day without you

Well I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
To explain the way you make you feel inside

Thought the meaning may be simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried

I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone I ever know
I need you
And I wanna build my world around you
I need you
