I recognized your number
It's burned into my brain
Felt my heart beating faster
Every time it rang
Some things never change
That's why I didn't answer

I bet you're in a bar
Listening to a country song
Glass of Johnny Walker Red
With no one to take you home

They're probably closing down
Saying, "No more alcohol"
I bet you're in a bar
'Cause I'm always your last call
