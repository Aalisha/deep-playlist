And you, were right to bide your time and not buy into my misery,
well the good things are never free,
do the colours of the rainbow look the same to everyone,

And I, was rushin' round in circles for a reason to believe,
wipe the slime from of your sleeve,
you could follow me for weeks and i'm not goin' anywhere,

Sometimes it's hard to love someone,
until the day that they are gone,

And I, just had a dream the other night,
I was married to the Queen,
and Madonna lived next door,
I think she took a shine to me,
and the kids were all grown up,
but I had to turn her down coz I was still in love with you,
...
