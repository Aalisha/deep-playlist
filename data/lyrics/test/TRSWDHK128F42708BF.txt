Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out

Up to bat
I thought I hit a love run
But to my surprise
I found I didn't hit none

Threw her love so fast
She put me in a daze
Never knew that love
Could come so many ways

Strike one - She took me by surprise
Strike two - Right in front of my eyes
Strike three - Oh, I was out without a doubt
Oh, I was out

Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out
...
