come on party were beautiful
one more taste have to melt and frame hold on Picasso
uplift fusion with massive palms

passion immobile is not the solution

a steady win. process for evolution craters

sour, the burning saint in ember
let her glow ignored while she was complete

there is so many days and i still have my dreams

youre standing still in the shadows
