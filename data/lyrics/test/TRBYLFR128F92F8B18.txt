This distant light, helps to remind me
So it keeps me in check but not all of the time
It goes straight to the nerve at the back of my mind
And it helps me retain what I openly give to you
For safekeeping

It's only safekeeping now
I will refrain from the words that I say to you
That's if you want me to my dear
Cos we're only safekeeping now
I will return all the words that I took from you
And I broke in two these things that help me

These words collide, help to decide me
So they keep me awake but not all of the time
They go straight to the place in the back of my mind
...
