I don't pick up the mail,
I don't pick up the phone,
I don't answer the door,
I just soon be alone
I don't keep this place up,
I just keep the lights down,
I don't live in these rooms,
I'm just rattled around

I'm just a ghost in this house,
I'm just a shadow upon these walls,
As quietly as a mouse,
I haunt these halls,
...
