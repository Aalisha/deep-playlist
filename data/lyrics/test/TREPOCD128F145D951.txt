I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change in my life
Starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would
And baby it's you

The way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say my name, your smile
(You)
The way you move me
The way you soothe me
The way you sleep softly through the night
(You)
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
