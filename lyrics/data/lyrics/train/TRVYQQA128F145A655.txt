He's the king of rock and roll
All right, yeah
Right

Hot night, summer in the city
Just about to smoke and burn
Look out, he's evil but he's pretty
And oh he's going to twist and turn

He's got the midnight madness, he's got control
He's the king of rock and roll

Bad blood, everybody knows it
...
