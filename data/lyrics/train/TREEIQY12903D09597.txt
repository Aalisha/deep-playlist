Should I try and cut myself for you?
Do have to let it bleed with no regard?
Tell me just exactly what to do?
I'm afraid that I have gone too far.

Cuz I don't know just what you're feeling yet,
Cuz I've been left out in the cold,
All I know is we both share regrets,
We haven? t done this yet,
There nothing here we cannot change.
