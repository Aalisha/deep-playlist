I've got to heat it up
Doctor, got to heat it up
I've got til 3 o'clock
I've got to rock until you drop

I've got to heat it up
Doctor, got to heat it up
I've got til 3 o'clock
I've got to rock until you drop

Something kinda ooooh,
Jumping on my tutu
Something 'side of me,
Wanting part of you-oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh,
Makes my heart go boom boom
Something 'side of me,
Wanting what you do0oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh,
Jumping on my tutu
Something 'side of me,
Wants some part of you-oo-ooh

Something kinda ooooh,
Bumping in the back room,
Something 'side of me,
Wanting what you do-oo-ooh

Ooh, when tomorrow comes
Baby, I won't even known your name
Baby so good
Wanna follow on by
But I'll never meet you
Never see you again
