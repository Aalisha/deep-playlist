the ghost of you
has almost faded now
you're drifting in and out
of my life
when leaves fall you'll come right back
' cause I was yours for a little while

you will always be
a ghost who lives and breathes
and you lay me down in reverie
every tear that falls
remember me

and I thought I heard your haunting sigh
...
