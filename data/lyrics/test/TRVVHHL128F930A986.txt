Let me tell you about a place I knew,
Where the fields were green and the skies were blue,
In middle class suburbia with a swimming pool,
And all the other trappings of a public school.

I'd get a size-6-rugby in my face,
For not liking games that much and "being out of place"
Or get my head kicked in for liking Yes,
Instead of Suzi Quattro, or The Rubettes
