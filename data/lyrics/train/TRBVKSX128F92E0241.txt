Keep generating, joy making
Keep dreaming on phorever people
Keep generating, joy making
Keep dreaming on phorever people

Phorever people behold you stand tall,
You won't fall, because you give it your All
With a magical aura of wisdom and will
We'll progress into the future
And never stand still
Knowing and seeing
That we're going through change
Discovery of Light, starting to arrange
In the mind with the help of visualisation
Plan for the future, civilisation
Making a decision, and knowing it's right
Discovery of truth in the vision of light
Phorever people you will always be
A step forward in life for positivity
So keep on believing, and keep on going
Keep on trying and keep on sowing
The seed that is good, you know that we know
Yo, uh, here we go

We are phorever people
And we don't have to look to far
To find ourselves
Cos what we see is what we are
Phorever we will be together
In our dream destiny
Phorever people can it be?
We are phorever people
And we don't have to look to far
...
