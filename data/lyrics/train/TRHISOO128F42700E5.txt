Love never came between us
For love was too deep in our hearts
It's the silly things we do between us
That managed to tear us apart
But oh I believe if we work real hard
We can get through, through it this time
Girl, just trust me and I will trust you
There'll be nothing that we can't get through

I love you babe, in the scariest way
I want you babe, to stay with me
I love you babe, though it's hurtin' to say
I want you babe, to stay with me

I love you babe, in the scariest way
I want you babe, to stay with me
I love you babe, though it's hurtin' to say
I want you babe, to stay with me
