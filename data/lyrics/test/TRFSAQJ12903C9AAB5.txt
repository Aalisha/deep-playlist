Verse 1 
Who do you call at 2 in da morning when you're feeling lonely and got no friends 
Where do you go when you run outof places and the walls of your dreams 
Come crashing in 
What do you do whern you've used all your voices and your only choice is packing it in 
Who wants to know that your life is a crisis cause you're paying the prices for living in sin 
Nobody wants to know 
if you're feeling down in the dumps 
You climb all the way to the top floor but you cant even get up the guts to jump 

Hook 
Cherry Brandy (Hennessey and Red Bull) 
Cames in real handy (Johnny Walker Blue baby) 
Vodka wine and whickey (swig another mouthful) 
Go down fine (grab another 'Q' baby) 
If I get lucky (if Jack Daniels got you turning) 
Maybe I'll make it to 40 (stagger to the loo baby) 
...
