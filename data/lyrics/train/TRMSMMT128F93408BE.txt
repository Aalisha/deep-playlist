I read a rumour in a tabloid paper
You said something interesting, denied it later
There was no evidence they couldn't make it stick
It's on Youtube now and then
But comes down pretty quick
So we stayed up and we argued all night
If we can't change the world
Let's at least get the charts right
The record buying public shouldn't have been voting
The record buying public shouldn't have been voting
How can you sleep at night
when nobody likes the music we like?
How am I supposed to sleep at night
when no one likes the music we write?
Record buying public: we hate them
This is Art Brut vs. Satan
