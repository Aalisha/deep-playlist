My problem isn't that I miss you
'Cuz I don't
My problem isn't that I kissed you
Woah oh.

I figured out
That you're nothin' that I thought you're about
You're just caught in a place
It's what time will erase in my heart.

You're my type of guy I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High
For the rest of my life
But people change
Thank God I did.

Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you.

Your problem's not for lack of tryin'
'Cuz you do
It's just that you act you best when your lyin'
Woah oh.
