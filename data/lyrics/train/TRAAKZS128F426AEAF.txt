Sure you haven't got the wrong number
You sure its me you wanna talk to tonight?
Everyone in town's got your number
Everybody's got you pegged right

Is that why you got in touch with me?
I guess you must be runnin' out of fools

When you went and left me there crying
Your goodbye was even colder than ice
It didn't bother you I was crying
And now you wanna break my heart twice
