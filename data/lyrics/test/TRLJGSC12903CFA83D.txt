I hear you calling
But I'll stay quiet till you go
You might be that jackal
That tries to steal my bones
Or you might be that preacher man
Who tries to cleanse me with his dirty hands
Or you might be the voice of reason
Convincing me to stand

I cannot fall
I cannot fall from the lowest place on earth
...
