I lie awake at night consumed by tragedy
I feel depression's cold hand reaching out for me
All I've ever wanted was your honesty
But now the words, become the blade
that you have driven into me

I don't need your sympathy

I know you're alone tonight, with tears you cry
I hope you're satisfied, and yeah I'm doing fine
Now baby it could be fun, to fire your gun
I promise not to run
...
