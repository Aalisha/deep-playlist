I have forsaken you
and all I ever felt was true
To take that step and fall to aim beyond these walls
With hope that the stars align
to get a glimpse of my goal defined
I stare the eyes of my biggest fear
Swallow pride I'll persevere

I fear my heart
Fear my soul
I fear I'm weak
I'm fearing you
I fear the cold
That the world is yours
That I drown your shores
I fear I'm wrong that I don't belong
I fear the cold
...
