What's this shit goin' down 'bout the FCC
Gone to war against obscenity
Well, in times like these
You better watch what you say
Watch 'em take your fucking rights away

Darlin' I've been falling down
Darlin' we've been and I'm falling down
Don't you wanna know? oh, oh, oh

Just a shame, just a drag, just the USA
More concerned about the things we say
