Your eyes are small
You'll never make everyone love your hometown
A curtain called
Make sure not to drop your head down
Because they'll want to see your eyes
And they'll want to see surprise in them

Someday
I will draw the line
And try to catch you disappointed
Yeah, yeah
Same guy
Spitting different rhymes
Someday I'll catch you disappointed
Disappointed

I never tried so hard
To get every single word out
That my tongue carved little scars
In the roof of my mouth
And I thought I tasted blood
But you convinced me otherwise
