Intro:
Stop it daddy
Daddy stop it nuh
A going to tell on you enuh

Chorus:
Daddy don't touch mi there
I'm gonna tell on you one day I swear
Can't you see I'm scared
You suppose to be ma father x2

Verse 1:
Everyday a wonder why ma daddy had to be di one
to take away my innocence
Oh sometimes a wanna die feels
like no one cares for me and it's evident
That something must be wrong with me
I'm not as happy as I seem to be
The long showers I take don't wash away the memories
Why do I have to face these tragedies

We go thru struggles in life I'm aware
...
