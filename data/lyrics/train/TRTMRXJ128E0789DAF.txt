[Verse 1:]
Every day is like a struggle
But I am a baller I stand taller
I rise above the bull shit
I'm not a brawler I give them inspiration
You don't have to be a relation
I've got street FAM
We are from the street man
Keeping it discreet and humble
If you're speaking speak up clear and don't mumble
It don't stop there's always a ruff and tumble
Sale in the jumble girls turn gullible
Once you bring the trust you'll be gone on the travels
I know that I'm a wrong en so I'm gone on my travels
I'll be stacking doe like beer in barrels
Fortunate for me I'm not short of a penny
I'm a crafter a master I'm famous like Lenny Henry
Let me a twenty so I can go and get a Henry
The weed keeps me calm I've got a good memory
You won't get to me by looking through the eyes of wifey
[Verse 2:]
I can see you staring and watching what I'm wearing
Told you I'm a Dan but you just won't hearing
Only now you caring now you hear me tearing
Thought I was a bum when u saw me run bearing
I'm a little wiser I'm a little older
Got a warm heart but a little bit colder
