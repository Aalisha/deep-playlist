I didn't call you today
Didn't think I could trust my voice in all that noise
Fighting for the space, staring down at these words
Tearing up all the reasons why I should try
But God knows why it hurts to be watching, waiting and pleading
when everyone here can see

That I can't heal this rift, feel plates shift
Tell me, me don't tell me everything is fine
One move and I'll slip, one breath I drift
Tell me, don't tell me everything is fine
Stuck here on this faultline
