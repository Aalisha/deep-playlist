Oh this time is right
Oh but I'm wound too tight
Never keep, never sleep, never find All the time
That I need just to stay in line
Gotta go, got to throw all the crap to the side
So that I'm never left by the wayside

Hold on, wait a minute, can't leave here
And then she broke down

No
Uh huh
No
Uh huh

Can't hold me down
Can't slow me down

Oh stop stepping in my way
Not quite what I thought you'd say
Never find, never mind, never peace God at least
Give me strength just for one more try
