Ramona, Ramona, Your'e mine
Ramona, I hear the mission bells above
Ramona , they're ringing out our song of love
I press you, caress you
And bless the day you taught me to care
To always remember
The rambling rose you wore in your hair

Ramona, when day is done you'll hear my call
Ramona, we'll meet beside the waterfall
