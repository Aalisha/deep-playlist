Hurt
On caution weep
With bleeding sky
I called your name
There was no one there
And in the cold and snow
I saw your face

I sang the song for the little things
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
