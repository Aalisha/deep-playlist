I found my box of letters
Lying on the ground
The ones you used to write me before it all went down
I even got a papercut trying to figure out what to do
With all those memories
And your not who you used to be and i wonder where your gone

Have you fallen in a black hole
Tumbling as a universe of missing stuff
What happened to the good times
What happened to the moments where we had so much
Where's the love (2x)

Remember all those hours laughing on the floor
