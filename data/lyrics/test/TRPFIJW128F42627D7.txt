With a face of stone my wounds are showing
In my room alone my fear are growing
Have I lost my place
Did I fall behind
Did I fall from grace
Did you change your mind

Thanks to you I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do I should give it up
Stop wasting time
Cause time is slipping away

Thanks to you I've had enough
It makes no sense to fall in love
What I should do I should give it up
Stop wasting time

Cause time is slipping away (x2)
