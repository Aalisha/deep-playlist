Once in your life
You find what you're looking for
A feeling you can't ignore, so right.
Welcome to love, welcome to paradise
Isn't it very nice, alright.

Even though, your havin' your doubts
We can still work it out,
Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not,
but it's still worth a shot.

Don't Walk Away,
Listen to your heart, hear what it says
'cause your heart won't lie.

Ohhohoh!

Tears in your eyes, frozen upon your face
Memories we can't replace, disappear.
