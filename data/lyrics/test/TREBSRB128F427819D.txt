From memories of 68 when the wizard shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But overtime it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and elecricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

In Henry's and in mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
