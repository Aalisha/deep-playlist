No one knows where she came from
On a night of rain and storm
They found a sleeping girl down by the shore

They never tamed this troubled child
She grew up and she grew wild
She seems to be searching
for something more
Something worth dying for

Her name is stormwind
She's a daughter of the raging sea
Every night you'll hear her lonely song
from across the bay
Her heart is trembling
Like a leaf on a maple tree
Waiting for the autumn rain
Waiting to fly away, fly away
...
