Out by the neon lights
I stand with my back to the wall
Cold breeze of city night
Night when the angels might fall

This city takes no prisoners
Only the strong will survive
Some stumble in the dark
But I got light in my eyes

Ooh, it's dangerous tonight
Someone's gotta fall and some will survive
Ooh, might cut you like a knife
If you hear it calling in the middle of the night
