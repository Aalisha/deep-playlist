Don't you be saying that I'm lucky
Don't you, no, no, don't you dare say it's okay
Don't come around being happy
And don't you be crying without me
'Cause I'll fall again if I see your face again, my love
And I've done all my crying for you, love

So don't break my heart again
Don't break my heart again
