[Chorus:]
Action back where you came your right'n
Everything and everything's ok
I need some action back where you came, 
Your right'n everything's ok

Never gonna fail and you better believe, 
I'm on the top notch coming and won't
Back out on the lease, 
I'm doing all that I please and
Then I'm going top speed, 
I'm cruising but still in control, 
...
