Ain't no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Ooo baby I don't Gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over

Yeah the goose pimples baby
'Cos I feel so good
When you cuddle me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Ooo mercy, I'm a rock-gone pappy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over

Your touch goes through me
