Damn

I got something to tell you
Listen

You know that I like it baby
I don't try to hide it baby
You be tryna fight it baby
But wassup wassup
Its so hard to take it baby
You say it's the matrix baby
Why we gotta fake it baby
Oh... wassup wassup

You let the little things
Like the fact that I make mistakes
Get in all between
What I wanna do with ya
Where I wanna take ya, baby
You say that im pressed
And that I've had my chance
I say it's comeback
That's how I know I gotta get it

I gotta get it
I gotta make you understand what im feeling (what Im feeling)
And girl I should be your man
And you know that the boy ain't playin round
And I'd go that extra mile
Just to put you down
But you don't get It (you don't get it)
So I gotta make you see that you're winnin (that you're winnin)
