Please play at low volume
Preferably, while having sex

Can I taste you, can I taste you?
(Yes, you can)
Can I taste your body, girl?
(Of course you can)
Can I taste you, can I taste you?
I just can't wait to

Can I taste you, can I taste you?
(Of course you can)
Can I taste your body, girl?
(Yes, you can)
Can I taste you, can I taste you?
(Oh, don't stop until I tell you to)

Oh, baby, whatcha doing
Got me feining like this
I wanna go to your valley
I wanna taste your lips, oh yeah

Never understood it
All my homies say don't do it
But baby, when I tried it
Girl, I couldn't help but like it

You taste so good
Baby, you taste so good
You know you do, girl
You taste so good

Baby, do you like it
When I taste your love, yeah
You taste so good
Baby, you taste so good

You know that it tastes so good
