Oh oh oh
All the energy is low
I fall asleep and she ’s getting higher than the rest
She ’s never ever second best
Oh oh oh
All the energy is low
I fall asleep and she ’s getting higher than the rest
She ’s never ever second best

She ’s faking
Every moment of every single day
She ’s taking
She ’s taking pills that will make her fly away
She don ’t need
Need no reason she ’s busting out in tears
She ’s friends with
With the devil and she smiles when he appears

Welcome to the show
This is her adventure
She ’s killing you for sure

Oh oh oh
All the energy is low
