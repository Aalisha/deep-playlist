Everybody, it's a good thing
Everybody wants a good thing
Everybody ain't it true that
Everybody's looking for the same thing?
Ain't it true? There's just no doubt
There's some things that you can't do without
And that's good
Ain't it true? The sun that shines
You got yours and you got mine
And that's good
Everybody's just like you, it's true
Everybody wants a good thing too
