There's something natural in the way you touch me
it's a feeling that I can't describe
something mystic in that soul connection
something magic in your misty eyes

Don't you say that it's all the same
don't you say that it's all the same, no
'cos there's something that I can't explain, 'bout this
something that I can't explain, yeah yeah

I can't explain
Oh no ooh
Hey, yeah

before the night is over
i wanna shake the question
i wanna leave it for now
