On the corner into my car
I drive forever never get far
The 45 is slowly getting loaded
I send another song to my star

California mountains in the mornin'
Stitch it up, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get it off
Take more than your...

Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

A pendulum inside of my bed
Swingin' low, I hope to get hit
The overflow is slow, but not enough no
Another drop will never fix it
