You see the magazines and
Me on your TV screens and
You think you know me but you really dont (You dont even know)
But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell
You see the money and
The cars and diamonds and you
You think it make me but it really dont (It really really dont)
But I, I'm feelin good about myself, so I, I splurge a lil' hell

I think the time has come, for me to have some fun
I'm bout to peel back the top go on and let in the sun
What the fuck I done done, my mamma's only son
I went from slangin and bangin to yellin number one
I love my fans to death, until my last breath
Thats why when I perform I give until there's nothing left
No competition, my opposition gonna feel the pain
More complications, relationships ain't gonna be the same
Do they want the fame, and all that it can bring
If they attracted to Nelly then who like Cornell Haynes
I'm poppin collars from California to D.C
