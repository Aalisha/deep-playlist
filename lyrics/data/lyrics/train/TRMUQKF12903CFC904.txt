Bring me a whiskey.
Get me a beer.
What's that song
I like to hear?

The dreaming child.
The father proud and strong.
I kinda like that song.
The one about the Earlie King.

Daddy, I can see him.
His coat's so shiny bright.
Behind us in the night,
I can see the Earlie King.

Daddy, I can hear them.
They're singing just for me.
Can't you hear? Can't you see
the daughters of the Earlie King?

Spill the milk! Spill the meat!
Life is bitter and death is sweet!
