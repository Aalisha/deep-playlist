In the stick count for the song
Of knowing you're gone
Glancing up at where you lived
When you lived here

I see you suddenly alive
And nearly smiling
Stop and hold my breath
And watch the way we used to be

The full moon makes our faces shine
Like over-ironed polyester
Then disappears behind the clouds
Leaves me under empty rows of night windows

We could walk to where these streets
Get pulled together
...
