Well, well, hello again, tell me where you've been
It's been a while oh honey, my old friend
You've been there for me, faithful as you can be
You're the one I count on in the end

One night you're making memories then that's all you are

Well, hello again, tell me where you've been
It's been a while oh honey, my old friend
