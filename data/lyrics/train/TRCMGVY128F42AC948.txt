Those are all very beautiful words but actions speak louder
In case you haven't heard, I'm all alone
While you're out on the town drinkin' with your friends

You can say all these beautiful things but they don't mean nothing
No, they don't mean a thing gotta back it up
But you keep backing down tell me how this ends

If you think it's possible then anything is possible
But I think you're impossible
I hope you prove me wrong

You only call me after you've had a few
You only wanna hang out when you've got nothing to do
Don't tell me you love me and act like you don't
Oh, if you really want me you just gotta let me know

Same old thing happens every night
You get me going and then you say goodbye, I'm heated up
