It's all because of you I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue
But you've disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears
I'm wishin' you were here with me
