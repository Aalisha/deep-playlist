I can't remember a time when I was innocent
There is no word that hurts me
No one could stop what was coming down
Nothing has changed inside of me
If I could end sorrow I'd be there laughing with you
If I could stop laughing we'd cry and cry forever
You can't save me from the riddle
that creates my own frustration
I am starring
A cold impression trailing off to nowhere
There is no look they gave me
A painted smile turned upside down, inside out
