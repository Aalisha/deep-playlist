Oh, you ask me why you say
You want to be with me
But you're still in love with me
And I just want to breathe

The way you move and sway
I'm resigned to say it's true
Oh, you're the only one to blame
That our love has fallen through

Stop, I don't love you anymore
Oh, stop
Stop, I don't want you anymore
Oh, stop
