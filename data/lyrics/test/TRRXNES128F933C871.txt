o u t o f t h e f r a y

how long will we pretend
it's seen so long since we could defend
our action and intentions start to compete
they collide and lead us to deceit

the right way the wrong way
lead me out of the fray
extinguish this dimming light
they'll never notice once we're out of sight
is there a good time and a sad time?
is there any way to wash off this grime?
we try so hard to get away
but somethings about ourselves we just can not betray

but itâ€˜s getting harder and hard to keep track
...
