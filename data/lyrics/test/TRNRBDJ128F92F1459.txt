Went to a party just last night
Knew it was wrong, but it felt so right
She was standing there with her short skirt
Looked up at me and started to flirt
We began to talk, I had nothing to say
I still hoped that things would go my way
I knew I had not time to waste
Right then I wondered how she would tatse

Took off clothes, hopped into bed
Then I started to wish that I was dead
Tried my hardest to stop a fight
That bitch would not shut up all night
