"Where You Are (Is Where I Wanna Be) Part 2"

I'm saying I'm sorry for leaving you
But I wanted to start my life brand new
I was going through changes and could not see
That with you is where I wanna be

Nothing compares to you
And I hurt from the pain that I put you through
Baby, I need you desperately
Cuz I gotta be

Where you are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Every second of a day I wanna be
Where u are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
Dont you ever take your love away I wanna be
Where u are
Anywhere you are, it don't matter how far
I cant live without you girl I wanna be
Where u are
