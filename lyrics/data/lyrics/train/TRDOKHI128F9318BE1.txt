Black is the night, metal we fight
Power amps set to explode.
Energy screams, magic and dreams
Satan records the first note.
We chime the bell, chaos and hell
Metal for maniacs pure.
Fast melting steel, fortune on wheels
Brain haemorrhage is the cure.
For black metal!
lay down your souls to the gods rock 'n roll

Freaking so wild, nobodys mild
Giving it all that you got.
Wild is so right, metal tonight
