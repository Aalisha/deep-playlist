Yea, that’s love that it is
Umm, that’s love that it is
When you come rushing into my heart
When you com running out of the fire
It must be love that it is
Yea, that’s love that it is

I think I’m the only one that’s got an idea
And I come running full of desire
And that’s love that it is
And you call me, and that’s love, and that’s love that it is
And call me
And that
And that
And that
That, that, that, that’s love that is

And then you fall into my arms and I fell for all your charms
And I’m sure I’m the only one that cares
