I know my life is a cynical, logical place
I know the meaning sys hold out to stay in this race
Waiting for someone or something to show me the way
Save me from drowning in something I cannot explain

I know this feeling will likely persist for a while
I know this fever will go down the day that I die
Move in slow motion my hands felt just like two balloons
Waiting for someone or something to take me away

Fear inside - break the spell tonight
