What made you think I would be fooled
I now see through you
And you 're the fool
Tell me
How do you feel when you see me
And I disregard you
There's someone new
And they're true


I can't believe I was so blind I didn't see
That you couldn't be the type of man to meet my needs
Strangest thing is everyone tried to tell me
But I did what they told me not to
You nearly had my everything, by running game on me
You told me all I had to hear I thought love was finally here
But then one day the truth I'd see your game was incomplete
Cos when I realised the truth
I see your plan, you're not my man so get from under my roof - I don't want you


What made you think I would be fooled
I now see through you - yes I do
And you 're the fool
Tell me
