yeah! yeah yeah

(verse 1)
ohh i think i have found the girl for me
and she is the only one i need
we fit together like a hand in a glove
and there are never enough moment when we make love
can i give you all my lovin cause your the only one in my life
when you and me get such a feeling in my heart that i cannot hide cant you see

(chorus)
i really love my girl
(i really love you girl)
