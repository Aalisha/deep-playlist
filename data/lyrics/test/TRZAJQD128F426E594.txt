I Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound
Chad Mitchell Trio


It's a long and a dusty road.
It's a hard and a heavy load
and the folks we meet ain't always kind.

Some are bad and some are good.
Some have done the best they could.
Some have tried to ease our troubling mind.

Chorus:
And I can't help but wonder where I'm bound, where I'm bound.
Can't help but wonder where I'm bound.
