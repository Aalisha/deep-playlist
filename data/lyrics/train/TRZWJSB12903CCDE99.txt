We came in from Old Tehran
Landed on Ellis Island
And we were greeted by this
Worn and weary
One man band

And his bassoon
Was out of tune
And his bass drum thumped out of tune
We thought their kindness was o' so grand
To greet us with this port authority band

I came here on holiday (It's a Port Authority)
Then they sent us on our way (Meet the Port Authority)
They pushed us off Ellis Island (it's in(?) their authority)
Blaming all our problems
Blame it on the Port Authority Band
