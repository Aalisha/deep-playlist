You look nice alright
And I like the way you nod after everything I say
Like it actually means something
To you

And I like your record collection
Townes and Jens with a hint of Rickie Lee
And you've cleaned up the bathroom, made a really nice soup
But a bit too much sci-fi in your shelf with DVD's

There are things you need to know about me
I'm weak right now, so weak right now
I need proof before I dare to open this heart
