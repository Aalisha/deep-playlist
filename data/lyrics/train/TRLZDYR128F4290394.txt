Let's begin again
And take me back to then
I want to see the end
Of what has gone before

And I'll be grateful for
The things I had before
I couldn't miss you more
Than I do now

Don't try to shut me out
When all I want is what you have
And in time you know that all of this will pass

I'm not the one that let you down
I'm not the one who'll get you out
I'm just answering the questions that you asked
