I... I can't let you get away
Tonight I'll believe every word that you say
I'm trusting the roll of the dice
The chance to win everything takes a sacrifice

And I want you now
I want you so bad
Tell me what to do

I'll try anything
I'll be anyone
Take on any track
Just to have your love
If you're Mister Right
I'm your claim to fame
If you're Tarzan I'm Jane
