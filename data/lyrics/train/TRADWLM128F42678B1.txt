Baby, baby, baby, don't leave me
Please, don't leave me all by myself
I've got this burnin', yearnin' feeling inside me
Deep inside me and it hurts so bad

You came into my heart (baby, baby)
So tenderly (Where did our love go?)
With a burnin' love (baby, baby)
That stings like a bee (baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby)

And now that i surrender (baby, baby)
So helplessly (Where did our love go?)
You now wanna leave (baby, baby)
You wanna leave me behind (baby, baby, ooh, baby, baby)

Baby, baby, where did our love go?
