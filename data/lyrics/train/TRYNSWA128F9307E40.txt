Are you having trouble finding sleep at night?
Or does your lack of conscience tell you
Everything's all right?

I trust your good intentions
That you're watching over friends
You must think that I'm crazy
If I don't see through that grin

So tell me what your best friend knows
That I don't know
Tell me why you talk me down
Wherever you go

You're a saint, you're a queen
And I'm just another boy without a crown
Tell me why you sell me out everywhere you go
I just wanna know what your best friend knows

So vindictive, you'll say anything you like
The smile you fake, the steps you take
You know you never could get it right
