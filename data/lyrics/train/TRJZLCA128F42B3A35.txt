To the best of my knowledge
I guess that I'm blessed and I'm holy (yo, hold up, hold up)
Yo Joe Beats, what's the purpose of you stoppin' me?
(I don't know man I want you to kick the raps
You were kickin' a long time ago, not this emo shit)
Aight, aight
I was getting props when I first started to flow
Makin' this music wrecking shop like a retarded vocational student
Didn't know it at the time, that the shit made me look stupid
Rockin' pro-black rhymes, *oh but the* the devil made me do it
I never gave two shits bout rockin new kicks
I ain't the type to wear something just cause the shoe fits
I make moves quick, till you head feet first
I dig women who got more to get offa their chests than wet T-shirts
Rent the east herb, permit the west side
I'd rather eat dirt than ingest pride, my sixth sense shines
Less wack than Mos Def's pitiful incense vibe
You couldn't ghostwrite if your invisible ink pen died!
Now kick fresh rhymes, and think next time
