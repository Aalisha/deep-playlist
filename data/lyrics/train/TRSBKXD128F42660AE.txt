I've had days
Of wine and women and wine
Spending all my precious time
I wish I could press rewind
But it's just play
Feels like fast-forward some days
Maybe it's just a phase
Maybe I'm losing my mind

Oh, pretty hair
Listen what I'm thinking

I wanna get lost with you
I wanna forget where I came from
I wanna get lost with you
Will you help me along
Floating on an island with you
I wanna get lost
