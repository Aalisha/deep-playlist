I'll never hurt you, oh
And you will never shed a tear for me
I know you're tired of
Being in and out of love with nothing to show
And nowhere to go, but

Back to the same one only with a different face
But now you are in a different place
And if my words don't comfort you
Time will surely prove
That I'll do just what I say

I'll only be good to you
(Only be good to you)
Be like I should to you
(Be like I should to you)
Be everything to you bring you nothing but the good stuff
 (Everything)
I'll give you good love
(Baby)

I'll only be good to you
(I'll only be good to you)
Be like I should to you
(Be like I should, be like I should)
Be everything to you, said I'll be good to you
Only be good to you
 (Good to you, oh)

You say it's too good to be, too good
And I agree that the way it seems
Except for my instinct telling me it's something else
It's not a rebound or playground
