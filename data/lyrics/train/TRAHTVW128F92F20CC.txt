light up the wheels and go for broke
stomp that pedal with a sniftin stroke
smack that roadblock caught in a pickle
i'm gonna hit that line like old dick trickle

well my motor's fine and this train's on time
and when i cross that line i'm gonna make you mine

i'm stroker ace-stroker ace-stroker ace
...
