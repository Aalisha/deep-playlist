She's breaking up, she's falling down
She's holding her fists up now
Her eyes meet my face but we don't look the same

She walks away on bloody knees
Her swollen face hides her tears
My mind strains for words but my tongue won't obey

You're just a shadow now, of the girl I used to know
Your broken song is maimed and slow
You strain your face to bear that smile
Your teeth clenched tightly all the while

And though you search so thoroughly
For some place to put the blame
It only rests on angry shoulders
...
