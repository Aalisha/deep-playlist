You do that Romeo
Be what you wanna be
Looks like you're running in place
Do that stupid dance for me

Do that Romeo
That go-go Romeo
I see you twist and turn
You look so stupid, happy and numb

Be my Romeo
Please be my voice in this world
I can't sing the songs that you sing
I can't find the gorgeous words

Will you be my Romeo?
My go-go Romeo?
I see you twist and turn
You look so stupid

I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys
We do what we want
Yes, we do what we want

I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys
We do what we want
Yes, we do what we want
