Now for all the times you must go
Notice all the things you leave
So what's behind that stare
Am I there with you

And as you turn to walk away
I can't help it
I can't help but feel those instincts
That want to dance with me

(Chorus:)
Silhouette is painted on the wall
How many times can I say that I miss you
...
