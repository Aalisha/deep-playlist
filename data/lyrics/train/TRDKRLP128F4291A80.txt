Here comes that shit again
I've got a halloweenhead
Head full of tricks and treats
It leads me thru the nighttime streets
Black cats and falling trees
Under ladders always walking
Salt shaker spills just throw it over your shoulder, babe
I've got a bad idea again, I've got a
Halloweenhead, halloweenhead

Head full of candy bags
Costume shops and punks in drag
Head full of tricks and treats
