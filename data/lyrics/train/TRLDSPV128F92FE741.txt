Ready, set, go man go
I got a gal that I love so

I'm ready, ready ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready ready Teddy
I'm ready ready Teady to rock 'n' roll

All the flat top cats and all the dungaree doll
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumpin', the cats are goin' wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy styles
