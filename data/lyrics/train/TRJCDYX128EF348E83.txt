(feat. Shabazz the Disciple)

[Intro: Killah Priest]
Destination:Â ?
Trapped in the dandie's lion with a pit of lions
World crying, inside, what the fuck's goin on with me?
What's goin on? What's goin on?
Ugh! What's goin on? What's goin on?
Yo, yo.

[Killah Priest]
Deep in the Water of life, I would fight
Wearing turbens, purified up in the virgin
Emerging the blood, would flood up the wombs
The eggs hatch, and let loose, a fume
Prophecized just like Jesus, writing Hebrew
On the wall's of my mother's fetus
Then I was swimming in the afterbirth
Each chapter, each verse, got deeper, got worse
The keeper, of laws, my brain, what saw
The seeker, of tablets, preachers, would ban it
The force, brought forth, the holiest, controlliest
Slowly, takin me, into, the mental, orgasm
Was 'jaculating, stimulating, relating to life
Incubating, rotating around light beams
Like creams, I was formed in the white dream
Redeemed, like powder, outta, my maker
Enter, nature, returned, the vapor
Killah Priest, born in the pillar of yeast
Lost in the miscarriage, the automatic of marriage
Pow! Once ya live, ya die
Ohh. what is it? Is it a mystery?
Did they mention me in history?

[screams & deep inhaling]
