You can take me up, you can wind me down
There's no escape, but I'll never drown
No wires or strings, no rough and smooth
Just fire and stings, watch me closely, watch my every move

I can count your money while I check your hand
And you know I just can't lose

Wine from the water, gold from a tree
I wouldn't fool you, there's nothing up my sleeve
Look for a mirror, there's nothing there
I get rings out of nowhere, money from thin air

I can break these chains, while i'm upside down
Well it may seem strange, I don't hit the ground
Now you see my hand, is quicker than your eye
