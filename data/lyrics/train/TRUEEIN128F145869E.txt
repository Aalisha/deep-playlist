Wonderful In Young Life
Two weeks in another town
Sending shivers along in the spine
Of your friends when they call
Here she comes
The wild wind blows
In rhythms of season
In young life and reasons
Deceiving and pleasing to some
Wild girls wild
In epic beauty wild
Surviving these changes
In paces and faces
In free wonder
Free wonder
Free wonder style

Wonderful
Little Egypt eyes
Wonderful
And the world can't wait
Wonderful
And the beat's white hot
Wonderful

Dream dream dream
It's the eighties youthful theme
...
