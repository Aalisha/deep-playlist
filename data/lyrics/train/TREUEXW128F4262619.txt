I like the sound of funky music
Let me hear you sing it (I like the sound of funky music)
I like it
'Cause funky music sho nuff turns me on
I like the sound of funky music
Bless my soul, I can't control
The feeling I get when I hear the funky music
People, it does something to my brain
What it is I can't explain
Keep it right there
I don't want to lose it
Come on, come on, come on people now
