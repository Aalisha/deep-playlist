It Goes one, two
now this gumshoe's coming for you
three, four
with more than the lord to speak for
five, six
i'm gonna walk this beat until I drop my drumsticks
I've spun 78's, 45's, and 33's since '99

(there's nine) ten foot poles
a needle wants to touch me touch me
my feet get cold, so i speak soft
until they cut me free
get out of this world of one window flaps and spins out of control
gold and silver,
it don't warm my soul, so cold i shiver
so i try to aim my bow and quiver
pull the arrow back but it wont deliver
and it's frozen like this hopeless liver slash romantic
will you hold this picture
and shake it out of habit
i ain't an addict i just gotta have it
so gimme gimme gumdrops
and one shot of whatever you got inside this gunshot
and give up control to the confused

(it goes) one, two
now this gumshoe's coming for you
three, four
