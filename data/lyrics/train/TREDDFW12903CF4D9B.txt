Is your heart so heavy
That it weighs you down
So all you have is time
Don't turn away
We have both seen darker days
And there's always a light that shines

[Do you feel like] all your hopes are a long way gone
[Does it seem like] every road only takes you down
[Do they shut you out]
Don't be afraid of what they say
Throw back your head and cry
