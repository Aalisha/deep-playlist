(Dokken, White)


What's wrong with you may be right for me
Don't need to feel your sympathy, no
In the dark
I feel at home
I need the night to make my feelings known

Alright like lone wolf, can't you see
Living in false realities
Do you know just how I feel, can't explain it,
but its real

Lost in a world full of fear, it gives me passion
I'm just a lone wolf who's waiting
Wating for life's attraction to give me

1ST CHORUS:
