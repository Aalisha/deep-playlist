Well-a well-a you changed your name
To Abigail Rocket Blast
And then they lined you up
For a Hollywood movie cast.
With all them big cigars and motor cars
You thought you was a movie star
But Abigail Blast you sure are changing fast.

When you-a you-a you were just sixteen when you knocking
At the agent's door
Because
Because
Because the silver screen
Is what a movie queen lives for.
They gave you minks and dreams
In pinks and greens
You threw away your old blue jeans
But Abigail Blast they're using you.

Come on
Come on
Come on
Now Rocket
I'm gonna launch you soon
Come on now Rocket
You're gonna reach the moon
You're gonna take off soon
You gonna reach the moon
You know your time will come

I'll give you three
