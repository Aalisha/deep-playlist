Scars of tomorrow can never heal
Wounds still fresh from riot shields
Sound the alarm and arm yourself
Were fighting a war based on wealth
Women and children must die first
Endless cycle murder and rebirth

It s a class war
Worse than before
Blood in the streets
We ll never retreat
Who really wins?
It ll never end
...
