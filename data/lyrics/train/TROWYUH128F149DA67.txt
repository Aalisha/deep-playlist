Another same old, same old Friday night
What a surprise dinner and a movie
Gotta believe there's more to life
I'm looking for a man, looking for a man
Looking for a man to move me

I want to go swimming in an icy creek
Make sand angels on the beach
Shoot cans with a BB gun
Go hang gliding and bungee jump

Swing around on the monkey bars
