Yeah, you like it like that (I can see it with ya)
Like it like that (Darkchild, what, what)
Uh-huh, yeah (I can see it with ya)
I thought you like it like that (Darkchild, what, what, what)
Uh, what, what-what (I can see it with ya)
Uh, like it like that (Darkchild, what, what)
Oh (c'mon, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Like it like that
What's up

Hmm, hmm, hmm, baby
I ain't have the free time
I been out there hustlin' tryna get mine
But when I come home
I can't even get my uh-uh on
Askin' me where my pager's at
Cause when you paged I ain't call right back
I didn't have my cell phone
So tell me, what's going on, baby, yeah?

If you're serious bout our love
Don't worry bout a thing (don't worry, babe)
They even playin' us (baby)
Just tryna get in (c'mon)
If you're serious bout our love
Did you know they hate on me (hate on me)
Talkin' bout what they heard
And what they seen

What's this about my car?
You said I picked up two girls from the bar
But you know it ain't true
Cause I was here makin' love to you
But baby, they come to you
They talk about me and what I do
