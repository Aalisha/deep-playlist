I've been waiting here for so long
Trying to find another place where I belong
Well, what you want to be, what you can never see
'Cause you're making mistakes, you really take
And there's nothing left for me

 (On and on, on and on again)
I've been waiting all along
 (On and on, on and on again)
 Trying to find a place that's home

 (On and on, on and on again)
I'll lay it out for you to see
 (On and on, on and on again)
Is this what you really need?

Why don't you make mistakes like I do?
Why don't you
(Why don't you)
