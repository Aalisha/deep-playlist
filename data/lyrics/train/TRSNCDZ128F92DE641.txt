I would pick and we would sing to the rhythm of that front porch swing
The moonlight holds the spotlight that we shared
I found new notes on that old guitar, she believed I could be a star
She told me that she wanted to be fair

We can't share a world with different dreams
So I chased mine and she found hers too, but someone else made hers come true
Now I'm a star, but every time I sing
