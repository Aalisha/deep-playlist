Stretch the bones over my skin
Stretch the skin over my head
I'm going to the holy land
Stretch the marks over my eyes
Burn the candles deep inside
Yeah you know where I'm coming from

Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you
