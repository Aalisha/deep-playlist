It's me versus you in love
We'll tag team, double up
Hit you in the sweet spot
And make you wish you'd buffed up
The gloves are off

We've been messing around
Breaking us a man down
But while you've got us on the ropes
We plan to play the mess around
He's technically trained
You've got him buckled up and he will misbehave
You weigh bigger and trained
But I've got the power and the glory in my burly brains
The gloves are off
