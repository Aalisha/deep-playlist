If you could open up your eyes
And see the color of my tears
They're not that gray, they're not that
Blue, they're beautiful

If you could just see what I see
You'd know the world is not that gray
And it's not that blue
You'd see the world is beautiful
If you would

Open your eyes, take my hand
Take a look at where you stand
...
