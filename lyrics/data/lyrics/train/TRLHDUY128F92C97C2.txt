If there's anything you need
All you have to do is say so
You know you satisfy everything in me
We shouldn't waste a single day
So don't stop me falling
It's destiny calling

A power I just can't deny
It's never changing
Can't you hear me, I'm saying
I want you for the rest of my life
Together forever and never to part
Together forever we two
And don't you know
...
