Ministers of religion have visited me many times to talk about it
They say to me, I gotta leave it I gotta leave it
It's a bad habit for a man but when I try to leave it
My friends keep telling me, I'm a fool amongst fools

Now I'm a slave, a slave
I'm a slave, I'm a liquor slave
I'm a slave, a slave, slave
I'm a slave, just a liquor slave

I have lost my dignity I had before, trying to please everybody
Some say to me, yo yo, I look better when I'm drunk
Some say, no, no, no, I look bad you know
