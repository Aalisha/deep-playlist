Here we go fools
And it's on once again for young and old
Because you stole the farmboy's time
Cuz if you find me on the trippy hip hop
Like I said before you whore
We got the drop on you you're through
So don't try and copy
The style of those you chose to propose because you're sloppy
There's a noise at the front door
And just last week you sounded just like Faith No More

Suckers come and go
you won't fight it you won't know,
...
