Come on
(Come on, let me show you where it's at)
Come on
(Come on, let me show you where it's at)
Come on-on-on
(Come on, let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place is
(I like It Like That)

Come on
(Come on, let me show you where it's at)
Come on
(Come on, let me show you where it's at)
Come on-on-on
(Come on, let me show you where it's at)
The name of the place
(I like It Like That)

They got a little place
Across the track
The name of the place is
I Like It Like That
Now, you take Sally
An I'll take Sue
And we are gonna rock away
All our blues
...
