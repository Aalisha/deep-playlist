Look, I'm telling you as a friend
Because I think you're so nice
I really think a lot of you
Now you can let her wear your pin
You can let her your friend
But remember, whatever you do

Don't you let her
Be your baby (no, no, no)
Don't you let her
Be your baby (no, no, no)
Don't let her be your baby
(No, no, no, no, no, no)

Don't you know she's gonna
Kiss you (gonna kiss you)
Hold you tight (hold you tight)
She's saying she'll miss you
(She'll miss you) day and night
(Day and night, night and day)

She'll tell you that she loves you
