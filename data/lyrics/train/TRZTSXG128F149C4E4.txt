What have you seen?
What have you felt?
Your lips are closed, the curtain's shut
All that we can see is on your sleeve
All that we can see is on your sleeve

I know from time to time
That hope seems but a foreign land
A distance that we cannot reach
A language we cannot speak

Your life is hidden in your skin
Though not entirely so
Some things can't be kept
...
