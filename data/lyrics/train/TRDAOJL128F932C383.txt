Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff-filled land
Drop... out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff-filled land

Solo One
Proceeds the Weedian - Nazareth
Proceeds the Weedian - Nazareth

Creedsmen roll out across the dying dawn
Sacred Israel Holy Mountain Zion
Sun beams down on to the Sandsean reigns
Caravan migrates through deep sandscape
Lungsmen unearth the creed of Hasheeshian
Procession of the Weed-Priests to cross the sands
Desert Legion Smoke-Covenant is complete
Herb bails retied on to backs of beasts
Arise arise arise - The Son of the God of Israel
