Careful where you hide
secrets come alive
walk right by the evil things
slip into the night

I am the creature and I'll roam
I've lived athousand times before
No longer waiting at your door
I am the creature and I'll roam

All across the land
the spectre holds your hand
though her face you cannot see
her thoughts you'll understand
...
