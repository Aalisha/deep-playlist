The rain kept on falling
And darkened the sky
The dawn was to come with the sunrise
Revealing the shadows
That passed through the mist
The torchlight was flickering, the storm

Foretold to come since ages
In silence they walked on
Crossing the lands

On their way to Bethlehem
To break the chains of the spell
