Long time ago knew a sweet little lassy
Hair like fire and a walk kinda sassy
She had ruby lips and sleazy eyes
Jungle hips and Lucy Lucy thighs

Baby baby, take my hand
Baby baby, understand

Give a little love to your baby
Give a little love to your man

She had a reputation and a cruel smile
You can give her an inch and she'll take a mile
