There's a village hidden deep in the valley
Among the pine trees half forlorn
And there on a Sunny morning
Little Jimmy Brown was born

All the chapel bells were ringing
In the little valley town
And the songs that they were singing
Were for baby Jimmy Brown

Then the little congregation
Prayed for guidance from above
"Lead us not into temptation
Bless this hour of meditation
Guide him with eternal love"
