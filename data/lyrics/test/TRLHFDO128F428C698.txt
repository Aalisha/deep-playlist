Rings of roses, 
Tied round my neck, 
Heavier than water.

Burn the new flesh, 
Watch it turn red, 
Heavier than water.

I can't stand to see you out there knowing what you did.
I can't stand to hear you talking like I don't exist.
I can't stand to live without you, anything but this, 
Anything but this.

Take a deep breath, 
...
