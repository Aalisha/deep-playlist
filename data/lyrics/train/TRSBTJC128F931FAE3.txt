You're so leftist.
You're so for peace.
You hate the death penalty, but love it in the middle east.
Don't know the facts,
Just catch phrase words.
No different than the nazi boneheads, the other side got to you first.
Critical thinking?
No thanks, not at all.
Admit it. You just like posters of men with machine guns on your wall.
Make you feel good?
Make you feel right?
Simplified complexity, it's easy to cheer when it's black and white.

Impressed with your badass.
I am impressed with your defiance.
Now you do know the Palestinians are not the same thing as the Rebel Alliance?
