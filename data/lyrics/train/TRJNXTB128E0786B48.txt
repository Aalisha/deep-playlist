Baby come over here
And taste me
Won't you feel my lips
And take me deeper into your arms
Mesmerising
Way you got my Venus rising
Visualising your skin melting into mine

Open up, I'm coming in
Explore original sin
Open up, I'm coming in
Lie back

It's getting so hypnotic
I'm coming up on it
Your love's hypnotic
It's a beautiful way to fly
Surrender your mind
And lose yourself as we rise
Hypnotic
