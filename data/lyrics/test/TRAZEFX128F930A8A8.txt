We built this all for you
To hang your dreams upon
Our sanctuary a safe and warm refuge
You turn lives upside down
In the pursuit of a common ground
But you don't even try to keep up with the pace

Well we never hang out socially
You never even seem to want to talk to me
Where we are all danger and you are the dust
And both are even balanced on ribbons of trust

This is my final letter of complaint
My fatal resignation
I tried to enable perspective
While wishing for education
You pretend we are all so dear to you
But these are the last words I will give to you
While silently you plot your revenge
...
