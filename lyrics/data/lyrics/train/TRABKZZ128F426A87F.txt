You've realized your dream
Life's fairy tale
You've almost reached your end
No, you can't complain
You've got so many friends
You bet they stand by you
Course you've got some faith
...and hope
Constitute your backbone

Base life on solid ground
Trust in your future
By just a simple count

You thought you're footloose
And fancy free
Enjoy your freedom
...
