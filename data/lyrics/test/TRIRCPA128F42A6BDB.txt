[Cam'ron]
Uh huh, Killa, They never said we couldn't get down
It's like I'm psychic and shit
I called this shit about 5 years ago
Dipset all day everyday man
Santana, Jim Jones, Freeky be home 07, (uh), let's go

Remember, I'm a man of respect, remember,
Remember, Santana was next,
Now it's not teks, it's checks, and vans he collects,
I want his wrist, fist, whole hand, jammed with baguettes

Pose for the camera man, me and Santana man,
Word to my grandma, he one bad MamaJamma, damn,
So I don't write for the stardom,
I get, booted, zooted, write down my problems

I been through it headed right for the bottle,
DC, nah, would'a been a sniper in Harlem,
That's why I throw some dough, to my cody from Kostovo,
Help me get on Overflow, no one supposed to know,
