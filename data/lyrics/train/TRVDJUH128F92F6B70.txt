Chorus:
Tell me what you believe
Jesus or anarchy
Who are you gonna be?
Let's live for Godarchy

You call it truth - it's only smoke
Are you for real? is this a joke?
Marx and Lenin are your thing
Where will you be when Christ is King?

Tell me what you believe
Jesus or anarchy
Who are you gonna be?
Let's live for Godarchy
