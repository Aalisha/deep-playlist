Heaven's no place for me not even hell
You burned all the good things again
I walked the earth and crossed that line to find
A place to go a place to dwell

Where do I run, where will I hide
I'm warning with my fears
You see the blood drop from my eyes
But still you'll return and take back my tears

I would do anything just to hear you scream
Now you will make me fall but only in your dreams
...
