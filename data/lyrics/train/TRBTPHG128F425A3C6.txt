My daddy got here on the gravy train
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game
They went walking and she took his name
Round here

There was dancing in the afternoons those days
Waiting tables, chasing girls with the money he made
It was 1957, and love felt the same, love felt the same

Frightened little girl, she makes a break
Into the arms of' something better
Round here

I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark
Waiting patiently to make my mark
Round here

And I remember my first day at school
And I remember trouble, and thinking I was so cool
I remember it all, like yesterday
