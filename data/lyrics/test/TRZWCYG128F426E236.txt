If you want something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not your little boy

If you are serious
Don't play with my heart it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then baby I will, girl you know I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed, let your conscience be your guide
