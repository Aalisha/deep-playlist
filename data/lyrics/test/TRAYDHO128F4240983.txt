I was that kid sittin' over in the corner
Smiling with a shit-eating grin
And I was that kid smilin' In the back of class
'Cause I'm flyin' on mescaline
I was that kid drinkin' 40's on the bleachers
Getting drunk after school
Gettin' home too late, fallin' on my face
Way too drunk to skate
And actin' a fool

I was that kid never doing good at
Nothing except for maybe at P.E.
And I was that kid getting bullied by the
Filipinos rollin' with ABT
Me and my friends reading
The Satanic Bible, thinking we should start a band
Cutting class to jam, cutting class to jam
In my dad's garage we learned to

Act a fool - don't need to be cool
Pissed off too and breaking the rules
