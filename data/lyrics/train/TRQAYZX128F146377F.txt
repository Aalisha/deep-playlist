You are entering the White Room
Yeah, that's the password
And you can leave your hangups at the door now
Coz this is the White Room
My asylum
And you are welcome
(ooo, na na na, ooo ooo, na na na)

Look at all you pretty people
Walking past my eyes
The room is getting smaller
There's a bright light deep inside
My toes are curling upwards
And my shoes have left my feet
They took away my velvet chair
My name is obsolete, oh

Hell we can get dreamy, yeah
Delicious, we can be happy, yeah
So happy I've been thinking about you, yeah
(and if you wanna come)
And if you wanna come in
You've got to knock three times

You are entering the White Room
Yeah that's the password
And you can leave your hangups at the door now
Coz this is the White Room
My asylum
And you are welcome
(ooo, na na na, ooo ooo, na na na)
