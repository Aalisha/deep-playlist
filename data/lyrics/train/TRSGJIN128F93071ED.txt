We've got a good thing going
So we've got to protect it
They say people lose it
When they least expect it
Baby, I know it's true
But I don't worry 'bout us

And all the friends we thought
Were gonna make it forever
They all ran into trouble
And now they're not together
Baby, I know it's sad
But I don't worry 'bout us
...
