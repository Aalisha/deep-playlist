I can't see you mama
but I can hardly wait
ooh to touch and to feel you mama
oh I just can't keep away
in the heat and the steam of the city
oh its got me running and I just can't brake
so say you'll help me mama
cos its getting so hard

Now I can't keep you mama
but I know you're always there
you listen, you teach me mama
and I know inside you care
so get down, down here beside me
oh you ain't going nowhere
...
