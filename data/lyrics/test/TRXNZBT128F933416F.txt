West coastin, coastin, coastin
West coastin, coastin, coastin
Y'all chillin' wit the villian right now (x3)
West coastin, coastin, coastin

Nigga ren up back in this motherfucker
Ya niggaz in trouble, ya motherfuckaz
Ya make me laugh how you bit shit
Ren come around and make it yo' shit
You upon a dick you can help it
Yo shit sound too good shit I can smell it
Fo' yo' bitch ass make it turn around
You can see a true legend from the com' town
Not an artificial or fake villian
I'm the truth homie live and in flesh nigga
Still west coastin', puffin' kush
Still hittin' corners, still fuck Bush
I know we out of this, villian still mesh
I got the brand new swisher sittin' on the dash
This is for the west, nigga pumpin' loud
Motherfuckin' villian 'bout to turn yo bitches out
