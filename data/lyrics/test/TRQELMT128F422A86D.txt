Seeing a world cast in shadow
Seeing it all waste away
I am a flower fading
The last and none, none to come

I will live my life through the cleansing
I will bear witness to all
I'm gonna pray for us
For what's left behind, for our broken hearts


The end of days is drawing near
So the rain will fall like tears
But the dusk of life will be the dawn
...
