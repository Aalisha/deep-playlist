Do you want to do this again?
I knew when we started,
I wanted to be more than a sin.
Oh and I did see
The pitfalls in front of me
But I laughed and filled them in.

I want to see you again
I know it's silly,
But I cannot hold it in.
Oh and I can see,
The pit calls out to me,
But I close my ears and grin.

'Cause it's real.
Really, really real.
Yeah, the feeling.
It's really, really real.
Real!
It's really, really real.
