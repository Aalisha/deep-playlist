I bet you're surprised
To see me waiting up for you
There's something I just gotta say
Never in my life
Could I have ever imagined that
That love was ever gonna feel this way

And I never ever felt so special
Never knew something good be so true
And I'm so much better, pray for forever
Baby, I owe it all to you

I wanna thank you
For staying out late all the time
While you were out getting yours
Boy, I was getting mine

I wanna thank you
For the times you cheated on me
'Cause I almost loved you forever
Never would have found someone better

I wanna thank you, thank you
For losing me
I wanna thank you, thank you
For losing me

Don't look surprised
You really think I was so blind
I wouldn't notice the signs
And it was you
...
