(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool, fool again
Doesn't matter what I do
(I've been a fool) I've been a fool
Can't stop myself from drowning

Nothing standing in your way, feeling good
And girls want to check you out, looking good
'Cos shops want to let you in, 'cos you've been a fool
You just can't help it

Suddenly it seems worthwhile, life's a gas
And just when it all goes right, working out
And just when I hit that high, I am a fool
Just can't help it
...
