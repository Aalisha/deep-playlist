Hit me, hit me, hit me, hit me
Ah
it's getting sour by the hour
hit me
Tough nut, don't crack
shake my tree and I'll attack
no cut, skin deep
secrets that you try to keep
I say hey hey you
don't you break my shell
I say hey hey you
'cause I know you well
I say hey hey you
now I see the sign
I've got you finally beat
so baby walk those feet
...
