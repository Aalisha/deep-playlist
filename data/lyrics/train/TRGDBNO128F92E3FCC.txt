I'd like to live in a wigwam
Yes I'd like to live in a wigwam
I'd like to live in a wigwam and
Dance round the totem pole

I'd like to live in an igloo
Yes, I'd like to live in an igloo
I'd like to live in an igloo
And Fish from an icehole

I'd like to ride on a caravan
I'd like to take a ride on a caravan
Yes, I'd like to ride on a caravan
And sing with the gypsies

I'd like to live on a commune
Yes, I'd like to live on a commune
I'd like to live on a commune
And people can call me a hippie
...
