It's the time of the day when I lay down to rest
To impressions of the day digest
But thoughts of my existence emerge
Who am I and why am I?
My consciousness can't be purged
Until a soothing breeze is putting me to sleep
I fall through endless depths

My dreams awake, they're taking over
Take me on a journey within

[Lead: Schalin]

I see myself and I see my world
I meet people from my past
But can't remember where they're from
They stare at me with hollow eyes
Still disappointment therein lies

I see nations birth and death
One thousand human lives
