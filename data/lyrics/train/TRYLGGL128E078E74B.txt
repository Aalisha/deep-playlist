Theres something about you
Tears me inside out whenever you're around
There's something about you
Speeding through my veins until we hit the ground

And there's something about this rush
Take it away
It made me feel so good
I get a feeling, you get a feeling, we got a feeling
Like we could die

Mother
We just cant get enough
We just cant get enough
Lover
We just gotta get it up
We just gotta get it up

Theres something about you
That tears me inside out whenever you're around
And theres something about you
That makes me fly
You're a heart attack, just the kind I like!

And there's something about your kiss
