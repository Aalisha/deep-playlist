I feel your eyes stare into mine
Burning through just who I am
I wish I could make things right again

I know this road takes me from you
But I can't seem to slow this down
I see myself but you're all around

I cannot run from you
You've caught my every move
I just want you to know
I'm burning down this wall
Can I start new?
