I found a letter I wrote to you
In the bottom of the drawer
Simple words, simple point of view
That I don't have much anymore
It said "I don't want fortune
I don't want fame
I only want the treasure
That time can't take away"

CHORUS
Look me in the eye
Tell me if you see
Traces of yourself
Growing here in me
...
