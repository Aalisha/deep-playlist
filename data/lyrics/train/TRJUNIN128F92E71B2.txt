Is it really the treasure of gold
Or the dance in the rainbow itself
Bound to a track
Painting over the cracks
In his dreams they'd put up on the shelf

Little wind-up soldier
With a ball and a chain
Got destinations engraved on your mind
Now you don't care as long
As you don't make it there
You wanna fly but not arrive

Calling you, calling you
You are the one to hear them
Calling you, calling you
Calling you, calling you
And you daddy won't approve

And when no one's awake anymore
He paints a picture of a strange looking fly
From a distant world
You light and lo and behold
It's coming alive

Calling you, calling you
You always hear them speak
