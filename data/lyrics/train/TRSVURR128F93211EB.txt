My shades on in the club
And I'm hollering "What it do?"
I'm all of the above!
High and some Gin and Juice
Nigga I will spit at you and you and you
I am drunk
I am on that you don't wanna do it fluid
What?
I got a bank roll size of a phone book!
And it got me walking around slow foot
Supply & Demand
I am the man
You want it? We got it!
Pocket full of rubberbands!

I think the odds are-
High in favor vote for our side, outside
Galo on shoes
They not our size!
Ride high!
Keep big shoes up on my ride
Stay fly!
Keep it tuned up on my side
I rock the best
So they shop, is my shop!
Cause my rock's the best
When they stop, we don't
Cause my Glock's compressed
So may I suggest?
Invest in some Tec's and some K's and some Vest's
