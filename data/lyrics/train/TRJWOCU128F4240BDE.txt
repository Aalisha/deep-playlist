Won't you forget about me when I'm gone?
Reproduction of death drags us all along
Close your eyes, pretend that nothing's wrong
Won't you forget about me? Damn
Won't you forget about me when I'm gone?

Stomp your feet, nod your head and we all move on
Close your eyes, pretend damn
Hey won't you sell me cheap bubble-gum?
I'm going out of my head

Hey won't you sell me cheap bubble-gum?
I'm going out
Hey won't you sell me cheap bubble-gum?
Going out of my head
Hey won't you sell?
