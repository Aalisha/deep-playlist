Oh god
I already forgot your name
But a name's just a string of letters
Put together - so clever

Oh god
I thought that I've forgotten your name
It's upsetting
But the setting won't change
We're never gonna be the same

If you look, everybody here's trying on new faces
And the ones that fit are surprisingly contagious
With a shiny new beginning
We cordially invite you so into the dressing room
...
