If you're ready for the street
You wanna mix it in some fight
Let me tell you somethin'
Now I don't wanna get you uptight
But if you're in a corner
And you can't find no way out
Don't look around for no help
No, no there won't be any around

Expect no mercy, expect no mercy
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy

So you think you got a case
And you think you know the score
No you don't wanna listen
...
