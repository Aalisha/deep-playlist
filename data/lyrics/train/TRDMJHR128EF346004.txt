(Junior's) I've been praying for you
'Cause I'm lonely and so blue
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away my fears

That you never, ever, gonna return
(Ain't gonna return)
To ease the fire that within me burns
(Hey, hey, hey, burns)
Keep me cryin', baby for you
(Burning and crying and crying)
Keep me sighin', baby for you
(Sighing, sighing and crying)
(So) Why don't ya hurry
Come on, girl
See about me (Junior)

(See if you see about, Junior)
Yeah, yeah
(See about, see about Junior)
See about me
See if you see about, Junior)
See about me, yea!
