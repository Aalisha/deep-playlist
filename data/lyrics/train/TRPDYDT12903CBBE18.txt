Since the beginning there’s been a division not at all desired
Always standing in the way, so hard to push to the side
Hidden from the world of others, dwelling in the heart
Sad emotions that pervaded both the good and the bad times

DON’T LET IT WIN
Don’t let it break the love of kin
DON’T LET IT WIN
