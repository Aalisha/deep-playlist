I don't believe in unity
It's just one more abandoned dream
Once the people get together it's easy to see
It's just a matter of time before they come after me

But it must be pretty cool to be you with your brothers at your back protecting you
It must be pretty cool to know you belong
Isolated my whole life, counting scars in the land of smiling knives
Yes, I'm envious it's true, but it must be cool to be you

You got a loving family
To give you everything you need
My family loves each other so much
We live a thousand miles away and never stay in touch
