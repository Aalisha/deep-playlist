She came out west
To find the sun
She lost her name
But found a new one
Amy goes to school all day
But at night in the neighborhood
They call her Amphetamine

She is perfect in that fucked up way
That all the magazines
Seem to want to glorify these days

She looks like a teenage anthem
She looks like she used to be happy with
The girl inside

She looks so bored sometimes
She has that super pale skin
And those soft green eyes
She looks like she could have been happy
In a better life

She came out west
Just to break away clean
From her family and friends
...
