Girl you really got me going
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Yeah you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doing
Oh yeah you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You really got me
You really got me
You really got me

Please don't ever set me free
I always want to be by your side
