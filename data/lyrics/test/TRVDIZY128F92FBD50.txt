You'll find me hangin' around
It's there I'll be found
Down on the corner of love
Beneath the stars that shine
And the neon signs
I'll be down on the corner of love

When night starts to fall
And love starts to call
Down on the corner of love
You'll find me hangin' around
It's there I'll be found
Down on the corner of love

When it's late in the eve'nins
And I can't help but feelin'
That my heart you're a steelin'
...
