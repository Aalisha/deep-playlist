Do you remember anyone here?
No you don't remember anything at all
I'm sleeping, I'm flat on my back
Never woke up, had no regrets
There's a party in my mind
And it never stops
There's a party up there all the time
They'll party till they drop
Other people can go home
Everyone else will split
I'll be here all the time
