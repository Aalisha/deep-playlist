This paradise
This hell which you all call home
Filled with plastic beauty
Where death is glory - The hookers den
These bloodred streets
Where the cloud casts a shadow
And that definite darkness
Roll of the rich man

He's a collector of ghosts

Devil man - schizophrenic hot loving man
He bears the burden of satan's toy
Cause heaven knows no pain
