I bare my soul, stripped on a silver platter - my back to the wall, blindfolded, tied up, battered
Yearning for someone, someone to end this misery but will that someone, anyone, ever come and rescue me?
Somebody save me I'm close to the edge - someone to fill me with life give me dreams I never had
Somebody save me and answer my pleas - someone to lift me back up and to put my heart at ease
Somebody help me please
