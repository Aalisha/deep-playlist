This is rock n' roll shouts out
Back to the rappers
A lot of people stake claims
Saying hip hop doesn't matter
But really what could be phatter than
Jungle j.b's beats and streetside sounds
Profound are the sounds
That I was hearing
When at the basketball league
This kid said "yo come here and
Put these head phones on your ears"
I was converted then
And practiced it for years
Rap music, like jazz, funk and r&b
Blues reggae rock n' roll, and rock steady g.
Will be around forever
And it's never going out
That's why I took this time to spell these lyrics out
