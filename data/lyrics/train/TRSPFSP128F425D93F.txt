First your mama and your papa
Sent you to the finest school
Never let it be said
That their little darlin' was a fool

So, with a credit card in your good name
You were drawn like a moth to the flame
To the people of the night
Where you more or less lost your cool

You had 20/20 vision
And still you were walkin' 'round blind
Yes and whether right or wrong
I'd still tag along behind

But you're flyin' too high for me
And if this is how it's got to be
Then it's time to say
You go your way and I'll go mine
...
