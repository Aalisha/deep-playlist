Everybody come on down, the man with the guitar just hit town
Sets off like a rocket, there he goes
Rockin' from his head down to his toes
My boy Elvis, real rock - My boy Elvis, real rock
Wish bam-a-ling, ooh Elvis sing to me
Heartbreak hotel, blue suede shoes
He walks away with all my blues
Take my troubles, take my pain
Load 'em on that Mystery train
My boy Elvis, real rock - My boy Elvis, real rock
...
