Whenever I feel I cannot go on
At a point when all my spirit is gone
I know what gets my head up high again

When I see the world with troubled eyes
After another conflict fed by lies
My conviction helps me through the day

Hope, is what keeps me going
Faith, is what pulls me through
Hope, faith, friendship
