"Maybe, just maybe
Naughty girls need love too."

I've been told time and time again
That you can't treat love like a game
But I play rough with hearts that never mend
'Cause some guys like you do the same
Love was just a four letter word
Never heard how absurd it could be
But now I can't believe this is real
How I feel now you steal
My heart away from me

Used to be so good and so bad
Sex was something I just had
