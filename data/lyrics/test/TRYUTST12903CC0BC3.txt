See that black boy over there, runnin' scared
his ol' man's in a bottle.
He done quit his 9 to 5 he drink full time
so now he's livin' in the bottle.
See that black boy over there, runnin' scared
his ol' man got a problem and it's a bad one
Pawned off damn near everything, his ol'
woman's weddin' ring for a bottle.
And don't you think it's a crime
when time after time, people in the bottle.

See that sista, sho wuz fine before she
