Georgia-Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind
Well, well, well, well Georgia-Georgia
A song of you yeah-eah
it comes as sweet and clear as moon light through the pines
Other arms reach out to me yeah
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in yeah, eah, but peaceful dreams I see
The road leads well, well, well, well
