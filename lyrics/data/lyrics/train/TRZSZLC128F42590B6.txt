There I was lookin' for somethin' new
Man comes into my view
Tells me, "Hey kid yo wanna make ten bucks?"
Bud gave me dirty looks
"Hey man, tells me what I got to do"

Man tore the money right in half
Says then to kill the fatted calf
A rich fat lady with diamonds and rocks
I'm thinkin', "Man this sucks, need a cement mixer
I ain't writin' no epitaph"

Make-up to her chin
But don't ask me where the Hell she's been
Broken bones in the gutter
But did I murder your mother?
Sorry 'bout dem bones in the muddy gutter, yeah
