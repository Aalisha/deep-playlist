Hey Ladies.
Yeah.
WOO.

He runs screaming.
He's been dreaming but he thinks he's awake.
He started trying.
Since the lyings about all he can take.
He grabs her hand.
The girl's hand that we just met at the bar.
He whispers gently in her ear as they drive off in a car.

He signs,
Let's go home,
I want to get a little closer.

She said we'd shine together,
We're fine together,
No end forever she said.
Let's spend some time together,
We're fine together,
No end forever instead.

He sings a song for her,
A song for her,
He hopes she will know.
