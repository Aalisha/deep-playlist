Hard beats like this keep my mentality raw
I G off C for lyrics to blow off them Lex door
My tex-ture be the kind that explore
MC's then blow 'em out, metaphor after metaphor

I'm more wetter than your boy bigger
So how you figure you can fuck with this rap unemploy nigga
I should own a fly bitch house and a Benz
But I got chicken heads criminals and broke friends

That love to get in, keep the seventeen spinnin'
Pull out from my jaw linin', commence to split end
Brains and body parts that motion couldn't picture
'Cause when I'm shittin' niggaz hit mo decks than a skipper

Mr. and Mrs. Howe, Mary, Anne and Ginger
Gilligan, you need the Professor to take the rigger
Waters out I got orders to kill 'em softly
I wouldn't leave a trace if I died and police chalked me

Who's the boss, G you better radio the walkie talkie
For the Fatal Attract MC's that stalk me
Got a big dick and your bitch click
When I flip this I got more work than a Olympic gymnast

Bust it, I cut the mustard, on any track
Milkier than Similak when I'm next up to bat
Redman is on the mic and I'ma
Dope motherfucker, yeah, you best ax somebody, Snoop

Yesh yesh ya'll, and you don't stop
Yesh yesh ya'll, and you don't stop
Yesh yesh ya'll, and you don't stop
Yesh yesh ya'll, and you don't stop

Yesh yesh ya'll, and you don't stop
...
