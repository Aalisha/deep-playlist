If you could step into my head
Tell me, would you still know me?
And if you woke up in my bed
Tell me, would you hold me?

Or would you simply let it lie?
Leaving me to wonder why
I can't get you out of this head
I call mine and I will say

Ohh, I can't let you go my little girl
Because you're holding up my world, so I need you
Your imitation of my walk and the perfect way you talk
It's just a couple of the million things that I love about you

So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
...
