It's so hard to feel right baby
When I'm travelin' around and you're far behind
Guy, I wish I could see my lady
Girl, I hope you don't mind...'cause

Chorus:
I'm snow blind
I can't see a thing
I'm snow blind
I don't wanna sing
I'm snow blind
Need a familiar face
I'm snow blind
Think I'm lost in space
