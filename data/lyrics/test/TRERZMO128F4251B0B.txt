Mighty and superior we are the rulers you're the ruled
We say the grass is greener on the other side, but you can't see that of course
We represent the nation; it's our people we put first
We even bail out third world countries
It's our investment they deserve it
Simply forcing back the Russians with peace missiles built for trust
Screwing with the Yankees - law and order is our must

Sick and fucking tired of their collaborations
Forwarding the clock to our extermination
We've got a one way ticket for a seat to destruction
It's their choice our must to rise with the mushroom
Hail to the mushroom - the total combustion
The realisation of annihilation
