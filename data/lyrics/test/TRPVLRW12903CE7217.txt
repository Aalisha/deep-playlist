I hear the wind blow, it's callin' to me
Singin' true love's lonesome song
'Cuz old smyrna road's where my dreams long to be
Lord knows that's where I belong

All of my tears just keep fallin' like rain'
'Cuz that woman is all that I see
And old smyrna road will just keep callin' my name
'Til there's nothin' that's left of poor me

Yes, my girl's got a heart full of gold
Lord, and she's all that I know
But my sweet little baby's been taken away
Lord, down that old smyrna road

My heart is pinin'
...
