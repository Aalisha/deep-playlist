You keep telling me yes
But you don't mean it
You keep telling me no
And try to lean it

You're giving me buts and maybe
You know this will drive me crazy
Why can't you tell it like it is?

And let your yeah be yeah
And your no be no, now
Let your yeah be yeah
And your no be no, now

Because I'm on my guard and
I'm watching you from head to toe
So that let your yeah be yeah
...
