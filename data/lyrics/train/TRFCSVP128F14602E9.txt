Never gonna miss it
The love I never had.
Never gonna miss it
The love I never had.
Never gonna miss it...

You've been coming home a little later
And you never feel like saying where you've been.
You know I tried to make some conversation
But I guess the things I say are wearin' thin.
You never needed me, I only see it now
But I can live alone, girl you taught me how.
And I wish that I could say I'm gonna feel so sad
...
