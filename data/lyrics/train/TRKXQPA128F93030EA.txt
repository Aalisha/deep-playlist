They be tryin' ta bring you flowers (Flowers, flowers)
But you prefer your roses blue
Brothers were tryin' to get in your trousers
I was just tryin' to get into you
I was just tryin' to get with you, honest
S'why them boys be scared of you
You never let them get past pyjamas
(oh)
When you find the time, how can I get to know ya?

Your name, number, game
Tell me anything (i gotta get to know ya)
Your way, words you'd probably say
When you want, I'll be here baby
Longin' to know ya (know ya)

I wonder when you'll ever see me (See me, see me)
