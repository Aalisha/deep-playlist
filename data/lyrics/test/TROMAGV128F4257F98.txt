Dear Dotti what should I do? 
I wrote this letter to you 
I know you'll tell me the truth 
In The Weekly World News 

My tongue is hairy, my lips are blue 
Oh Dear Dotti what will I do? 
Shaved my tongue but my back is hairy too! 
Signed, Hairy and Blue 

Honey you're funny, with a hairy tongue 
I can't imagine who would want some 
Stop shaving and get it waxed 
...
