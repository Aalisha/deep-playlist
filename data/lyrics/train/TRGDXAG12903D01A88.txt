Breathing in and breathing out
My head leaned back my hands are tied
I stand in here alone I scream, questions why
Days slip by and nights I taste
These memories run through my veins
Injecting me with one last kiss, screaming why

This medication, can't save me
And desperation, takes hold of me
I wanted to believe in all of this
I wanted to believe in you

All I am, all I have
Leads me down these roads again
...
