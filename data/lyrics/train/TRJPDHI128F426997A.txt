[DJ Premier]
Yeah, yo
Ladies and gentlemen I present to you straight out the Gangstarr Foundation:
BIG SHUG! Go ahead speak on...

[Big Shug]
Catch me sipping on that moonshine tonic
Freshly dipped in these hip hop garments
You try to bomb it, I take it and disarm it
Hit you in the gut now you vomit, Sean John all on it
But I rock them wheels
Real niggas pop up and stay right there
Fake niggas stand down and stay right there
This is street music so it stays right here
Big shug, I spit fire for the hood
For realness feel this, higher for the hood
Blazing blocks, ripping internet some web pages
I rip stages, with? v-block? and singapore
You want the raw? It's pure and uncut
Me and my cats we're pure and uncut
You niggaz is butt, so I say screw ya
I bring them four fives and two twos to do ya

[Chorus]
I bring the fire to your grill, I barbecue ya
I got the flames on blaze, just to do ya
