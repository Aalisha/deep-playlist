The night whispered a distant dream
The ashes fell to dust
An innocent; A deathly scream
Another dead - for my bloodlust

Oh cursed life; Eternity
Tied; My fleshbound soul
Pray a prayer to set me free
I'm weary of this wretched role

Delived us from evil
Forgive us for our sins
For we are gods creation
