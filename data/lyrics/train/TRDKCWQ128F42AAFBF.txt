You are guilty
Of every sin I know
You don't take care of me
And I'm feeling so low
Now I do love you
But you make it so hard

Now I've tried to let go
But I just can't say no
I've cried all my tears
Over you
Tell me what, what can I do

You can't fool my heart anymore
So now I'm walking out the door
