So Lord, I wait for your reply,
but I won't hold my breath tonight.
You're so much empty sky,
and it's too late.
The damage has been done.
You gave a child a gun,
Then turned around and run.

And it goes on and on and on.
It goes on and on and on.
You know that it goes on.
We were here long before,
and we'll be here when you're gone.
It goes on and on and on.
...
