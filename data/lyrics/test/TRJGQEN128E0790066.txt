My nights grow long
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone

Now that you're gone
I'm living my life all alone
Or hit by a blow
To my pride
But I'm doing OK

I won't let you see
What this has done to me
I guess I'll just take it in stride
Come what may

My nights grow long
My nights grow long
Now that you're gone
My nights grow long
