When the feelin' is ended
There ain't no use pretendin'
Don't ya worry - it's only love

When your world has been shattered
Ain't nothin' else matters
It ain't over - it's only love
And that's all - ya
When your heart has been broken
Hard words have been spoken
It ain't easy - but it's only love
...
