These bitches act local and think global
Never seen a 100 thousand, well let me show you
What you want to drink, I know you hate being sober
And I know all these niggas hate Chief Sosa
I'm cruising in my 'Rari with my Louie loafers
Bitch I'm a Rastafari, I'm a toolie toter
Wish a nigga would try to screw me over
Now I got blood on my Louie loafers
I wear thousand dollar belts cause I'mma rich nigga
Nina like a boxer bitch the way she hit niggas
Shoes cost a bunch of shit, look at my kicks nigga
Could of bought a ass for my bitch nigga
I'm off this Activis, it got me leanin' over
I poured up 4 of Purp in some Peach soda
You friend of a opp, I'mma Nina blow him
You was on the phone with him, sucking my dick, he ain't even know it
