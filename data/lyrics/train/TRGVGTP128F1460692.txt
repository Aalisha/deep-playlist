You niggaz just don't get it, do you?
Young Roscoe, the sodo
YA, Dogg Poung, Kurupt, Young Gotti
Yeah, started November 23rd, 1972 an' 83

Put me on lockdown an' sneak out back
An' when the cameras ain't rollin', I sneak a sack
Let's make one thing clear, this ain't no democracy
Not while you listenin' to my CD

You see right now, ain't no other rappers hot but me
Oh, yeah, Pac an' B.I.G., R.I.P.
But if you ain't feelin' the same way, press 'Eject'
I'll even give you 5 seconds

Yeah, Tabasco, yeah

The wait is finally done with, the time is now
YA, like who want it, we in it to run it
The album's done, nigga, Volume 1, nigga
Tabasco sauce all over the track

That nigga, Roscoe'll boss all over the track
He make the 'Girls All Pause', yeah, they open to that
Now who you know the flow talkin' about approachin' a mac?
Without a stack of doe with some dodo to roll fat

I'm a top notch nigga, hand an' cotch trippa
Cut your arm off to get to the watch quicka
Not tryin' to do it all, can't see Juvy Hall
