No, I'm not colorblind.
I know the world is black and white.
Try to keep an open mind but,
I just can't sleep on this tonight.

[Chorus]
Stop this train.
I wanna get off
and go home
again.
I can't take the speed
it's movin in.
I know I can't.
But honestly,
won't someone stop this train?

Don't know how else to say it...
Don't wanna see my parents go.
One generation's length away
from fighting my life out on my own.

[Chorus]
Stop this train.
