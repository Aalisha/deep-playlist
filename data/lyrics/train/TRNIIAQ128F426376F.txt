CHORUS:
Well, it's a long way to Richmond
Rolling north on 95
With a redhead riding shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearing down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

We met at a truck stop
Johnson City, Tennesee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me
Said "Which way are you headed boy?
Do you need some company?"
