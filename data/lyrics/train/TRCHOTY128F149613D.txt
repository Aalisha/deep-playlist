You shoulda seen her, she shined like a star from afar
Visions of venus silky as she sat at the bar
She had me feenin', I really wanna know who you are
And what's the meaning
Legs like the strings of guitars
She got my body moaning, her body toning like hot sand
My eyes are roaming if only for the moment
But I can't control it, it's like my heart was stolen
And when she looked at me I tried but then I couldn't hold it
"Can I talk to you"
She answered in a sexy motion, "Yes"
Her breath was like a magic potion
She had me floating in her private ocean
She said her name was India and then the door was open
