verse: tell me how	
how did we get here
we keep runnin from all the answers 
and leaving me here with questions
its not fare
why you never there
you keep leaving me here alone
please tell me what
what you wanna do
my heart belongs to you
and i dont know what to do
you say
that you still love me
its not in your actions so whats the distractions
were falling
falling apart
feels like our ending
its not like the start
please wont you tell me the truth
instead of always just leaving me here alone

choruse: alone
i 
dont wanna be 
...
