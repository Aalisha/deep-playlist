Here comes that man again
It's always round midnight
That Amsterdam creeps into my PC
After a long hard day selling pornography
He likes to come home and talk to me
He's got his mind on the job but
His technological props
Oops, another file on the email
And though I'm scared to click open
I just can't help having a look
Oh, here comes that man again
A car crash in my psyche
My curiosity's driving me
Yes here he comes again
Who'd have thought I'd have as much fun
With an anonymous Dutchman?
I never knew I had it in me
He says the camera is on and
Can I see him yet?
