UNDER THE BLADE

A glint of steel, a flash of light
You know you're not going home tonight
Be it jack or switch, doctor's or mind
Nowhere to run, everywhere you'll find
You can't escape from the bed you've made
When your time has come,
You'll accept the blade!

You're cornered in the alley way
You know you're not alone
You know it's gonna end this way
The chill goes to the bone
Now here it comes that glistening light
It goes into your side
The blackness comes, tonight's the night
The blade is gonna ride

'Cause you're under the blade,
