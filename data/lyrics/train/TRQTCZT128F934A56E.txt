Our lives were spinning in a hopeless situation
Livin' in a fallen world without hope for change
But Heaven heard our cries and that's why Jesus came
Now it's up to us to give His love away

Let's take the hope of Christ, lift it up and hold it high
Because hope changes everything
Let's take this faith we wear, to hurting people everywhere
Because hope changes everything

No matter how dark or troubled
Someone's life may seem
I do believe with all my heart
That hope changes everything

Every time I see someone who's feelin' helpless
