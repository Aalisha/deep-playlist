Take back the city for yourself tonight
I'll take back the city for me
Take back the city for yourself tonight
Whoa whoa

God knows you put your life into its hands
And it's both cradled you and crushed
But now it's time to make your own demands
Whoa whoa

All these years later and it's killing me
Your broken records and words
Ten thousand craters where it all should be
Whoa whoa

No need to put your words into my mouth
Don't need convincing at all
I love this place enough to have no doubt
Whoa whoa

It's a mess, it's a start
It's a flawed work of art
Your say, your call
Every crack, every wall

Pick a side, pick a fight
But get your epitaph right
You can sing 'til you drop
...
