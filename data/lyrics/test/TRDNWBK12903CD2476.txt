You're dead!

Voice in my head you're really getting kind of old
and now i know that you're not even real
i realise why i was really coming home
and i apologise for leaving you back then
and now i'm here to break the ice again

(Chorus)
Find the right time, just before you die
When you're on your way down's the time to shine
Take your whole damn life, just to break the ice
