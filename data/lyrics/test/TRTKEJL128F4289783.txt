Beautiful girl wherever you are
I knew when I saw you you had opened the door
I knew that I'd love again after a long long while
I'd love again.
You said "hello" and I turned to go
But something in your eyes left my heart beating so
I just knew that I'd love again after a long long while
I'd love again.
