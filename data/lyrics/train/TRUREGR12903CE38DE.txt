so many days i've can't stop myself
from fighting this monster that eats me alive
so many time i've fought and i've tried
to live for a moment without fearing my mind
i hate this, yet live this, and it's bringing me down
i feel like I'm standing on uneven ground
the balance to life has been skewered so violent
I'm so sick of this death-instinct silence
so despondent and so somber so frail
so scared to begin for the fear i will fail
I'm alone in this pattern and i can't call for grace
...
