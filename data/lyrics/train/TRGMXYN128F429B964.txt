Why do we sleep, oh little one?
Forget the ringing bell
They won't be dark for long
The sleep embrace the truth

All we left before we...
There's nowhere left to run
There's nowhere left to hide
Time will steal another piece
From our hell
And time will tell

Light of where we lie
And where we fall
Light shine out
Over distant waiting walls
Tones strike out
Will fall back down
There'll ring out
A distant clear sound
