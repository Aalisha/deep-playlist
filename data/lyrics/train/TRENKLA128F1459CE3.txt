Wake up, ninety miles an hour
Take the world's fastest shower
Coffee black, microwave it
I'm at at my best caffeinated
Out the door, pick up the pace
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everyplace

That's how it goes
A day in my life
I'm on my toes
From morning to night
Livin' like this
Some might say it's
So exhaustin' frenzied, manic
Call me nuts but I like it frantic

I'm not built for relaxing
...
