Now who's that babe with the fabulous shadow
So obscene, but to me it don't matter
Home movies get down like you won't find in my hometown
They won't believe it when they see what they're seeing
Go see baby now

Pictures on the silver screen
Greatest thing you've ever seen
Now her name is up in lights
Everything turns out alright
