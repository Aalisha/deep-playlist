In a way I'm glad it's over
Even though it's gonna hurt me once you're gone
But I can learn to live without you
Give me time and I can make it on my own

Lovin' you to me came easy
Now losin' you will change my life no doubt
In a way I'm glad it's over
In another way it turns me inside out

In a way I guess it's better
