I know that there's more to life than women.
I just can't seem to figure out what else there is.
I don't need it every night, every morning would be just fine.
A little sex, that's all I'm askin' for.
That's all I'm askin' for!

That's all he's askin' for!

Something I can test, a gal would suit me best.
I got a thing to use, I know what to use it for.
A girl I can love, and kiss, and hold, and fu...
That's all I'm askin' for!

Now I don't wanna be rich for the sake of women.
I wanna be rich for the sake of our lord.
Enough to build a church where everyone can come.
Enough for the lord, that's all I'm askin' for.
That's all I'm askin' for!

That's all he's askin' for!

It ain't a lot to ask.
