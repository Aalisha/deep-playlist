You're a snake, a viper
Devious and hyper
Talk and spit saliva
Sell out your mum for a fiver
Out of control like a truck without a driver
Cheap skate copycat imitation rhymer
Part timer nothing but decoration like eyeliner
Prime timer
Everything you ever did was minor
I'm a deep-sea diver, a shark, a survivor
You're as vain as vain gets, you're a man with a vagina
Hair style's designer, your attitude kind a
Forced to make you hard but you're easy to decipher
And you're soft like a pussycat, sly like Delilah
The hook to capture the bait, the Samson blinder
Your own crew divider, information provider
To the enemy and plus a bandwagon rider
A biter, no good time waster, an outsider
