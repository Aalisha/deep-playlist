Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spendin' my money, no, I didn't care
Takin' my friends all out for a mighty good time
Buyin' high priced liquor, champagne and wine

Oh, then I fell so low
Didn't have a friend nor a place to go
If I ever get my hands on another dollar again
I'm a hold on to it until the eagle grins

Nobody wants you when you're down and out
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
...
