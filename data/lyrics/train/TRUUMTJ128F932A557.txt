Won't you please stop telling me
I know you're not so blind to see
That everything that was correct
Is wrong and I know that it ain't just me
But given half the chance to be near you
Would only make a start in a new decline
And if I gave my heart a convincing listen
I'd be giving me a warning sign

No form of apologies
Would ever start to stitch the seam
Now it ain't that hard to see
...
