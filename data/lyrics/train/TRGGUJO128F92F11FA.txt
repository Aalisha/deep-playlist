Nowhere To Run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Got Nowhere To Run to, baby, Nowhere to hide.
It's not love I'm a running from,
It's the heartbreak I know will come.
'Cause I know you're no good for me, but you've become a part of me.
Ev'rywhere I go your face I see ev'rystep I take you take with me.

Nowhere To Run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Got Nowhere To Run to, baby, Nowhere to hide.
