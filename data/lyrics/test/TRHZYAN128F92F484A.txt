1, 2
1, 2, 3, Let's go

Back in the mud I've been in
I confess, I'm so happy here
There's nothing you can do to make me stay away, away, away

He's just that country boy, city slick, pit bull temperament
At the Pony, at the Flame, either way it's an event
If it's me consider it more than a coincidence
Even though they mumble at me sucka's keep they distances
Barber K, hey, what's that, they say
Hip hop redneck that's a safe place
Say what makes you comfortable
Wit me 'cause I like it here
How about a road-dwellin' urban music pioneer
Turn it up, let it bang, run wit me I bet you can't
Took too much to make it float, never will I let it sink
So when we invented it for our youth and generous
Hopin' that my moment passed, I can see no end of it
Twenty-five, livin' like I was born yesterday
Lovin' life, doin' right, earnin' every breath I take
Standin' in the mud again 'cause it seem to pay me well
Playin' wit my not-so-distant cousins from the A-T-L
Aaah
