Queen Bodecia is long dead and gone
Still then the spirit in her children's children's children it lives on

But if you've lost your faith in love and music the end wont be long
Because if its gone for you then i too may lose it and that would be wrong
Tried so hard to keep myself from falling
Back into my bad old ways
And it chars my heart to always hear you calling
