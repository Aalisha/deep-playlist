Close the door behind you
Hide from yourself
Destined to fall down
Praying for help
Pain embraces me
Holding me back
I was in envy
Fragile intact

Truth was forgotten
All the lies that had been told
Fear that leads to pain and silence
And honesty so cold

Life goes by 
My truth remains
Follow your own way
Hide your false discouragement
