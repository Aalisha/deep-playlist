As torches rise
I take a look around,
the blood of our men has painted the ground
there are corpses lying everywhere
some try to pray, some cry in despair
as our enemy cuts its way through our lines
desperate thoughts take over our minds
is this to be the end of our days?
The overwhelming enemy
rides our front lines down
with hate in their faces, with hate in their sound
houndreds of men lying wounded on the ground
no one can help them,
to their destiny they're bound
...
