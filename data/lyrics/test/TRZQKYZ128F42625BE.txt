You keep on walkin' on the other side,
other side,
other side
You keep on walkin' on the other side,
other side,
other side

Wherever you go,
I'm going with you
shouldn't you know I'm bound to follow
whatever you say,
whatever you do
I give you a clue,
I'm gonna follow

And the stars
will show
where the waters flow
where the gardens grow
...
