And you can dance for inspiration.
Come on. I'm waiting!

Get into the groove.
Boy you've got to prove your love to me,
Yeah.
Get up on your feet, yeah, step to the beat,
boy, what will it be?

Music can be such a revelation.
Dancing around you feel the sweet sensation.
We might be lovers if the rythms right.
I hope this feeling never ends tonight.

Only when i'm dancing can i feel
this free? At night i lock the doors,
where no one else can see.
i'm tired of dancing here all by myself.
Tonight i wanna dance w/ someone else.

Get into the groove.
Boy you've got to prove your love to me,
Yeah.
Get up on your feet, yeah, step to the beat,
boy, what will it be?

Gonna get to know you in a special way.
This doesn't happen to me everyday.
Don't try to hide it, love wears no disguise.
I see the fire burning in your eyes.
