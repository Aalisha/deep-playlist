Oh Child, Deceive me
Enter the same the same as I
Moments pass as desperate contortions unfold
Seeking placid sanity a moment of calm

Sheltering indifference to dignify rage
Begging for a line drawn in the sand to separate the prophets from the men then bittersweet the wicked so the guise of harmony can breathe again delighted
Hear me son the rivers dry again
