Thinking clearly never came as easy as it did for you
Driving this route out of town I wish you were still around

In the dead of night I always wondered whether you were true
Someone better than myself an offer you just can't turn down
A morning flight, A wasted night
You crept back to your room…

Run along back to your new man, Limassol
Hold on, I couldn't trap you
We're gonna head for… new horizons, Limassol
