When I wake up each morning
Trying to find myself
And if I m ever the least unsure
I always remind myself
Though you re someone in this world
That i'll always choose to love
From now on you re only someone
That I used to love

As for me
It s getting down to the last
Unspoken part
When you must begin to ease
The pain of a broken heart
Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on you re only someone
That I used to love
