Started on Thursday
At seven or maybe eight
You crashed into my world with a boom
You came over as a guest
I said I liked you and I confessed
By ten o'clock I was making fun of you
You stayed for a while
Then left with a smile
At least I made you happy
You make me happy, too
It's kinda cheesy to say but

You're everything I want
When I'm with you all the hurting stops
You're the hand that fits my glove
And I'll never replace you
