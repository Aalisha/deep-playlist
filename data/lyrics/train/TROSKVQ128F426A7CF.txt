Do you ever wonder where
We would be if we had tried
A little harder?
It seems like yesterday
That we were making plans
For the future

But it's been so long
Since I have mourned the dreams
Those dreams we left abandoned

And I'm haunted by your face
And the memory of your kisses
Sweet kisses

Do you remember?
I still remember so much
I remember never feeling so alive
Do you remember?
I still can't forget your touch
We swore that we would never end
We knew our love transcended space and time
