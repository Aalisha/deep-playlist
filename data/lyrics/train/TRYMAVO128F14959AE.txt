Walkin' to work here lately.
So baby you can drive my car
Holdin' back just enough change from my check
for a Coke and a candy bar.
Now I don't mind a bit baby
their doing sweet things to you
But don't you think it's just about time
you made an effort
to try to please me some too.
I found some hid out
gift wrapped alligator shoes.
You said they suppose to be a suprise
Little things like that make me wonder bout' you baby
...
