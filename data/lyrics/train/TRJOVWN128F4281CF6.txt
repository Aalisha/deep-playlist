[CHILD STAR]
Is there a photo of me on your wall in short short-shorts
Or zipped down jeans?
Do you look up at night and wish you were me, under the stage
Under hot lights?

Are you visceral viscous?
Do you want to make love to my sweet visage,
And then pretend it's you, it's you
It was always you

[CHILD FAN]
I wrote you a letter to become a member of your fanclub
But all i got in the mail was return to sender

[STAR:]
I'm still a big big star

[FAN:]
No you're not

[STAR:]
Yes I am

[FAN:]
No you're not

[STAR:]
Yes I am

[FAN:]
No you're not.

[STAR:]
