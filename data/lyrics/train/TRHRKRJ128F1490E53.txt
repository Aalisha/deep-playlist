So I was rolling down the Mountain Side
The Sun come around melting the snow away

Girl I've been gone for such a long long time
Seasons no reason to change

Girl I love you more and more each day
and each and every day I pray that you will stay

Girl I keep loving you more and more each day
Seasons no reason to change

woooooooo seasons no reason to change
Seasons no reason to change

Seasons no reason to change
Seasons no reason to change

Seasons no reason to change

Girl I love you more and more each day
