You crack like glass on the southern side, above us the moon will haul a lonely tide. I fall, fall, through a filthy
fog to meet you in the station by the hanging clock. The bells in the clock will chime a song for you, "As You Are Growing Older I Grow Older Too," the light from the carousel should send you home. You want to go but you won't.

You crackle like fire and I can see you're fitter, fiercer than you used to be. I fall, fall, through a bitter cold to
meet you in the harbour by the tallest boat. The buoys in the dock will peal a song for you, "As You Are Growing Older I Grow Older Too," the face in the photograph would send me home but you won't.
