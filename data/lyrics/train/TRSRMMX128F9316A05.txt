Far too long I've awaited this rainy day.
That can wash away the pain I feel
Among those memories I bury all my inner thoughts.
And I'm safe from your world, too real.
How can you be so cruel, blaming me like a fool, a thief in darkness?
I know that this is the end, there's no need to release that force so shapeless.

My heart can be cold, that's what you have told, so many years ago.
No reasons to stay, one reason to go, this is your game, my overdose.
