Don't leave, cuz I really wanna love you
So what you wanna do, I gotta be with you tonight
Don't leave, cuz I really wanna love you
So what's it gonna be
I need you here with me tonight
Don't leave, cuz I really wanna love you
So what you wanna do, I gotta be with you tonight
Don't leave, cuz I really wanna love you
So what's it gonna be
I need you here with me tonight
Won't you lay next to me
Got something special for you baby(Now what's it gonna be)(I need you next to me)Got the room dressed in red
And setup for two, yeah
Ooh what I wanna do to you, whoa(Let me do things that'll turn you on)So don't you try to fight it, girl
I promise you gon' like it
I got plans for you, for what I'm ready to do
So let me taste your love, girl don't you leave
