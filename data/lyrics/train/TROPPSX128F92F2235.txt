She parks her car on Woodland Street
She's got a job at the meat-n-three
She's kind of pretty in a perculiar kind of way
And I try hard to like her
Yeah, I try hard to like her...

CHORUS
Because she's good for you
She's so good for you
You say she's good for you
That makes her bad, that makes her very bad
For me.
