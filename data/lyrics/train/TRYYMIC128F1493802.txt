(Verse 1)
I used to do okay on my own
Think I was made of stone
And I could carry a heavy load
Never thought that one day I'd be all alone
And then the road got long
I saw I was wrong
And had no one to lean upon
But you kept me from falling far below
And taught me somethin' I had never known, that

(Chorus)
You Lord, You Lord
Can hold my heart in Your hand
