99 days sparring with the Don King of the business
I'm in and this is where it begins.
The arena is packed and stacked with the P-Pack
the pact is sealed and we are gonna react - SMACK.
The judges?: "READY", the coaches?: "READY",
the referees?: "STEADY" Henning?: "Boom ah yeah".
The bookies gimme 5 Grand for every buck I bet on me,
from what I understand they don't expect an upset - SEE It seems to
be the hour has come I hear the clock go ring ah ding - ah ding dong!

Ladies and Gentlemen, the bout is about to begin
Get in the ring Henning Boom ah Yeah, yeah and sing:

Ref.: (2x)
