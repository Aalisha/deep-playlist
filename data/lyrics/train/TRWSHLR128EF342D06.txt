Do you spend your life hiding in the shadows
Terrified of letting down your guard
Do you fantasize of glorious tomorrows
Come alive you're perfect as you are

Careless lies
Will hurt you no more

Till the angels cry
And the music dies
You and I will be protected
Till this earth burns out
And stops turning round
I will keep u protected
We're protected

Walkaway from those who bring you sorrow
...
