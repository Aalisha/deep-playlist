Oh, lullaby of birdland that's what i
Always hear, when you sigh,
Never in my wordland could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how i feel.

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips
When we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
...
