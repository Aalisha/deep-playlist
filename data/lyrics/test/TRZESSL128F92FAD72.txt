See we gotta get it right
But we always get it wrong
And it be the same old thing
And it be the same old song
Tryin' to fight to survive
Tryin' to fight for our lives
See
I'm only tryin' to live
I don't want to say goodbye
But the day that it all should end
Holla back some more that be

Cause we'll all be born again
Maybe then we'll all be free
And the day that it all should stop
Is a day that will never come
Cause we gonna live forever
Spinnin' until we're spun
Here we go one more time

Here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Yeah we spinnin'
Now we spun
Here we go one more time
Here we go one more time
Now we Spinnin'
