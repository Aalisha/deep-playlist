Walk on city light
Walk on in the night
Run on down the street
What I got I'm gonna keep

Walk on city lights
Walk on city lights
Oh it's a pity
It's a city

Yes it's the city
That's the pity

Help me in the backside door
I got what I want I need more
Take me to your car
Drag me to your bar
Walk on city lights
Walk on city lights
Oh it's a pity
It's a city
