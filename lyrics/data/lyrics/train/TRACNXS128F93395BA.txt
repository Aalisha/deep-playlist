This world is driving me crazy.
Things goin' on make me mad.
Waiting in the dole queue for money to come down.
No wonder this boy turned bad.
I'm gonna write my M. P.
Say what the fuck's goin on,
All my life I'm runnin' on empty,
Watchin' everybody else have fun.

I'm a victim of circumstance, a victim of circumstance.
This boy never ever stood a chance, I'm a victim of circumstance,
whoa - yea!
