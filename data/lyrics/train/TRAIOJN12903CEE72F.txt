Ready Ready Ready for the fight cos I´m
Ready Ready Ready
(Coming for the knockout baby!)
Ready Ready Ready for the fight cos I´m
Ready Ready Ready
Mother said there´d be days like this
She never said how bad the nights could get.
I entered the corner the same way I exit
I can´t quit now got too much invested.
Obstacles in place in my face
Don´t get greedy maintain steady pace.
Trying to spray my 3rd eye with mace
I gotta keep my people close just in case.
If you gonna hold me down ´cos I´m coming for the crown
I´m gonna stand my ground and be the best pound for pound.
Cos I´m
