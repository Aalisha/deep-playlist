I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes.
Well love is all around me, and so the feeling grows.
It's written on the wind, it's everywhere I go.
So if you really love me, come on and let it show.

You know I love you, I always will.
My mind's made up by the way that I feel.
There's no beginning, there'll be no end.
'Cause on my love you can depend.
