I lost more sleep than I can say
And blurred the lines between the days
Pour myself another cup
Put one out, light another up

My mind's stopped making any sense
I've lost track of the present tense
Don't want to leave, don't want to stay
I'd kill to bring back yesterday

Folded up and left for dead
The things I wish I would have said
The times I should have turned and run
But the damage was already done

And I dug myself a deeper hole
Raked myself over the coals
Reason brings redemption
...
