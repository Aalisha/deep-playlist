Moon shine on the bayou
Love shrine break the taboo
I wanna know what's in your potion
Bound by total devotion

I was lookin' for love all over
You're the hunter and I'm your prey
Now I'm lost in a lover hangover
I try to leave but I have to stay

'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo (under your spell)
'Cause it's voodoo voodoo voodoo (under your spell)

Swamp sings over the bazaar
Snake bites aligning stars
I'm in rapture there is no cure
No sanctuary from your allure
