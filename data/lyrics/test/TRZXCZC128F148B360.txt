She claims we travel in a rollin' jet
But in fact she arrived on a blue Corvette
She almost dares to plush your tail
Loves her daddy's cash 'cause it spends so well

Just watch the way she walk
She's got a double wild figure
Watch her body talk

She's a twentieth century fox, oh watch her walk
She's a twentieth century fox, talk that talk

She got designer jeans, so tight n' blue
Regardin' the sweat when she looks at you
...
