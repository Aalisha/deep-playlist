Good day my fellow citizen 
I don't mean to intrude 
But allow me to get right down to the point 
We've monitored transmissions 
We calculate your moves 
Did you really think you're hidden from our sight? 
Your name's been added to a list that's been compiled 
Our agency considers you a risk 

Secret power I can't believe 
Growing stronger I feel them 
Strengthening their grip 

So there you are you crossed the line 
You pathetic little man 
Well rest assured the worst you feared is true 
In the seduction of society we play upon desire 
Spoiled and drunk that's you 

Can this be happening? 
This world is just a grand facade 
You're just a simple man at heart 
A victim playing out a part 
Oh I just want my freedom 
Where are the ones who back you now? 
...
