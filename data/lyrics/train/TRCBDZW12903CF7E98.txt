It's not enough, It's not enough for both of us.
This love I feel, Wont reach into your heart.
Though it hurts inside, To find my pride so altered.
I let you go, to find your way alone.

I never knew it would hurt like this
To let someone go against my wishes
All I can do is hope and pray
That you'll find your way.
