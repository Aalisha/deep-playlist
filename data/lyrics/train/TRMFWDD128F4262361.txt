Hey! Like a shadow in the night
Molested by his sight
He's come to get you

Sharper than cold steel
He's gonna show you how it feels
Ain't that a sight, nothin' you can do

You were so special that he dragged you straight to hell
Like all the other bad girls
He'll rip your heart, he won't let go
He wants your soul to keep

Spreading his disease
