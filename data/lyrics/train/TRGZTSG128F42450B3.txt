The soldiers led Jesus from a courtroom of mockery and nailed him to an old cross to die, They laughed at his statement, "I'll rise again, you'll see", One pierced a sharp spear in his side, And his cryin was finished he was heard from the hillside, He was placed in a tomb by his friends, His words were remembered by mary as she cried, I must die but I'll live again
