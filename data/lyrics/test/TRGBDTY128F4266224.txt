[Intro:]
Aye yo u
Still up at the hood spots
Still no security, still gotta swaga like my pops
Still water run deep when that coke is cheap
But when that price go south, get your surf boards out
Still gotta lil pimp in me from my past
Still got some lil cousins that will beat yo ass
Yo I'm the only dude that u know burn the block up
So why the hell do I gotta call the cops up

[Verse 1:]
Shorty you're so amazing, your body's bangin
Conversation so stimulating, my heart is racing
(I just want to know if we can get 2gether sometime
And you know what I'm saying
Ya bodies toned up look at those thick thighs
Grandmama must have been feeding u right
(shake it to the left momma shake it to the right)

[Chorus:]
Somebody call the cops up
Lil momma done stole my heart
She's making me fall in love
She's not gonna give it up

Somebody call the cops up
Somebody call 911
Tell'em I've been shot through the heart
...
