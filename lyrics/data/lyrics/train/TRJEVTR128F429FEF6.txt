T-shirt, blue jeans, don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscuit, ain't no red eye gravy on a biscuit
My deep southern drawl makes the conversation crawl
You're gonna have to hang around long enough to hear me out

Some folks ain't happy like they are
Some wanna take things just a little too far

Singers wanna be Hollywood actors
And millionaires wanna ride old farm tractors
I am just what I am, I'm just what you see
...
