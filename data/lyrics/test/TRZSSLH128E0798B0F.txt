My Lady, My Lady, My lady

[Verse 1:]
My lady you doing it
I can't withstand
You better slow it down,
Where I'm from, Dwele will make you forget your man
I'm trying to hold tight, but I can't help if he don't move you like you need to be
(ooh oh baby alright)

(All I) wanna do (is) glide or slow motion straight to you
(Then) Figure a way to make you move (by)
Using my hands, using my dance
(All I) wanna know (is) when you get it down on the floor
(How) does your body move and make me grab your hand
And find out your name
