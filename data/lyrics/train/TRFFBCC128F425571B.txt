Outside a church on a Friday night
Saw the lights were on, so he stepped inside
Walked the straightest line to the nearest pew
Bowed his head and spoke to you
Said I know it's been a while and I must confess
That since our last talk I've become a mess
It's falling all apart, there's nowhere left to turn
Oh God, are you listening in the heavens tonight
And God, we need you more than ever tonight

So close your eyes and start to breathe
They're all around, do you believe
That angels fight to ease your worried heart
Keep whispering your broken prayers
