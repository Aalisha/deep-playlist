Man, what am I say this time?
She already heard the one about staying at work late
I already gave her the script about hanging out with the boys
Guess I messed up this time, I'll face the music

I see that you're leaving
After giving you everything in the world
Like a brand new Benz, a laced out crib
A pocket full of dough and your baby got milk

Girl why you're trippin'
'Cuz I stayed out late at night
But I locked my keys in my car
After getting off work, didn't think to call

If innocent is my plea
Then why can't you trust in me?
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to the question could be the end

I'm guilty for loving you
And that's all I got to prove
You don't wanna know where I've been
The answer to your questions could be the end

So you think I've been cheating, yeah
