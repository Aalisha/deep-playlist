You said enough, you said too much
You focus solely on her touch and halcyon
In arguments set in stone
In promises of what was once, you come undone
If you take this away, I fade to black and disappear
If it's all a state of mind
Give me something I can believe in
Aah
What you say doesn't say that you mean it
Aah
If I'm wrong well at least I know better
Aah
Give me something I can believe in
Aah
It's in your hands
No war, no causes and effects
