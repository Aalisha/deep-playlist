It always sucks refolding the kind of map
Needed when I get stuck where the sun don't shine the fact
Is if I just shut up my rubbered stamp could flag you as dumb
It ain't your mind you're givin' me a piece of
As it don't take Einstein to know that's just obscene but
It's been Buck Rogers' time since I hit other than rock bottom

Even the odds of having you against me
With your crotchless jihad on blue balls evidently
Are all mighty good God so angel dust my soul like James Brown
Street legal whore hauling so much stunning ass
Sell yourself short like bridge at the bunny ranch
Do it all fours the satisfaction of getting fouled

I'm the least you could do
