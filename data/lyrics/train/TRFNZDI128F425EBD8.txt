(Lalalalalala)
Mary Mary (Lalalalalala) (Thank You)
When I look back over my life (Thank You)
And all the times you brought me through (Thank You)
I just wanna say father, Thank You
Oh umm! When I was lonely, (Hun) and needed some one to hold me
Oh! You were beside me, when my nights got cold and lonely
Oh ho! You never let me down when (no one else could be found I)
Always count on you to see me through, I’m telling you that,
(Listen) You are the reason, I’m alive and I’m still breathing
(Halleluiah) (For me you gave your life and now my life it has
New meaning)
(Yes) When I think about your grace (grace), and I finally see your face (face)
There’s one thing I need to say, wanna say, yeah (Yeah)
(Thank You Lord for loving me (Thank You)
Thank You Lord for keeping me (Yeah)
Thank You Lord for that day you came and broke the chains and set me free (Yes sir)
Thank You for another chance, you gave me joy now I can dance)
All the people open up your mouth and let me here you say Thank You (Thank You) Thank You (Thank You) (Come on!)
Thank You lord for one more day, you made the raindrops go away (away)
Thank You ‘cause my pain is gone, I know it came to make me strong (Yeah, yeah)
