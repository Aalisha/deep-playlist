Can't stand the light, it hurts my eyes
And it comes as no surprise to find
A broken heart has no reprieve
In all the things we leave behind

I won't forsake you
Don't wanna break you
Don't wanna make you
Make you cry

I can remember, can recall
When once we had it all before
Can't stand up for falling down
...
