How long, do I have to feel the blame
I don't know
So long, I'm only wasting my time
It's been a strange kind of love, I know
It wasn't meant to be
Found it so hard to believe
It happened to me
But I can live without you
Don't know if I want to
Always trying so hard to understand
Still I'm holding feelings
Still I can't believe it
You've always got the best of what I am
