Follow me to solace and safety
Over the tar-blackened river and past the gleaming yellow eyes
I hope I'm right this time
I can't lose any more of you tonight
They're trusting me to lead them
But they don't know
I'm just running from my fear
Are they catching on yet
Let's change our course
I'm putting all that I've got into my last resort

Can I count on you to make it work
Peril and risk prowling around every corner
Sudden death rushing at us from behind the clouds
Danger and threat stalking weary stragglers
Keeping us on the very tips of our toenails

The enemy has been on our scent for days
Only miles away from revenge they crave
There has got to be a way
To cover our tracks
Or what happens when we stop running
I can't be too panicked to protect
...
