VERSE ONE
(PRODIGY)
Forever wild from the cradle to the grave
Kid, watch your back, one time, it's comin always(Yeah!)
They lock me up for 12 days, I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin St.Ide's down with some Seagrams Gin
Life is like a dice game and I'm into win

(HAVOC)
On the scene from the 41st side of Queens
We get the CREAM, laid up, love-love for dame
Cos I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim King
Doin my thing, do wild stakes my name'll reign

(PRODIGY)
To all my peoples locked down comin back to life
In the world once again though ya fear was trife
While you was gone, we was goin to war and even more
Saw my man layin dead on the floor, kid I swore
That our crew will live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong(Yeah!)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police(Where?)
Sweatin dogs as I'm runnin cross 12th Street
Just as I approach the block
I spot a jake on the creep down by Vick's weed spot(So what!)
Made a U-ey up the hill plus a change of plans
I had to hurry back so I could warn my man

(HAVOC)
Ya had me stressin little sumthin, had my heart rapidly pumpin
Niggas start a guttin behind the bushes duckin
My ears rung, I punch a clip into the guns
Got (? Raydes?) in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin from the head, I couldn't believe it
