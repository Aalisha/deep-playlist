Would you like to come and try my style
And this is something from the wildest side
Life without a care, sweet sensation in the air

You can come and feel your fantasy
Everything is yours, it's for free
The music's grooving, the body is hot and moving

I'm gonna take you on a pleasure ride (pleasure ride)
Where your mind is free to fly
Like a bird on the wind
You can do anything

We got jazz in the house
We got jazz in the house
We are here in your house (in your house)
So let's have fun tonight
