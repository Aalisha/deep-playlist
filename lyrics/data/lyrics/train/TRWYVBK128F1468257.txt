You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady

Don't think I don't see them looking atcha
All of them wishing they coul have ya
And as a matter of fact
A bunch of them are itchin' for you to scratch them

I'm tired of hiding what we feel
I'm tryin to come with the real
And I'ma gonna make it known
Cause I wan't them to know

You're my lady
You're my lady
You're my lady
...
