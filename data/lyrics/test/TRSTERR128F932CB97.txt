Now, me and my wife went to town
(Sail away lady, sail away)

Went to buy a ten dollar gown
(Sail away lady, sail away)

Don't you rock me daddyo
(Don't you rock me daddyo)

Don't you rock me daddyo
(Don't you rock me daddyo)

Don't you rock me daddyo
(Don't you rock me daddyo)

Don't you rock me daddyo
(Don't you rock me daddyo)

She tried the green
She tried the red
(Sail away lady, sail away)

I'll have 'em all
That's what she said
(Sail away lady, sail away)

Don't you rock me daddyo
(Don't you rock me daddyo)
