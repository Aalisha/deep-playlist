Twenty- six miles across the sea
Santa catalina is a-waitin' for me
Santa catalina, the island of romance, romance, romance, romance

Water all around it everywhere
Tropical trees and the salty air
But for me the thing that's a-waitin' there-romance

It seems so distant, twenty-six miles away
Restin' in the water serene
I'd work for anyone, even the navy
Who would float me to my island dream
