You're making me doubt myself
This feeling I know so well
Visions of naked greed
Are visions I just don't need

Far deep, phantom seeking, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart
Far from living, I can see
The nude that broke my heart
The nude that broke my heart

The texture of moistened skin
All over this skin I've been
...
