(woohoooo
woohoooo
woohoooo
woohoooo)
Waiting for
opportunity to strike
I have been your biggest fan
what a tour
a little blow to cure your fright
that's what it takes to trap a man
water me
I am not the desert plant
they would like before you
when I close
(will I have my blue eyes...)
when I open
(...this time?)
when I close
(should I have my green eyes?)
when I open
(that shine and shine)
when I close
(will I have my green eyes?)
when I open
I love you
(woohoooo)
I love you
(woohoooo)
