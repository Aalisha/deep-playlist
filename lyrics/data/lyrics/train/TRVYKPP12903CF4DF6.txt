I hate your bad tattoos and your second-hand stories
Those anecdotes that grew old last month
I hate the way you move when you're drunk and try dancing
It's not sexy, it's just keeping us up
And I'm just not fond of anyone
And that's got everything to do with us
I hate the way I get when I can't handle bad news
It feels like I've been an asshole for months
All I've got left are these handfuls of fuck you
Man, that's never enough

I guess I'm just down
I guess I'll be honest, I could use you around
I can't stand the dork that you're hanging with now
I guess I'll be honest, I could use you around

I hate the way that you can't keep your hair straight
