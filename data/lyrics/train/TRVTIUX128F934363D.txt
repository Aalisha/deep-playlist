First you fall in love
There you make it
When you've had enough
You start to fake it
There's someone on the phone
But you're not listening
And she's not coming home

Remember where you met
So picture perfect
She's meeting all your friends
Because it's worth it
And they could only see
What you cannot see
The things you won't believe

Ah ah

Then you wake up
To big change
To the break up
Done at close range
And the love is such a cruel thing
What you want you got but can't hold on anymore
