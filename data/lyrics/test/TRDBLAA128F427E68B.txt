It's even brittle
They lock hands
To make a line
Perhaps dividing

Solid forest
Saw blades
Sightless, flawless
Walking sideways

Chain could bite
In this white out
Scissor teeth
Cruelty lip

Tireless grasp
Frigid spike
Glass desert
Mesmerize
Circulation

South Pole fighters
South Pole fighters
South Pole fighters
South Pole fighters

Missing climate
Bleeding wind
Needle wages
Blinking words

Ghost of light
No circulation
Way of breathing
No more blades

No more walk
...
