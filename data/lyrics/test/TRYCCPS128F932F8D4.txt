Yeah, believe it or not
What kept me alive is my dreams

I'm a dreamer but I ain't the only one got problems
But we love to have fun
This is our world, from here to your hood
We alive man, it's okay to feel good

I'm a dreamer but I ain't the only one got problems
But we love to have fun
This is our world, from here to your hood
Lock me up now, it's okay to feel good

I got a friend named Flow
Who got a friend named Blow
With a finger named Clap
That'll leave you on the side like a Kangol hat

He ain't have no choice, he was born this way
These streets pull your number like a phone display
And you gotta be defensive with your life
You gotta be like Bush and take pre-emptive strikes

And the boys from the hood are always hard
Let alone in Mogadishu it's a mastered art
If you bring the world hoods to a seminar
We from the only place worse then Kandahar
Well, that's kinda hard

But we still like to party and hardy hard
Something good happens we say, 'Mashallah'
Something bad happens, 'Que Sera Sera'
I close my eyes and all I can see is you dancing with me

I'm a dreamer but I ain't the only one got problems
But we love to have fun
This is our world, from here to your hood
We alive man, it's okay to feel good

I'm a dreamer but I ain't the only one got problems
But we love to have fun
This is our world, from here to your hood
