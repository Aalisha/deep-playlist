Lydie lit a cigarette today,
Ancient fumbling fingers in her way
From a forty year old coffee cup she sipped a bit of gin,
Closed her eyes and let the memories in.

She lives in the old place all alone,
Keeps in touch with neighbours by the phone,
Grows herbs on the graves of her firstborn and his father,
And the coal trucks never bother her.

Oh Lydie, let him go. the boy is gone,
Her mother struggled as she tore him from her arms,
Oh Lydia, your tears are heaven's rain,
But she never was the same.
