Like a ghost that came
From old beginning
You heated up
The freezing destiny
But I told myself
I had the chance
To live a better life
By loving someone new

I miss the mind of the wonderful
I let the icey thoughts
Run through me cold
And no one knows
I keep the pain
Of a broken soul
Wounds that just won't heal
No one knows
Not even you
