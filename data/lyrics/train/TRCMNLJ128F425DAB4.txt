I learn about life through your life
I learn about touch through your hands
I learn about love through your heart
I learn to be kind where I can

But the window's still broken
It's starting to freeze
And the only thing I ever wanted
Is scattered in the breeze

I learn about strength through your strength
I learn about hope in your eyes
I learn about taste through your lips
I learn about trust through your lies

But the cuts are still open
...
