The smell of your breath, it makes me sick
Your naked body lying on the floor
I want to kill you but you did it yourself
You killed my innocence
You drunken fuck
I hate you
I piss on your grave and curse your memory

I was always there in the family hell
I was in your way and you hit me
You cut your wrists and jumped from the 4th floor
