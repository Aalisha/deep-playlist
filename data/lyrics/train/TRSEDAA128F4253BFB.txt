"Lately there has been some kind of changes in the structure
It seems somehow the sunlight doesn't move the way it ought to, my love
What are you thinking?
You draw a line that doesn't fit
You write a word that doesn't quite
seem to describe the things they should
And what can I say, when I look around I see nothing sometimes

And maybe I've been building me a fence
â€˜Cause nothing's gonna get to me again
Betina, if I'd only know the things there were to see
But I couldn't see the forest for the trees

And you're just a girl but when you smile
it seems to me you've seen it all
Like nothing anyone could say or do
would slightly surprise you
