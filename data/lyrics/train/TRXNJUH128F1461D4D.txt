Feel A Whole Lot Better

We've seen the look of sadness in your eyes
But you're not to blame
You will get this from any other guy-uy
'Cause they're all the sa-a-a-ame

But you know you've go-ot friends
On that you can depe-end
You better try and get yourself together
Don't be a fool

Whatever it is - it's tearing you apar-art
We can help if we just stick together
Ooh, whatever it is - you don't need a broken hear-ear-ear-eart
If you dance, you'll feel a whole lot better

We know the way he treated you is bad
