Where you're headed there is no return
You're hell bent on a crash and burn
You think you're winnin but you won't be free
Until you realize there's no enemy

So live
Live on through me
It's time to forgive
The creeper kamikaze

Goin down on a one way flight
You're just dyin to be right
Your time is closing in and that's a sign
...
