Oh, yes it's hard, it's getting harder
To turn the cheek or just walk away
When all I see is degradation
Day after day

I wanna fight, my hands are tied
My weapons are pitiful
And all that's left
One troubled mind, one timid voice
Such a desperate noise

What's in a word, more than I can say
Once in a while you can hear such sweet sounds
Freedom's singing in your head, in your head

And while I slide down into darkness
