What they say
They say I'm crazy when it comes to you
(No matter what they say)
(No words I know can keep me away from your love)
(They say I'm crazy)
This is why

They see me walking down this lonely avenue
They see me talking when I'm the only one in view
(They say I'm crazy)
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you

I hear them whisper
Certainly, she's lost her mind
And draw conclusions on any reasons they can find
They say I'm crazy
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you
(They say I'm crazy)
Well I'm not crazy
(Maybe a little crazy)
When it comes to you, you

(When it comes to you)
