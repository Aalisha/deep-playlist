Mouths are moving, people talking slowly in my ears
Another year goes
You stood up gently, turned around to face me, staring back
I'll see you sometime soon, if only I could see the way you do

The midnight air, it blows between my fingertips
So cold as I walk back inside
It's hard for me to understand how you could die for me
