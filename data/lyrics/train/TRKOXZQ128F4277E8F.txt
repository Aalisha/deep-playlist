the stars were bright before we got here
but our choices sent them into the darkness

before we know it, they will be reunited
and looking for revenge

if i could run the clocks, i would
but their hands are out of mine
their hands are out of mine
i told them to turn around
but the future was on their minds
it was on their minds

the stars were safe before we got here
but our attraction brought them to the ground
...
