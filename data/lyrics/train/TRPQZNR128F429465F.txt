Feel my little heart
It's broken just tonight
Every little teardrop
Baby, you hide

Understand the game
Queen of broken hearts
Oh, you win and lose
Now I tear apart

Oh, yeah, it's ecstasy next to me
Oh, baby, it's fantasy just with me
Come and hold my hand
Understand the name of the game

Too young, too young to get steady
Too young to fall in love
Too young, too young to get ready
Too young for that stuff
