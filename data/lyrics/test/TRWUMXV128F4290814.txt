I was standing all alone against the world outside
And you were searching for a place to hide

Lost and lonely now you've given me the will to survive
When we're hungry love will keep us alive

Don't you worry, sometimes you've just got to let it ride
The world is changing right before your eyes

Now I've found you, there's no more emptiness inside
