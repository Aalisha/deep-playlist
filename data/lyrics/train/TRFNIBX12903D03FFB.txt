Well, I wish I was in London
Or some other seaport town
I'd set my foot on a steamboat
And sail the ocean 'round

While sailin' around the ocean

Wherever she might be

Oh remember, oh dear Molly
When you gave me your right hand
You said if you were to marry
That I would be your man

Well, now you broke your promise
