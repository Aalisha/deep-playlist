I never thought I would return
To be consumed by you again
Think you're cured
You'd see it come
The folly of a monster love like you

Gray is good, the light is good
We went down to Hollywood
You only get one chance in Tinsel Town
I save the part, the sweetest part
Shook for you

Everything comes around
Bringing us back again
Here is when we start
And where we end
...
