Well I know, That It's sad.
But the World's, One way!
I'm really sorry that I woke you up,
But I know what is known to me.
If I'm Wrong, Let me know.
Do you think, I should go?
But before you give an answer,
Think of something you'd rather be.

All that I have,
26 dollars and the keys to a Cadillac
All that I know
Drive all night go anywhere you wanna go
All that I want, and all that I need
All I wanna know, is do you wanna come with me?
