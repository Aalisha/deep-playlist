I play out my role, why I've even been out walking,
they tell me that it helps, but i know when i'm beaten.

All those lonely films, and all those lonely parties,
but now the feeling is off screen,
and the tears are real, not acted anymore.

Oooh im all mixed up inside, I want to run but i cant hide,
however much we try, we cant escape the truth and the fact is,

dont matter what i do, dont matter what i do,
it dont matter what i do, it dont matter what i do,
it dont matter what i do, cos i end up hurting you.
