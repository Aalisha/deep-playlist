Tonight decide
To rise above yourself
Last chance, your choice
To rise above yourself
You're going out again
You're acting out again
You're passing out again
Don't waste your breath on me
I'm in control, I'm doing fine
(But I'm finding out you're going down)
Don't waste your time on me
This is my choice, This is my life
