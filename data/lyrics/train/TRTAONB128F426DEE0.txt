Those who told us that life is a triviality,
They are liars and couldn't care less about you and me.
Don't demand me to stay cause I'm totally free
And I'm gonna find shelter and tranquility.

May those people who blather he seized with remorse.
I am proud and I'm gonna sit up on the highest horse.
