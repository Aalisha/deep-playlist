When I was a child, I heard voices...
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices.
I learned the voices died with me

When I was a child I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flames
Something in it had a power,
Could barely tear my eyes away

All you have is your fire...
And the place you need to reach -
...
