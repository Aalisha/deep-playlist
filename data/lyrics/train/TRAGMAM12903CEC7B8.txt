You are married
I am buried
You've got children
I can barely take care of myself
You've been to London
You've been to Hollywood
You think it's cool, it's cool going there

I can deal with this
But I doubt that you feel OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, OK

You moved away from here
And nobody cared 'bout your stupid plans for the future
I felt sorry for you
