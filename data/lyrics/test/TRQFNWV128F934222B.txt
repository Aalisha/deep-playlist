You don’t have to be part of the problem
I just need a second chance
I just need a second chance
Instead of leaving me standing in sorrow
I know that you’ll understand
I hope then you’ll understand
I know that I was wrong
But just don’t walk away

Chorus:
Oh won’t you stay
I need you need you here
When you’re with me
All others disappear
