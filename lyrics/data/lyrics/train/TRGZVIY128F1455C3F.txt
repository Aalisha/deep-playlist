I Don't Care What You Talkin' 'Bout Baby
I Don't Care What You Say
Don't You Come Walkin'Beggin' Back Mama
I Don't Care Anyway
Time After Time I Gave You All
Of My Money
No Excuses To Make
Ain't No Mountain That ICan't Climb Baby
All Is Going My Way('Cause There's A Time When You're Right)(And You Know You Must Fight)Who's Laughing Baby, Don't You Know(And There's The Choice That We Make)(And This Choice You Will Take)Who's Laughin' Baby
So Just Leave Me Alone
Leave Me Alone(Leave Me Alone)(Leave Me Alone)Leave Me Alone(Leave Me Alone)(Leave Me Alone)(Leave Me Alone)Leave Me Alone - Stop It! Just Stop Doggin' Me Around(Just Stop Doggin' Me)There Was A Time I Used To
Say Girl I Need You
But Who Is Sorry Now
