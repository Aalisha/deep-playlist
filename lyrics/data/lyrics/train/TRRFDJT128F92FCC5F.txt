And they'll say, "It's a part of it,"
So they buy, and you sell your soul
Well my friend, the thought of it...
They'll sell your soul for a piece of gold

While they and their companions [led/left?]
Steady through the night
Not a [baby's momma?] [inaudible]
For [our baby's strife]

Chase dem
Run dem politicians
When I see [them and that gold?]
Chase dem
Run dem politician
When I see[them and that gold?]
Chase dem
Run dem politicians
When I see[them and that gold?]
Chase dem
Run dem fallitician
When I see them... yeah!

And they'll say, "It's a part of it,"
So they buy and you sell your soul
Well my friend, the thought of it...
Sell your soul for a piece of gold
...
