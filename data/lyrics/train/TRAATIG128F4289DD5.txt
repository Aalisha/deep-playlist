Today was a wonderful day, fantastic
No, of course, I'm being sarcastic
I spent most of it in pain
Taking my own name in vain
It's not easy being all-knowing and all-seeing

If everything around you
Disgusts or dumbfounds you
I'm losing my patience
With a few of my creations

The idiots in the village
That I made in my image
They're a big disappointment
They kill for enjoyment
I feel like shaking the Almighty Etch-a-Sketch

My name is God
