I see trouble coming,
Trying to change my ways.
Take a little piece of me,
And squeeze what blood remains.
Joke and jive, and fool you,
Slip that sugar past your nose.
Hope when all is said and done,
You'll slip on an overdose.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Run for your life.
Who is it that they're fooling?
Not this mothers son.
