What would I do sweet baby
Where would I go tell the lady
If I didn't have you baby
Right here standing by my side

How would I get by, oh baby
How I would I make it through the night, oh lady
This old world would conquer
All of my dreams

They say dreams don't always come true
But I'm here to tell you my dreams came true
The first day I laid eyes on you

So how would I get by baby
How would I make it through the night precious lady
