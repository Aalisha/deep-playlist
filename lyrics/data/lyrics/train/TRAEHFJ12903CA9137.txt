The strands in your eyes
that colour them wonderful
stop me and steal my breath
emeralds from mountains
that first touch the sky
never revealing their deaths
tell me that we belong together
dress it up, with the trappings of love
ill be captivated, ill hang from your lips
instead of shallowed heartache
from heartache that hangs from above

ill be your crying shoulder
ill be loves suicide
and ill be better when im older
ill be the greatest fan of your life
...
