Self destruct
We've lost all control
Self destruct
Defy all the trust you stole
Self destruct 
I think you sold us all
I feel your stranglehold

Self destruct
We've lost all control
Self destruct
Defy all the trust you stole
Self destruct 
I think you sold us all
I feel your stranglehold grow tighter with time
We stand in line to fall

Keep an eye on us, we surrender
Steal our thoughts so we don't think at all
A different view, a new offender
Monitor the world and watch us crawl

Now we're silent and in submission
Steal our thoughts so we don't think at all
Single file, we're in position
Push the button, we start our own downfall

Self destruct
We've lost all control
Self destruct
Defy all the trust you stole
Self destruct 
I think you sold us all
