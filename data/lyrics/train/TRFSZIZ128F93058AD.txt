Violence creates violence 
So the media like to say 
Stuffed with their non-gratitude 
They lock themselves away 

Sit at home and watch TV 
Safe in their private place 
And all the time they're wondering 
What's happened to the human race 

Try and hide all of their fears 
Try and hide all their tears 

Devestation's on the way 
Small price for them to pay 
For living in the world today 
...
