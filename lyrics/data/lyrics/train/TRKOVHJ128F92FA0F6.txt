Looked Like A Women

There was a girl uptown, she kept her lights down low.
She kept her breasts taped down, so they did not show.
She had a daytime job, she had a daytime name.
But her nightlife baby was a different game.
Never the kind to wear a thrift store dress, she did it better in a suit and vest.

She looked like a woman but dressed like a man. looked like a woman but dressed like a man. She looked like a woman but dressed like a man. Looked like a woman.

Well I was checking her out, (checking her out), I saw she had no purse.
