Up jumped Jack on the railroad track
Said I? ve got to get out of town
It? s been really nice knowing you
Hope to see you around

Oh the boy he couldn't boogie
Oh the boy couldn't kick a ball
But the boy he got hung up
Smooching in the stalls

You? ve got to give a little love
To those who love to live
...
