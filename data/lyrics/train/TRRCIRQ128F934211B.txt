Go

I belong to You, You belong to me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
I will walk with You, You will walk with me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go

Oh, would you sing it with me?

I belong to You, You belong to me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
I will walk with You, You will walk with me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
And I am Yours and You are mine, oh mine

You promised me You'd never leave
