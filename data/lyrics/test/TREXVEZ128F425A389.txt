Let's go across the tracks
Where pussy ain't no feline
Rev up my Chevy
I'm gonna pay to play

I'm gonna lickity-split I like that taste
I push ahead and I fall behind
Hav'n such a good, good time
I just wanna stay

Just got back from the best cathouse in town
And had the best piece of Mona Lisa I ever found
And I'm going back to the best cathouse in town
To get some more of that cheap little tramp right about now

Let's go to the house
Where business is a pleasure
Perversion is an aversion
...
