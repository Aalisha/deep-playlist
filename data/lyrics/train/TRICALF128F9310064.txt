Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
 Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
 Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
 Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it

 Swordfish hotkiss night
 Breathing to the beat
 Push it in the wind
 Calling all the life forms

 Swordfish hotkiss night
 Breathing to the beat
 Push it in the wind
 Calling all the life forms

 Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
 Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
 Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
 Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it

 Kings cross hotshot
 Jesus Christ on web blog 
 Cowboy in a cop shop
 Tiger in a drug store 

 Days go by days
 All we do is roll on 
	 Days show my ways
 When I when I when I when I

 H
otdog belt donut melt
 Magpie knelt by itself
 Monster goons magnet moves
 Diamonds in a harlot douche
