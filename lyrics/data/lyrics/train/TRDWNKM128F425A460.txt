You lie in gentle
Sleep beside me
I hear your warm
And rhythmic breathing

I take your hand
And hold it tightly
(Listen) can you not hear
Our young hearts beating

I kiss the sleep
From your eyes
Your smile is sweeter
Than the morning

And a-here it comes
Can't you feel it baby
Can't you feel it
Here it comes
Feel it, feel it
Fire, fire

Something's burning
Something's burning
Something's burning
...
