The first time you looked
At her curves you were hooked
And the glances you took, took hold of you
And demanded that you stay

And sunk in their teeth
Bit you hard and released
Such a charge that you need
Another touch, another taste, another fix

She just might get you lost
And she just might leave you torn
But she just might save your soul
If she gets you and she gets you any closer

And she leads you up
Points out skylines and stars
Steeplechases and bars and took your keys
And demanded that you stay

The city longs well for rooftops and invitations
...
