You are, you are, you are you
You are, you are, you are you
You are, you are, you are you
You are, you are, you are you

You are plain insane, inside you live tonight
Afraid the pain will give

Don't you want to feel death has done your part?
You chose not to feel, you won a lonely heart
The devil opens his eyes, he breathes right into your face
If you like the smell, you'll really like this place
You'll really like this place, you'll really like this place

You'll really like this place
Are you ready to shake?
Don't be afraid of the snake
