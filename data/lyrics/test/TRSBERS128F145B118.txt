1st Verse

How can we have peace in the Middle East
When there's none at home?
How can we have understanding in the land
When there's none in the woman and there's none in the man?

Refrain

How can we heal the wounds of the world
If we cannot heal our own?
And where does this peace on earth begin
If not in the home?
