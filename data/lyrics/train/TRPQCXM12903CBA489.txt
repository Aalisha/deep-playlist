She has a way that is beautiful to behold,
Movements of silence and calm,
A universe of life folded up inside her,
A symphony of strangeness and charm

Every now and them there's an ocean of silver,
Concealing herself as a stream,
Scars in her life that she once tried to hide,
Healing themselves as she breathes
...
