The morning paper
Look in the mirror
On your key chain
Or in the coffee spoon

On your shirt sleeve
In the flat-screen
In your mailbox
I'm Breathing over you

Come on baby, when will you see
That you and I were meant to be
And now I got my target on track
Baby you should know that I'm so good at that

Run to where you want, run to where you want
I am gonna find you
There aint no distance far enough
My love's gonna find you
Run to where you want, run to where you want
But may I remind you
There aint no engine fast enough
My love's gonna catch you
