She said "there's nothing you can say to me that hasn't been said
There's nothing you can do to me that hasn't been done inside my head, done inside my head"
"Well what else do you have up there that isn't tied down?
You make a lot of noise for a girl from south of town"

She's so calm, yet so confused
She don't know she's being used
She tries so hard, but it makes no difference
Cause biting the bullet is bad for business
