Step back gonna come at ya fast
I'm drivin' out of control
and gettin' ready to crash
won't stop shakin' up what I can

I serve it up in a shot
so suck it down like a man
so baby yes I know what I am
and no I don't give a damn
and you'll be lovin'

Somedays I'm a super bitch
up to my old tricks
but it won't last forever
next day I'm your super girl
out to save the world
and it keeps gettin' better

Kiss kiss gonna tell you right now
I'll make it sweet on the lips as it
can knock you out
shut up I don't care what you say
...
