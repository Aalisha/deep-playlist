I miss my head
I miss my heart
I miss my lungs
Be what you want to be
Watch what you want to see
Killed for fun

Down a hole, up a rope
Down some pills, up some hope
This karma machine only takes quarters
New age soldier, new age soldier

Everybody's all right
Everything is automatic
And everybody's all right
And everything is skin deep

And everybody's all right
And everything is automatic
And everybody's all right
And everything is skin deep, me
...
