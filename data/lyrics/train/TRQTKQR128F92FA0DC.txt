(in the ghetto)
(seems like, the whole world)
(the ghetto)

A place where Jake don't feel safe
Cause the thugs got the block locked down
There's no escape in the (ghetto)
There's petty hustlers, they flip fiends and uh
Our holiday's every first and fifteenth
It's the (ghetto)
A place where some people can't shine for themselves
So when they rob you they just crying for help
And it seems like we make the whole world go round
And everybody wanna be down
Copy the sounds of the (ghetto)

Boys and girls grow up fast
Chicken-heads run the streets as soon as they eggs hatch
Players posted up, perking perpendicular
Searching for a way but all they have is the (ghetto)
They settle for the street cred
Instead of trying to teach heads
The best way to walk the narrow path in the (ghetto)
It's sad cause we wanna bust shots
Getting props for licking the block hot
You're messing up the (ghetto)
It's time to make a change for the better
By starting with ourselves
