And in the end, all our troubles vanish, melt away
(Play â€“ like a gold bell in the evening wind)
And in the end, all the time we've spent we'll save...
(And in the end, after all is said and done)
Time is only dust, when it's done we will fly...
Like a tea-tray in the sky
So don't be scared of a lobster or molluscs
...
