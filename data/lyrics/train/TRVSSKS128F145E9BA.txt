There's another reflection involved up in my mind
A wholeness that has just been lost
Striving hard for perfection but still nothing to find
Some value with a cheaper cost
And as I reach out to hear you the sound is so muffled
It makes a lesser man of me
So the only thing left to bring up to date is

You suck!
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me
Watch me fall while I go down
I'm taking all you bastards to the ground with me then I'll frown
On your fucking whole life
The systematic hype still means a bit much to me

I'm at the point of retraction and still slipping further
This place is getting worse for me
There's such a lack of direction and models to live by
