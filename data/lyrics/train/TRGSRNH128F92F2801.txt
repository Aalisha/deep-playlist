Just for that moment time stood still.
Nothing mattered but the thrill of things to come,
And never knowin' where you're goin'.
A little nervous and out of practice,
Sweaty palms and an awkward silience.
You pulled me closer for a kiss; I'm so scared to feel like, feel like this.
Can't stop my hands from shakin'.
(Can't stop my hands from shakin')

I won't blink cause I might miss,
And I've waited way too long for this.
The perfect words at the perfect time.
The perfect song with the perfect rhyme,
Compose the soundtrack to our night.
Are you listening?

Tonight the world will wait for us to say it's ok to move again.
The stars will have to find another sky to shed some light,
