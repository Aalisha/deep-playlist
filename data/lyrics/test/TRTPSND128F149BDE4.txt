Down to the earth
I fell with dripping wings
Heavy things won't fly
And the sky might catch on fire
And burn the axis of the world that's why
I prefer a sunless sky
To the glittering and stinging in my eyes

I feel so light
This is all I wanna feel tonight
I feel so light
Tonight and the rest of my life
Tonight and the rest of my life
