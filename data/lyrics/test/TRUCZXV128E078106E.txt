My baby drives a car
(Hey!)
He calls me when he wants
(Hey!)
I don a pair of zip-up boots (uh huh huh)
I go and shake my hair out loose (uh huh huh)
I never take my eyes off you
Oh no no, oh no no
No I don't think so

Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
This won't last for long, not forever
And the champagne makes it taste so much better better
Some girls always get what they wanna wanna
All I seem to get is the other other
Dreams of number one last forever
It's the only way to make you feel better

Footloose and fancy-free
(Hey! Oh)
My baby waits for me
(Hey! Oh oh oh)
He likes to put his own records on (uh huh huh)
