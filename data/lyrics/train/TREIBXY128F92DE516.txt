(Bobo)
Once again
We're back
It's the big bad Cypress Hill
You know what time it is

(Beat fades in)
(5x) Whoop
Legalize it,
Cypress Hill will advertise it
Legalize it, (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Cypress Hill advertise it
advertise it, advertise it

(Chorus: B Real and Sen Dog)
Once Upon,
(B-Real singing)
Bugaboo L.I.F.E (Now Here it is )
Why, Why, Why (Bo Bo Bo Bo)
Cypress is still here
We're of those glad MCees
Still Puffin Weed, Weed
Why Diddely Why
Why, Why, Why

(B Real)
