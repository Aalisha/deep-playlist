Yeah, he was sitting by me at the beach front bar
He seemed pretty tore up so I bought him a beer
And we lit up a couple of Cuban cigars

Well, a couple beers in we was gettin' profound
He said, "A guy like me likes the simple things
That I can wrap my head around"
I didn't know where he was going but I began to understand
When he stood up on his stool like a fool and started hollerin' at the band

So play me something about drinkin', one about cheatin'
A few about losin', lyin' and leavin'
Something where somebody did somebody wrong
And play it all night long but don't play me no love songs
...
