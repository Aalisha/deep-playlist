You delight yourself in a paranoid state of mind
A bunch of mischief talking shit, it's what you're all about
You celebrate yourself in filth and self-indulgence
As you believe you own the world

Fuck you!

You blame us all to never trust your lies (trust your lies)
Your lame words won't ever justify wasting our precious time

You want it all, could kill for five seconds of fame
