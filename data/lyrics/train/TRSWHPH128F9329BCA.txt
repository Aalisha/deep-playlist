Thousand rivers from the same tear
Protects me keeps me safe
Wheel of fortune shapes the landscape
Record memories on tape

still the thought of happiness haunts me
Like a lost soul in a house
Maybe one day it will catch me
And give me the skill to breathe

sequensce my thoughts
'cause nothing seems real
Keep my heart in steady beat as I download the end

do you believe in anything
The pieces play a game
Do you believe anything is real
Struggle to harvest the seed that breeds shame
The pieces play a game
Do you believe anything is real...
