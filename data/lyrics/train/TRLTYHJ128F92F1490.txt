This story has just begun
Only ten pages in
and your assumption has won
All the skeptics can place their bets
It doesn't mean we're done
You know we've heard it before
It won't make us stop
but just want it more
All the critics laid down their bets
odds are two to one

And we've made this dream
turn into a reality
four chords, six strings
This is what we want our lives to be
We're all in
We're all in
