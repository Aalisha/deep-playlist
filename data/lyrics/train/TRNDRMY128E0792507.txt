It doesn't matter what you need, just where you go to get it
It doesn't matter what you've done, there's no need to regret it
If you're a loser just like me then life hasn't been easy
Maybe you were waiting for the wake up call
And when it came your line was busy

I know it's happened to me, and it will happen again
If I don't slow down and listen

It's undeniable, we're so much smaller than we think we are
It's undeniable, we're so much smaller than we think we are
