Rudy's on a train to nowhere, halfway down the line
He don't wanna get there, but he needs time
He ain't sophisticated, nor well-educated
After all the hours he's wasted, still he needs time.
He needs time – he needs time for livin',
He needs time – for someone just to see him.
He ain't had no lovin'
For no reason nor rhyme
And the whole world's above him.
Well it's not as though he's fat –
No there's more to it than that –
See he tries to play it cool –
Wouldn't be nobody's fool.
