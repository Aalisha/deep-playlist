You told me you were leaving
With a note pinned to my bookcase
You said you could not bring yourself
To tell me to my face
Too many cold summers have passed
Since we were last in love
And i’ve laboured too long in the rain for too little
You need more now than i can give
More than i can show for the time i’ve spent
With my brothers-in-arms but trouble and pain
You said you left your share of the rent
Between victor hugo and maynard keynes

I just miss you
