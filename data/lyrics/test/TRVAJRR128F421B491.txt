Inside my camera is watching
Memorizing my view of earth
And stained is the eye
Ambitions not where they should be
Out of focus - too much fantasy
Within hides the dreamer

From the north to the desert sand
Chaos disturbed the land
And revelation was left behind us
Lost without a cry
A silent lullaby
And I'm waiting - waiting for the healer

I see with bleeding eyes
I carry the world on my shoulders
The load is heavy
And it's time for an awakening
The road is long - I've been told
But I think it's short
Time goes by - and I wonder how the world is taught

From the streets of Babylon
...
