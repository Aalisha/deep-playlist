This little town hasn't changed so much, not since the time of night
When we would lie out and talk like we couldn't be touched
Then you'd go away when the morning was light
But sure enough well we had to grow up
And there's nothing like a full time job to put out your fire
We were young and wasn't in love but maybe we were happy
Getting carried away
