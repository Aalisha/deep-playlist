Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh
Rollin' down the Eastern seaboard
I got my diesel wound up
And she's a-runnin' like never before
There's a speed zone ahead alright
But I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road
And I'm gonna make it home tonight

I got ten forward gears
And a George Overdrive
I'm takin' little white pills
And my eyes are opened wide
I just passed a Jimmy and White
I been passin' everythin' in sight
Six days on the road
