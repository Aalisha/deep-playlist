I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
When I asked him, where are you going?
This he told me
I'm going down to Yasgur's farm
Think I'll join a rock and roll band
I'll camp out on the land
I'll try and set my soul free

We are stardust, we are golden
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden

Then can I walk beside you
I have come here to lose the smog
...
