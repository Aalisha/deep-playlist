I don't believe in superstars, organic food and foreign cars.
I don't believe the price of gold, the certainty of growing old.
That right is right and left is wrong.
That north and south can't get along.
That east is east and west is west and being first is always best.
But, I believe in love. I believe in babies. I believe in mom and dad and I believe in you.
Well I don't believe that heaven waits for only those who congregate.
