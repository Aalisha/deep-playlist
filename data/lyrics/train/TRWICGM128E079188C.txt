I have a story, a bitter anthem for everyone to hear
About this kid who just don't like me and that's a solid fact
They say he's hunting me and as you see I'm all swelled up with fear
Cause I can't get him off my back

If you see Jordan
If you see Jordan
He makes me sick
He makes me sick
High school's over
High school's over
And you still won't quit

You tried to fight me down at Tyler's Beach
And man I think that's great
You nearly cried and said to yell at you like I do at all the girls
