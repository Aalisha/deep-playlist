Monday morning and I find myself missing you
I'm thinking of you and your new lover
playing it cool, even though you tore my heart apart
I start my day just like any other day
and when the phone rings on the other end you say
now I realize that I made the wrong move
to take you back in my life girl I can't see it coming through

Remembering times we both knew we would regret
how we feel is not the issue girl
