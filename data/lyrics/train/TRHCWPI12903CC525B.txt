Baby when we break up from a quarrel or a fight
I can't wait to have you back and hold you, oh, so tight
Tell me why, I wanna know, tell me why, is it so
That the best part of breaking up is when you're making up
Best part of breaking up is when you're making up
But after breaking up be sure you're making up with me

Everytime you leave I get those teardrops in my eyes
But they seem to go away when you apologize
Tell me why, I want to know, tell me why, is it so
That the best part of breaking up is when you're making up
...
