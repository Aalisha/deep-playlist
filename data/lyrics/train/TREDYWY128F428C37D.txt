Stay, stay, stay stay by me now don´t walk away.
Whoo.
Stay, stay, stay stay by me now don´t walk away.

Lonelyness can kill a guy, baby please don´t say goodbye.
Without you girl I couldn´t live.
Stay by me couse i´ve got so much more to give.
Yeah!

Come on and
Stay, stay, stay stay by me now don´t walk away.
Stay, stay, stay stay by me now don´t walk away.
