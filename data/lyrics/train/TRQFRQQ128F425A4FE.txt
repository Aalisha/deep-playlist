Turn the music way down low,
Let me see you in the glow.
In the fire light you are shining...
Though it's much too soon to know,
If this love I feel will grow.
Let's take tonight to start out finding...

'Cause the way I feel tonight,
Everything will be alright.
I will keep your candle burning.
Oh, yes, the way I feel tonight
