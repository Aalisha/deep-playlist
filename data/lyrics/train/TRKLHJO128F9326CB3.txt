You got to have rock love within your heart
You got to have rock love before you start
So when temptation tries to move your soul
The rocks of love wont let you roll
When I
And clouds of doubt begin to form
Rock love will weather the storm
You got to have rock love to call your own
It's got to be rock love as all of us know
...
