Um I don't wanna do wrong
But you've been gone baby so long
And I hope I hope you'll understand
That it's really, it's really oh yes it is
It's out of my hands but (I don't wanna do wrong)
I don't wanna do wrong
(But it's been so long) it's been so long
(I just can't help myself) no
(No, no, no) um

since you been away
I been prayin' everyday
For God to make me strong till ya get back home
No, no, no, no I don't wanna do it
