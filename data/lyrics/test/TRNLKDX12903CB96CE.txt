Scarecrows and devils are the only thing out this way 
What that says about me, it's probably true 
I've been carrying all these words around 
For too long and now it's time to lay them down 
I'm here for forgiveness I need it from you 

The road was long and it took so much time 
But I learned a lot from my mistakes 
I made some wrong turns that I'm not proud of 
They made me who I am today 
I just got a little lost along the way
