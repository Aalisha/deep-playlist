I've had a lot of big dreams
I've made a lot of bad moves
I know you could walk away
But you never do

I've met a lot of cold hearts
I've learned to smile and deceive
I know I'm hard to be around
But you never leave

I'm not easy to understand
But you hold out your hand

And you say you love me
You always treat me
The best that you can
...
