And so with the explorers on my heels
I started t'wheel
Stepped aside stone walls,
I was sick of it all
And so I set my sail
On your cocktails and your warm shawl
Up where
There's an Everlasting Arm
Sends us out alone,
Moves us out of harm
Ever-reaching always sweeping...

And though I struggled t'take my place
...
