I'm finally mad
Like a rush of blood to my weary head
No longer sad
The emotional tide has turned and I see red

Heard you clap your hands
'Cause I'm joyfully and most bitter mad
I hope your heart is glad
Oh sweet relief that you've always longed to have

'Cause that's what you wanted
That's what you wanted
All along
That's what you wanted
That's what you wanted
All along
