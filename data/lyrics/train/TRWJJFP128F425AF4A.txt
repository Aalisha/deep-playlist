He's got the smile, swimming grace across his face
And it's been a while since I saw him last, he left so fast
And I'd like to try to share a kiss or two with you
And I'd love to touch you, so many things that we can do

So if you do feel the way that I feel about you
Come on and share this crush with me
Oh Baby, this love endeavor don't have to last forever
Come on and share whatever you want with me

He came when I wanted one to call all mine
And to my eye, he's one of such a lovely kind
I could spend my time trying to sort out your feelings
But it's not my style anymore so tell me darling
