Been waiting for so long
And I never even thought about giving up
And I could see something
I live on and I could feel something
I live on and now those scorching eyes are burning into mine

Don’t make a sound, just curl up next to me
And we can breathe the same air and think our thoughts out loud
Don’t say a thing, just lay here next to me
And we can breathe the same air and think our thoughts out loud

I wanna say so many things
