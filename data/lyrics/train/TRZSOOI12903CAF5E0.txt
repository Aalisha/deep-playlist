If I can only, make you see
That you were only, meant for me, now
Our love will be free
And I'll be your destiny
destiny, destiny, right, now, now, now, babe

If I can make you only understand
Treat me right and love me
Then I will be your man
Your one and only man

These are the words
That I have to say
Live by them each and every day, now
And as the time pass
I know our love will last, our love will last, our love will last
...
