My imagination wants to see
The vivid colours of reality
There's a place out there beyond my grasp
A revolution in a looking glass
I've got to get this problem off my chest
I'm sick and tired of being second best
I'll rearrange my credibility
A fundraiser for a restless sea

Don't ever doubt me
What's come over you?
Won't you forgive me?
What are you gonna do?
Don't ever doubt me
What's come over you?
Won't you forgive me?
What are you gonna do?
What will you do?

I can't contain what's inside my head
I'm using words that I must have read
Do you remember the time we spent?
It seems that we were the main event
Have you a reason to behave like this?
Maybe you need a psychoanalyst
