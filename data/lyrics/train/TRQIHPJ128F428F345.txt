Is it me or is it you
Tell me what am I to do?
I've got my back up against the wall
Your silly smile is at my face again

Was I wrong or was I right?
I guess I should have taken my own advice
I thought we'd talk this out before
But we keep opening the same old doors

And so you've got me where you want
I feel you've got me on my knees
Yes, you have me bleeding
And so you've got me once again
I feel you've got me near the end
Yes, you have me bleeding

And so you've got me where you want
I feel you've got me on my knees
Yes, you have me bleeding
