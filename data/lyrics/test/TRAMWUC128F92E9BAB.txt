All I hear is static when you talk
All I hear is static when you talk
No, you don't make any sense
It's all noise to me

All I hear is static when you talk
All I hear is static when you talk
No, you don't make any sense
It's all noise to me

All I hear is static
'Cause my brain's on automatic
My emotions are on cruise control

My head has fucking had it
With you talking so erratic
...
