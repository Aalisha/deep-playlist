Yeah, yeah

Another bird has grown
Another part of all of us is gone
Another right has been wronged
Still we go on and on

Until the words for each of us are all to real
Still I am not able to feel, what you feel
And I cannot say how long
It will take for you to heal

But I believe you will
And someday your broken hard will mend
I know it will
And you will find your smile again
...
