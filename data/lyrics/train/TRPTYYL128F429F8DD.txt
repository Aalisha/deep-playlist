Got the telephone in my hand
Call up tonight
Planned every word I'll say
I'm gonnna do it right
Maybe I'll wait a little longer
Maybe I'm not ready yet
Where did I put that number?
How could I ever, ever forget?

I try but I hang up every time
To call you girl and make you mine
Pick it up I'll have it made
Call you now, I won't be afraid
