She can taste the sorrow
And she can't get enough
And she's too scared to swallow
If she might fall in love
And if we look to tomorrow
And we know that these kids will follow
Where we go and these steps are hollow

She's gonna haunt your home and break your bones
Never gonna leave your soul alone
Because the things you've got will leave you all
On your own, own
She's gonna haunt your home
And break your bones
Because the things you've got will leave you all
On your own
