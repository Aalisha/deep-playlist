I've got it all to myself now
Crack the window just a hair
Dark and close, the way I like it
Black tobacco chokes the air
I keep to myself, I lack the language
I measure out my life with coffee grounds
The trees are the color of ashes
In Charlemagne's home town

I said I didn't fear the distance
As if I'd ever been that tough
I can hear your voice across the water
But that's nowhere near enough
