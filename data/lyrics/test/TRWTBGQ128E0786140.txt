Love, two pages in a book
So close it only took
A moment to know
That our love would grow together

And from the time I saw your face
The lovely smile you made
The feeling of doubt I had about
Tomorrow

Love at first sight, so right
In every way
Love at first sight, so tight
Ever since that day
Our love is here to stay
...
