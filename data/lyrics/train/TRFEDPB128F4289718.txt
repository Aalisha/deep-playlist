You can be difficult
I can be mean
We can be lovebirds
Or sting like bees
Walking a wire
In danger of falling from grace

A minute of pleasure
An hour of pain
You reel me back in
With your physical thing
Cause sometimes you're worth
All of the things that I hate

Oh, should I let go?
My heart says yes but my head says no

So I'm black and I'm blue
And I act like a fool
Cause you made me crazy
And I'm up and I'm down
Turning into the clown
That you made me
Maybe that's what you're waiting for
You make me want you more
...
