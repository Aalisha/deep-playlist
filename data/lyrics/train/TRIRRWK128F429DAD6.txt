Where were you, when I said I loved you
And where were you when I cried at Night
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinking of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke, I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you, I was sad and lonely
I remember when I walked out, I remember when I screamed I hated you
But some how deep inside I deep inside still lovin' you

Sad and lonely

No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love, I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know, where I would go, where I would be
...
