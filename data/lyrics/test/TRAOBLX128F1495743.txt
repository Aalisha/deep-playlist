If you stay, stay darline,
Stay in my corner.
You'll make me ohh so proud, just stay.
To the world, i cry i cry how i love you, honey i love you
I really do.
Please, stay.

And I will never, never, never let you down, just stay.
Cause i will need you always around to tell me you love me.
Why don't you say that you do.
