Since I was 3 I had ADHD,
got in trouble constantly, said, "Just gotta be me!"
Nineteen years later I've got this piece of paper
It says "congrats, you're broke English major"
I still live with mom and dad and it's kind of sad
when this Stanford grad brings ladies to his pad,
"What up girl?"
"Aren't you that rapper with that song about Hot Topic?"
Maybe Bukowski was right about women? "ha ha, stop it!"
This is an old-school jam, I'm dropping knowledge like Plato
while most rappers track it backwards and stay flat like Play Dough
but I'm a Minor Threat, I flip scripts so they know
You can't taze me bro ("Don't taze me bro!")
Not to conceal, keep it surreal,
piss off the British press when I'm like, "Who's John Peel?"
The NME says, "Lars is well rubbish,
his single is bollocks," but I know that they love this!

chorus
I'm MC Lars (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real)
It's my self-referential introduction song
TPFR (true player for real)

I'm MC Lars (true player for real!)
TPFR (true player for real!)
The name's MC Lars now you know the deal
(true player for real)
