If euro replaces the pound
It's still likely to be shiny and round
Rich may switch the way they feel rich
but not the man who's alive
or the man who has drowned
Keeping pound only makes sense

if you're worth more than 99 pence Those who have a lot and those who have not
remain francs marks pesetas or cents

If money is the root of all evil
what does that make lover of pound
