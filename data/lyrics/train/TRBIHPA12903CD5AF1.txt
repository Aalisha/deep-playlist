When all the old consoling places
Lose their charm and change their faces
The world becomes too cruel to bear
And something in you starts to tear

When nothing seems to be quite worth it
And sleep becomes the only sure thing
I'm here to help you out of it
Come and see me for a lift

We're all close to the end, don't you need a friend?
Honor your allegiances
Everyone is drowning in sand, couldn't you use a hand?
Please don't make a guess

When changes make the world a stranger
No one calls and your life's in danger
If the money's gone without a trace
...
