Upon the storm that gathers here, the torment reigns like fire on my soul.
Yet I'd cross this ocean with both eyes open wide,
And dream of the day that I set free my sorrows into your world.
And when your heart ceases to shine, I'll show you illumination;
Divide the distance between I and I to regain all the strength I'd lost.
What she it's life for you and I, could endure a lifetime in our minds and in our veins.
Though the moments slowly pass that burn my soul,
I'd spend a lifetime letting go and what will remain in it's place is the thought,
That I gave the world to itself to destroy.
Upon the storm that's gathering, rides a lifeless burning god like me
