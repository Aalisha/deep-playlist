'Now listen'
(Mos)
.doin this song for you.
all my little brothers. out in the street.
strugglin to survive. keep your eyes on the prize, you know

(Kweli)
Yeah, the revolution will not be televised
Or broadcast live on the net
My man Mos said it's personal. knamsayin?
It's gotta start from right up in here, you know

(Mos & Kweli)
You can't stop, you know (x3)
You can't stop when we rep

(Kweli)
We rep the ain't-gots
Ain't nobody can't start no party like us, we crush the faint hearts
From Hallsey to St. Mark's, walk in the main blocks
Painted with blood that's still hot, so deep it stain socks
The pain spark frustration, situations lead to hatin
Some deal with drug distribution, others walk the plantation
Some know the code a' the streets, some got a college education
Come down on the weekend, and peep the conversation

(Mos)
Yo
On the corner, units stormed out
Ghetto lookin bombed out
Police waited to roll, for those who walk the wrong route
Shorties goin all out, they got they swords drawn out
...
