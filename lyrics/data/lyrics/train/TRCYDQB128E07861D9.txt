Don't you know, don't you know
See this is worldwide baby
That it's wrong Germany, Italy, France, Japan
To take what is given
Many foreign lands
Talkin' 'bout Queens
(Ha)
I'm talkin' 'bout, Brooklyn

I'm talkin' 'bout, uptown
I'm talkin' 'bout, downtown
Oh y'all with this too Jerz
The girl like, strong Isle they wild
The girl like, Connecticut
Yo they get them, they need to get more
Shutouts up there, word up
To take what is given
(Ha)

Breaker breaker one nine, I had a rendezvous
Pop vintage wine with this dime, hot as a barbecue
(Ha)
She was young, too wild without a curfew
(Ha)
Smile I hurt you, had me groin' berserk too
I'm guaranteein' she'll be leanin' in the coupe
Fiend in' for your loot, little demon schemin' for tiffany hoops
(Ha)
Her right there, Dominicans is doin' her hair
The jewels and gear, it's all there, fully equipped

Body sick, she never played fair yeah
(Ha)
Far from classy, walk real nasty
Talk real sassy, why you frontin'? Come smash me
I can't do it baby girl, your man might blast me for
(Ha)
I can't die for American pie
Hypnotized cause somebody combined thighs and lies, but it's
(Ha)
No surprise, your pipe will rise
Don't bounce with her, puff a ounce with her, not wise, not with
(Fan ha)

Papi chill, get sloppy, get killed by
(Ha)
Blood streams the guillotine f'real yeah
(Fa ha)
Pop bottles with hot models and rock throttles
I guess your motto is I'm a desperado
Leave alone, end up like caste llano
 (Ha)
Believe me, she flap her gums like Sammy Gravano
It's easy, child barely an Italiano
But don't do it, she'll have your eight by ten on every channel
(Ha)

No honey can set your body on fire like
(Ha)
Make you wanna get higher and higher with
(Ha)
Put your murder game down so you can buy it for
(Ha)
Street dreams, you goin' hustle and retire with
(Ha)
