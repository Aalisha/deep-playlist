Written by Tommy Shaw, Jack Blades, Ted Nugent

Mister please
Won't yo tell me I'm alright
I'm so lonely
I been thinking I could die
I got me a woman
She bled her soul
All over me
I think she's crazy
What you gonna do with me
Brother brother
Can't you hear them mission bells
Calling out
All them sinners bound for hell
Ain't no stranger
Been down that road before
So brother brother
Won't you tell me I'm alright
I'm alright
