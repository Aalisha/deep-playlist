Written by - Steve Bogard & Rick Giles

1986 Harley
Blowing smoke and sucking oil
My daddy said, 'Buy it and you're crazy boy'
You can't tell me nothin'

It took me a year to fix it up
And one day to lay her down
I got a little hitch in my get-along now
You can't tell me nothin'

Chorus:
Talk is cheap and free advice
Is worth the price you pay
