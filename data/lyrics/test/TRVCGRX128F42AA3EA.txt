Love is a funny thing
Whenever I give it, it comes back to me
And it's wonderful to be
Giving with my whole heart
As my heart receives
Your love
Oh, ain't it nice tonight we got each other?
And I am right beside you
More than just a partner or a lover
I'm your friend
When you love someone
Your heartbeat beats so loud
When you love someone
Your feet can't feel the ground
Shining stars all seem
To congregate around your face
...
