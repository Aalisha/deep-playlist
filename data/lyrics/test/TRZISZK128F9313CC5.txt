theres someone in heaven to talk with today
someone that know just the right thing to say
you lived a full life, you fought the good fight
theres someone in heaven to talk with tonight

he'll look the same then will so will
just as you did when your marriage was new
you'll roll over laughing bout a silly ol fight
