Oh how you dance
I stare entranced
Is there a chance
That you would catch my glance

Oh how you dance
I stare entranced
Is there a chance
That you would catch my glance

Hey baby, please don't stop
You move, you move me so
Let the music flow

Hey baby, just don't stop
I'm your captive on the dance floor
I want to see much more

I can't keep up with you
