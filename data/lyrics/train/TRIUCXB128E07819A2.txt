I can't stand by, see you destroyed
I can't be here and watch you burning
you lie for a moment, you lie as a decoy
Does it matter if I give in easy
So why is it so hard to get by?

And I said
We so down
But it's now or never, baby
We don't mind
If this don't last forever
See the light
But it won't last forever
...
