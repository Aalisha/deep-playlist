[Chorus: Lil' Wyte]

Getcha dawgs off me move bitch, Getcha dawgs off me move bitch
Getcha dawgs off me move bitch, Getcha dawgs off me move bitch
Getcha dawgs off me move bitch, Getcha dawgs off me move bitch

[Lil' Wyte]
This Is a lyrical IndenTION, rollin wit some big GUNS
Mystical attenTION, sudden comprehenSION
Rollin wit a fine ho, don't hate 'cause she mine ho
All you cheesy chicken heads can catch up wit yo kind ho
I can make a hit yo, do you really want it no
I'm gonna be up in yo head till I make you sick whoa
I represent in the bay, could give a fuck what you say
All the minors wishin to be made 'cause they to young to play
I can break yo bone oww, I can pull a? bloaw
I can have you screamin telling me when you gonna come now
This will make your heart stop, have you reaching for your glock
This series countinues as I got plenty mo in my stock
I'm crunker than the club how? 5th of palmason? Wow
