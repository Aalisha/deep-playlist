A pictures worth a thousand words
But not worth the words I need to hear
I miss you so much that it hurts
And tonight, I wish you were here with me
So I could make you see
The stars, they lay across the sky so perfectly
And they remind me of
All the times, when we used to sit underneath them, those summer nights
And fall in love
