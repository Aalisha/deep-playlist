All my homies drinkin' liquor, tears in everybody's eyez
Niggaz cry to mourn a homie’s homicide
But I can't cry instead I'm just a shoulda
Damn, why'd they take another soldier?

I load my clip before my eyez blurry
Don't worry I'll get them suckas back
Before your buried, shit, retaliate and pull a 187
The real niggaz get to go to heaven

How long will they mourn me? Bury me a motherfucking G
Bitch, don't wanna die then don't fuck wit me
It’s kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homie's lying dead on the pavement twisted

Ya'll don't hear me though, I'm trying hard to make ammends
When I'm losing all my mothafucking friends
Damn, they shoulda shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the mothafucking storm

How long will they mourn me?
(I wish it woulda been another)
How long will they mourn me?
(How long will they mourn my brotha)

How long will they mourn me?
(I wish it woulda been another)
How long will they mourn me?
