[chorus]
The game owe me
Game owe me
The game owe me
Game owe me
The game owe me
Game owe me
The game owe me
Game owe me
The game owe me
Game owe me
The game owe me
Game owe me
The game owe me
Game owe me
The game owe me

About 4 o 5 years ago
I made a promise 2 my momma that I would neva sell no mo dope
And tha world so cold
Where tha real die young
And the hate grow old
But they all die slow
I wonder how it get so close and its hard 2 focus when ya got bout 4 or 5 hoes
Bout 6 7 pounds of tha dro
Faybo unleashed a roll at tha do
Tha game old
Speakin of tha game no smoke
I always keep 44
They don't know tha life I know
From tha dro smoke
New po'smoke
Maybe no smoke
...
