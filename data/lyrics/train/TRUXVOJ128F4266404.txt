Living hard was easy when I was young and bullet proof
I had no change to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had bloodshot eyes at 25, or was it 26?

It didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth having I'd just lose anyway
Friends worried about me and they asked if I was sick
Thought I would die at 25, or was it 26?

Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melting into memories like somebody else's life
