I'm alone
yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
and the cryin' that I do is for you
I want your love
Let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough
I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough
I've suffered and I've seen the light

Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Don't know what I'm gonna do

about this feeling inside
...
