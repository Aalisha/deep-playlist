Seven years with local hope
They take it all, don't stop don't gloat
Try to reconsider fees
Talk to him, it's all to please
Sensing heat, the fire hits
We don't have the strength left
What they made is coming down
This is in the smallest town

Because you feel
Half as real
Like most people
Personalities they steal

Rough and old, it's wearing thin
Loose thread bearing skin
