Now I'm not like this
I'm really kinda shy
But I get this feelin whenever you walk by
I dont wanna doubt you
I wanna make you high
If you could see a way to me
C'mon and let me try

Chorus:
Let me take you home tonight
Mama now it's alright
Let me take you home tonight
I'll show you sweet delight

You must understand this
I've watched you for so long
That I feel I've know you
I know it can't be wrong
If we just get together
I want to make you see
I'm dreamin of your sweet love tonight
