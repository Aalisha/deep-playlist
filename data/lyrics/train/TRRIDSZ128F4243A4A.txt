I used to think that I was never good enough to cut it
I bought the lines that they were selling time after time
But when You opened up my mind and I refused to shut it
You brought me to a place where I could leave it all behind

Good-bye to my old life
I don't listen to those lies anymore
You've given me new life
Loving You is what I was made for
