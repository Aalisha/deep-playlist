Verse 1:
I cannot express to You
What this means to me
That You would leave Your throne above the clouds
To come and talk to me
So much has been going on
That I don't understand
But when the weight seems heavy
I listen closely

Chorus:
I hear You say
I'll fight your battles
I hear You say
You are not alone
...
