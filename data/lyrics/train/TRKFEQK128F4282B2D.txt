Edge of patience, let the anger flow, don't try to talk to me, I will abuse your soul.
You got away by your sweet innocence, but things you said don't mean shit to me or anyone else...
So you cut my arms, you slit my throat, can't run away. You paralyzed my legs, made me your slave...
Mentally murdered the ruins that were left in me and my sense of goodness, now go and disappear.
