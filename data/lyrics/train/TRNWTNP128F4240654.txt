On the heels of the sons of hell
The viper defines it's path
How many times have you sworn to God
That you would forget your past?

You're spreading lies and taking lives
He stands beside and laughs
Well this son of hell won't last

Your fortress will fall
History can't be undone but it can be erased
Your fortress will fall
History can't be undone but it can be erased
