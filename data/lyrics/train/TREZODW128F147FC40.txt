All my lifetime I've done wrong
Never thinking I belonged
And my problems stay with me
Cause my thoughts lie with she
She was my girlfriend though I was mean
Always there in my hour of need
I took for granted her gentleness
And have to live without her sweet caress

And as I light me a cigarette
My heart is falling in my breast
...
