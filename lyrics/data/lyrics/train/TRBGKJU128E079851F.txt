Kristofferson:
Sherry was a waitress,
At the only joint in town.
She had a reputation,
As a girl who'd been around.
Down Main Street after midnight,
With a brand new pack of cigs.

All 4:
The road goes on forever
And the party never ends

And one day he got caught.
But he was back in business,
When they set him free again.
All 4:
The road goes on forever.
And the party never ends.
