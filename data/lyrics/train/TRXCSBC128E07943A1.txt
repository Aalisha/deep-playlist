laughing

chanting

You're my food
You're my water
You've got to be the devil's daughter
Can't get near
Can't get far
You've got the power
But know you are

She's radioactive (radioactive)
She's very selective (radioactive)
She's what I need
She's so pretty indeed
She wants it all the time

And I'm crazy
Kinda hazy
