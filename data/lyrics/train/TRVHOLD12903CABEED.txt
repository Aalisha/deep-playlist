She'll want your full attention
Looks in the window with a little smile
And checks her makeup for a little while

Decides that on reflection
A cash injection is what she needs more
I have to tell you that she ain't no whore
When love is war you need all of your weapons in the fight

'Cause a girl like you
Well, you don't understand
