This following program is dedicated to the city and people of San Francisco
Who may not know it but they are beautiful
And so is their city this is a very personal song
So if the viewer cannot understand it

Particularly those of you who are European residents
Save up all your brand and fly trans love airways to San Francisco U.S.A.
Then maybe you'll understand the song, it will be worth it
If not for the sake of this song but for the sake of your own peace of mind

Strobe lights beam creates dreams
...
