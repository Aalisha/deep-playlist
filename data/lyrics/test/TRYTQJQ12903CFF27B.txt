One small blue planet, so many shores
This land is mine, that land is yours
Your way is righteous, our way is wrong
That's been the sad and painful story all along

I recall like yeasterday the horror of it all
One image burned the screen in every home and hall
We watched in shock and awe as flesh and faith collide
Changed the world forever shadows hide now in our minds
