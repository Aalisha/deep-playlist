Supreme talks about his baby's mother like a whore.
Sweet 16 she is,
with future uncertain,
love incomplete.
Soapy days for Jr. and she.

At 3, Supreme comes to give his boy a pat and a pound,
put his hoodie on the couch,
his Timberlands up on the coach
so his bitch can bring him a beer.

' So, this is the Nuclear family?
Mommy, baby... and
Daddy makes a mess of his baby's mother's hair as they fuck
'til her mother comes in from work.
She's playing house,
he's playing man
and Jr. is the only one who accepts he's just a child.

Wild nights she had with a swish of her stuff,
knocked up to a waddle,
a baby carriage bustle
and still gets her play.
