Hear the devil calling, he's calling my name
So take the demon ride up on the road of fear and pain
When the wind is howling and the sunlight is fading away
I'm driving down the highway with my old black Chevrolet

Oh, rock 'n' roll
Is always present in my soul
Oh, rock 'n' roll
Into the Reich of darkness we will go
...
