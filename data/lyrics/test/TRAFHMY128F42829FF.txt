Hell holds the sands in vast distant plain outside the fathom of men
Where the rains do pour on this desert land in the shape of flame
As ashes swirl and suffocate the air they burn all that is below

They must walk, an endless struggle to find relief for their bodies that burn
Melted among flesh and bone, their cries of torment are heard
Disfigured and anguished the souls of these sinners must trek across the sands
