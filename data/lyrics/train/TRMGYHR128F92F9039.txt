All night long you've been lookin' at me
Well you know you're the dance hall cutie that you love to be
Well now you've been layin' it down
You got your hips swingin' out of bounds.
And I like the way you do what you're doin' to me
Alright!

Well that's right
That's right
That's right
That's right
I really love your tiger light
And that's neat
That's neat
That's neat
That's neat
I really love your tiger feet
I really love your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Alright!
