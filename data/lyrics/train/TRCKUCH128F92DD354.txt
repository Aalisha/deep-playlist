Fergus sings the Blues
In bars of twelve or less
I'm a stranger
To the land
To this wilderness
All
Things are possible
But happen less and less
This
Is my country
These
Are my reasons
'Cause I look
In the mirror
And it throws
Back the question
And I whisper in words
That beg
An answer
Tell me
Can
This white man sing the blues
Home
Sick James
My biggest
Influence
