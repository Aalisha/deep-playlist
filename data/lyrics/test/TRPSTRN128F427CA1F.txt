Gone and disapearing on this cold night
I never thought it'd be that way
Your crying eyes they form the question
Formed by the words that we have shared

Uncovered signs now change the times
Perplexing incongruent lies
Unparalled, impossible, complacent amiable souls

God, I wanna see you on the inside
But it's not feeling like that way
I wanna see you on the inside
