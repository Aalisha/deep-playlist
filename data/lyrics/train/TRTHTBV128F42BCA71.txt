I always knew
No matter what you say or do
Right by your side I keep you satisfied
Other girls can stare
And try to catch you if they dare
Mondays, Tuesdays
You're always working overtime
But Fridays, Saturdays and, ooh, Sundays
That's when you're all I mine
To help me through the day
Kisses leave me incomplete
That's why don't always hear me say
I need you 24 hours

24 hours

I always knew
No matter what you say or do
Right by your side I keep you satisfied
Other girls can stare
And try to catch you if they dare
Mondays, Tuesdays
