Don't you know what time it is?
It's the new time
All disciples gathering by the boats
But your revolution is chasing its tail
You love to take the wind out of my sail
But not this time

In between commercial breaks
It's a new war
Men with books have run away to the coast
And the ladies quit callin' them back
And starting plotting the counter attacks
You foolish animals!

She's out in the park conducting the birds
Trying to remember which bicycle's hers
...
