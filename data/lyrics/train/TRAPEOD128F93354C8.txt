I say, say, say it again
(Someday, we'll be together)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
You're far away from me, my love

And just as sure my, my, baby
As there are stars above
I wanna say, wanna say, wanna say
(Someday, we'll be together)

Yes we will, yes we will
(Say, someday, we'll be together)
Some sweet day
I know, I know, I know, I know
My love is yours, baby
