Twice upon a time in a slowdive running low,
Such an empty paradise that always feels so cold.
Lost as lover's kisses that seek to hold you so,
Down those shadow steps, down those shadow steps I go.
And you'll take another, that you'll never know,
and you'll lose your love, for everything you hold,
to taste the orchids dreaming is sweeter than this life
