Setzer

St. Jude pray for us
St. Jude pray for us
We need some peace and comfort now
St. Jude pray for us

We're all alone in this great big world
And we're slippin', time's slippin' by
Spirituality is thing of the past
And it's something money can't buy
I know I've asked for things before
And you've always heard my prayers
So can I ask you one more time
'Cause we're all running scared

St. Jude pray for us
St. Jude pray for us
We need some peace and comfort now
St. Jude pray for us
