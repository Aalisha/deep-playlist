Here I Stand
A Heartbroken Man
I Was A Bad Seed In Your Future Plan
When It Rains It Pours
That's When You Hide And Close The Door
I'll Never Be The One You Wanted

I Sent You A Letter
I Thought It'd Be Better Than Calling You

I'm Missing You
I'm The Man You Never Knew
Always Blue over You
And I Can't Help It
I Can Not Fake It
For I Still Love You

I Don't Know You anymore
Behind The Shell Lies Something Wounded
...
