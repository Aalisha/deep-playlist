hey watch the places you walk and mind

watch out for the big time thief who claim sey that them smart
stop bringing the crack and the gun to mash up the youth dem heart

chorus:
earth a run red
ten year old a look dem owna tea bread
i hear a next youth dead whoa

earth a run red
ten year old a look dem owna tea bread
i hear a next youth dead yeah

watch it
the mark of the beast a come in under sneaking under man feet
a revelation time, check the signs of the time, you no feel the heat
