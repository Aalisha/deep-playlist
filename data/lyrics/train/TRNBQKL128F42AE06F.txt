The chase is on
Reverie dies
Stand up be counted
This world that we hold
Will never kneel
Fuck you - you can never win
You never had
Our persistence
It's an honor never bestowed upon you
We're wide - awake
All senses alert
We'll brush you off
Like dirt on our skin
A lifetime under devil wings
Has forged a shield of unpenetrable strength

'Cause they want
'Cause they need
...
