Too eager to appease
the cure is the disease
and it's only growing worse
Day by day it takes its hold
divides its cells a thousand-fold
and makes your blindness seem perverse
Out of sight and out of mind
are deadly traits when they're combined
but it's easier that way
Sit and watch the world go by
while all the problems multiply
with nothing left to do but pray
I am the rain
falling down to cover you
wish me away
but i'm here for your own good
i am the storm
sent to wake you from your dream
...
