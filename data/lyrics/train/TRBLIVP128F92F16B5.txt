Whatever you want, whatever you need
Anything you want done baby, I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman
It's all in me, it's all in me

I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z

I can cast a spell of secrets you can tell
Mix a special brew, put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
