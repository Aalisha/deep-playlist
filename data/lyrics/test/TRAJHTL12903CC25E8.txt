All hail the god in the TV
White noise medicating
Rape and murder, holy war, nothing phases me
And now I have the only scapegoat that I need
(A modern day alibi for a life of abuse and neglect)

HAIL
ALL HAIL

Pray to the god in the TV
Eyes wide, fixed and dilated, bleed
A myriad of rich white trash, nothing phases me
It promises just what I'm longing to be
