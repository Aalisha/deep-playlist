Yea, though I trod through this valley
I will fear no evil
Yea, though I trod through this valley
I will fear no evil
'Cause I know
Jah guide, Jah guide, Jah guide
Jah guide, Jah guide I through this valley
And I know he will
When I'm trodding through death's valley

I know he will
Though my enemies fight me everyday
I will fear no evil
Though my enemies set traps in my way
Still I will fear no evil

'Cause Jah guide, Jah guide, Jah guide
