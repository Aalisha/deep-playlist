Step into my world...

Like a moth to a flame, you know you're drawn to me
I know you better than you know yourself, baby
Why do you try to resist what you want, honey
I want you to give me what I need - listen closely

I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy's what I will bring
You, if you just

Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place
Where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams
And the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only
...
