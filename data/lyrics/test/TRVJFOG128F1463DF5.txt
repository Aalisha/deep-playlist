Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my friend's coming
Ridin' many mile

So friends, you get some silver
Did you get a little gold
What did you bring me, my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole
What did you bring me
To keep me from the gallows pole

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know that we're too damn poor
To keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming
Ridin' many mile

Brother, did you get me some silver
Do you get a little gold
What did you bring me, my brother
To keep me from the gallows pole
