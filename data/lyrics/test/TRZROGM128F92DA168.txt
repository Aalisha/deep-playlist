[Byford/Quinn/Oliver/Dawson/Gill]

When you're dyin', when you're dyin'
There ain't no use in cryin'
I'm gonna keep on livin' till the light
Shines down on you
Burnin' right in
Ya can't stop when you're winning
I'm gonna show my hand make history

Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
