All work and no pay
Makes Jack a dull boy
I'm driving insane
Cause I need a brand new toy

Killer stalks in search of prey
Sometimes my mind goes astray
The blood flows as my curtain calls
I'm bustin' through your walls

All's fair in love and war
Repeated nightmares have begun
Old wounds that never heal
...
