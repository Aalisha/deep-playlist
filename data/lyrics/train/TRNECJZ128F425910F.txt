Used to sit and worry about the future
Worrying about the future don’t change the past
Used to think that tomorrow would be better
But now i know that i’m doing the best i can
I’m just a man trying to find the reasons why i stand
Took some time to realize that i am what i am
And i wanna be rich, i wanna be happy
And live inside a love that shines bright enough to last a lifetime
I wanna be rich more than a fantasy
Ride the winds and climb, cause it’s all a state of mind

Wake up in the morning and i turn the pages
Don’t understand what’s going down
