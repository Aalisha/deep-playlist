You're my boppin' high school baby, dear and you're for me
Yes, my boppin' high school baby suits me to a T
Every time I look at you, my eyes bulge out
Sayin' a-look here everybody and begin to shout

She's my boppin' high school baby, loves me naturally
Yes, my boppin' high school baby loves nobody but me
