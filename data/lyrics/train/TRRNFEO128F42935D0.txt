My girl so lovely
Here comes your only love
My boy so lovely
Here comes your only love

City life to countryside
This train ride guarantees
Beatific visions of horror & lovely things
Will I be slain or saved
By the kinds of things I see
There's just one kind
Dose marks the line
Poison or remedy

My girl so lovely
Here comes your only love
My boy so lovely
Here comes your only love

Lights & shadows keep us dancing round & round
In this place where angels come to meet the underground
Now things are new
...
