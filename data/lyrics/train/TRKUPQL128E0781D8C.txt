You've got to lift yourself up so high
You can't see the ground
You don't hear a sound
You've got to move it up so slow
You see it all
You'll probably fall

I'd rather die than see you fly
Than see you try
I'd rather die than see you fly
Than see you try

It's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind
I don't care what I find
It's like pushing locked doors to get in your mind
I don't know what I'll find
