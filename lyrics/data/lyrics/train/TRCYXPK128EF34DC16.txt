II was down, I was barely makin' it
She was gone and I couldn't take it
I was lookin' for a new way of thinkin'
When I go to sleep, I pray I wouldn't wake
up

Well, I want you, I want you
To rescue me
The world kept turning
But I stood still
Just a shadow lookin' for the man
Did I play to win?
Or did I win to loose?
Of all the cards I had to draw the fool

People tellin' me
About the things I do
The more I hear
The less I see the truth
