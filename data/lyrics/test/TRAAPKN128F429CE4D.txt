The bicycles inside your skull
Send you away and off you go
Into the streets where all the pretty girls collect their thoughts for you
and pin them up to clouds and treees
and aggravate your paranoid
and shivering fears and rolling aches
Can you not see a star out there?

Where all the bricks are bright and free
Where all the bricks are bright and elegant and free
...
