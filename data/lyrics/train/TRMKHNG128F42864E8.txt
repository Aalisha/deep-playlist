Wooo, Yeah!

As poor as I am I've got my ambition
Keep my distance from war and contention
I might not be rich but I sure got style
Got some good friends,
But still some who hate me
tell their lies
And still that don't quake me
The joy thats inside
Brings out my healthy smile

Try if you want
Can't stop me
Lie if you want
Still won't move me
Won't move me
Nooo
Won't move me, at all.(x2)


I know who I am
I don't let nobody
Underestimate me and you'll end up sorry
The father will humble you like a child
Oh Yeah
I'm getting stronger
So much stronger
Day by day
I'm getting stronger
