Hear the engines roaring
Hear the grinding steel
Advancing divisions
Behind armoured wheels
They're driving through the clouds
They're staggering through the mud
Panic, fear and terror
An enemy on the run

Artillery is ploughing
The earth of foreign land
Screaming stukas drop
their deadly load
Einsatzgruppen murdering
On the FÃ¼hrer's command
Heavey calibre mortars explode

Seven armies marching
About 3 million man
Operation Barbarossa
