You tell me you love me, you say you'll be true
Then you fly around with somebody new
But I'm crazy about you, you butterfly

You treat me mean, you're makin' me cry
I've made up my mind to tell you goodbye
But I'm no good without you, you butterfly

I knew from the first time I kissed you
That you were the troublin' kind
...
