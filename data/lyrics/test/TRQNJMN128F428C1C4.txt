People criticize the way I live my life 
but who are they to put me down 
I try my best and thank the lord I´m blessed everyday 

and though I´ve had my share of highs, it made me realise 
that nothing ever comes for free 
all I do is try and make the most of being me 

but sometimes you get to the point 
where you just can´t go on and it feels like the end of the road 
but if you keep going round 
with your head in the clouds will you see what´s right under your nose? 

And if it´s never gonna be 
don´t try to hold on 
see everybody has a dream 
that doesn´t seem to go right 
you´re not the only one who hurts 
there´s people going through so much worse 
...
