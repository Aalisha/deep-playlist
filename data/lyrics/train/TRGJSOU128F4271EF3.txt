Walk into my room
Ask me jerky questions
Don't mean what you say
Immaculate protection
Play by the rules
So close to the vest
Hope that all's not lost
And this is not a waste

Stay just as far from me
As me from you
Make sure that you are sure
Of everything I do
'Cause I'm not not not not not not not not
...
