Your plastic souls melt within cauldron's burning black
Chanting to the Ancient Ones, chants of broken lines
Kneel before the alter, sacrifice is made
It is pleasing to the ones most ancient of the days

They call the prince of disease, messenger of the Absu
Carry through the icy winds our curse upon their church

Hanging helpless above the pentagram
Sacrifice swings within leather noose
Sing the ancient hymn that makes the Abso roll
Raise the rusty knife, let loose the blood of Kingu
