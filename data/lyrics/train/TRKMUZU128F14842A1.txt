I am sure all of Heaven's heard me cry
As I tell You all the reasons why
This life is just too hard

But day by day, without fail
I'm finding everything I need
And everything that You are to me

Every time I breathe You seem a little bit closer
I never wanna leave, I wanna stay in Your warm embrace
Oh, basking in the glory shining from Your face

And every time I get another glimpse of Your heart
I realize it's true that You are so marvelous God
And I am so in love with You, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So in love with You
