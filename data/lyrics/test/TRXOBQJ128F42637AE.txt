(J. Jett/R. Byrd/R. Browde)

Johnny, Johnny I was by your side
I'm looking for a ride, told me you won't be denied
You want a taste of everything
Your going too fast, you're gonna crash
But you know you'll survive
So much to fight for
Lots of flags to wave
A rebel without a cause
You've got so much to say

Tell me how you feel
Tell me what you see
Ridin' with James Dean
Ridin' with James Dean (Jimmy Dean)
