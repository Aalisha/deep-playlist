Burned down on the boulevard
Livin' so fast and sweet and hard
Don'tcha try and shoot me down
Don't intend to stick around

Gotta move, move on down the road
Gotta move, move on down the road

It's a gas when you got the dice
Been to heaven maybe once or twice
Lookin' for love but love don't last
...
