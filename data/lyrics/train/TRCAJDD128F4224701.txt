Nothing can stop me
So bad, do I feel inside
Get my hat, I`m checkin` out
`Cause you and your friends really hurt my pride
So unexspected you shot me down
With all the fella`s standing around yeah
`Please don`t go`, that`s what they`ll be saying
`Please don`t go`, But I`m not playing
`Cause nothing can stop me

(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Nothing can stop me
