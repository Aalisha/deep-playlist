One summer day a stranger walked up to me and said,
hey Little Angel would you please tell me your name.
I just turned my head and said, Laura Jane's my name.
he said, Laura, would you like to play a game.

Too young to know and understand the reason why
this Little Angel had to live with so much pain.
As a child of only nine I was not to blame
Now my heart must grow beyond the shame.

Dear God, keep and eye on Little Angels
