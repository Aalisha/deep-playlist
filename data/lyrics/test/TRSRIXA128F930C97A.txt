Now the eagle flies to aid her fallen sister
Fear and anger growing around the world
Blinded, the false prophet still rings his bell
Signaling his soldiers to march into hell

We've learned to live in pain and fear
We know the end is very near

Never ask for whom the bell is tolling
Never ask me, don't ask me
Never ask for whom the bell is tolling
...
