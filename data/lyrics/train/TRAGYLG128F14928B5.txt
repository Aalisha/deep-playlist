When you walked into my lonely life tonight
I saw my destiny, I saw eternity tonight
And the moment I held you I knew it
What we do is decided before we do it

Fate, this can only be
Fate, I never thought I'd believe in
Fate, now I understand
It's part of the plan
I was meant to be your woman

Time stood still, and we were lost on words to say
And though the people stared, they seemed a million miles away
All we knew it was love we were feeling
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning
