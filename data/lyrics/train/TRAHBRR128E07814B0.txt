She's in my veins
Gold in my veins
She is my pain
And my joy
Time and again
Waxing or waning
I am insane
For la luna
Madame de la luna

When she is sleepy
She's creepy, mysterious and wicked
When she is full
She is full of promise and joy
Beaming her smile
All the while
Across heaven's horizons
Weaving her dreams
Into hearts of lonely boys

But when i'm under the moon with you
I'm in heaven
When i'm under the moon with you
I'm in heaven

She'll bring out the killer
Bring out the lover

She loves a tyrant, a pirate, a dreamer, a crook and a liar
