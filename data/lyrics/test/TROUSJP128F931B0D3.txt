Oop-scooby-dooby-lena, go-gal-go
Bop-a-lena, bop-a-lena, she's my gal
Oh, bop-a-lena, bop-a-lena, yeah she's my gal
She's my gal and I love her so
Oop-scooby-dooby-lena, go-gal-go

Well the school bells are ringin', everybody went out
Goin' to the shag, gonna shake it all about
Bop-a-lena lookin' like a rose in the wil
Man I dig that freAk juvenile
When she gets a-goin' she's a real cool chick
She do the bop like a pogostick
