You wanted power and you begged for fame
You wanted everything the easy way
You wanted gain without pain
Now your bill is in the mail
You got stronger but your mind got weak
You made a promise that you couldn't keep
You got it all - you lost more
It's all there in the fee

Via hell incorporated (regeneration)
First you love it then you hate it (you're such a saint)
And now you're never gonna make it (bad situation)
Get on get on down
