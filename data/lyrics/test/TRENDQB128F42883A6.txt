(Marc Nelson, Jon-John, Darrell Spencer)

First chapter
You stole my heart away from me
Made me believe true love could be
We were so close you changed my life
How could a love so strong not go right

Where do we go from here?
When it's said our love would stay around
Why do I even care
The way you looked it can't be found
My heart is broken down
