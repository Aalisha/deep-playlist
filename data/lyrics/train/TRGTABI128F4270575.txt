Let's raise the glass.
Let's peel the eyelids back
And toast them.
And we can watch their plans fall through.

I've found a reason to quit.
And I can stop when I want.
And I can call it off any time I want to.
If I could light your cash,
You can smoke your stash.
Sucking on your best friend's skin.
