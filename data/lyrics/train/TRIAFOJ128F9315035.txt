I don't like the way he's looking at you,
I'm starting to think you want him too.
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya.

Even though I know you love me,
Can't help it.
I turn my chin, music up,
And I'm puffing my chest.
I'm getting red in the face, you
Can call me obsessed.
It's not your fault that they hover,

I mean no disrespect.
It's my right to be hellish,
I still get jealous.
Cause you're too sexy, beautiful,
And everybody wants a taste.
That's why (that's why)

I still get jealous.
Cause you're too sexy, beautiful,
And everybody wants a taste.
That's why (that's why)
I still get jealous.
