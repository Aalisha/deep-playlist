It's falling, It's falling, It's falling on the ground, yeah
It's falling on the ground, yeah
Let's blame the lightman
for our own mistakes
We'll blame the whole damn crew
if that's what it takes

Cause We wont talk
to anybody else yeah
We wont talk
to anybody else yeah

Let's blame the lightman
and anybody else
Let's blame the lightman
and save us from ourselves
...
