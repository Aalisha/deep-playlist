If there's hate in this heart
Then there's hate in that heart
For one hand claps not without the other

If there's hate in this heart
Then there's hate in that heart
For one hand claps not without the other

From love springs love
But who can say
If the love is not returned
It furthers by the day

From hate springs hate
So we have found
It's growing ever stronger
We will see it all around

With every chance y'all take
And every heart y'all break

You know that every day I'm more disappointed
By the world and I'm losing my faith
We made the hell that we have to live
Another universal truth

We keep on asking the same kind of questions
We keep on fighting the same type of wars
But you will find what you need inside
To be a superior mind
Superior mind
