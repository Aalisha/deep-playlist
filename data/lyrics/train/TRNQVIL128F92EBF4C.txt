[Verse 1:]
Breezy I can't pick Tony's trust no more (no more)
That's when he lost was messin up my flow (my flow)
Steady hand cuffin, frontin and stuntin
Was talkin love but he wasn't sayin nun-in
Cause we together (yes), homie whateva (yah)
Too young to be locked down now
Taka loss cut'um off when I found that out
I couldn't have that, (oh no wasn't for me)
Just wanna lay baaacck (so I can shook it you see)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Um lookin for someone who don't bring no strees to me
I'd love to have some fun that is all that I need
Click, click, click, click, if you really wanna turn me on
Click, click, click, click lay back chill and be free...

[Chorus:]
Okay if you really wanna get with me
Baby this is how we gotta be (lay back lay back chill and be free)
If you really wanna get with me
Baby this is how we gotta be (lay back lay back chill and be free)
