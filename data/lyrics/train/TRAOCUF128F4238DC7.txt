Looking back, sometimes I wondered
Who held the key to your heart
Now I know, through places I travelled
Our love's unraveled a chart...

In my life I've waited...
For a chance to really make it...
Something written into my stars.
Past lives that I've lived
Only lead up to a gift
Of speaking out my thoughts in my songs.
