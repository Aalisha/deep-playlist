may you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
may you never make your bed out in the cold

Verse 1
your just like a great strong brother of mine and you know that i love you true
You never talk dirty behind my back and i know there are those that do
won't you please, won't you please, won't you bear in mind
love is a lesson to learn in our time
won't you please won't please won't you bear in mind for me

may you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
