You know I try so hard
To be the only one
But I don? t know so tell me why
You don? t wanna get it on

I? m on my knees I? m givin' up
This thing is heavy as a goddamn log
I can? t stop wantin' you baby
Now I? m begging like a little dog

And if rip my shirt to pieces
It? s not enough for you
Dress up in a suit and tie
It? s not enough for you

You got me hollering out for Jesus
It? s not enough for you
Oh baby, won? t you tell me why

Hanging on to the roller coaster
...
