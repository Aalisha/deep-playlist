No chosen path lies among their ways.
Inner emptiness must be fed by destiny.
Cut the fields of the heart
And wander to the sacred ways
Of rise and sorrow,
To the wastelands of strange shadows
To the forbidden roads that will bring
The wisdom of light and darkness.
Separate minds united by instinct,
Hanging between life and death.

I teach the language of the senses
I am the dark crown, free to explore against thee
I am the guardian of all hearts and souls
