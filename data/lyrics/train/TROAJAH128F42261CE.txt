"Viola"

Dancing underneath these silvery and bright moons
Drifting on seas of wisdom again
Seeking the ancient spirits for their guidance
Letting them unfold again

Viola
All the things that you believe
It's falling apart
Breathe in me
The spirit of belief
Let the wine pour down

Breathe in me
Rescue me

Viola!

Viola!
