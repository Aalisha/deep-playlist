Well, I'm here looking through an old picture frame
Just waiting for the perfect view
I hope something special will step into my life
Another fine edition of you
A pin up done in shades of blue

Sometimes you find a yearning for the quiet life
The country air and all of it? s joys
But badgers couldn? t compensate at twice the price
For just another night with the boys, oh yeah
And boys will be boys, will be boys, yoy yoys
