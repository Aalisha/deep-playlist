Picked her up on a Friday night
Sha la la la lee, yeah
I knew everything gonna be alright
Sha la la la lee, yeah
Sha la la la lee

I asked her 'where do you wanna go?'
Sha la la la lee, yeah
Well we went someplace, I don't know
Sha la la la lee, yeah
Sha la la la lee

I held her close and I asked her if
she was gonna be my baby
It felt so good when she answered me
Oh yeah, oh yeah
