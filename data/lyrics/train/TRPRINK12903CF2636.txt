Beneath a shawl of midnight silence
A howling blackness
Where all is remade in necromorphosis
Asleep in human remains

Worn from the stones
Elegiac words
Recounting hopes
And forgotten lives
For beneath them lies
The dust of humans
The dust of dreams
The dust...

A coach drawn by the blackest steeds
As befits those who've passed from life
Will bring you to where swarm the specters
...
