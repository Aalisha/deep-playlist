Cancelled flights, limousines
Hustle bustles, crazy scenes
First you're here, then you're there
Pretty soon man, you been everywhere

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Oh, Satan's desire
We've seen the rise, we'll see the fall
He's here to see us all
Burn in hell

Time ticks away, faster, faster
You run so fast you forget what you're after
You make a deal to sell your soul
Just to find out, baby, it's been sold

Ooh, this planet's on fire
Oh, Satan's desire
