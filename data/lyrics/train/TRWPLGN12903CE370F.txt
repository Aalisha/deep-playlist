Half the truth is the same as a lie
And half of you, it just won't suffice
For tonight
Half of me is all I'll let you see
The other side I'll keep inside of my mind
And locked tight

Never again will I trust you
Never again will I love
Never again will I push through
And try to make sense of it all

You said you wanted back your life
Slow down, baby
Give me a little more time
Time to heal
Time to learn
Where I can find the time to watch it all burn

Give me the truth
Nothing but the, but the pain
Come clean, baby
...
