(Mark Nesler - Jennifer Hanson)

You can settle down in Mexico
Runaway join a circus show
Whatever baby it's alright with me
Take a walk in the pouring rain
Sky dive from a jet airplane
Love like ours is all about being free.

There's two chairs on the front porch
One's yours and one is mine
Four wheels in the driveway
That'll take us across the line.
