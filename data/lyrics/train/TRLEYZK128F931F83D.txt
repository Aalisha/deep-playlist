Dull as dirt, you can't assert the kind of light
That might persuade a strict dictator to retire
Fire the army, teach the poor origami
The truth is in, the proof is when
You hear your heart start asking
"What's my motivation?"

And try as you may, there isn't a way
To explain the kind of change
That would make an Eskimo renounce fur
That would make a vegetarian barbecue hamster
Unless you can trace this
About face to a certain sign

Shine
Make 'em wonder what you've got
Make 'em wish that they were not
On the outside, looking bored

Shine
Let it shine before all men
Let'em see good works and then
Let 'em glorify the Lord

Out of the shaker and onto the plate
It isn't Karma, it sure ain't fate
...
