Down in the holler there's a thriving town
A treasure trove that makes the world go 'round,
When the city barons bring their legal papers and guns,
Oh darlin', don't be afraid to run

When we came to settle here we came to stay,
Maybe raise a family, earn a decent wage,
Now every public servant reeks of suspicion,
So darlin' don't be afraid to run
...
