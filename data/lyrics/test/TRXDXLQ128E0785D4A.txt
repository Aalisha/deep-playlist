As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong

Back at the old gray school
I would win and you would lose

But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
Because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh

So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say, oh
