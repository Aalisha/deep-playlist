(Jumbo the Garbageman)
Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen, classics blow off the runway
Pregnant drums jam the experts, electric hymn, some say
Greasy revival fried chicken sermon Sunday
Soldierfied punk spray
Vurs, use your sun ray

(Vursatyl)
Carrying ten men's pain I appear, the prophet reflection
For cowards who couldn't get open in a c-section
Village idiots, I'm the period in your prison sentence
And you're an Elle column installment, good read
