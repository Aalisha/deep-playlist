No more shall we pray for peace
Never ever ask them why
No more shall we stop their visions
Of selfdestructing genocide
Dogs on leads march to war
Go ahead end it all...

Blow up the world
The final silence
Blow up the world
I don't give a damn!

Screams of terror, panic spreads
Bombs are raining from the sky
...
