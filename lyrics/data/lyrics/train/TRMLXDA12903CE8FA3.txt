I've been living in the past
Trying to live without you
I can feel your presence here
But I just can't touch you anymore
Memories are all I have
And your pictures fades from the light of another day
Can you hear me call
Call your name

Cheyenne, I am
I am so far away
Can you feel our dreams
They are slipping away

I've been looking to the west
Where the silent man can hear the harmony
Of the children's song and it's sweet refrain
I just can't hear it anymore
Memories are all I have
Of the sun and stars dancing endlessly
Can you hear me call
Call your name

Cheyenne, I am
I am so far away
Can you feel our dreams
They are slipping away
I am, Cheyenne
I am the sky, the wind, the rain
In my dreams, my friend
I can see you again

Look behind my footprints in the sand
This moment I stop to wonder
Why I long for yesterday
Tomorrow pulls me under
All the while I wallow in the mire
The moment just passed me by
Sunrise, will you grace my eyes
Bless my soul, make me whole again

The voice of reason guides me home
To the summit in the sky
