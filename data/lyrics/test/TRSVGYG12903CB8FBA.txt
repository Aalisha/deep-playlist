Heard a voice call down
From the lonesome north
Singin' songs of the work and worth
Hard edged stories from
The hard rock towns
I can picture Saturday night
Tires squealin' from the main street lights
Hear the crackin' of the cables
On the cage as it's lowered down
Hard edged stories from
The streets of the mining town

Chorus:
Don't follow me in boys
...
