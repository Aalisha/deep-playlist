Baby love, ooh, our love, our love
Ooh, baby love, ooh, our love, our love

Every time I see her face you know my heart drops to my feet
And I would never feel this way if my baby love walks so sweet
Well, I know I'm the envy of every girl
And my baby love is the reason, why you better stop, take a look

Because my baby, my baby love, ooh
I gotta have her love, have her love, ooh
