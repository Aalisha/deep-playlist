If I left tomorrow would you notice?
This familiar town's getting the best of me
Whispers on sidewalks
Steady shit talk when you're not around
The story turns so many directions
Getting lost doesn't sound too bad

[Chorus]
Maybe I'll see you somewhere down the road
If not, that's all right either way

Open your eyes quit being blinded
By the nonsense wrong does bring
