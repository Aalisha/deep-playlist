I can't believe you're here with me inside this dream come true
I'm so gone, I'm so far lost in your arms, in you
Here we are again between the darkness and the light
Hopin' that this moment could be frozen in time

I don't want this night to slip away
I just wanna lie in your embrace
And never see the sun come up
Just stay lost in your love

I wanna feel you brush against my skin
I don't want this feeling to end
I wanna see the moon dance on your face
I could lie here forever and never see the light of day
