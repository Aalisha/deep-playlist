Your car crash buckled up from heaven
Feeling like it's poison
When there's no one around
Your whole life sectioned up from red rose
Wishing you could see who
But you're stuck in the ground
With this minute sad show
Let the scenes go
It's obvious that you want
Would you say it feels smooth
Would you stay home
How do you feel
It's how do you feel sufficating
Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
Look what's all around you
Breathe in
Breathe in
Breathe in
