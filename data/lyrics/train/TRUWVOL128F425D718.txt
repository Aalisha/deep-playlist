You've done me wrong
Your time is up
You took a sip (just a sip)
From the devil's cup
You broke my heart
There's no way back
Move right outta here baby
Go on pack your bags

Just who do you think you are
Stop acting like some kinda star
Just who do you think you are
Take it like a man baby if that's what you are

'Cause I'm moving on up
You're moving on out
Moving on up
