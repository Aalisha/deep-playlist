I fought my way through the darkest days
Out into the light I was scared and I cried
But I believed in something more
You are guilty for

This darkness you gave me everyday
Everytime you pushed me away
The coldness you had shown me everyday
You'll never hurt me again

No mercy for the merciless
No forgiveness
...
