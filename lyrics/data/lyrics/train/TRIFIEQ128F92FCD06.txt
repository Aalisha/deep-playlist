I've been working so hard
I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got

I got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling

Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I gotta cut loose
Footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon before we crack

Lose your blues
Everybody cut Footloose

You're playing so cool
