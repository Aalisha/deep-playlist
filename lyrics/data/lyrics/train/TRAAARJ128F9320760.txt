there's a pink world
comin' down
yeah, there's a pink world
comin' down
in a quite little village by the sea
I hear the calling and it calls for you and me
so leave your riches and your houses on the hills
cancel all your credit cards and settle up your bills
cause you won't need them anymore
close down the factories
