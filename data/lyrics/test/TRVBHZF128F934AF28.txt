I am the living end, i have the touch, the last man on earth
I am your only friend, that ain't saying much
I think you know what it's worth

I've got things to do, people to be, i'm a man on the make
You want to stick around, that dont bother me
Long as you got what it takes

You know my name, you've seen the writing on the barrom wall
I'm still the same
A little stronger, a little faster Half demon, half disaster
He's a killer

When i walk in the door the men drop their drinks
And the woman drop their pants
Ooh man don't get up; what are you thinking?
