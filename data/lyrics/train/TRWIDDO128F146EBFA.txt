Down boy
Keep you down, boy

I'm the one that you would die for
The one you long to touch
The one you live a life for
I know it's much

The more you see, the more you want
The more you taste, it just gets better
The more you get, the more you like it
Don't go too far, I won't let you

Down boy
Won't you bring me down, boy?
Gotta keep you down
If you want me with you

Down boy
Won't you bring me down, boy?
Gotta keep you down
Some things I just won't do

Down boy
Won't you bring me down, boy?
Gotta keep you down
If you want me with you

Down boy
Won't you bring me down, boy?
Gotta keep you down
Some things I just won't do
