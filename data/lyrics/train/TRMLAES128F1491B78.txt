I've been away for every day and every fucking night
I've seen your eyes, i've seen your eyes
I've been away for every day and every fucking night
And with every city, it gets harder

You got a mouth like a razor blade. It cuts so deep
So kiss my wrists my neck and give me eternal sleep

You say, you say, I'm only a phone call away
But for me, this distance is decay
You say, you say, I'm only a phone call away
...
