What, what happened to the girl I used to know?
What, what happened to the girl I used to know?

You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys to the range
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys to the range

Say what the Dilly yo
Said, won't you tell me somethin' I didn't know
Do you got plans to be with me
Then why'd you flip the script on me
I need to know, you're the one
I can take around the world
So tell me, tell me, tell me baby
Why do you change?

You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys to the range
You've changed
You're not the girl that used to do things
The way I like it it's a damn shame
You was on your way to the house, money, keys to the range
