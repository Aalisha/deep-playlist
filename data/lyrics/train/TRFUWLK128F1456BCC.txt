Yeah, it's just more drama, it's kinda funny, things you go through in your lifetime, sometimes you just can't explain it, well, do women do what men do, if you don't think so, explain this to me, keep it real

Tell me where you were last night
I caught you in another lie
See you been creepin for so long
You see I had this feeling (feelin)
That you ain't never been true
Shit you said you did not do
Confessions goin down tonight (down tonight)
See you won't get a chance to me no more lies

(Chorus)
You know you ain't right
Been livin double lives
Creepin on the low
You thought I wouldn't know
You know you ain't right
Been livin double lives
Creepin on the low
You thought I wouldn't know
