Remember I'd forgotten that I met you before
It was your friend, distant friend
I really got to know
Before you waved your witch's wand

Climb up to the roof so we can check out the view
I think somebody spoke but I didn't have a clue
That you waved your witch's wand

Won't you start facing your dragon tonight
Won't you stop counting the matches that
Never would light
Ooh
Yeah, you waved your witch's wand

Do you know of any places we can dance at this hour
I wiped out on my bike, you were laughing in the shower
At seconds 'til the dawn

Don't bother with the feelings, we'll just set them alight
...
