You allude to every negative there was
Makin' out, that's all we had
Couldn't you believe that there would be an end to it?
All the good could not be that bad

There is just one thing to say
There's a lesson here to learn
Can you use it in any way?
You are nothing without my love

Couldn't care if you decide today and run away
Always said we'd be apart
