"Infatuated by the extensiveness of the universe,
it's easy to forget one of the most complex
enigma's of this world: The human mind,
a universe of its own."
Open the gates of the past
With the key to our hearts
Dream of the years gone by
Centuries through mankind's eyes
In the wasteland that grows inside
Within me I shall find myself
...
