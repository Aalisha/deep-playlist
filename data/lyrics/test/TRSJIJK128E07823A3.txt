We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody's watching
We might take it home

We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate

So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known

And why do you sing Hallelujah
...
