A high road, low road, Some Old Side Road
Really don’t matter to me it gets me back to you
Jet plane, fast train, bus in a hard rain, any ol’ way you please
If it gets me back to you
Young man, big shot, gotta see what’s out there
Leave town, hung around, what the hell does he care
Corner park, broken heart, girl in her home town
Porch light every night, hoping that he comes around
A high road, low road, Some Old Side Road
Really don’t matter to me if it gets me back to you
