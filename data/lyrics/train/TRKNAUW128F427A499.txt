It's not just a blink
Or the following of an arm
And it isn't just a flicker
No it isn't just a flicker
Oh, there's a look in your eyes
That you can't explain
Oh, there's a look in your eyes
And when it slips through the rain
Oh, there's a criss-crossed thinking
(No it's not just a blink)
There's a deeper tear
...
