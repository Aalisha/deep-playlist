I wake up in the morning full of dread
Tryin' to remember what I'd said
I say that I won't call you
And I mean it every time
Until I cross that bourbon borderline

I wish that I could tell you why I call
Sometimes it's just hard for me, that's all
I know that it's over and it's just a waste of time
