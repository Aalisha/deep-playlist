You've got me tangled up in you
You've got me tangled up in you

I must be trippin' it's true
I'm losin' hold of my cool
And I really ought to let you go

Don't even make any sense
It's gettin' crazy intense
Why you wanna make me lose control?

I just gotta let you know
I can't seem to let you go
Now, it's gettin' personal

Girl what you do to me
It's crazy new to me
It's gettin' through to me

I can't deny that it's true
You've got me tangles up in you
I tell myself that it's wrong
That when you smile at me I'm gone

There ain't no way to escape
Trapped in this beautiful mistake
