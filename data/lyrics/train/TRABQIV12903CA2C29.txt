I was born on a levy
A little bit south of Montgomery
Mama worked at the big house
And daddy he worked for the County
I never had no learnin'
Until I turned 16
When Joe Henry come up the river, y'all
Law, made a woman out of me
Lord, he made a woman outta me


I used to tease Joe Henry
I guess I teased to hard
And one day it all happened
Right in my own backyard
