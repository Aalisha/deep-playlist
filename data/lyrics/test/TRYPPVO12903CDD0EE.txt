I WANT TO BE YOUR GENTLEMAN
I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND
STAND UP FOR YOU
WHEN YOU NEED A SEAT ON THE BUS
BE THE KIND OF GUY
THAT YOU CAN TRUST
AND WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE
I'LL LEND YOU MY COAT
AND WHEN YOU'RE FEELING HOPELESS
I'LL PROVIDE YOU WITH HOPE
OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU
WHEN YOU WALK TOWARDS IT
AND PAY FOR YOUR MEAL
WHEN YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT

ALL I WANT TO BE
ALL YOU NEED FROM ME
