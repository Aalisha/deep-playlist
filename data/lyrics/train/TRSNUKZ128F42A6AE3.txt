You know I've always got your back girl
So let me be the one you can run into, run into, run, run, run in
I say this, cause it's a matter of fact girl
You just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll get coming

On the other side of the world
It don't matter, I'll there in two, i'll there in two, i'll there in two
I still feel it everytime
It's just something I have to do
Now ask me why I want to

It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like everybody, it's just us too
And there's nothing that could want too
It's everything about you, you, you
Everything about you, you, you
It's everything that you do, do do
...
