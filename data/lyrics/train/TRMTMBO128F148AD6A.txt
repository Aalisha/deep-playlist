Rolled up
Rolled up again
Rolled up
Right in front of my friends

I was rockin' like a star
Closed down all the bars
And now I'm sitting in this holding cell

Sad but true
Well, I need you
Come get me out of jail
Please, please

You're my only friend
That I know
Who's got something to live
Post my bail

Cheese sandwich, orange juice
I've even had to fight to keep my shoes
I don't got no phone or credit cards to use
And it's late at night and this calling card's gonna have to do
