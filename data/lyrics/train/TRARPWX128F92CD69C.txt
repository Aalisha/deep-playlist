I found a book that my mama kept
Filled with secrets she hid
And in a dusty old attic, one mornin I read
About a woman I never met
Who had dreams just like mine
With every page that I turned, the words came alive

I'll do as I dare, let them call me insane
I'll never sit on the sidelines of life, I'll dance every dance
If I just had the chance
