She's a heartbeat
Yeah, she's a heartbeat
She's a door at the end
Of a dead end street
She's a heartbeat

And footsteps, I hear her footsteps
Here come rumors and lies
Here comes my life of crime
I hear footsteps

When the music goes down
And the traffic is stopped
And nobody talks at all
When they turn up the town
I hear a heartbeat

And I've shut all the shades
And the radio stops
And nobody moves at all
When the city's asleep
I hear a heartbeat
I hear a heartbeat

In the shadows, out in the shadows
It's like walking on glass
It's the end of the show
...
