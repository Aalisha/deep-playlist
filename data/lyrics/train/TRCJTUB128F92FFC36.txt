Whiskey bottle and brand new cars,
Oak tree, you're in my way.
There's too much Coke and too much smoke.
Look what's goin' on inside you.

Oo-oo that smell,
can't you smell that smell?
Oo-oo that smell,
the smell of death's around you.

Angel of darkness is upon you,
Stuck a needle in your arm.
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose.
One more drink, fool, will drown you.
