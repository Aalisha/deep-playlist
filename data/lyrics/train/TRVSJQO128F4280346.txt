Throw out all my thoughts, that's all I want to do
Theres things I want to say to you
I look up at the sky and close my eyes, and think of you

I've met noone like you before
I think I love you
And theres nothing I could want more
I think I love you

I feel happier today, I feel okay
Breathe in your sigh
I look up where you stand, and leave this land
