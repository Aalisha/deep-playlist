Watch out he's the kind to deceive
Mama tried to tell me but I didn't believe
Something about you that put me on a string,
For your tender love I gave up everything.
Too late now I am aware,
I'm not the only girl who has your tender love and care.
You took my love, money and time.
Please have mercy baby don't take my mind.
Don't do it.
It's plain to see you don't care for me
Still you get jealous when I talk to other guys
You have another girl somewhere
Your love I have to share
