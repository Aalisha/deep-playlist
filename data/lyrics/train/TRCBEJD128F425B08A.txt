When do I just get to be a woman?
Sip some wine and do my nails
Bubble bath till the candles melt
All week long and everything else

When do I just get to be a woman?

That's what every tired girl needs
When do I just get to be a woman?

I make our bed, his lunch
I put my make up on while I run by the daycare
