Twenty-five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I've been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty mad
But I got a girl waitin' for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin'
Make a boy go stone wild

I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin' my name
