i woke up out of bed in the mornin'
the sweet sunshine outside is glowin'
take me down to the arms of the street
i start walkin' to the gentle beat
there's a store with organic food for the masses
i bought some cold cornbread and molasses
there's a man beat boxin' in the street corner
cool rhymes for the heat and i'll be
so lazy all today...
i'll be so lazy all today...
