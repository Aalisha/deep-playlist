The flowers are faded now
Along with your letters
They will never
See the light of day
'Cause I'll never take them out
And there's no turning back
It's for the better
Baby, I deserve
More than empty words and promises
I believed everything you said
And I gave you the best I had

So take a bow
'Cause you've taken everything else
You played the part
And like a star you played it so well
Take a bow
'Cause this scene is coming to an end
I gave you love
All you gave me was pretend
So now

Take a bow

The future's about to change
Before you know it
The curtain closes
...
