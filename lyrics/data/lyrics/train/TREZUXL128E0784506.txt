I've seen you fall with stupid pride,
The vunerability you try to hide,
Forget the past, and look at me now,
(And look at me now)
(And look at me now)
A cold expression on your face,
From your contempts I feel disgraced,
Forget it all, and look at me now,
(And look at me now)
(And look at me now)

You wanted the mystery,
You asked for, to feel me,
My mask is beginning to slide,

So where we gonna go from here my love?
What am I gonna do when you won't hear me?
You should know I'm there, by your side,
If you need me,
Will you take my love?
If I show you how?
See I could never be,
