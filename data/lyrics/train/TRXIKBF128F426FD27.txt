(and) Coming out of my mouth
Into your eyes, not once but twice

(and) Choosing the others I always lie
Forever yielding

You should have seen your face
Can you imagine how I must appear

(and) Let me do it for you
(and) Let me do it for me
(and) Let me do me some more
Your good stuff
(oh) Let me do me some more
...
