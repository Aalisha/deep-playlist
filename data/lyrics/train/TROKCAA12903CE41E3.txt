Do you know what would be good right here? Some yellow
A touch of humility, original sin or two from you
Half the math, double the myth, they told you to
No aftertaste, no residue, chop chop, you're through

Our good order taker has what it takes to make it
It's up to you
Unflinching trigger finger, coffee fetcher to the letter
See it through
