Please don't ever let me down
For you know I'm not so sure
Do I have the speed to carry on
I'll burn you out of my mind, I know
You're a flame that never fades
Jungle red's a deadly shade
Both ends burning, will the fires keep
Somewhere deep in my soul tonight

Both ends burning
Burning
Burn

Both ends burning
Burning
Burn
