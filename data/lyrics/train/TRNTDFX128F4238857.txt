Lawd me can't tek it no more, give me back the woman that you give me before
Lawd God me can't tek it no more, give me back the woman that you give me

After half pint tek wey me girl Winsome, laugh after me and tek it for fun
Then me go back and talk to blossom and she gone left me tru no money naw run
Searching for a girl and me couldnt get none, when mi find one she said me hav fi Pay down
Now me confuse and mi no know wey fi tun, an a goin back a bag an go a New Kingston

Lawd me can't tek it no more, give me back the woman that you give me before
Lawd me can't tek it no more, mi cry and mi cry till mi eye dem sore

Mi first girl gone and they say a mi fault, and the rest of dem say me dirt too salt
If she just came and hear what mi a say do you think mi a sit down and a bawl so today
