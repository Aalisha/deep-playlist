We were like a pair of shoes, you never saw one of us without the other
We were brothers but we weren't kin
Those neighborhood football games was the only time you might ever see
Us on different teams back then

Oh we'd cuss one another for all that the other was worth
But in our hearts we were only cussin' each other's shirt

I wore blue and he wore brown
But we both knew the colors didn't count
At the end of the day we'd walk away
There was no doubt we were friends for life
I wore blue and he wore brown
...
