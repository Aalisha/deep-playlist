Teenage rebels rule okay
I'll be damned if I work all day
I think that you look okay
I won't even look your way


Teenage rebels out all night
Teenage rebels drink and fight
Rockabilly rebel don't go to school
Teenage rebel rule rule rule
Hey hey hey hey


Teenage rebels rule okay
I'll be damned if I work all day
I think that you look okay
