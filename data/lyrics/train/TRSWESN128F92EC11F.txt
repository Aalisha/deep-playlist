Don't the water grow the trees
Don't the moon pull the tide
Don't the stars light the sky
Like you need to light my life
If you need me anytime
You know I'm always right by your side
And see I've never felt this love
You're the only thing that's on my mind
You don't understand how much you really mean to me
I need you in my life
You're my necessity

But believe me you're everything
That just makes my world complete
And my love is clear the only thing that I'll ever see
You're all I ever need
Baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me
You're all I ever need
Baby you're amazing
...
