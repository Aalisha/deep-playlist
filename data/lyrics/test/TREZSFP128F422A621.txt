Last night I had a vivid dream,
I found a place where nothing's what it seems,
I'm bound to walk this earth alone,
I am a hunter and the heir to the throne,

The chase of blood and sweet revenge,
It keeps on hammering in my head,
The urge to kill is getting stronger,
I'm south of heaven, north of hell,
My final place to dwell,

Surrender your soul,
Surrender your pride,
Please enter my dream,
Find your natural high,
Have nothing to fear,
Cause your rebirth is near,
...
