Livin' out of a suitcase
Sleepin' in hotel rooms
Rental cars and airport bars
And dog day afternoons

My occupation is a picker
And music is my game
Sometimes it makes me crazy
But I would not change a thing

So lay down a back beat
Crank up your trusty Gibson
Let's give it everything we got just one more time
Lovin' the life we're livin'
Playin' that Georgia rhythm
Nothin' else ever made me feel so fine

Four o'clock in the morning
Waitin' for a plane
We passed around the bottle, Lord
And we don't feel no pain
...
