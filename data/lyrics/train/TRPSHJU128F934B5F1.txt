Darkness falls on landscapes of grace
To mourn the beauty of the past.
Down for the days, feel the pain,
Feed the hollow ground again - again and again!

The sun that never rises died long ago.

Breathe in the black to see,
The razorblade cuts too deep.

Disposed for eternal sleep,
I'm dressed in lost shadows
Like costumes for my dying hope.

Masquerades on broken knees,
