Still I yearn to see chaos and calm in harmony
Arcana that lies beyond the dreams of everblazing skies
And the night fell black upon the ones who yet
Blinded still wander in the mysteries of life
In blood are the murderers hands once again
As I hold you my child for the very last time
Though I'm crushed by grief, there is no other way
"Thou shalt not hesitate, just let it slip away"

I am the Flaming ember
Flood of neverending pain
