This landscape mechanical
Well-oiled black machinery
Bio-driven computers
Programmed for slave labour

For slave labour!

Structure made in urban design
Kills the evolution of the mind
I marching on a dead end path
With misplaced concentration

It's a pitch-black progress
It's a dead end process
It's a pitch-black progress
...
