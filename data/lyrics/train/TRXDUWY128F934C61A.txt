The bodies of millions
Pile atop the splintered streets
Of a now rotting metropolis.
Ignorantly drowning in the flames and fumes
Fabricated by their own doing.
As their limbs smolder and ignite
Their faces steadily ripen with immense pleasure.
Self-execution comes with victory,
Self-mutilation comes with utter success.
Their perception flickers
Within the glowing and ignited landscape
As they gaze toward
The once populated soil.
The nations flag cloaks the
Impure fallen militant bodies,
Fraudelent celebration of integrity.
