Like all birds together we will squawk and we squeak
The joy comes from all our beaks
And ringing bells is our fun
Now our ass is moving as one

If we are forgetting all the rules that we learnt
As all the rule books are burnt
And just as A follows B
Our chorus must always be

So glad to see that you came
We had best times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
...
