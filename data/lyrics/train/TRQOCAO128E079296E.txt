visions haunt my memory
they hold on, hold on desperately
you and i were over long ago
dont know why my heart was the last to go
each time i find somebody new

Chorus
Still in love with you
I know ive been lying to myself
Baby its you
and the more i deny it
the more that its true
Still in love with you

wake up crying in the night
