Awaiting your sentence
Locked up in your hell
Your crime will now be tested
By the jury representing Death
Bitterness inside you
All you feel is hate
Not for the vicious crime
But for the victims you kept alive

Incision, precision, remove the limps
The pulse beats on, the body won't turn cold
I stab, I drill, my intention's clear
My hands they squeeze, but the bastard won't die
