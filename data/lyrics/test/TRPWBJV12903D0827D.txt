You hear my cry, lover of mine
No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and we don't recognize
We parted our lips, and we reached from inside

Wide-open field

Off to nowhere

Need more people to be satisfied
No fear of a god and a prayer for the night
Come into our minds and you rush through our lives
We parted our lips, and we reached from inside
