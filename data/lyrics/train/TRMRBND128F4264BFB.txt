Then she walked away
Quietly so afraid
smiling but no doubt
Crying her heart out
She really just wants to stay

Then she walked away
Leading her own parade
nobody's cheering
The voices she's hearing
are empty remarks she made

How was she to know that
it could come to this.
sorry miss, they forgot to tell you
it was just a game.
just a sad illusion
