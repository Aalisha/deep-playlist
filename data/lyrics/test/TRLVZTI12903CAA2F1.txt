Every window in my hometown is empty
And I really don't know why
And the house you used to live in
Is cold and fallen down, yeah

And I am tired and I'm weary
And Lord, those gray skies bring me down
And I came home for just one reason
To find myself in this quiet town, yeah

And I keep thinkin'

Oh, I'm thinkin' time's been my teacher
I don't want to leave you
So please give me one more try
I'm tired and I'm weary but I want you near me
So please give me one more try

Oh, just give me one more try
One more try
I don't know where to go for one more try
...
