Well down through the ages. woman's had a time
Tryin' to get her man to walk the chalk line
To keep him on a string with a kiss and a hug
But there's never been a man who wasn't bitten by the bug

Yeah rockin' and rollin' with the bug
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug
Itchin' and twitchin' singin' and swingin'
Yeah with the bug

Well Delilah loved Sammy, but he wouldnt stay home
Always runnin' and leavin' Dee home
She set out to find Sammy late one night
Found him down at the sand dune rockin' it right

He was rockin' and rollin' with the bug
Rollin' and strollin' with the bug
Itchin' and twitchin' singin' and swingin'
...
