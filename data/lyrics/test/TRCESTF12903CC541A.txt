They swarm, whenever you're on
For others, they swarm without an on or off
Self-sufficients breed best always on
Ignore, but bioforced never to bypass a swarm
Overfed the self with their faith, tried to tear it all off
But could not, it all stayed on
Strapped myself to the faces that'll never give me anything more

On or Off
On or Off
Somehow I always turn it off
But
I'd rather live a lie that's always on

Upright
...
