I always thought my fortune flowed
All along the River Thames
From Westminster to Southend
Into the sea

I thought I'd find it at the heart
Of every garden and Royal Park
Where money grows on trees
Beneath the moon that's made of cheese

Was just tarmac and concrete
The road sticking to my Converse
As it melted in the heat

Of a muggy Monday morning
Through the smog of global warming
The sun would not be blocked
By any cream bought from a shop

On a busy London high street
That looked just like any other
As it was filmed from every angle
For a voyeuristic Big Brother

The opening of another
