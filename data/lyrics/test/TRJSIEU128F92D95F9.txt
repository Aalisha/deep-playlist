Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
Hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
