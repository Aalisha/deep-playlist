What if I fall along the way
Would you be there...

So you heard, that I'm on my way
Wish that I didn't have to say
Goodbye. I'll rely on your faith in me.

I got my feet on the ground
But my head's in the clouds
Can't forget where I come from
I hope your there when I'm done
I got my feet on the ground
But my head's in the clouds
Can't forget where I come from
I hope your there when I'm...

What If I fall along the way would
You be there to ease the pain?
It's my one shot can't fuck it up
And throw it away. Won't be long.
Won't be long before I break.
