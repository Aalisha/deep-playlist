i want to take you down to the side of the city
where the sun doesn't shine and the moon isn't pretty
the slow train crawls in the nights and the days
are as warm as the smoke and the heat haze
yes and neon here twenty-four hours of the day
and you're sure looking pretty when it's hitting on your face
looker on the corner take that dog for a donor
well she's only doing what her mother told her
i... i wanna take you down
i wanna take you down
i wanna take you right down
i... i wanna take you down
i wanna take you down
i wanna take you right down
i want to see a touch of evil in your eye
...
