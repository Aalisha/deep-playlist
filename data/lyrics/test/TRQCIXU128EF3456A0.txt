I lost my control today
Something came and ate it away
Tears trickle down your face
As quickly as it comes it escapes

Now youâ€¦
You'll never get this far off the ground
Throw in all designs when you're found
You'll never get that far from me now
And damages take one more look around

Science made us skin and bones
