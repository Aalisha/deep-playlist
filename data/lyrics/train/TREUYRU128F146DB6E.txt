(You'll never know)
You'll never, never know I care
You'll never know the torch I bear
You'll never know it, for I won't show it
Oh no you'll never, never know

(You'll never know)
You'll never, never see me cry
Not even when you're glancing by
For I won't weaken, when we're speaking
Oh no you'll never, never know

You'll know the use to me
...
