well, as i came home on Monday night
as drunk as drunk could be
I sar a harse outside the door
where my old harse should be
so i called the whife and i said to her, "Will you kindly tell to me, who owns that harse outside the dar where moy old harse should be?"
"aaah ya drunk ya drunk you silly old fool, i tell you cannot see thats a lovely Sow that me mother sent to me"
"where many a days I travel, a hundered miles or more, but a sow with a saddle on, i never saw before"
Now, as I came home on Tuesday night
as drunk as drunk could be
i sar a coat behind the dar where moy old coat should be
so i called the whife and said to her, "WIll you kindly tell to me, who owns that coat behind the dar, where moy old coat should be?"
"aaah, ya drunk ya drunk ya silly old fool, i tell you cannot see, thats a lovely blanket that me mother sent to me"
