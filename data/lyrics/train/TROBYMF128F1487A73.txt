This one's for all the people who talk
Shoot you down before you reach the top
Cause they just don't know much about me
You know the types that say this and that
Jealous types trying to hold you back
Soon it will be as clear as can be
For those who feel that they need to speak
My life is more than stories on beats
You'd know that if you new about me

Can I just rock a rhyme one time?
Elevate minds enjoy the vibe
Like 93 till infinity I'm alive
I light the vicinity spit the rhyme
But I still receive cut eye, when I, bust rhyme
Must be the light or the shine from the white
It can't be the skill or the beat or the mic
Could it be jealousy that you're not quite like, me
I'm not like you your attitude is at the altitude
Like dude I want to battle you
