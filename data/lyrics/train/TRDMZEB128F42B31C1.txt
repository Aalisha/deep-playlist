Verse 1:
If I were a builder
Then you'd have a castle
Drive on the highest mountain
And if I were a billionaire
I'd give you every material thing
But unfortunately all I have to give to you
Is an imperfect heart
But it's a heart that beats only for you

Chorus:
Listen to this girl if you give me one shot
I will love you forever now
No man will do you better now
Love is a risk
But if you give me one shot
I will show you your the only girl
In the world who can
Give me this feeling
Baby, that's how I feel about you
Your one in a million
I'd rather die than live without you
We can't miss
So if you give me one shot
We can do it girl {we can do it girl} do it girl

Verse 2:
I'm talkin' 'bout love in the mornin'
Just like you want it
Anything you need you can call me for it
Now girl I'm only human
I'm full of many faults
I'm guaranteed to fall short (guaranteed to fall)
But you'll never hear about me cheating
