Remember that August night
The last time I saw your face
I heard you cry
Terrified
When they took you to another place

But now I can see you smile
There's a wall that divides us
Never forgive
The right to live
And all the love that they deny us

Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna find you baby
So you better start running
Ready or not I'm coming
And I'm gonna get to you
No matter what they do
Ready or not I'm coming
Creeping up behind you baby
Let me tell you something
Ready or not I'm coming
Bringing all my love to you
...
