Looking back, all I ever wanted was to go to school
And get a rocking band, playing all the dances could be really cool
We got a date, Friday night a mixer at the high school gym
The band was hot, everybody rocking 'til the jerks rolled in
Who let them in?

They stroll around and stare you down so low
They wanna push you down and put you down so low
What do they know?

Bully bully, oh, bully bully
Bully bully, oh, bully bully
Bully bully, oh, bully bully
Bully bully, oh, bully bully

It started fine everybody dancing having F-U-N
