This love cannot be bought or sold
It's timeless as a story often told
Oh, and this love is never well behaved
Makes me wanna testify
Stand up, tell the world I'm saved

Oh, daughters of Jerusalem
I have seen the day break
And the shadows flee away

I'll break the chains of fear
In the name of this love
Laugh away the tears
