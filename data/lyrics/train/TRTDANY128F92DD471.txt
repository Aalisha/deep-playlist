It was a clear summer day
When I saw the tears on your face

I knew that our times was up on us
Our moment of end was so fast

But the kiss of goodbye always last
Not even time could fade it away

Eventhough you are no longer here
There is still something between us
Eventhough life isn't fair
I'll never lose my trust

Just another lesson to be learned
Gotta move on and lose faith
Just another obstacle to take
Live my life before it gets too late

I wont give up, I wont stay down
...
