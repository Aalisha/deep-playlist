You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man
You do your thinking with a one track mind
Keep talkin' about heaven glory
But on your face is a different story
Clean up your rap your story's getting dusty
Wash out your mouth, your lies are getting rusty
Can't believe nothing you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know, you're funkier than a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of bollweevils
Same old game, same old thing you never changed
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing
I got something to tell ya, I got something to tell you baby
But you ain't hip to baby, blowin' minds is a thing of the past
