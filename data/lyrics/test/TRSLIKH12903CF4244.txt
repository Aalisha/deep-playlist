untouched by grace
fallen are the messengers
hymns of the profane
unheard by the pious
revere the inverted hypocrite
as we breed to the sound of the hammering nail
BEFOUL THE TEACHINGS OF DIVINITY...
words shall unveil the silent truth
like razors through the flesh of the divine
severing the artery from god
abandoned and devoured by the larvae of those who abhor
distant lull
deep in the subconscious
unstoppable urge... uncontrolled
now coming to the surface
their eyes are blind
but the dead shall always see
the coming entity
...
