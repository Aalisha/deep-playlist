I talk with my friend over the phone
I'm scared to say things I don't know & be wrong
And words always sound much better
Coming out of someone else
But put it in a song
And I know that we can get along

I'm trying to lose, lose my mind
When it's gone, I'll tell you where it went
About the extent of it's stay
Strum a few chords & use my voice
...
