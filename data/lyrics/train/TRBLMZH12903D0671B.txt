I remember the day
Still remember the time
I remember the place and the weather
When i heard the news about you
I recall what she said
On the morning i received the news
Nearly droped to my knees from the message
How can this be true about you

Things just ain't be the same
Since the day you ran away
I must be strong to carry on
How am I to make it on my own
Physically, fressing me
Reletualy, tuensing me
...
