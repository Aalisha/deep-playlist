If you do want me
Give me a little sugar
If you don't want me
You can't lead me on, girl
If you do need me
Show me that you love me
So when I'm feeling down
Or I'm wearing a frown
You'll be there when I look around
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl
Oh, my baby
To show me that you're mine, girl
Alright
Just gimme some kind of sign, girl
Oh, my baby
(Show me that you're mine)
Show me that you're mine!
Alright
