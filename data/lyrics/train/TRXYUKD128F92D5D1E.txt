There was a time when I was younger
My love was cold and I didn't know wich way to go
Then I was found by a shiny flower
She took me in and saved me from stormy wind

Christine - everyday she is so good - so good to me
Christine - she's everything a man would ever need
Christine - she lifts me up when I'm feeling low
Christine you mean the world to me
