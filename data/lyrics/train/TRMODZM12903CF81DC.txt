Sunrise
Wake up stand up look into red eyes
Stayed up all night thinking of
Reasons why I cant feel your skin

Is this plaguing your brain? [x2]

Couldn't brace yourself in the morphine hallway
Lying on the ground with a heart as a ball and chain
Message to the bird I know your wings will be fine
Spread them on the floor, learn to heal with take time

Close the hatch and lock us inside (Now breath in wide I'll forgive you later)
Close the hatch and lock us inside (Come on it's time just stand aside)

All these reasons why
I am reaching wide
I am sticking to all these one liners
And all this means
And all I have to say
...
