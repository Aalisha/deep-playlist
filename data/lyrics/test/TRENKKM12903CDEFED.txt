I've found a sweet haven of sunshine at last,
and Jesus abiding above,
His dear arms around me are lovingly cast
and sweetly He tells His love

The tempest is o'er (The danger, that tempest forever is o'er)
I'm safe evermore (My anchor is holding, I'm save evermore)
What gladness what rapture is mine
The danger is past (The water is peaceful, the danger is past)
I'm anchored at last (I'm feeling so happy I'm anchored at last)
I'm anchored in love divine
