There was a girl i used to see,
down on 42nd street.
She walked by on her way to work
makimg the air smell so sweet.
I used to sit in a coffee shop, sometimes i'ld have a cup.
When she'ld go by she'ld light up the sky like the sun coming up.
I be standing by the bus stop, driver open up the door.
I'ld just sit and watch her, getting on the 104.
I wanna give her my number, i wanna tell her my name.
Wanna climb on board that cross town bus, take a chance she feels the same.
Its just another east side story.
