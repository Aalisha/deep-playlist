A cheap suffocation.
A bloody genocide.
I feel your breath escaping.
This time it won't take long.
Bringing all to ruin,
I will set flames unto the body
that lies undone
and when your life passes through your eyes
I won't remember you or your disgusting fate
the unyielding fear the relentless pain.
I won't remember you.
