Hey Father
I want to put you to an end
Hey Father
I'm almost over it again

Hey Father
You were never my friend
Hey Father
I've lost my mind again

Officer, what will you do?
Officer, I'll pay you

I'll pay you to shoot him now
I will you pay you to take him out
I will pay you to shoot him now
I'll pay you to blow his brains out
