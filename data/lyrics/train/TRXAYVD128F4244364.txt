Pop songs your new boyfriend's too stupid to know about
Pop songs your new boyfriend's too stupid to know about
Pop songs your new boyfriend's too stupid to know about
Pop songs your new boyfriend's too stupid to know about

True he likes the Breeders
He thinks Green Day's pretty swell
But what about the Bartlebees and Neutral Milk Hotel?
It's okay for a sunny day but that Sting album won't do
So when I play you Allen Clapp, you'll know baby I love you!

Hey hey

Pop songs your new boyfriend's too stupid to know about
Pop songs your new boyfriend's too stupid to know about
Pop songs your new boyfriend's too stupid to know about
Pop songs your new boyfriend's too stupid to know about

Sure he buys you records
If you like them by U2
But if you want the Pastels
