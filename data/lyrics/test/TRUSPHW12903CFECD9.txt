Thousands of soldiers march to their fate
Lambs to the slaughter, certain death awaits
Trapped on a field littered with bones
Nations of fallen lying below

Now you march forwards - die to
Ten million bodies piled high
Mechanized engines of war spitting lead
Horrors of battle fill you with dread
Bombs are falling, death is calling
...
