He can't take the street no more
Street too full, full of junk
Thinks he'll hide in his room
Room too full, full of junk

He turns on his TV, TV full, full of junk
Processed zombies pushing junk
Junk food, junk clothes
Dressed in junk from head to toe

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
...
