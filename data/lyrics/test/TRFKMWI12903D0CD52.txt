Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang
Could be dangerous do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style

Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin' ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin' ruckus

Ghostface, catch the blast of a hype verse
My glock bursts, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Ya head rush, fly like Egyptian musk

Aw shit, Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However, I master the trick just like Nixon
Causin terror, quick damage ya whole era

Hardrocks is locked the fuck up, or found shot
P L O style, hazardous, 'cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow sparks like Waco, Texas

I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hittin' sound, watch me act bugged and tear it down
A literate type asshole, songs goin gold, no doubt
And you watch a corny nigga fold

Yeah, they fake and all that
Carryin gats but yo, my Clan rollin' like forty Macs
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo sew represent
