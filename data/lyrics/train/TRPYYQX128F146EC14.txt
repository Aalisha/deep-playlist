I'm at work, I don't feel like working
The sun is out, don't tell me off for lazing
It's so hot 'cause my ice cream's melting
We're only used to the same rain belting
Belting down, why don't we take the top down
And drive around and pump up the sound
Leave this desk, oh yes, this is a protest
Go to the seaside and you could be my guest

Rest assured, you know we'll have a good time
Bathe in the sea and bathe in the sunshine
We've got all day 'cause this time is all mine
We'll take it easy, the sun goes down at nine
We'll take a hamper with some cashews and shampoos
...
