I'm dustin' off Hank and I'm puttin' him on
And I'm gonna drink one and listen to a country song
The way it sounded in nineteen fifty-two
I'm takin' some old things and makin' 'em new

I'm pickin' up the phone and I'm startin' to dial
A number of friends I haven't talked to in a while
And I'm gonna tell 'em that I love 'em, yes I do
I'm takin' some old things and makin' 'em new
