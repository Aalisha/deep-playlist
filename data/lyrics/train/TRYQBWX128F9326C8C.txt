I think you wanna come over
Yeah I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
(Think about it)
Doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for

Feel my temperature rising
It's too much heat
I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher?
Get closer to the fire
I don't what you're waiting for

I'm gonna party
(Yeah)
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started
(Yeah)
'Cause everybody wants to party with you

Boy you got a reputation
But you're gonna have to prove it
I see a little hesitation
