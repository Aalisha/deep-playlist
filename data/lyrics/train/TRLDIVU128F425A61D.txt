Don't say goodbye, girl
Goodbye, girl
Don't make me cry girl, cry girl
'Cos I love you, love you

Used to have such fun, used to have good times
But now those days are gone
Used to have it all, used to get on fine
But things just went wrong

Used to be in love
Thought we had it made
But everything has changed
We just grew apart no one is to blame

Woh, woh, woh, woh
Time has made us strangers
Maybe we can't go on
But if love can take the changes

Don't say goodbye, girl
Goodbye, girl
Don't throw it all away
'Cos I love you
Yes I do, yes I do

Don't make me cry, girl
You're my girl
Don't say goodbye to me
'Cos I love you
Yes I do, yes I do

We could go along saying things were fine
But we're just fooling ourselves
Maybe we should talk it out right now
And put things on the line
...
