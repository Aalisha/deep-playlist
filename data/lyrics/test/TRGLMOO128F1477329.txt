Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
And ya Running Away.
Ya running and ya running
But ya can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself
Can't run away from yourself.

Ya must have done (must have done)
Somet'in' wrong (something wrong)
Said: ya must have done (must have done)
Wo! Somet'in' wrong (something wrong)
Why you can't find the
Place where you belong?

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (Running Away)

Every man thinketh his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
...
