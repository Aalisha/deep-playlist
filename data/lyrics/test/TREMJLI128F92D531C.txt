The human soul is always free

Some people they keep secrets
They say that we are not telling
And I know in their silence
It slips right through their fingers
Scared eyes are blinking
Heads held high ak reasons

Try for such big ideas

You take the hand and you break it boy
They can't really see
That you're trying to be right
You take her by the arm
You say what my dear
That wasn't very nice
You better change your mind

Why are you telling me this
