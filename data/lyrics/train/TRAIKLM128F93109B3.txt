I've painted these walls a million times
I drove so far to say these lines
The only thing I wanted was with you

And I've packed my bags, yeah I'll be fine
I've made some calls, I've said goodbye
She'll see me in a couple days
She'll wipe the smile off my face

You're not looking yourself today,
I can see it in the way that your hands shake
And you know that you're no good for no one else but me, love
And you're trying not to act so cute
With your hands in your pocket and one on your locket
Show me something new
