Comformity training center
Seas of mindless brain dead kids
Wandering lost forever
What an education is

Don't speak out, don't make waves
You get an education free
Just play along with our games
This system just ain't right for me
Faculty not ready to accept our needs
Schools geared to what parents want to see
Knowledge comes second to doing what you're told
We deny you exist we have an image to uphold
