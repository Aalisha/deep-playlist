Standing in your line,
You know I gave you half my time.
Just what it used to be
Never meant that much to me.
Held you to close;
I think I often ran from this,
So where did it go?

I'll leave it all behind, I'll leave it all behind
Standing in your line, standing in your line
You know I gave you half my time.
