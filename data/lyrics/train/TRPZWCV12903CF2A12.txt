God damn alarms are ringing in my head
Wake up world or we're all gonna wind up dead
Look around I see the hate and the greed
Lifestyles of the rich still people dying in need
Wake up world things are gettin' serious
I'm looking at the future and it don't look too good for us
If we don't take the situation at hand
And spread a message of peace all throughout the land
Cause I'm looking through the eyes of tomorrow
And all I see is misery and sorrow
Desperation and despair everywhere
Reactions of a system that just don't care
Greedy politicians leading people astray
They just want more money they don't care what it takes
Polluting the earth destroying the environment
Building bombs for war and killing the innocent
My mind's in a rage they got me living like an animal
They're feeding off human lives just like cannibals
Killing the planet and everything on it
With their chemical waste dumps and nuclear power plants
Our tax dollars are killing people overseas
Still people dying at home but no one hears their pleas
