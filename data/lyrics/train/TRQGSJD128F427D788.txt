I put an apb on you tonight searchlights citywide
I flash your face upon the news at nine
I put the heat on high whatever I gotta do to find you
Won't let fair-weather friends step in to hold ya back or blind you

I need you more than ever
You are the only one
Better be sure put out
An all-points bulletin
All-points bulletin
