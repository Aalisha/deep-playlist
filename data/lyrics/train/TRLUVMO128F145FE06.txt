We’ve been livin' a lie
We’re not what we seem to be
And we’ve had enough of being fooled
Now we wanna be free

Sure, we be livin' a dream
(Somebody else’s)
And now we wanna live on
But we got to leave this game behind
And know who we really are

Don’t let anyone take over your life, no, no, no
Don’t give up your dreams and you’ll be alright, no, no
They think they can control you but they should’ve told you
When you’re a clone, you know you’re never alone

Who, who do you think you are?
Do you know for sure? Now tell me
Who, who do you think you are?
Do you know for sure? Now tell me, baby

Who do you think you are?
