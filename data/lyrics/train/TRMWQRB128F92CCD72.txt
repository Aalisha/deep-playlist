Well all I want is a party doll,
To come along with me when I'm feelin' wild,
To be everlovin', true and fair,
To run her fingers through my hair.

Come along and be my party doll,
Come along and be my party doll,
Come along and be my party doll,
I wanna make love to you, to you,
I wanna make love to you.
