[Rome Talkin]
Young Rome
1st album
Im here now
Yo yea
Let me get at yall for a second

[Verse]
Yo I spit like no other
I let my flow smotha
Cities and burrows im thorough
Rich but im so gutta
Im so rookie you'd think I was satins advocate
Im bad bruh bad as JLo so call me Affleck
Sick of dis sickle cell anemia
Platinum status so I treat hoes like they the media
