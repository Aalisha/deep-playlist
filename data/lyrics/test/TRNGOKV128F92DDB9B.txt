Now, I wish it was last September
We could lose ourselves in crowds everyday
'Cause Emaline, don't walk in time,
She's not the same that's all you can say.
(*When I've heard enough, I tell myself)
That we've learnt our lesson, but I,
Don't wanna walk away from Emaline.

They're talking now.
Does she know what they're saying?
She's got the air, to float above it.
I'm sinking in the "Someone Should Pay".
She's dear to me, and so expensive.
Now I'm not talking 'bout money.
Money talks,
