I think you're wrong you think your right; and all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
we may wake up on the wrong side, lets not go to bed mad tonight

{Monica}
Time is ticking, my eyes are getting heavy but I know we got to squash this
So boy what's poppin its time for dropping, copping attitudes right now
It's not for nothing cause this aint nothing, don't you know that I love you
Its hard to stop and think about it, you will see its stupid

Argue about things so critical
And get heated over nothing
And just hang up the phone
See I won't wanna talk in the morning
See we need a resolution like that Aaliyah song

I think you're wrong you think your right; and all that equals up to is a fight
Let's compromise before we go to bed tonight
Cause if the fight don't die before the sun rise
we may wake up on the wrong side, lets not go to bed mad tonight

{Tyrese}
What time is it? Im not on a mission to stay up with you all night
