The unprecedented spirit of now

There's a corner inside this second
A reward just beyond this day
There's a rest house inside this minute
We ignore it and rush through our lives

Find the logic inside the jumble
Reach the silence inside of the noise
Miss the moments we never captured
As we travel our separate ways

Angling feelings
On the run
Move the movements
Watch the sun
Cross a blizzard
Fill with doubt
Ourselves angling feelings
Let them in

Into our naked fate
Open our trust again
Into our hearts

There's a feeling beneath the surface
There's a feeling beyond the light
...
