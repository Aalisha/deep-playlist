He clasps the crag with crooked hands
Deformed from gripping the rock so tight
Close to the sun in lonely lands
But the wax never melts from his wings
Ringed with the azure world he stands
Emperor of the sky
Lord of the ocean
The very image of a king

His outstretched feathers overwhelming the sky
And his innate pride to lead
Suggest power
Not modesty
But he never kills without consuming
And though he is always watchful of his surroundings
As he skims the surface
I suspect he doesn't realize the panic
His shadow induces
In the hearts of the creatures underneath
The overflowing surge of relief
They feel as he revisits
...
