Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin

Beggin, beggin you, put your loving hand out baby?
Beggin, beggin you, put your loving hand out baby?
Ridin' high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast 'cause I had everything
You walked away, you want me then but easy come and easy go and it would end
Yeah, beggin', I'm beggin you, put your loving hand out baby?
