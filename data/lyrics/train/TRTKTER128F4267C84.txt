TV’s broke, heating’s out of order
Lousy day, hours don’t get no shorter
Need ah laugh, to put you on your feet
And baby, I’m the one you need

So get on the line, any ole time
I’m always ready to make you smile
Girl pick up the phone, if you’re alone
And I’ll be over in just ah while
Baby, all you do is dial

Out of cash, no food in the freezer
Been stood up, date was just ah teaser
...
