I can't take you to the movies
And I can't tell the real thing
From a fake
But I'm curled up tight
In your Chevrolet
And baby you got wow
You've got what it takes
You've got no brakes
I can't take you anywhere these days
Baby you're going wild
Your lips and nylons
Baby you've got what I think
I think it takes
You've got no taste
