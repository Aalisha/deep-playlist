It was strange glue that held us together
While we both came apart at the seams
She said your place or mine
While we've still got the time
So I played along with her schemes

But i don't have the right to be with you tonight
So please leave me alone with no saviour in sight
I will sleep safe and sound with no body around me

When faced with my demons
I clothe them and feed them
