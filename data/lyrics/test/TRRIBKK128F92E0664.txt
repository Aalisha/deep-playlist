Setzer

Some people like to live
Where the livin' is good
Other people just like to live
Down in Hollywood
Some people say live and let live
On the edge of town
But don't nobody try to
Hold me down

We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
We only got sixty years on the planet
And if you get anymore
You might wish that you hadn't

Some people try to tell me
What I should be doin'
Spent all my money
