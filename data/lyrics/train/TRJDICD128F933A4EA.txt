Coming back around
Baby, just when I need it
Stuck inside my head
You're a groove to my needle
Got nowhere to go, 'cause you know I don't want to
What's on your mind?
Slip back into bed
I'll pretend not to notice
Open up my eyes with you already in focus
From our blurry past
No one else needs to know us
You can look me in the eye
'Cause I'm right here
Open up and I will listen
The pleasure is mine
Any old time
If I can spend a minute with you
The future is ours
Lost in the stars
