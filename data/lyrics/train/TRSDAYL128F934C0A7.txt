One last natural obstacle
The Luga river crossed
Determinded to take Leningrad
No matter the cost
Not the final stormattack

Build up the surrounding
A city under siege

Man the ramparts
and the barricades
Attempts fail to break
through this blockade
In a circle of hostillity
Easy target for artilliery
