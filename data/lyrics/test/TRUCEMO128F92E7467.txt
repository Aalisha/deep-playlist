I wish you out of the woods
And into a picture, with me
I wish you over the moon
Come out of the question, and be

If this is gonna
Run, round, in my head
I might as well be dreaming
Run, round, in my head

I roller coaster for you
Time out of mind
Must be heavenly
It's all enchanted and wild
It's just like my heart said
It's gonna be
