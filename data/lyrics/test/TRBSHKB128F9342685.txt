It was a night oo-oo what a night
It really was such a night
The moon was bright oh how so bright
It really was such a night
The night was alight with stars above
Oo-oo when she kissed me
I had to fall in love
Oh it was a kiss oo-oo what a kiss
It really was such a kiss
Oh how she could kiss oh what a kiss
It really was such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips
Sets me afire
I reminisce and I'm filled with desire
But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
