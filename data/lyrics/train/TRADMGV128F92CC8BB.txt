(Intro sample:)
Do you think a girl should go to bed with a feller, if she doesn't love him?
No. Unless it's me.

I heard she drove the silvery sports-car
Along the empty streets last night
Hanging around
With hair-dos like mine
No, I haven't seen the kids for some time

Picked up her shoes from the red-brick stairway
Just like a harpsichordist she moved
And back upstairs
At half past two
With a paper folded, outside the loo

Rain falls
Like Elvis tears
Oh no
...
