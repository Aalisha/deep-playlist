A lady, cold blooded, dressed in tight fitting white
She possesses a mansion 
Her home better known as the lair of the white worm
Her eyes, a deeper green, glowing light in the dark
And at night she`s a snake 
Dwelling in the pits of the lair of the white worm

A secret well preserved 
She`s lurking in the dark
No-one ever made it back alive

No-one knows it is her
Monstrosity in a human form
She`s a thing of the night
She transforms in a snake in the lair of the white worm
The pit in her house goes down to the bowels of the earth
Pray God you`ll never meet this creature from the deep of the lair of the white worm
