Another fucking day
it's still a nine to five, I swear.
I don't want to reach the top.
I don't want to be a millionare.
I know that it may sound crazy,
but it's driving me insane.
Staring out the window of another fucking train.

(CHORUS) We're walking arm to arm. I won't follow.
Arm to arm. I won't lead.
Arm to arm. Beside me until tomorrow.
