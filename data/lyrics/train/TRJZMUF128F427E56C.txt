Rags to riches, so they say
She got her break and she found her way
I admit this may sound strange
This girl is dancing a different way

If they only knew how You've mended
My broken wings, now I'm flying

Your love is Heaven on Earth
I'll shout it out to all of the world
There's no doubt my greatest dream has come true
Just to be loved by You
