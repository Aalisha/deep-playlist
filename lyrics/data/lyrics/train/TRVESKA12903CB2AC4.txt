[Jamie Madrox]
They told me, to let go and dream of torture
And horrible things of that kind
They told me, you're only good as a thought you keep
In your head when you unlock your mind
They told me, you'll never win cause you're doomed to fail
And everything that you do just ain't right
They told me, I need to quit acting like a child
And grow up and get on with my life
I told them,

[Chorus]
Fuck you motherfucker fuck you fuck-die
Fuck you motherfucker fuck you fuck-die
Fuck you motherfucker fuck you fuck-die
Fuck you motherfucker fuck you fuck-die

[Monoxide Child]
They told me, be afraid of the ones around you
Cause nobody's gunna have your back
They told me, make sure you get used to lonely
Cause they're gone when you fall face flat
