Girl, you been on my mind all day
And I been thinking of what I was gonna say
When you got here, um, I want you to relax
Let your hair down cause tonight is the night
For me to blow your mind

It's time to relax, it's time to unwind
Whatever's on your mind, girl, leave it outside, outside
Tell me your fantasy girl, cause I want you to be, free to explore
There's so much more if you let me

If you let me blow your mind tonight
Baby, it'll be okay if you let go with me
Baby, just let me take time control tonight
Take ya to another place, girl
Somewhere that you can't explain,

I know that you've had your reservations
...
