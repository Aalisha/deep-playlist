I gotta gotta take a trip, gotta take a trip out of this place
I gotta gotta get away, get away from the human race
I don't know what I'll see, don't even know what I'll find
I don't know what to pack, never been to a trip at the mind

Chorus:
Trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
Do you know what I'm saying
Trip at the brain, trip at the brain, trip at the brain -
Well, I'm going insane
