Don't blow your cover, honey
Some things a man shouldn't see
Lean on your sisters and me
You can't go wrong

Don't show that sucker your soul
He'll get his hands on your gold
You won't know how much he stole
Until he's gone

Don't blow your cover, honey
Some things a man shouldn't see
Lean on your sisters and me
You can't go wrong

Don't show that sucker your soul
He'll get his hands on your gold
You won't know how much he stole
Until he's gone

My sunshine, beat him up good for me
Been a long journey, long car ride
Chillin' ain't good for me
My sunshine, beat him up good again
Been a long journey, long car ride
Chillin' gives me the best

If you wanna be, I got some
If you wanna buy, I don't pay
If you wanna feel all my fun
'Cause if it's in my eyes I got game

If you wanna be, I got some
