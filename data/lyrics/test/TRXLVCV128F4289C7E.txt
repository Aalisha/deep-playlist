You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
I'm down
(I'm really down)
I'm down
(Down on the ground)
I'm down
(I'm really down)

How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?

Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen every day
I'm down
(I'm really down)
I'm down
(Down on the ground)
I'm down
(I'm really down)

How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
