Out beyond the recon point
Battle weary, nerves now frayed
One step closer to oblivion
Abandoned life the price to pay

The final sacrifice - ushered to the grave
There is no time to run or hide
No chance to pray

Mankind's legacy - past knowledge saved
Glory not given - respect is made

Stranded in no man's land
...
