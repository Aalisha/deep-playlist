Well it doesn't look much like we'll see the new year
Cos all the bright young faces are here
And I can't see us rising to their occasion any more
No, not their Christmas cheer

Time is against us, even love conspires to disgrace us
And with things being what they are ...
Yes and things being what they are

Oh my friend, we used to walk in the flames
Now somebody's taken my arms
The shadows are taller. you're missing your halo
...
