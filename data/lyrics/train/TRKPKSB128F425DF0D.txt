Now once upon a time in a nursery rhyme
Three little men got lost
Like you and me they couldn't agree
And upon the wave they tossed

Well, I'll sing their tune 'cause I got marooned
With the love I can't forget
Now the three little men just took me in
On an ocean of regret

With a rub-a-dub-dub, three men in the tub
Lost on the ocean blue
I roll like a hub, sing, rub-a-dub-dub
'Cause you broke my heart in two
