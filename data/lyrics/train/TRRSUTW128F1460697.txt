Alright let's do this
Yeah, J-Weezy Bozzy J Well
Yeah, Young Sco Cal Holmes
We about to do it real big
Take it somewhere
We ain't never took it to before, outside

I just rolled up in my Benzo
I just rolled up some of that you know
I just popped out of nowhere like whadday know
And I ain't going nowhere you know

Y'all don't know half of my scenario
I got niggas all up in my cereal
And don't know if it's Applejacks or Cheerios
Y'all don't hear me though

It ain't no clothes in your ear to scope
See I just took over your stereo
Eighteen year old college material
Puttin' Philly on the map, Philly on my cap
The imperial superior

And all the skirts wanna give it to Sco
Till these shirts, mini skirts wanna give it to Sco
Stick works, skinny work but I'd rather have a fatter
If she pay 'em like she weigh 'em, give it to Sco

See, me my crew ain't nothing but trouble
And we be coming through like nothing but trouble
And niggaz tell us we ain't nothing but trouble
Especially, me, I ain't nothing but trouble
