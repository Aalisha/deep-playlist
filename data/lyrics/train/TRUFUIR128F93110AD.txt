i will come to pick you up
you'l be wating by the church down town
noones gona make you stop
wi'll be raiding strait out of this town
like so many times before
when we reach the shore
we dive into the sea
the sea of love
we dive into the sea
the sea of love
you look so pretty to night
have i told you that you look like a moviestar?
and this can't lie
...
