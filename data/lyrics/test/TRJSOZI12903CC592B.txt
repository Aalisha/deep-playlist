You float in a million lights
But the one you seek is not there
You fight in a million fights
But it's yourself you cannot bear

You think you are a leader
But you turn everyone away
You think you are a preacher
But you can't turn night into day

Well there is something inside of me
And I know that it's growing
Well the thing that will forever be
And I feel its shadow calling

It is the fear that drives you mad
It is the fear that makes you blind
...
