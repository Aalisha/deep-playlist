You told me who you were 
But i guess i never heard 
You thought it treason 

'til i saw you from the floor 
Running out the door 
You had your reasons 

But don't close your eyes 
'cause you might need them now 
But don't close your eyes 
You might need them now 

Well, i pulled you off the fence 
To see the consequence; 
We didn't dream it
