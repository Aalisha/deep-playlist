Truth about Roni she's a sweet little girl
You can treat her right real nice and hold her tight
Only tender Ronis can give the special love
A special kind of love that makes you feel good inside
You believe in love and all that it can do for you
Give it a chance girl you'll find romance
And if you find a tender Roni that is right for you
Make it official
Give her your love... (love...)
(my heart) Ooh
(belongs to a Roni)
She's my only love
(she's my only love...)
My only heart baby
(my heart) Yeah
(belongs to a Roni)
She's my only love
(she's my only love...)
The truth about Roni she's always on the phone
Talkin' to her homeboy wishin' they were home alone ooh
She sends you lovely letters with the smell of sweet perfume
This is what a real tender Roni likes to do for you
And if you believe in love and all that it can do for you
Give it a chance girl you'll find romance
And if you find a tender Roni that is right for you
Make it official
