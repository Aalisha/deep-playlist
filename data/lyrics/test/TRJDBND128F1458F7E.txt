Under the house
Under the house
It came out of the wall
A single cadaver
(under the house)
It went under the house
Scream in the trees
Under the moon
(scream in a dream)
Solid the grave
(vile stinking)
Stone cold ambition
Solid and gross
It went under the house
It's not the sun I wear as a crown
I colour the clouds
Under the house
Solid the grave
Stone cold ambition
...
