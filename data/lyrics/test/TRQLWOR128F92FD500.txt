If you want it in the mornin'
Just call my name
If you want it in the evenin', baby
Just do the same

Let me
(Sock it you, sock it to you)
(Sock it to ya, sock it to ya)
The way a woman can
Let me
(Give it to you, baby)
Make you feel like a real

Gimme, gimme, gimme
(Give it to me, give it to me, gimme)
Gimme, gimme, gimme
(Give it to me, give it to me, gimme)
Gimme, gimme, gimme
(Give it to me, give it to me, gimme)
