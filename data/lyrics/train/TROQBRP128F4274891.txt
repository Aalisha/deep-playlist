I need your love living inside of me
I need your love living abundantly
Can't live without your love, no
So keep giving love, keep on giving me love

Woman and man, giving what I say that I am
Receiving all you need, say that you can
Share unselfishly your fidelity
Give me what I need, baby

I need your love living inside of me
I need your love living abundantly
Can't live without your love, no
So keep giving love, keep on giving me love
