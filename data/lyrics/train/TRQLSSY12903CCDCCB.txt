Please excuse me, I've been living in the past
I have walked the same old path for many years
Please excuse me, can you guide me, I am lost
All these places, this map, they just don't match

What has happened, what is wrong, I'm homeward bound
Where's the winding road that's leading to our house
Where's the bridge and where's the forest where I walked
In my childhood, all I see is a motorway

Where are the fishes that were swimming in our lake
Watch this dry land which has driven away the rain
What's that fear I can perceive inside the night
