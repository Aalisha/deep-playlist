Call out the soft sound,
the 4 letter word divine?
call it up, Call out the soft sound
and make it round everyone together
hell for leather, over good ground

all caught up in love struck
all caught up in love struck hands, struck hands

your all caught up in love struck
never seem to get enough
and everything you wanted going get it,
goes, there it goes
