Your beauty took my breath away,
in awe all day,
your company was so relaxing,
easy going ways,
we saw the first signs of summer and springtime change,
walking barefoot along the sand,
i hadn't planned to stay

yeah we've been walking barefoot
all summer
it'll be sad my friend
to see it come to an end
why can't we just quit

you are broke all summer
but you still sing
don't need money when it's sunny,
don't need anything
just need music and sun and laughter
and no currency
the sun on your bare shoulders,
comes for free

yeah we've been walking barefoot
all summer
it'll be sad my friend
...
