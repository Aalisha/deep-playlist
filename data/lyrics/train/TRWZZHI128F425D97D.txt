We're sending out a message to the future
That words could not communicate
Don't think it's something that's electric
Just 'cause we're using the radio waves

We're turning on the lights
Down through the halls of time
Flip on the switch, illuminate the future
Send a shock through the power lines

Turn it up so everyone hears it
...
