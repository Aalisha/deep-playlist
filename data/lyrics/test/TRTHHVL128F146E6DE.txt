Well, Josie walks around
Like she's bought herself some brand new clothes
Singing to herself
Swinging for the sidewalk Jones

She's got a cousin down in Reno
Says, "The money is coming fast"
So she's packing it up
But her Mama says, "It ain't gonna last"

Wait it out, wait it out
So tired of hearing that I got to slow it down
I ain't gonna listen to them tell me how
I just got to burning and I won't stop now
