Your eyes have grown tired of
Hunting for the fox and the owl
For smooth stones
And a safe place to hide
In the hills near your home

Now you walk with bare feet through the wet sand
And a boy sees you and comes running over
And stands about forty seashells away
Wanting to walk on water
To turn you on
But you don't pay any attention at all
As the world rises and falls
As the world rises and falls
...
