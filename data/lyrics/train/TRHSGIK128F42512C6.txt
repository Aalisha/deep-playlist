Woah momma, woah pappa,
You should have seen your little son.

The first time the youth, come a New York,
Them tellin' you, you must'nt skylark,
Learn a trade or go to school,
And don't you turn yourself in a fool.

But now him gone, a Riker's Island,
He never want go a Riker's Island.

Him used to walk and screw up him face,
But now him spending 'nuff time up-state.
Dey used to tell 'im, understand,
But now dem find him with a M-1.
Inna 'im pocket, him have a million,
So, now him gone, a Riker's Island.
He never want go a Riker's Island,
But now him gone a Riker's Island.
Mmmm, oy.

Him used to chuck it, from Brooklyn to Bronx,
And a gwarn like a big top Ranks,
But 'nuff a him government response.
'Cause him gone, a Riker's Island,
He never want go a Riker's Island.
Now him gone a Riker's Island,
...
