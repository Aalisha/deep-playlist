Here I am again,
Overwhelming feelings
A thousand miles away
From your ocean home
Part of me is near

Thoughts of what we were invade
The miles that stand between
Can't separate
You're all I hoped you'd become

Sister, I see you
Dancing on the stage
Of memory
Sister, I miss you

Fleeting visits pass
...
