Out on the tarmac
There stands Scouse Jack
Megaphone and anorack
Shouting out â�‚¬ËœListen Matt
Choose Christianity, donâ�‚¬â„¢t choose humanityâ�‚¬â„¢
He lost sanity a long time ago

Coming out of Topshop
Girl with a mop top
Cheeky little boob tube
YouTube lover
Round at the back door, crack whore,
Morals slack for a reason, Iâ�‚¬â„¢ll tell you whatâ�‚¬â„¢s more

Play her down and beat her
Treat her meaner
Never made her keener, man you shouldâ�‚¬â„¢ve seen her
Now on the forecast, sheâ�‚¬â„¢s got a snow blast,
She better run fast, sheâ�‚¬â„¢ll die a young lass

All the sinners and the winners, sitting down for dinner,
All the salaries are fat, the mistresses are thinner,
All these cats have their kittens on celery,
And all these twats have their mittens on the treasury
...
