Our cannons have more strength than yours
Our weapons take more lives than yours
Our soilders are obsessed with gore

Accepting of the hand were dealt
We kill until there's nothing left
And we just want you to melt

Strength pride obsessed
We kill until there's nothing left
And when they're dead your ass is next!

We spit our beer upon your corpse
Without the slightest of remorse
With radioactive force!

No resistance to our radioactive force
We march until everything is scorched

Tired of the things you've done
...
