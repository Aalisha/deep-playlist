She's hot like red pepper
Sweet like cherry wine
I'm so glad she love me
Love me all the time
She's my little baby
Sweet as she can be
All this love she's got
It belong to me
If you hear me howlin'
Callin' on my darlin'
Sayin' ooh hoo, hoo hooee
Every time she kiss me
She make the lights go out
Up early in the morning
She make me jump and shout
This bad love I've got
Make me laugh and cry
