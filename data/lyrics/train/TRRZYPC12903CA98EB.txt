I owe you twenty dollars baby, you were right
I guess I should have thought it through before
I swear that all I've done since I got off the flight
Is missed you much and then missed you some more

Unpack my bags, put on some tunes
But all it did was make me think of you
Now I'm a wreck, I miss my beau
Being away from you is just not cool

I love what you do to me baby
The touch of you makes me go crazy
I figure there's only one thing to do
I gotta get back to you

I need you to whisper in my ear
And tell me the things that I want to hear
The moment that I got here boy I knew
I've gotta get back to you

Rush, rush now boy
Running on back to you
Rush rush boy
As fast as I can to you
