Come, all ye non-believers, feel the creases in her
brow
Look once and then you'll know she was not very loud
Touch her eyes and feel the shadows growing on her
face
Take seconds to catch your breath before you slow the
pace

Come, all ye non-belivers, but leave your books behind
Your knowledge is wasted here, for love there's always
time
Reach out for emptiness as she crowds you from the
room
Let falling tears paint your face but don't do it too
...
