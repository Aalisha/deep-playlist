Since the time we met never shall forget
The magic feeling when I look in your eyes
Every now and then I see you again
But the words never come out right
I've always been painfully shy
I hide what I feel inside
Tonight I
(Never let you get away)
Open my heart
(Invite you in to stay)
I need you
(More than words can say)
And I hope you feel the same
Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine
You've captured my heart
And I won't take no for an answer
Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine
Hope that there's a chance, baby
That we can get together
'Cause I
(Gonna make you mine)
Gonna make you see
(Gonna make you mine)
You were meant for me
(Gonna make you mine)
I wanna love you endlessly
Many times before I would just ignore
Love when it came around and knocked on my door
