Silence is a power and tool, for you, for you
Wild Tigers I Have Known, they see me down, messin' around.
You keep your heart from your chest,
It'll be gone, just like the rest,
Cause it's a man's world, say all the right words, and hold your heart from your chest,
The silence and the call, and their beauty, stands right and still for you.
