Heard the rattle from the train
Sounds of a hundred people, maybe more
Cut through the ropes before you came
I had a dream that you were gone

I'm in the days of throwing rocks
When I saw your picture on a silver coin
Stole a kiss through your golden locks
I had a dream that you were gone
Woke up and you were gone
