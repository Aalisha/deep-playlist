Yeah you know, Rasta live
Universal sign of love
Love is the answer my friend
And love is the only way

Yeah, true love you can find yourself
And call a true identities
Love your brother, love your sister
Love one another the universal sign
I'll take it from here

Love is much more to life than just words
Love means much more than to say you love
Love is call on me brother
Love is call on me sister
