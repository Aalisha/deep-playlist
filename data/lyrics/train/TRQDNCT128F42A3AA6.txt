Ahhhhh... Ohh 
You can be an alcastar 

We're the VIP, everything's for free 
It's a life filled with love and emotion 
This is wonderland, try to understand 
To get in it takes more than devotion 

Gotta open up your heart, show us who you are 
To become an alcastar! 

Welcome to our galaxy 
The place to be, our universe 
See the stars where love comes first 
Stay forever, you can be an alcastar 
Welcome to our galaxy 
The place to be, our universe 
...
