Never above, never below
Always beside, beside

I chose to back off from this open wound
To sweep this all into the flames

Scream under street lights
Till the voice takes leave
Life's beautiful mystery

Never above, never below
Always beside
Always beside

But you can't make amends
When no one lends
A chance to make up for times you've known
But you can't make amends
When no one lends
When no one lends
...
