[Intro]
Painted a picture of how it's supposed to turn out
Down in a cold dirty well and I cannot climb out
Can't see no light
Can't hear no bells
They walk right over me
Can't hear my yells

[Verse 1]
They state me missing and search all over the town
Look left and then right but don't ever look down
Dig me my grave, I won't be saved
No I won't be saved, so dig me my grave
