Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, hey, hey, hey, I'm alive

Look in the mirror tell me
Tell me what you see
All the expressions of the
Life that shouldn't be
Are you in a place
You fell far from grace, ooh
It's not over till it's over

I can relate 'cause I've been there before
(I've been there before)
The battles not yours
So you don't have to fight no more
No more
You're still here so let go of your fears and say

I'm alive
Don't just sit there
Get up and tell the world that
I'm alive
It belongs to you
So go and get your life back and say

Ah ah, I'm alive
...
