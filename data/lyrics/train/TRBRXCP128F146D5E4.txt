Talkin' bout my baby
Little Latin Lupe Lu
She's a high flyin' baby
There ain't no dance she couldn't do
She's my groovy little baby
Little Latin Lupe Lu
A boppa boppa Lupe Lu
A-ahake it shake it shake it Lupe
Watusi pretty baby yeah
C'mon and do the hoochie-coo
Mash 'em up pretty baby
Little Latin Lupe Lu
If you wanna do the Twist
Lupe Lu could put her down
