I live in the bright light
Walking in the dark midnight
Skin pale from the street light
Kill time nothing to do

Inside looking outside
Clawing at the door shut tight
You can't run and you can't hide
White lies fearing the truth

See ghost in the shadow
Living in the past feel cold
While trying to remember
