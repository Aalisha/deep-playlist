Why, why, tell me do you wonder why
Some can look so hard and miss the truth, yeah
Some will stumble over it a hundred times
And never ever see the living proof

Well, there's a kind of love
The world could never deny
Let everybody see it
In our lives

The world will wonder why if you and I will shine His light
And hearts will discover life when we decide to let ours go
We've got to give it up and live the love that opened our eyes
Live your life the world will wonder why
