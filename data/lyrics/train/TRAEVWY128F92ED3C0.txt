Don't let it get to you
Don't let it get to you

Nothing I can do, now you're on your own
Better make it good on the telephone

I know how to make your hair stand up
Are you hip to what it's all about

Must be something you can do
To distinguish you from you

Don't let it get to you
Don't let it get to you

Don't let it get to you
Don't let it get to you

All the puppets on the stage of life
...
