Unni Wilhelmsen - Can't stop

He tells me it needn't be dangerous
but what does he know?
And the record keeps playing
and I rest my case for a moment there
I rest my case
And maybe I'll try for a second or so

I can't stop what's coming what he's doing to me
I can't stop what's coming what he's doing to me
