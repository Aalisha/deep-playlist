Fallen like the rain
Crashin' down again
Sinkin' all alone
The walls are closing in
The pain is just beginning
A feelin' like I've never known
I've never known

I never wanted
To ever hurt you
The trust is broken
Salvation

Lift me
Lift me up
Forgive me with your touch
Lift me
Higher
Straight to your love

Shaken to the ground
