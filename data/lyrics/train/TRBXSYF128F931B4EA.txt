Is that somebody calling
Perhaps my love so long forgotten
Now the snake wrapped around my arm
Has bared its teeth, has done its harm

Rain rolling sky
Sing a broken lullaby
And the rose, paint it red
Because my love it isn't dead
Isn't dead

Who has left the water running
In suicidal waves it's coming
This sleepwalking prayer of mine
Is locked away, it's done its time

Dry the weeping eye
...
