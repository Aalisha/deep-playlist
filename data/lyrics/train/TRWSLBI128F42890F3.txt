hey, you, don't need your benediction
i'm through flipping through your fiction
if you want a camera trick
then find a counterfeit

i'm here cooped up, engineering
you're there looking for a clearing
find a friend at the other end who will blow your bubble gum

come on, come on
don't get me wrong
...
