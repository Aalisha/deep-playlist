A picture of the two of us, I don't remember
When the crazy me and the devil by my side
Well, I just can't help but crack a smile every now and then
And I'm just wondering where you are tonight

Back when we knew everything too much for our own good
The world was ours and all we had was time
We didn't make it all the way we did the best we could
And I'm just wondering where you are tonight

Oh, never knew where we were going
