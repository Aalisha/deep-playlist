(B. White/D. Dokken)
I considered all the chances that were mine
I believed they'd find solutions just in time
I believed they had more answers than I'd heard
The angels sing a diffferent song
Strangers all around us. "Trust in me", they say
"We have got the answers, to save the world today"
I considered all the things they said
Paper plans drawn out, but never read
To save us from our darkest fears
We close our eyes and trust that time will find a way
How we trusted in you, no one knows for sure
