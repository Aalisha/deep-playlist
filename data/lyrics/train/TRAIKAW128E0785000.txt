So I've blown, I've blown it all on cures for pain,
And I've learned to regret the choices that, that I've made
I want, I want to stay awake for days
Until the sunlight washes over my face

Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
We run, run, run to loose it all

These days, are darker and they draw me in
...
