Sleep as the goer
The bridge that watches the light-speed through
And cries while the spirit stumbles
The inside missile for the protection of you

Maybe it's silent
The voice can't bear anymore strain
But speaks without even knowing
And streams outside in the direction of truth

There's no reason, there's no secret to decode
If you can't save it, leave it dying on the road
Wide open arms can feel so cold
So cold, feel so cold

Balance the books, the ledges, the loons
The disappointed look on the faces that squint at the moon
Let's see it, with shadows enhance
And then vote to decide who'll advance

Silver jet plane making a turn
Exciting the brain that expects it to crash and then burn
It's not the life lesson I'd have guessed
If you're conscious you must be depressed or at least cynical

But someone might still eat the steaks
...
