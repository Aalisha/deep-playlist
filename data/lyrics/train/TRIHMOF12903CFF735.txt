My hands are shaking
head is spinning
No mistake
the end's beginning
Body's aching
I feel like breaking down


Looking left and searching right
The pressure mounting,
my skin's too tight
Though I've made this bed
I'm not laying down


Next stop is heartbreak city
Get off this train of pity
And hang on - the worst is coming
Be strong - the walls are tumbling down
...
