Come on show me your cancer, I might show mine
I've been holding out for something but got left behind
Well I'm almost out of patience don't cross that line
There's only so much I can handle till it wakes me up inside

[Chorus]
(Life of mine){in background}
There's no happy endings, in this life of mine
Fate has had it's way with me, gets me every time
