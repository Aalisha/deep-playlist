And you know we're livin' every hour
As if it were the last one
Let's stand up to evil powers
In just a second we can be gone

We don't believe in superstition
When by the words we come
And there's only one conclusion
To rid the world of all the scum

Stand and be counted
Millions together as one
Stand and be counted
