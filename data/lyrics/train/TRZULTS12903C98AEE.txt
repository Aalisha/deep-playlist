Take all your medicine
It's gonna make you well
You'll have to run till it's over
I'm sure you'll be able to tell

You'll know it's over
For the rest of my life
You're gonna be high

Come home
It's something less than a holiday
When you come home
It's something less than a holiday
They'll be sneaking up behind you again
