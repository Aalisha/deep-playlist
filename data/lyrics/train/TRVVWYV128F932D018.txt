Crawl in the sun today as I
Chase all the monsters away
And I am glued to you
But what am I supposed to do when
All I seem to do is bleed
And you're the only one I need
Oh I want to be addicted to you
So I will chase after you like you chase
You chase after me
You chase after me yeah yeah
Chase after me
You chase after me like I chase after you

Crawl in the sun today as I
Chase all the monsters away
And I think it's time for a change 'cause I won't, no I won't
