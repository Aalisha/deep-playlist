Save My Pride

(I save my pride)
I save my pride (I save my pride)
I save my love (to save my pride for love)

I save my pride, oooh!
I save my love, oooh!
In the night I cross the ocean
To save my pride for love

1.
Every since the day of graze when I was born
Even thru the nights of thought my heart was torn
I would always stand there right beside you
I save my pride for love!
Like when you face a broken heart to men
Like when you share a love you must defend
Let me be the one who's there to guide you
I save my pride for love!

Bridge:
Ooooh! Stand it up for good and for better
Ooooh! Join hands, we're in this together
Ooooh! Hold on tight, we travel forever
Across the universe
