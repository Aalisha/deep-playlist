As we're driving through the evergreens,
The darkest hours hold the brightest dreams.
With the touch of your hand,
as we glide in the rain,
is this the closest you've come?
cause it's the farthest I've been.
Yeah it's the farthest I've been.

No!
I can't lead you on
Wait!
The truth has come out,
don't you waste your time on me,
the time is wrong.
So take a second look,
I will be gone, gone.

With impure motives and a lustful grin
I'll steal your heart again,
...
