You're gone!
You're gone!

Your body's cold
Hope is lost, I can't let go
Can I die with you
So we can never grow old?
Cut the ties (Cut the ties)
With this note you left behind

As I read the words I hear you telling me why
Too late, too late
I never said goodbye
Too late, too late
Can't even ask you why
And now I'm wasting away
In my own misery
I hope you've finally gone

To a place where you belong
...
