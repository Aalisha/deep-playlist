Well I watched her from my window
for a week or month or more
til i heard from an old acquantance that my chance had come

He said it ain't the kind of party
where they kick you out the door
and they leave you in the gutter can't remember what you've done

Traffic piles up in the city
weekend lurches into gear
got that Friday 7: 30 feeling in my bones
if you lose playing Bogart
you're better on your own
good time people make excuses on their telephones
