I love it when we do what we do when we do
I love it when we do what we do when we do

Aahaaa...
Aahaaa...
Aahaaa... Yeah

When you're around
The sun is always shining
And since we met
I haven't once stopped smiling, yeah
The love I feel for you
Is almost blinding, yeah

Running up and down the street
Hugging everyone I meet
Now you love me life is sweet
When I got you in my arms
I can't turn off the fire alarms, yeah

CHORUS 1:
I love it when we do what we do
...
