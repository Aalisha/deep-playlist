I been standing underneath this dark old cloud
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine in my heart again
I been throwing a lot of good love away
Waiting for the sun to shine
Waiting for the sun to shine in my heart again

Oh I'm just waiting for the sun to shine
I'm just waiting for the sun to shine
I know it will be sometime
