Been staring for a hundred hours
Run down a spiral drain
Keep mouth clamped tight
And it isn't right

Three words keep running round my mind
But my tongue is hard to find
I need to let it go
Because I know

Dark secrets burn their vessel
Tearing out to grab a mouthful
Chunk of heart destroyed by quiet
...
