Two people, just meeting
Barely touching each other
Two spirits, greeting
Tryna carry each further

You are one
And I am another
We should be
One, inside each other

You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride, inside my love
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me
Do you wanna ride, inside my love

My love
My love
My love
