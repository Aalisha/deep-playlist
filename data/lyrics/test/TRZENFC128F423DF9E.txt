Save me
The skin that's stretched across your bones
The scent that lacks the innocence I know
Cold front coming, like blisters threw your pores
Breathing you'll trust me darling
I'm the sword inside your stone

The rest of your life
May rest in my eyes
Let me show you what it's like
[x2]

Meet me at the skylines
I'll wait for you to go
I'll wait for you to go
Meet me at the skylines
I'll wait for you to go
I'll wait for you
