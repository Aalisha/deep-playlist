Half way through the wheat, my golden foe
With his itching ears in the scorching heat.
The weight of summer, torment to my hands
Armed with a sickle I am out for his beguiling glance.
Thought I heared a mare neighing from the creek
Where in every hour spared we anxiously would meet.
Drunken whispers noone could hear
'til the day when hordes of wasps
Poisoned every hour so passed.

She was faint as I when she spoke to me.
Reluctantly. Words came through
Words of leaving here and leaving me.
And her eyes grew bigger then
Bound in moonlit glittering.
She Leaned to me and whispered tears into my ear.

Well, I went to see the creek again
And many a day I'd stand at it's shoreline wondering
If it might be heading north
Through the timber, passed the lake and our chalet
Should have gone with her, should have gone with me.

But I stayed when she begged me
To come with her, never to separate, never to be alone.
And lept silent when I should have sung the song of heart
...
