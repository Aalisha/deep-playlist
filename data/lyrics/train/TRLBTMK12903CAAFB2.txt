Well I never thought that I could hate anybody as much as I hate you
You used to be my friend till you ran off with my lover
Now you've got off with somebody new
If we ever were to meet in the street I wouldn't have a lot to say
But every night before I go to sleep I get down on my knees and pray
And this is what I say

I hope you die young I hope you die in pain
I hope you die alone in the pouring rain
I hope you die cold and empty inside they send you to hell on the other side
I hope you die young I hope you die in pain
I hope you die alone and half insane
And I hope that I'm still alive
So I can dance and sing and piss all over your grave
