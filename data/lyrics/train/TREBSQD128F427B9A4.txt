She said Don't leave this up to me to say that I don't love you anyway
Just leave it up to me to say goodbye
'Cause these good times will never last
Keep a hand on the wheel and a foot on the gas
We thought it would last forever
I wish you'd just remember

No
Will anything change your mind?
(She said)
A one way ticket was a pretty good sign
(And I said)
Well how can you leave it all?
(And she said)
There ain't much to leave behind
Just say goodbye
So say goodbye
Say goodbye
So say goodbye
Just say goodbye
So say goodbye
Say goodbye

Next time I'll take it slow
And as for you I'll never know
At least next time I'll try to understand
...
