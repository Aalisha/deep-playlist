Jimmy Lee, chip pan grease
set fire to the school canteen
all the children had to leave
they missed school for the day
the teachers still got paid

Ivan the terrible looks after some animals
turkeys and highland cattle
he sells them for their meat
he's a farmer on his feet
sitting on a railway line
scaring all the passers by
stars and stripes flash in their eyes
scared the kids off the bus
the driver gave no fuss

Lives his life so dangerously
goes by the name of American Steve
keeps some hammers up his sleeve
he's a man you'd like to meet
but don't give him no cheek
don't give him no cheek
