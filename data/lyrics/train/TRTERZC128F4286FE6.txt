Oh can't U see
I've got you on my mind
They say that love isn't bad
And it could be true since I met you

Cause the world has been
A much much better place
There's a smile on every face
And the sun shines through when I look at you
Girl it's true

What a wonderful way to feel
Something you got makes me want to know
Something you do makes this feeling grow
