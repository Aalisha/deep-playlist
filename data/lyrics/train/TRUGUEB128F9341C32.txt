Yeah
The sun is shinin' everyday
The clouds never get in the way for you and me
I've known you just a week or two
But baby I'm so into you
Can hardly breathe

And I'm in so totally
Wrapped up emotionally
Attracted so physically
Actin' so recklessly
I need you so desperately
Sure as the sky is blue
Baby I love you
I love you

I never knew that I could feel like this
...
