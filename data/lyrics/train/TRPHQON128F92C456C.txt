Damn I miss the, damn I miss the, damn I miss the game
Game, when it's gon' come back, come back?
I'm gettin' tired of the dumb rap, dumb rap
Man I done been there and done that, let's move on

Damn I miss the, damn I miss the game
Game, when it's gon' come back, come back?
I'm gettin' tired of the dumb rap, dumb rap
Man I done been there and done that, let's move on

Damn I used to love this rap sh**
When it was on some gold rope, Kangol hat sh**
Now e'ry rapper on some bust that gat sh**
Cut that crack sh**, that whack sh**

Public Enemy was on some power to black sh**
Rap cats need to get back on that sh**
They need to try switchin' they flows
'Cause all of our women ain't ******* and ****

And e'ry rapper out got a brick on the stove
And his wrists all froze and he whippin' the Rolls
To hear that, I can listen to Hov'
You bullsh***** and then you gettin' exposed

Damn I miss the, damn I miss the, damn I miss the game
Game, when it's gon' come back, come back?
I'm gettin' tired of the dumb rap, dumb rap
Man I done been there and done that, let's move on
