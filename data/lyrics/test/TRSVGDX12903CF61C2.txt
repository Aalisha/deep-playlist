Every time you come around
It makes me way too crazy
Crazy enough to think
That you'll ask me out
Yes, you are the talk of town
So congratulations
With a smile as good as gold
So don't wear a frown

Everytime I see you down
Still you're not too bitter
You don't need a babysitter
To keep you on your cloud
Baby, you know it's true
I'll never be too uptight
To wrap you in my love
To just satisfy you

Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction
Didn't your mama tell you
Didn't your papa tell you
To get a little satisfaction

Every time you come around
My heart beats a little faster
You're all the drug
I'm sure I'll ever need
All the time I do believe
