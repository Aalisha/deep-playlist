Real gangstas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggaz sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Real gangstas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggaz sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Y'all niggaz see me when I come through
And ain't no denyin' that them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin' in and out of white line, six double, oh
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin' like the streets is mine

Mines hustle, Mucho Dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin' mine
And I won't stop bustin' 'til them Escalade seats recline

The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein' sorry, it ain't nuthin' but a gangsta party

And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin'
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And The Game ain't tryin' to win, fuck the awards
So, keep that little ass horn and that Neil Armstrong, nigga

Real gangstas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggaz sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
