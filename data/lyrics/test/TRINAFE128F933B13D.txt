More than a feeling,
Sitting on an instinct,
Breaking out fast,
No time to think if it's live -
Is it living in my own mind
Forced to the ground
When I bring it on down,
It's a farce,
It's unsurpassed,
Too young to be political,
Too old to care,
What's next?
To be taken out of context,
Fooled into sellout -
Making me shout lies,
About compromise,
Forced, inhibited, unresolute
Don't shoot!
Just prostitute,
With that in mind,
Don't waste my time.
