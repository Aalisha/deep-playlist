Started at a summer lake,
A sentence and a name.
If only for a moments sake,
You called it and it came.

Held him down and let him eat,
longer then a while.
Hold it down and let him eat,
softer then a child.

We've seen how sick wind blows,
But I've got your bovine eyes.
And I'll love you like i love you when i die.
