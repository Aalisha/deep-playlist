No fantasy
I'm reality

Oh, a dream comes true
for me and you, when I'm with you
You're watching me
I will make you free

I take you around the world
so I'm with you
and comfort you

Here I am
more than ever
back again
friends forever
take me on the run
your little friend

Here I am
more than ever
back again
friends forever
take me on the run
...
