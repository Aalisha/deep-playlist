I hear a baby crying,
A sad sound, a lonely sound.
I want to take her in my arms, and then I dry away all her tears.

I see a boy who's frightened,
A young boy with cold eyes,
I long to say you're welcome here, you can be happy now that you're warm.

We're all a part of one world,
We all can share the same dream...
And if you just reach out to me,
Then you will find deep down inside, I'm just like you.
