Blackout, blackout
We're headed for the blackout
(Blackout)

It's better when we can't see
(Can't see)
I can see better when my eyes can rest
I push it off my mind

Blackout, blackout
I'll see you in the blackout
(Blackout)

There's a place where things are down the line
So simple we can shut it off
We can break it down

So turn the lights down
We're shooting in the dark
So turn the lights down
We're shooting in the dark

Lights down in the dark
Lights down in the dark
