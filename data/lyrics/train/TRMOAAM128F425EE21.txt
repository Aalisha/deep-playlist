It sure felt like forever
When we were together
Imagine my surprise
When You Told Me It Was Over
Threw your coat over your shoulder
And walked out of my life
You said that it was just infatuation
Something I'd get over soon enough

But it hurts like love
And it feels like heartache
You were here in my arms

Then you were gone
