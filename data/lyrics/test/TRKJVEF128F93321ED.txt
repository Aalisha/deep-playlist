Finally woken
Finally woken

I've been thinking 'bout things
For a long while
I'm Feeling so calm
I've got a big smile
I have a view of the sun
Right over the sea
And now I can feel
Life is flowing through me

You see I've finally woken
From a long sleep
I'm ready to jump
To make that blind leap
...
