Relying on, a conscious you never had
Ignorant for the rage within

Feeling like, you're
betraying yourself
The urge creeping right under your skin
This miry
deception, it crazes
you
Crestfallen, you are losing your way
Your blood, now it starts to
boil again
But
your disguise is not gonna fall
Now the time, has come to pay back
...
