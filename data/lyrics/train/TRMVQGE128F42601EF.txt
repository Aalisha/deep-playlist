So vile men's torment was truly a pleasure
A plain that would change mankind for ever more

Catherine Blake slept fitfully in the
summer night. In the heat.
She murmured gently and moved smoothly,

Her luscious eyes, delicate fingers,
clawed at her sodden bed.

of summer air and tasted death.

Die Erorians' visit had been successful rewarding.
With night of female screams of whimpers,
lustful dreams.
Night followed rampant night of
delicate soft gasps.
The ultimate attack on Heaven and it's glories.
Seduce them as they slept, oblivious to
their midnight tryst.
