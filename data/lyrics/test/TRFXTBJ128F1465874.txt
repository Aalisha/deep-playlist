If I was good, I'd tell everyone I know
If I was free, I wouldn't be so keen to go
If I was wrong, I would take it like a man

If I was dying, I wouldn't go out quietly
If I was lost, well my heart would feel the same
If I was honest, I would probably be ashamed

But if I were you, I would notice me
