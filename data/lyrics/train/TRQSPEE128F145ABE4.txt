Party Out of Bounds

SUPRIIIIIIZE! PAAAAAARTY!
Yeah, we just thought we'd drop in!
Where's your icebox?
Where's the punch?
Ew, house-a-tosis!

Who's to blame when parties really get out of hand?
Who's to blame when they get poorly planned?
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoooo-ooooooooo.

Crashers get bombed, slobs make a mess.
Ya know sometimes they'll even ruin your wife's dress.
Crashers getttin' bombed. (Who's to blame?)
Can you pull it back in line?
