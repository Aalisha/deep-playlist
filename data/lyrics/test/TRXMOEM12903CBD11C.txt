They say when you find the one
There'll be no second guessing
You'd feel it deep in your heart
You'll know that it was destined

The feelin' inside will let you know
Something that you can't deny, just let it grow
They say it's better to love then never love at all
To appreciate all the good sometimes you gotta fall

But I was foolish
I shouldn't let you go
But now I miss you
I gotta let you know

I need you back, back in my life
I need your kiss, kiss in my life
And it's been so long since you been gone
Baby, won't you come back home?

You only get one
One love
One in a lifetime

You only get one
One love
One in a lifetime

And I can't believe that I almost missed the signs
Right in front of my eyes
And now I know the love is real, it's hard to say why

You only get one
One love
One in a lifetime
And that one is you

They say that pleasure
Comes with pain
And I'm so used to being whole
It's hard to be half again
