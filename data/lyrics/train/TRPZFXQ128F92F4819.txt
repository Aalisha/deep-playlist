What if she twisted 
The truth to fit in 
Hide all the scars 
Where to begin 
There are so many 
The tales of her life 
Some are too deep 
Cut with a knife 
Some of them will never 
Never disappear 
Just like the screams 
And the crying she'll hear 

You could come to get her 
You Could Have 
You could come to protect her 
You should have 
Somehow she managed, she's still around
