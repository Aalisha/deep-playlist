Now when this is over
Over and through
And all them changes have come and passed

I want to meet you in the big sky country
I just want to prove, mama, love can last, yeah
Like hallelujah in the big sky country
Just like forever and ever is wide
Be getting over in the big sky country
Be kissing time, kissing time goodbye
And God knows it's all been done, let me tell you why

'Cause you held my number
You held my name
...
