I ran into some girls who knew you today
They tried to tell me some things
But I know there's always two sides to a story

I don't give a damn about what others say
They just can't see you gettin' close to me
I don't give a damn about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story

I don't give a damn about what others say
They just don't want you gettin' close to me (No, no, no)
I don't really care about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story (First verse)

I don't understand why it's happening
And I'm tryin' to ignore the things I hear
People saying things all up in my ear
And I'm wondering is it the truth I fear

You don't need to explain, 'cause baby, I don't care
Whatever happened then was then, then was then
All that really matters, girl, that it's you and me
Whatever was then is gone, we can't change it now

I don't give a damn about what others say (Oh)
They just can't see you gettin' close to me (Close to me, yeah)
I don't give a damn about what happened before me
There's always two sides to a story (There's always two sides to a
story, mmm, hmm)

I don't give a damn about what others say (Mmm, no)
They just don't want you gettin' close to me (They don't want you
gettin' close to me, no)
I don't really care about what happened before me
