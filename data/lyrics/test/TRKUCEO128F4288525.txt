Did you think
my life would end that day
that you walked out
when you broke my heart?
Did you think
I couldn't make it through
ooh -- without you?
Did you think
you'd stop my world with goodbye, oh no
Did you think I'd crumble inside?

Not me, I'm still breathing
and this heart of mine is still beating
And I, I'm not feeling any pain
No baby, not me, I'm still breathing
This old heart of mine is still beating
The tears I've cried have dried
You have gone and I've survived
I'm still breathing (yeah.)
