Used to come around here every day
Now you're breakin
Used to be the one that is not ashamed
Now you shamin
Lost in all the wars we fought
Never saw a road
Now that I think about you in the skies
I'd turn my row
And i wonder where you are
Now I wonder where you.
Are
(ooooh)

Missing person's in the window
Staring at me
Saying things I cant hear
...
