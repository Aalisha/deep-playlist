If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad
Today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours
This way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my
Call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand
At all?
I never know what the future brings
But I know you are here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
I don't wanna run away but I can't take it, I don't
Understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me
That I am?
