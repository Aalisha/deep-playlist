There's room at my table, why don't you pull up a seat?
The music's inviting but I'm staying off of my feet
The floor's getting crowded, but I don't wanna take part
I bet you can guess it's got someting to do with my heart

Chorus
I could sure use your company now
But don't be mistaking my smile
I'm only in between dances
