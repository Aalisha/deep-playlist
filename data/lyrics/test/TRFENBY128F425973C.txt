There is a door we all walk through
And on the other side I'll meet you
Reunion in the air
A cappella meets pure prayer

Somewhere, I can't wait to meet you there
Somewhere, I can't wait to meet you there

If there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight
They never sang doowop in Harlem
If there ain't a heaven that holds you tonight
...
