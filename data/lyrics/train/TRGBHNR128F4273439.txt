I dreamed I heard that you were dead
I dreamed I searched an empty bed
For a sign of you
And the sea called hard to me
Like a cell without a key
And I felt the distance
I watched the tall ships go
With the drift wood on the flow
With pride that grows in hardship
And I knew you were below

I hear your voice
And it keeps me from sleeping
Why must it always be dreams
When your voice comes to me
