I've been so lonely without you
It's hard to believe you're really gone
I think back to the way we used to be
But still need you baby can't you see
All that I wanted was your love
And you night by my side
I thought our love would never die
But now I'm alone

Chorus:
I'm forever missing you, makes me crazy
