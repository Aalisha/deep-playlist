The cracks in your face
where the porcelain broke
some things don't get better with age
and I swear I remember
everyword that you spoke
and the china you left in your place

A litany of faces
I'm number one
counting backwards from one hundred
and count on one hand
the truths that you spoke
and every lie you called romantic

...
