(Roy Drusky - Lester Vanadore - Faron Young)

How I'd love to be around you
When the lonely night surrounds you
How I'd love to be alone with you

What I'd give to have the power
To read your mind one hour
How I'd love to be alone with you.

Just to be with you one night
You and me alone
Kiss your lips and hold you tight
Have you for my own.
