Where's your respect? (Where's your respect?)
Why bite the hand that feeds you
It's not over yet not over yet (not over yet)
Plenty more fingers for you to nibble
I'd like to see you get your teeth round this
I'm sure your jaw will surely be missed

Not even salt can make your hands taste good
I'm still crunching your lifeline
Not even salt can make your hands taste good
I'm still crunching your lifeline

You do this every fucking time
No sweat (no tears) no guilt

You do this every fucking time
...
