Gather at the church
Say a quiet prayer
Hold each other's hands
Praying that you might be there
In honesty and peace
With the whispers of your god
Falling on your ears
Falling on Your ears

Melt your silver down
Kiss your lover's face
The sirens start to sound
And you're caught up in the only place
Where the honesty of fear
Makes a battle like a song
...
