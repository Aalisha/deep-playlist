Running against your wall
Let us blackmail you car pretty scars
The clock's been ticking for quite some time
Are we able to withdraw and who should take the fall

Take me right back to this time
When you held my hand and told me everything was alright
I mean alright as okay
Could I use this standard phrase
I really don't belong you coughed me up way hard
Yet you tricked me from the start

Have you seen that guy in black (that's me i hope you realise that he is bad for you sweetie)
Should I've known this from the start (this guy in front as though his girl I'll tell her that you said hello)

Pleas don't ask me why I keep on loving you
