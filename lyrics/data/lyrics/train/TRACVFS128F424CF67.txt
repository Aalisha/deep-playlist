A deep frustration's running through my veins,
A dark light's entering the church
By pale glass windows
And I feel so cold.

I can't stop looking at the wooden box placed
In the very centre of the nave.
I'm trying to imagine you...
...Sleeping.

We're in the home
Of life and death,
Where each being takes end.
