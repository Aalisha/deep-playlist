She's got no idea where you've been
We know you've been misbehaving
You've been living dangerous
You're trying to keep it just our secret
Psst pass it on, come on and pass it on
Psst pass it on, come on and pass it on
Goodness I like this
Mysterious mistress
Keepin' me hush hush
Try not to blush blush
I just can't stop this
It's risky business
Being your mistress
Keepin' me hush

Your girlfriend's no competition
She is no competition
Your girlfriend's no competition
Goodness I like this being your mistress
Your girlfriend's no competition
Your girlfriend's no competition
She is no competition
Someone's gotta be the one to tell her
that we got it going on

You're keeping me out all night long
