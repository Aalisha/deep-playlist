Necromancer, the rites of dementia
See what the death looks like
Souls in Limbo, coming with eternal flames
Arrive in circles of trembling hands
No inferno but also no heavens
No god on his golden throne
Promised eden turned into desert
Empty space and dead remains
Spectral mouth tells hopeless truth
...
