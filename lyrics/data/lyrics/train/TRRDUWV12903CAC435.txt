I'm gonna take this map
And tear it up
Because I've been up and down
These dead end streets getting nowhere
I'm a little bit older
A little wiser
I've got to find my own way out of here
And start over
I want to feel sun in the morning
And make these shadows
Leave me alone

[Chorus:]
Maybe time will be all that I need to grow
Maybe time is all I need
And a little hope
