A new, a new day will come. When the children will run and laugh with the Son.
And you, you will be mine, in awhile. And honey that’s all I need.
Honey that’s I need.
Let me go now. If I shall be released. I’ve been here before. I’ve been deceased.
That redemption may come like a wave over me, run me still to the shore, pull me out of the sea.
I will walk through my garden of roses that fade and I wait for the day that is done.
And I will do, I will do, what ever it takes to believe a new day will come.

I’ve been down. I’ve been broken by shame. I’ve been carving too shallow a meaning out of my name. That redemption may come like a wave over me, run me still to the shore, pull me out of the sea.
