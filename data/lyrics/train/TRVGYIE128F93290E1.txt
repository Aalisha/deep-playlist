As eyes gun you, the sky tumbles off
Yeah, I made foul mistakes I know
Our hearts die soon but I can’t spit the love
Her body stroked by hands of God

The eye stuns you, their body’s naked brawn
Yeah I despise the faker’s foe
If I die soon, yeah can spit the blood
My soul inscape the hands of hurt

So to you is this dirty? Have sick undertones?
But I know you’re dirty, you’re no tame animal
