liar
liar
liar
liar

i don't like you not at all
so i'll make you take the fall
i'll dismantle your empire
rain down brimstone and fire
hecklers are cocky but simpletons
laughter and shame are their violins
single out the loudest one above the din
grab 'em by the throat stick a knife in

liar
anything we say you believe
liar
don't you see we deceive
liar
doesn't mean a thing right or wrong
liar
just follow along

even with the balance swaying back and forth
steady is the finger always pointing north
screaming on the corner 'til your face is blue
condescending laughter makes your words untrue
...
