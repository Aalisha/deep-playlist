Yeah, I remember it now, we were kids back then
Livin' down on the farm
We were told that the city
Could only bring us harm

"How far is the city?", somebody said
And, "Oh, that's a great big town"
And Barbara said, "Why, it's a million miles"
And the story got around

It's a million miles to the city
From the hills and valleys we know
It's a million miles to the city
And someday we all wanna go

There was a town nearby but a town is a town
...
