Living like caged animals
Afraid to speak in words
The streets are wild, with maniacs
The wicked know who they serve
For you and me, society
Is a prison without walls
I'll have no remorse for you my friend
When the light of the kingdom calls
I can see the neon lights
It's the nightwatch your pursuing
Crystal smoke and all that coke
It makes you so inhuman
...
