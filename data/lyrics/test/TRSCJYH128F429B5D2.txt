Nor the pain and the sorrow
Caused by my mistakes
Won't repent to a mortal
Whom is all to blame?
Now I know I won't make it

There will be a time

We'll get back our freedom
They can't break what's inside
I'll face it
'Cause it's the heart of everything
Open up your eyes

Save yourself from fading away now
Don't let it go
...
