Since you've been hangin' out with guys like him
You've started to betray yourself
He tells you everything you want to hear
And then he leaves you on the shelf

He turns you on and off and on
Can make you happy for a week or 2
He should be put under arrest cause
I don't like the things he does to you.

He makes you feel like a superstar
