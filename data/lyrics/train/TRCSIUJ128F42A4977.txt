The blackness
Keep, keep on
Never say die
Keep, keep on

The blackness
Keep, keep on
Never say die
Keep, keep on
Keep, keep on

The blackness
Never say die
Keep, keep, keep
Never say die
Keep, keep on

Never say die
The blackness
Keep, keep on
Never say die
Optimistic

When in the midst of sorrow
You can't see up when looking down
A brighter day tomorrow will bring

You hear the voice of reason
Telling you this can never be done
No matter how hard reality seems
...
