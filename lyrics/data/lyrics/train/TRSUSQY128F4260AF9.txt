Well i just got back been gone too long
Wasn't my idea, didn't pull the trigger
Oh, I but I'm just so glad
I'm just so glad to be back home, yeah

I just got back been a long long time
Wasn't my idea, didn't point the finger
Oh, I'm just so glad
I'm just so glad to go home

You run the risk of falling
With some solitary Sam
