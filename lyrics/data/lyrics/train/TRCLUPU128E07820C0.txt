I spend the night, yeah, l
Looking for my insides in a hotel room, waitin' for you
We're gonna make it tonight, yeah
Something in the air tells me the time is right
So we better get on
DJ, play a song for the lovers, tonight
Please, play a song for the lovers, tonight

Don't wanna wait, Lord, I've been waitin' all my life
But I'm too late again, I know but I was scared
Can't you see, oh
I'm moving like a train into some foreign land
I ain't got a ticket for this ride but I will
