Mother mother
Can you hear me
I'm just calling to say hello
How's the weather
How's my father
Am I lonely heavens no
Mother mother
Are you listening
Just a phone call to ease your mind
Life is perfect
Never better
Distance making the heart grow blind

When you sent me off to see the world
Were you scared that I might get hurt
Would I try a little tobacco
Would I keep on hiking up my skirt

I'm hungry
I'm dirty
