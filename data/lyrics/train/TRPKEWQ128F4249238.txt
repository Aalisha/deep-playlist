I saw sparks fly
From the corner of my eye
And when I turned
It was love at first sight
I said please excuse me
I didn't catch your name
Oh it'd be a shame
Not to see you again
And just when I thought
She was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet
And brought me to the floor (she said)

I'm only seventeen
But I"ll show you love like you've never seen
She's only seventeen
Daddy says she's too young
