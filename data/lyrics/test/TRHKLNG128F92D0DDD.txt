Don't be afraid if I'll go crazy for you
Don't be surprised if I fall at your feet
I don't care about what they think of me
I don't know what to do
Cause I'm falling for you (for you)
When I look into your eyes
I can see me and you
Remember this time that will last until the end
When I find you in my dreams
I just won't let you go
I'll hold you in my heart
