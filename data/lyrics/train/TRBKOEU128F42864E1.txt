Sorry I'm late but I had to pay my water rate

Boss, boss, me little late and ya going on bad
Boss, boss work overtime yeat ya didn't see that
Boss, boss do this do that driving me mad
Boss, boss grey hair is a thing I never had
Now let me talk so ya hear that a fat overseer ain't my style
Cause we won't get along if ya wearing one plastic smile
Seems like you invented 9ine to 5ive
