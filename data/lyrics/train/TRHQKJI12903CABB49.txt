Where could I run, where could I hide
Where could I go where You are not
Where could I be where You don't see
All of these demons chasing me
What kind of sin could I find myself in
Where You wouldn't stop
The world from spinning 'round and 'round
When it seems like I am upside down
But in Your comfort I have found
A safe place to fall

And I'll be alright
...
