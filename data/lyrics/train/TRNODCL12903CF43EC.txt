In time my wounds will heal - as they give your name 
Rivals meeting face to face - fate sealed, you bow down in shame 
Run, run, you run so far - escape to nowhere 
I smell the path you`ve fled - turn your head you`re dead 

I am the master killer - fall to me 
Pray for a way out which you can`t see 
I the master killer - strike you down 
Can`t be defeated, I own the crown
