until we meet again you know you're always on my mind I know you're right here by my side.
I know you're looking down.
I feel you watching over me I know you're with me when I fall, you still protect me from myself
I know you're looking down, I feel you watching over me arms raised to the sky I try my best each day
to carry on your name you're more, much more than just a memory.
my life was shaped by the love that you gave me
