Let's go
Follow me outside
And I know it won't be long till
I'm holding your hips tight I know you want to
Leave them all behind
So let's catch a cab down town now
And light the fire up and make it right
Cause There's nobody home tonight
Break out and take it to the floor
So I can take you on and give you all the things All the things we're not supposed to do
Break out and take it to the floor
We'll finally be alone just take me home with you tonight
