You have been so good for me
I will change my ways for you
You can call and I'll come running
You know my feelings are warm and true

You've got me wrapped around your finger
I'd surrender it all to you
You got the power I've got the need
I hate to say it
I'm down on my knees

(so don't you)
Push Push
You break me in your stride
Push Push
You'll cut me down to size
Push Push
Please don't throw the dice
Push Push
Push Push

I'll be the angel,
...
