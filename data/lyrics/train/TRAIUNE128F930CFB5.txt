Who wouldn't love you, who wouldn't care
You're so enchanting, people must stare
You're the dream that dreamers want to dream about
You're the breath of spring that lovers gadabout, are mad about

Who wouldn't love you, who wouldn't buy
The west side of heaven, if you just winked your eye
You're the answer to my every prayer, darlin'
Who wouldn't love you, who wouldn't care
...
