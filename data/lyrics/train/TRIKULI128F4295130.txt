Everybody in the building has to sing the song
All the boys and all the girlfriends sing the sing-a-long

Think I'm in trouble, there's always a couple
Around me wherever I go
They're out there to bug me
I don't think it's funny
Everybody's laughing at me, yeah

I wanna go out but there's no-one about
All my friends want a quiet one at home
The same age as me and
They're husbands-to-be, yeah
