Yes your motives are tasteless
But your mouth is so bittersweet
When my worst fears surround me
I'll just wait for you to sweep me right off my feet

And your face turns blush red
As you scream for forgiveness

Is the regret that you'll live with

(Hey!)

So please don't let this be the end

I'm not afraid of the consequence
