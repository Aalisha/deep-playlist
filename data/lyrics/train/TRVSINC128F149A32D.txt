Are you frightened by the fire in my eyes?
It burns for you
And I know you see it, too
Your heart was open, looking for light
Are you surprised?
Baby, leave your pride

'Cause I'm gonna burn, right or wrong
It's all for you to see
Stop hiding your eyes
Take the fire from me
And be warm, life is hard
And sometimes the night is long
Take the fire
You don't have to give it back to me
...
