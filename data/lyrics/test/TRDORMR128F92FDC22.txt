When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take second look

Oh baby give me one more chance
To show you that I love you
Won't you please send me back in your heart
