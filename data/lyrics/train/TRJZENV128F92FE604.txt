Day after day after
Trying to understand
Why the world tries to grind you down
Make a ghost out of a man
Your date of grace is due
And you've pawned everything you own
I guess some dreams just don't come true
Nothin left but skin & wishbones

Each year the world gets lonelier
And uglier with sin
You'll never see those blue skies
Through young eyes again
You've prayed to every god you've found
Just to wind up all alone
Your friends are gone, your mama's dead
Nothin left but skin and wishbones
...
