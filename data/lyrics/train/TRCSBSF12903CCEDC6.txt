Rise up this morning,
Da first thing dat i heard,
Was some devastating news,
Yeahh uh
Just like my friend,
His life was taken away,
Not by natural causes,
But by other man,
We all know time is ours in the ghettos,
But its not the ghettos so long,

So ghetto youths,
Keep ya calm and keep it cool,
Dont let no one come boast u up,
And turn u inna fool,
Keep ya calm and keep it real,
Cus anything u want in life,
Yu can achieve,

Are'nt u tired of living in their fucked up system,
Cus all i can see round us is poor people as da victims (victims)
Are'nt u tired of living in their fucked up system,
Cus all i can see round us is poor people as da victims,
...
