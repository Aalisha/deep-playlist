Existential demise
We close our eyes to conceal it
No air to breathe
No time left, it's all over
Awaken in denial
Evoke a perpetual bane
No way to justify
This inhuman urge to degenerate
We only see what we wish to be
But can't conceive what we perceive
I see the writings on the wall
Where did we think this would end?
We're on the verge to tragedy
We are blind slaves of consent
The answer is in the mirror
A constant threat's within
