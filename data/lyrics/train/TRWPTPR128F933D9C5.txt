Tell me how long, can we go on this way
Just to be strong
We talk through the night
But never reach the other side
We fill our lives
With endless words, an aimless search

When all that we need, we hold within our hearts
When will we find, our way out of the dark


CHORUS
We know that
Love is the power, love is the key
