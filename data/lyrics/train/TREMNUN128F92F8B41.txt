Existence no more, once and for all
Have mercy, time's up, behind the prison wall
Compassion run dry, one final call
Injection, rejection, go take the fall

One by one, watch them go to the silent chamber
Step by step, watch them go
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter what you did
It only matters who's the boss in the factory

One by one, knocking at the gates of Eden
Step by step, no one answers for the lonely ones
It doesn't matter if it's wrong
It doesn't matter if it's right
It only matters who's the boss in the factory
