Want Me, Take Me, Need Me -It's All In Your Mind.
Love Me, Hold Me, Want Me -Hoping I'll Be Kind.

You Think That Up Here I'm So Special.
But Put In A Crowd I Would Be Just Like You.
You Think To Be With Me, Would Make A Change In You.
You Think To Be With Me, You're Special Too.

Want Me, Need Me, Take Me, - It's All In Your Mind.
Love Me, Hold Me, Want Me, - Hoping I'll Be Kind.
