There's a reason for all that rhymes, it's the fact and the way of the times
Moving emotion, it's high and it's low, no matter where you go
There is something for all who look, there's a story in every book
All of the pages, between all the lines, so much that you can find

But there's too many empty lives my friend
And we just can't let them waste away
For this life is a precious thing my friend
And we can't wait another day
