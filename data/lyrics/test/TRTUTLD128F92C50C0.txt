Spacetime,
A fusion between the concepts of space and time
Brought forward into one four-dimensional continuum

Right now and forever
There will always be a moment
Spacetime, select the spacetime
Right now and forever there'll continue to be
Matter Motion Energy
Spacetime, define spacetime

A tumbling through space and through time
The concepts of space and time are combined
Twirling and twisting through red, blue and green
The stars, the planets, the Nebulae seen
Infinite outward and infinite in,
So where did Infinity all begin?
In the very same place where Infinity ends
In the conscious minds and dreams of Shamen

Spacetime, spacetime
There will always be a place for you in my spacetime
