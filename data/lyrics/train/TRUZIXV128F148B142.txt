Did you know you were the girl?
That made me hate blond hair and I?
I just can't wait to make you hate me a little more?
And every night that I spend?
With bloodshot eyes and no end?
And enough excuses here to bury me alive?
So here I am?
A love worn masochist?
With hearts carved straight across my chest?
Lettin' the carpet soak up all that's left to give?
Will you swear you won't be sleepin'?'
Cause I can't begin to dream to shut my eyes?
And I'm biting bullets and watchin' phones for
No apparent reason?
And I don't think that I'll make it out alive?
Did you know you were the girl?
