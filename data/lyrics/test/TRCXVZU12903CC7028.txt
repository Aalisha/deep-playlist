Warm black asphalt
South of nowhere
I'm going there under a dirty cotton sky
When the rain comes round
I roll my window down
I lift my face to heaven
And wash these tears from my eyes

I'm just looking for some inspiration
I'm looking for something to rock my soul
I'm looking for a brand new destination
I'm looking for Elvis down a Memphis road
I'm looking for Elvis

I remember...
All those Septembers
The pledges of allegiance
The prayers of trust
I slept on those beds of hope and promise
Woke up choking on cheap paint and carnival dust
