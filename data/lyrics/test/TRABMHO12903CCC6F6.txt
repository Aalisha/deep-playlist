Girl, you are mine, mine, mine
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine

Even though we fuss and fight
I don’t wanna live one night without you
So what am I gonna do, baby?

Sometimes we don’t see eye to eye
And I just can’t tell you why but I love you
And you know it’s true, 'cause, girl, you know

Girl, you are mine, mine, mine
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine
Girl, you are mine, mine, mine
