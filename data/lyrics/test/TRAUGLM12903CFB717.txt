All my life a children's song was lost in helices
The darkness tries to hide me from that place

Can I drain the source of fears and find my energy?
â€˜Cause a dark man is my barricade to a new philosophy

In my playground of fears

The candle leads me down to hear this melody again
Where all the ghosts of Disney world will guide me to a land

I'm on my way back to my Abydos
