Face down on the ground
Storm clouds lie in white snow piles all around
I don't know if I can make it through
One more winter in this town

Voted worst in show the last two years
Got a refill on my tears
Another bottle
Of foam-yellow clear

An old man twitching on the train
Reminds us of mortality
The snow everywhere
