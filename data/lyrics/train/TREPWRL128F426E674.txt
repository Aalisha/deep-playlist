This moment here is so much more than you will ever know cause when its dark we scratch and claw to get a glimpse of who is watching over the things that make us who we are
We walk a fine line in between fear and hope when we say we'll live forever for all you know forever's gonna feel alone

Say what you will but I believe in moments like this they make us matter look in my eyes and tell me you don't believe that I'm right
I don't know how to make you hear this run if you want but I'm not leaving there is a life that makes this world go around tonight

We're so afraid of what we feel so we ignore what's real renounce the thought that down inside there is a voice that screams of something deeper for more than just the here and now we try and act like everything is in control when we say there's no forever but we can't shake the feeling that we are so alone...
