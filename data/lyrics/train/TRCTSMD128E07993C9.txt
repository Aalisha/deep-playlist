Trains moan in my sleep
When I'm trying to go to bed
Moving way too slow
For whatever that they be carrying
And I've been working hard
Ever since I was a kid
Trains moan in my sleep
Seems like something's always moving

Trains moan in my sleep
When I'm trying to go to bed
Moving way too slow
For whatever that they be carrying
I've been working hard
Ever since I was a boy
Trains moan in my sleep
Seems like something is always moving

You know I don't always show
What it is I'm feeling baby doll
