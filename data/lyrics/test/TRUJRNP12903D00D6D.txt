What will you say about me?
Will you say I was a good man?
That you felt my love and that you loved me too
What will you say about me?
Will you say that it was perfect
Or it wasn't worth the pain I put you through?

Seems so strange
We just let this slip away

One day in the arms of another
When you're close enough to share
The dreams you'd wished would be
What will you say about me?

What will you tell him about me?
Will you say that we were soulmates
And you knew our lives were meant to be as one?
