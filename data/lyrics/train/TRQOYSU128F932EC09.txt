It must be written that the moon
Elbowed the stars and said,
“Let's do our best to make it hard for them”.
Your house turned into paper cranes
We watched the wind blow them away
Some sorry comfort I was then

The weight of a mountain
The skin off your knees
From climbing up to me

We can work this out
I believe, although it seems impossible

They turned our skeletons to wood
And scattered matches underfoot
We must walk carefully in place
...
