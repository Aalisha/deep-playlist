I took the fall and on came all the changes
Work your way through the cold shell of my heart
Just to find another layer of stone waiting
I know I'm not a good man, I never was and I never will...

Don't think you'll make it through the night
My words, my words
My words are poison in your ears
What I say, what I say
What I say and what I do are never related
Like a tumbleweed I'll fly with the wind

I don't mean to fuck up the only things that I love,
It's just my nature. Now let's make a deal
I'll get my conscience back when you get a clue
For all your shadow needs, how dark they may be

Of course no one collected my soul
...
