[(J Christie)]

Well, here I am, baby, waiting for you to come back
Here I am, baby, waiting for you to come back
You know I ain't gonna move until you decide to come back

Well, here I am, baby, waiting for you to come home
Here I am, baby, waiting for you to come home
You know I ain't gonna move until you decide to come home
