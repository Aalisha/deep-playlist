Here I go, restless heart
Another lovely misadventure in the dark
All my friends who knew me when
Tell me not to wander down that road again

What they don't know, what they can't see

Some say I'm running
But I know I'm falling
Back to you

The water's deep under the bridge
As I pass by our old house up on the ridge
