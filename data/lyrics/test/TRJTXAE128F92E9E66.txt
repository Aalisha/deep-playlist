I got your letter from the postman just the other day
So I decided to write you this song
And just to let you know exactly the way i feel
To let you know my love's for real

Because I love you and I'll do anything
I'll give you my heart, my everything
Because I love you, I'll be right by your side
To be your light, to be your guide
