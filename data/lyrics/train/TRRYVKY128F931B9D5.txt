I wake up in the morning
Sky is gray and storming
Buildings bridges and city streets
Still as ugly as yesterday

They used to tell me
Anything just to sell me
But I learn quick when I have to

Keep your target in sight
Don't listen to
Fools on the run
Stay in the light
Keep your target in sight
Don't listen to
Fools on the run
