I love the time
and inbetween
the calm inside me in the space
where I can breathe

I believe there is a distance
I have wandered to touch upon the years of
reaching out
and reaching in
holding out
holding in.

I believe
this is heaven
to no one else but me
and I'll defend it as long as
I can be
left here to linger
in silence
if I
choose to
would you
try to
understand.

I know this love
is passing time
passing through like liquid
...
