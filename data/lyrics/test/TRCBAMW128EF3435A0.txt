Burning down to the ground
Burning life slips away from me

Stuck in this paradox and I cannot get out
This burning bridge is burning down

Burning down to the ground
Burning, Burning down to the ground
Burning life slips away from me

Now I feel the flames are burning
All the parasites thriving within me
So I surrender now
Cuz this depression's burnt me out

Stuck in this paradox and I cannot get out
This bridge is burning down
Stuck in this paradox and I cannot get out
