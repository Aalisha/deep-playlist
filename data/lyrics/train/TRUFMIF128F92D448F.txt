Woman tell me, where did you learn
To handle a man with so much ease?
After all of his life
He's used to doing like he pleased, yeah

You got me doing all the good things
That a man's supposed to do
I know a lot of men who wish they had
A sweet little woman like you
'Cause your kind is so hard to find

Woman tell me, where did you learn
To make a man feel like a king?
When all the time he knows
That he hasn't got a thing, yeah
