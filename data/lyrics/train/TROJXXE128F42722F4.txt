Last week you said you'd never do this to me
but now i'm sitting here wondering why i'm on
the shelf again
I know you want to get closer to me
But I don't want to go on if you really do not
want this
I hate to sound so jaded
But it seems like nothing's changing
My apathy for apologies is getting stronger
No, I can't take this any longer
So why don't you figure out if you want this or
not
I know I said that I forgave you
But I don't want to see you go through
