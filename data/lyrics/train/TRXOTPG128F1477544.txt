Am I the kind of girl who could be your boyfriend
Am I the kind of Jill who could play with Jack
Am I the kind of girl who could be your boyfriend
The kind of screw your toolbox lacks

Tear up tradition you'll take that dress tonight
Tear up tradition I'll be the groom and honey you be the bride
Cos I'm the kind of girl who could be your boyfriend
And I'm the kind of woman who could be a man

Let's twist it up
(C'mon now)
Let fix it up
