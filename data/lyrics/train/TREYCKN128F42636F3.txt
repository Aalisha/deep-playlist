Light snow falling
On the muffler shops and the lumber yards
The streets are slick as glass
Ditches lined with stranded cars
The tow trucks are busy
Dealing with the evening rush
I might have picked a better day
I probably shouldn't expect that much

(I'm just) On the outskirts
Of an old familiar town
With a misty darkness coming down
On the fringes
Outside looking in
She says Well now where you been
Didn't expect you back again
