Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

27th of January, think he died a year ago today
She's crying on my shoulder and begging me
To make the hurting go away
Pretty brown eyes, tears full of guilt, a heart full of pain and fear
I wanna tell her it's okay but we both know
She's the reason he's not here

I keep on crying but it doesn't seem to help at all
With every single tear drop it's like another raindrop falls
And I would if I could but the try would be in vain
Said no matter what I do I can't stop the rain

So I cry, ooh, I can't stop the rain, stop the rain
Ooh, I can't stop the rain, stop the rain
If I could you know I would but the try would be in vain
So I cry, ooh, I can't stop the rain, stop the rain
