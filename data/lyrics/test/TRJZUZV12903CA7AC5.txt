Woh! Bop-do-day (oh, what a girl)
Oh, bop-do-day (oh, what a girl)
Boo-dow, boo-day, a-bop-do-day (oh, what a girl)
I caught the train, I met a real dame
She was a hipster and a gone dame
She was pretty, from New York City
And she trucked on down the ol' fair lane
With a hee, and a hoo
And I just couldn't let her go
So get along, sweet little woman get along
Better be on your way
Get along, sweet little woman get along
Better be on your way
