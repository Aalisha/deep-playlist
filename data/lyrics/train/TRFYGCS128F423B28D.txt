I've been patiently waiting
I can't think of the words to say
And it's getting frustrating
This is honestly killing me
I've been meaning to ask you

There's a thousand things I want to say

So break some pieces off of me
I can only wait until the end
Go break some pieces off of me
Baby, this is just the beginning
