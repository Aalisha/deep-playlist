You say, I'm your mystery
Please, don't ever solve me
I won't be a mystery anymore

Something's holding my breath
Strikes the moment down
Gives me greater heights to reach

Sensual
Seriously sensual
We are all in search of the sensual

Eros
Erotomania
Brings ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

Little lover, let's explore a little while
Dance upon my heart
Take me on, you say

I'm your mystery
We'll unveil a little more each time
A little more

Sensual
Seriously sensual
We are all in search of the sensual

Do I ever feel tired?
