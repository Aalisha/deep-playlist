If, if you want
If you want to be the one that he's thinking of
You, you just need, you just need to understand
Ah, just turn around, just turn around

You are the only thing
The only thing that he has left
The only thing at all
The only thing at all

In later hours when the packed bars start spitting cowards
They're picking scars cell phones clenched along, along the sidewalk
They usually stay out of our way the bridge and tunnel
Just seems to escape near our home, near our home
