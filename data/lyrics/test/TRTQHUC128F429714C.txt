Ah!
You think you've got the looks,
you think you've got the fashion.
You thought you'd have me wanting more,
but don't like my reaction.
You think you're really something.
You're nothing to me now.
You thought you'd keep me coming
without ever thinking how.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
You think you're really special.
You think I think you're best.
