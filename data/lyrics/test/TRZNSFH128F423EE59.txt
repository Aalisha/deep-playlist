You squeeze the life right out of me
Like sapping the juice of a bumblebee
And then you call me honey
You say it once and it isn't funny
When you say it again
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Now inside there's a style going on
A head full of dreams only room for one
Now I know you can't live without me
But I've no doubt that you'll never doubt me
Like you did before
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

And we're pumping out love into the sea
I'm full bodied and bursting with energy
