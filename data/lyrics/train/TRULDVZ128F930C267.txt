Down where your paint is cracking
Look down your backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Did you see his eyes?
Did you see his crazy eyes?
And you're so surprised
He doesn't run to
Catch your ash
Everybody always
Wants to kiss your trash
And you can't help him
No one can
...
