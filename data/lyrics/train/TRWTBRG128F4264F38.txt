Why do you hurt yourself?
You do it very well
You do it so politely
That you couldn't even tell
When everything has changed
You think you're not to blame
How come you keep on talking
When the whole thing feels so strange?...

But seeing is not the same as believing
When everything goes wrong
You're anything but strong

It's all bittersweet
Outside in the street
The grass is growing greener
Underneath your feet
...
