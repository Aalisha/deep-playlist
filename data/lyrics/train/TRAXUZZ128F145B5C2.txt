You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man
You do your thinking with a one track mind
You keep preachin' about heaven and glory
But on your face it shows a different story
Clean up your rap your story's getting dusty
Wash out your mouth
Your lies are getting rusty
I can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you're funkier than a mosquita's tweeter
You gotta mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same old game
You never change
Always rappin 'bout the same old thing
