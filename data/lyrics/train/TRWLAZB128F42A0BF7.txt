Homegrown rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
You ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role
You can play with me

And all the bros
Try for the courage and try for charity tight clothes
She's got a hat and all the hat says is 'asshole'
She'll be bobbing to me

Pretty hairdos and those lipstick kisses blown yeah that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who moves you
