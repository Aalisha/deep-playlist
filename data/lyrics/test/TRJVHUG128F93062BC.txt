Now in the time of dying
I don't want nobody to moan
All I want my friends to do
Come and fold my dying arms
Whoa Whoa well so I can die easy
Whoa Whoa well so I can die easy
Whoa Whoa well so I can die easy
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed

Meet me Jesus, meet me
Won't you meet me in the middle of the air
And if these wings should fail me Lord
Won't you meet me with another pair
Whoa whoa well won't you meet me Jesus
