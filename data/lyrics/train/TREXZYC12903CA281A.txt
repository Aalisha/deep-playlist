(Verse 1)

Baby, I know that you've been waiting patiently,
For a man to give you all that you need,
And love you like he should.
Sticking to your guns, looking for the right one.
Just somebody who treats you good.
It took me a while but I got here as fast as I could.

(Chorus)

I ran full speed ahead,
Without stopping to rest.
Not knowing where I was running too.
Now that i'm here,
It's perfectly clear.
That I was making my way to you.
