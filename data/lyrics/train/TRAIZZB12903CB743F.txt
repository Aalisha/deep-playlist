I was warned
I your humble Alamo kind of world
Around you and all you are
I was fooled by the way you take me seriously
Even when Im joking

Damn damn damn damn
Im not tired and Im tired
Im not calling out
Cross the street I was holding out
Holding out cross the table
I was holding out
Trying to find a lover like that holding out
Like the wind I was holding out
Staying still hoping no one else would see me
