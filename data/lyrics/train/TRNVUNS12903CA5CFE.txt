Watching for hours
Like wilting flowers
Blame it on something
Pouring it over
Falling like soldiers
Thinking of nothing

Blank in your head 'cos it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet
Blank in your head 'cos it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet
Blank in your head yeh it's hard to accept
The loss that you feel isn't easy to heal
Blank in your head yeh it's hard to believe
And the ache in your bones goes from chest to your feet

Doesn't really matter what was said
I won't believe it
