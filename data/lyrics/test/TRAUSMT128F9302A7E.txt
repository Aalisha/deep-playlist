I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been

Hanging on the promises in songs of yesterday

And I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time

But here I go again, yeah
Here I go again, yeah.

Though I keep searching for an answer, oohhhh

I never seem to find what I'm looking for.

Oh Lord, I pray you give me strength to carry on

'Cause I know what it means, oohhhh
