It's Friday night and I wanna rock.
I got 48 hours on the clock. Were runnin now 'til 6
A.M.
When Monday starts that grind again.
I spend five days waiting for two.
We'll do the things that we wanna do.
We'll tell the boss goodbye, the teachers too.
The next two days belong to you.
Rock. Rock.
48 hours. 48 hours.
To rock. To rock.
We got 48 hours. 48 hours to rock.
