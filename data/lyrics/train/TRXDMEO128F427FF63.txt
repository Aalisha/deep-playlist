Love on the rocks ain't no surprise
Just pour me a drink, bitch
And I'll tell you some lies
Got nothing to lose,
So you just sing the blues, all the time

Gave you my heart, gave you my soul
You left me alone here
With nothing to hold
Yesterday's gone
Now all I want is a smile

At first they say they want you
They really need you
Suddenly you find you're out there
Walking in a storm
