I know that my old life is ending
Very soon I'll lose my breath
But raise up high or slow descending
Is the question after death

Death is a forecourt to hell, where the lost of humanity dwell

In the realm of the other side
I saw some spirits a force of might
Black and white and side by side
They will take me beyond the light
