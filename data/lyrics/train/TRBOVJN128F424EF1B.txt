Behind these walls
You can be so self-absorbed
Behind those eyes, no disguise
Disguise, no you can't disguise
Behind this fortress of an address
Stuck in the passion void
With a little style full and for a while
But you can't turn back time

Dear Miami
You're the first to go
Disappearing
Under melting snow
Each and everyone
Turn your critical eye
On the burning sun
And try not to cry

Strictly rolling V.I.P.
