In the middle of the night, wakened by the wind
Or was it something from my past, come to call again?
It was the presence of the pain that I could not escape
And it wrapped around my soul like a ball and chain.

This ball and chain.

In the middle of the night, wakened by the wind
Or did I hear it call my name like a faithful friend?
