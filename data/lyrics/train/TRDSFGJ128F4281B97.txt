(I'll keep on holding on)
Oh yes I will
(I'll keep on holding on)

I know that you the kind of guy (you're the kind of guy)
That got too much pride
Scared to love someone (yeah, love someone)
Run and hide

And each and every day
And each and every way
My love is growing stronger
And I know that you can't hold out too much longer

When there's no place left to hide
I'll still be by your side
...
