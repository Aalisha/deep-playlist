When I look at you I think of everything I don't have
Everything you are is everything I'll never be
Blinded by the light, blinded by the darkness
Blinded by the sense I'll always be reckless

When I look at you I think of everything I don't know
Everything you say is every place I've never been
Blinded by the light blinded by the darkness
Blinded by the sense I'll always be aimless
