Sing along with the shadows
Sing a song to bring about the end
Of your resistance
To the simple fact that you're dead
What did you have to believe in?
What can you say that hasn't already been said
What makes you any different than me
Other that the bullet inside of your head?

All your life was hit or miss
Living under the false pretense
That you were so special
That you were someone
