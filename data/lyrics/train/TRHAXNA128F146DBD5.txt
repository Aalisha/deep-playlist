You can dance every dance with the guywho gives you the eye, let him hold you tight.
You can smile every smile for the manwho held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight. But don't forget who's taking you home, and in whose arms you're gonna be, so darling, save the last dance for me. Mmm, oh I know that the music's fine, like sparkling wine, go and have your fun! Laugh and sing, but while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone! But don't forget who's taking you home... Mm, baby, don't you know I love you so, can't you feel it we will touch? I will never, never let you go, I love you oh so much. You can dance, go and carry on till the night is gone and it's time to go.
