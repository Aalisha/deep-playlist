Captured by time, I'm trying to move
But my limbs don't react. I've lost control
I'm so frail but I'm reaching the door
And I lean against, but it's closed

The fire will burn, no matter what I'm trying to do
And it seems that the flames are laughing
Figures all around, they're reaching for me
The play with me, a bloody game

And I'm tired now, I don't care anymore
'Cos there is nothing I can do, nothing I could ever do
And my chains won't fall
...
