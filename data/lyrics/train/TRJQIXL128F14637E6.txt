Life is a roller coaster that we all ride
Life is a roller coaster that we all ride
Life is a roller coaster that we all ride

Iceberg, I've fallen in love with an
Iceberg, its only the tip of the
Iceberg, I've heard that it's cool

I got class, I got style
But once in a while out on the town, I must go
You'd better wash out your zone
Watch out you stone bone headed woman
Watch out you bone headed man

Iceberg, it's freezin' over Second Avenue
There's not a thing that you can
Iceberg, it's freezin' over Second Avenue
You'd better believe there's nothin'
You can do about it
