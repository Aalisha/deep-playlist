Where's your dirty mind when
You need it, you left that in your
8th grade suit, maybe some girls
Would think it cute if you put it on
Show 'em what you're made of, yeah
What happened to love, in its first stage
We left that when we wanted more
Now tell me what should be in store
Be adventurous, show 'em what
You're made of, yeah
