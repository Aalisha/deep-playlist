Well, I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night
I'm ready, I'm willin', and I'm able to rock and roll all night
Come on, pretty baby, we gonna rock, we gonna roll until the broad daylight

Because I'm ready
And I'm able
I'm willin' and I'm able
So you better come and go with me
We gonna rock and roll till tomorrow `bout three
