(Love me, love me-lo)
(Love me, love me)
(Love me, love me-lo)
(Love me, love me, love me)
(Love me, love me, love me)
(Love me, love me, love me-lo)
(Bom, boo-loo, lo-lo-lo)

I need it (I need it)
When the moon is bright
I need it (I need it)
When you hold me tight
I need it (I need it)
In the middle of the night
I need your honey love
(Bom, boo-loo, lo-lo-lo)
I want it (I want it)
When the lights are low
I want it (I want it)
Just before you go
I want it (I want it)
Because I love you so
Have a-little, a-mercy
And give some (honey love)
Now, throw your arms around me
Pretend that you're lovin' dove
