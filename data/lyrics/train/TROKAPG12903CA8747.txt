There you are standin' with those teardrops in your eyes
Tellin' me you're sorry for things you've done
I've heard that same old story so many times before
I know what you're doin' and I know where you're stayin' at night

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
