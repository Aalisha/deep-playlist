A lifetime of misdeeds
has lead you to me
you've made your last mistake.
This time you won't get away.

[Solo: Hobbs]

I'll see to it
that these are you last breaths,
and strip the life with my bare hands.
You never saw me coming,
now I've got you
It's gone on too long, this time it ends.

And now I'm to take your life,
and still this will not rectify
what have you down.
What have you done?
To torture the soul, undeserving
