Through my window I just saw you
You were walkin' by with someone new-ew
Oh what I'd give to be walkin' wi-ith you

Window wishin', that's all I do
Just window wishin' because of you
Without your love I can't go on
And face this world

For me there'll never be another you
Oo-ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh-ooh
Oo-ooh-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh-ooh
