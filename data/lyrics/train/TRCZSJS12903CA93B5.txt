Must be mildly crazy
Thinkin' that you're goin' preciate me
Cuz you just be kinda lazy
Cuz I think it's time you celebrate me

Always tryna do the things you like
Why d'you have to make it a waste of time
I lay it out baby you must be blind
Chasin' my tail again

And even saying I love you
Never ever sounds enough
But you know that I do
The sky could be clear babe
But you never call it blue
Why don't you
You F-F-fool

Could be a big neon plus sign
