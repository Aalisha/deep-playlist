Some people said, if I could only care for you
Some people said, he will never love again
Some people said, you can see it in his eyes
He keeps it all inside and yet . . . .
Some people say, in time, we all teach ourselves to live this way

And for a thousand days, I was lost
I thought never to be found,
Underground
And don't you think I'm ready now?
So please send me someone to love . . .

Please send me someone, someone to love
As much as I loved you
(The way I loved you, darlin')
Please, please send me someone, someone to love
Please send me someone

Any time, any day, any time, any day now
Any time any day, any time, any day now
Please, please send me someone
