[King is back on his throne and he organizes a big celebration. While the warriors celebrate along with the king, in the great hall, a glowing warrior appeared on his white horse, outside of the walls. He is Lugh, the incarnation of the God Of The Sun, and asks to enter the brotherhood of Tuatha De Dannan. The arrival of Lugh encourages Tuatha De Dannan, and they accept to be trained for battle, while strong Fomorians army is disembarking on shore.]

Through a great celebration on the crest of the hill
Though my coming's a vision revealed
Facing warriors riding with power across
Aonvarr oh my great white horse

Though a man of science and talents I fear
It will take more than knowledge and spears

Dishonor has lasted long enough...

By the Gods I feel a great desire to kill these savages
By the Gods I will kill them myself no one now will be spared
