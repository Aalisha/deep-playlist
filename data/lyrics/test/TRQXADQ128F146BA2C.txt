Well hello it's been so long,
and I see time has been kind to you.
Though we once were handing gloves,
You're not the same person I once I knew.
Take a good look at yourself,
From the frown and despairing eyes,
Once were fiery and so bright,
Now seem sad and unsatisfied.

Wipe the tears from your eyes,
And remember you are

One in a million, one chosen soul,
...
