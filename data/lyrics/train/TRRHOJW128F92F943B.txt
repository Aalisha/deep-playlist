Many a man bear the scars of laboring to pay a toll
They lie just to exploit our miners and hell bent to export our coal
Come step into our territory and our laws you shall not adhere
They're gaining control through the voting and bribery built on your fear
Lay down the bible and take up the rifle
Our blood runs thick down the banks of the crooked creek
These grass roots have all been tilled for generations next in line
