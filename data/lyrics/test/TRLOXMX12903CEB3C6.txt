hands trembling
rusting veins
feverish dreams
i see myself from above
bitter cold
frozen tears
all love / brings fear
we had nothing / we had nothing to fear
the world was silent
a whisper, load rc.heaven
skies burning
still keep your dreams alive
civilized, pixelized
tumbling down, hitting rock
smashed down
hammered down
it'll heal
it'll never heal
shine shimmer autumn day
...
