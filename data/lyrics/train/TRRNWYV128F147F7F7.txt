I arrive in the jungle
in my new khaki clothes
make a splash in a pontoon plane
bought and paid for by those

who demand a tally
of the dark horse, the bad seed
poking and prodding progenitors
of respiratory disease are we

Whiteworld

I have institutions in the West
to make institutions in the East
I historically revise
with Deconstructionist ease

to name is to own
to market is to steal
I'm a gangster in a Hummer
& this culture will yield to me
...
