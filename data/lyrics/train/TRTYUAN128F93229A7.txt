Why can't i think straight?
Can't concentrate on anything
Why does my heart skip?
Why do i trip?
On everything i say to you
So may questions
Leavin' me guessing
All of the classic signs
Fell like a yo-yo
The highs and the low lows
Happening all at same time

Isn't it a lot like love?
Isn't this the way it feels?
The naked emotion you can't conceal
Isn't it a lot like love?
