[Chorus] 
35 a gram is too much for me 
They got it for 29 up the street 
So please, papi, work with me 
Cuz see 35 g's for a key is too much for me 
35 a gram is too much for me 
They got it for 29 up the street 
So please, papi, work with me 
Cuz see I don't wanna hurt you papi 
[Verse 1] 
No I don't usually rap about crack and all that 
I ain't doing the Devil's job, nah, fuck that 
And I don't usually just rap to jaw jack 
But I'ma take you back, way back, before rap 
Before I had to fight with a kid got clapped 
Before all of my fist fights and nap nap
