Yes, yes
There comes a point in your life
When you have to come to grips with yourself
And say just like Jacob
That 'I won't let go until you bless my soul'
N-now it took some time to get to place in your life
And I don't know about you but I refuse to allow God's presence
to come in and leave without a blessing
My, my, my, my
And leave without a new anointing
You need to say this with me
Come on

Now that you're here
I don't wanna let you go
I don't wanna let you go, no
I don't wanna let you go
No-o Lord
Now that you're here
I don't wanna let you go-o-o
I just can't wanna let you go (Ooooo, no)
No, no-o-o

Now that your presence is here
I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna)
I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna)
I don't wanna let you go (Oh-o-o-ohhh No)
Oh no

I'm in love with you Jesus, said I
I don't wanna let you go (I-I-I-I-I)
I don't wanna let you go (Can you just wait one minute)
I don't wanna let you go (Don't go please, no)

I'll just stay here
In your arms forever (Forever)
