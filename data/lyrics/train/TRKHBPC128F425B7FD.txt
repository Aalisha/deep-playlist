Roasted visions unherald the call
Pay the piper or face the fall
Unpleasant benevolence
Undesired, it's your defence

Rotting flavoured retribution
Burning hotly in your throat
Perished antiseptic inner domains
Drowning love begins to float

The familiar screams aloud
Mainline my blackened bones
Exaction with a vengeance
History consumes it's own

Wicked voice, a whispering flame
Stems from all past foul deeds
Telling me that you're to blame
Ruled by your bitter creeds
...
