Hold tight
Hold tight
If you wanna make this feeling stay
sl? miospflh kb
Hold tight
Hold tight
Dont let this moment fade away
Hold tight
Now tears gonna stay
Everybody gets the chance someday
Call it once it last you think you ve got it made
Not a word that anyone can say
That can change the way you feel
Cause you know that love is real
You can choose within you fall in love
Anybody any moment any way
Cause no matter who you chose
Theres a chance that you might loose
Gonna the best that I can do
