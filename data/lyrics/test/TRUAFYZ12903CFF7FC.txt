Maybe you think it's just a game,
But I swear it's not the same.
Cause there's so much more inside my heart for you.

And you are the only one,
Why my life has just began.
I wanna sing this song for you,
Just to let you know.

I wanna show you what I feel inside,
Becuase the feeling is good and oh the
Feeling is right.
It is the only way to tell you the truth,
The only way to do the thing that I could.
Some people say that everything is illusion,
Like a belly of dreams that is filled with confusion.
But we have flesh and blood and all the things we do,
is a gift of life and it's all for you.
