Summoned from the fields of terror 
We approach with a ghastly speed 
Devoted to the cause of aggressive submission 
Striking down the enemy? s opposition 

Brought forth by the sun 
Riding on the streams of destruction 
Our wings are carried by blackest emotions 
Carrying the instruments of perdition 

Resistance is futile and expect no mercy 
...
