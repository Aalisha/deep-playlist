Oh, my heart aches
deep inside me.
Oh, how I miss you.
Will you come back?
Oh, why'd you leave me?
Oh, what can I do?

'Cause every night I sit here by the phone.
You know it rings a lot inside my head.
I daydream you're home.
I never knew that it would go this far.
Come pick me up, I'm going down
like a falling star.
