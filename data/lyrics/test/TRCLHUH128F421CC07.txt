So the skin has turned its back on me again
And it's back to playschool for me and my childhood friend
Well get over it!

And the words don't leave my mouth till I've had a dram
So I sit in the corner and watch you like the man I am
Well get over it!
Get over it!

D'you want my side, my side of the story?
D'you want my side, my side of the story?
Well I want you, want you like I'm eighteen
