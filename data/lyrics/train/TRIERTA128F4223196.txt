Well, I tripped, fell down naked
Well, I scratched my knees they bled
Sew up my eyes, need no more
In our game, there is no score!

Forgive me father why should ya bother
Try honesty, try honesty
Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me, ride over me
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy, die tragedy
Call me a cheapskate, come on for pete's sake
Cry agony, cry agony
