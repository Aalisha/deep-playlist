I was walking along
Mindin' my business
When out of the orange colored sky
Flash, Bam, Alakazam

Wonderful you came by
I was hummin' a tune
Drinkin' in sunshine
When out of that orange colored view

Flash, Bam, Alakazam
I got a look at you.
One look and I yelled "timber"
Watch out for flying glass
'Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell out
...
