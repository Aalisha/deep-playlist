Marie Laveau (1974)
The most famous of the voodoo queens that ever existed
Is Marie Laveau, down in Louisiana
There's a lot of weird ungodly tales about Marie,
She's supposed to have a lot of magic potions, spells and curses...

Down in Louisiana, where the black trees grow
Lives a voodoo lady named Marie Laveau
Got a black cat's tooth and a Mojo bone
And anyone who wouldn't leave her alone
She'd go another man done gone

She lives in a swamp in a hollow log
With a one-eyed snake and a three-legged dog
