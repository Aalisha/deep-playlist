i dont ever wanna see you cryin'
and i dont ever wanna see you blue
ohh no
all i ever wanted to do was know you
and maybe hope you could know me too
well i dont ever wanna make you sorry
for anything you've ever said or done
ohhh no
all i ever wanted to do was love you
and maybe hope you could love me too
