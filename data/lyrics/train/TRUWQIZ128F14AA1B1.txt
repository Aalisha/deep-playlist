It always occurs to me
How lovely you look today
Just how you smile that way
Makes my heart melt
Seemed like just yesterday
When you stole my breath away
You walked into my life
You completed my soul
When you walked into my life
You completed my soul

Now I'm in peace yeah, yeah
I'm in peace
Whoa
I'm in peace when I'm with you
You set me free
You're all I need
Lift me off my feet
Beauty Queen

Where did you find that soul of yours
You must have traveled through heaven
