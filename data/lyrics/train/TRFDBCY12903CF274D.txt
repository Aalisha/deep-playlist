The deformation of this land
That I hold dear
The fornication of our rights
Forgotten
Fit the mold or at odds be damned

Fear is our tradition
Rise from the sheep we are
Face your destination
(Or be predetermined)
We'll find our own way out
(Find our own way)
Find our own way out
(Find our own way)

Go!

Trust the plain and simple minds
So moronic
Feel the knife inside our backs
Still thrusting
...
