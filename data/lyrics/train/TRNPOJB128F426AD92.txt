Fire

Show no serenity
For medicating thoughts of a real life
Beyond the ruins lies our victory, just out of reach

Forgotten savior
Nothing could purify your actions
Nothing to prove, nothing to prove
Betrayal left you out in the frame, the frame

We seem surprised at the nature of man
When all along, we were there to lend a helping hand
