Everything you said to me was constant lies
Everyday you fail to see I'm trying to help you

I'm losing grip on you
Can't seem to pull this though
You fight, can't win
Your time, at hand

Where is your belief
Can you save yourself
One more time, one more lie
Will it ever end

More repetition of your failing ways
More ammunition, come and put you in your final place
Can't stand to see you lose your saving grace
