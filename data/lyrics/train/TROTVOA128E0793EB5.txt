How would you feel if I was to kneel right down,
at your feet, right now?
Is the way it's going to be from
now until to forever,
Let's have less of getting clever with me

Who would you blame for blowing the flame right out?
Is it me?
There is no doubt I can do what I want to do from
now until forever,
Let's have less of getting clever with me

You're wasting your time
and my time as well la la la living a lie,
...
