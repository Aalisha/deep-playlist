First she took him to town
But the reason for this was not found
And before he even wanted to cry
She said: summer days go by 

Next she showed him around 
Let me introduce and glad that I found
But the harder he wanted to try
She said summer days go by
Would you please identify
There's no time to cry

It was easier
When he ran away
Almost every day
No talking - no say
It was easier
When he tried to hide 
So deep down inside
And turn out the light

It's birthday coming around
But the people for this were not found
And before he could fall on the ground
She said summer days go by
Would you please identify
...
