Sit back, no song is written
It's nothing you thought of Yourself
It's just a ghost, came unbidden
To this house

This infection gets stronger every year
This seed in the water of your tear
There is no escaping it

This seed in the water of your tear
The way an unborn baby's ear
Unfolds in your belly

This infection gets stronger every year
This direction of a tear rolling down your cheek
And there is no escaping it

There is no escaping
The thing that is making
It's home in your radio
...
