Aiiyo, straight up
I'm sick of watchin' all y'all rappers and actors
On MTV Cribs playin' basketball at ya house
I'm sick of watchin' y'all mess up Celebrity All-Star Weekend
Ya non lay up makin' motherfuckers, y'all suck
I'll bust all y'all asses one on one
We'll play to eleven, I'll spot ya five points
And I'll still serve that ass
This J-Zone talkin' to you boy, come on
Now that every ball player wanna rap and every rapper wanna ball
I'm talkin' shit one on one, I drop a dime on 'em all
Look I make records but when I get time ballin' is my hobby
Ball playin' rap dudes, none of y'all can stop me
Bow wow's got game but he's five foot three
Nice crossover dog, try that jive on me
Might need a little backup to hang with me
Fuck that, two on one call Jermaine Dupri
Call Kriss Kross too, all four of y'all in
You're gonna have to do more than Jump Jump to win
Ice Cube, I love his work but on a court ain't nothin' poppin'
When my jump shot droppin' I be like steady mobbin'
Four, five niggaz in a mother ship
Cube, take it to the rappin' bring the Jeri curl back
Timberlake is the man for flashin' Janet's tits
But his hoop game is so weak, even Magic can't assist
I saw Nelly playin' ball but his game was sturrr
