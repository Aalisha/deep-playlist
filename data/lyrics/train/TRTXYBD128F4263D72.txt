Sometimes, 'bout every twenty years
It comes, and everyone's in fear
We pray, and hope we will survive
If they don't like me then I die 
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout style
Cause style can make or break you honey-chile
No, I ain't talkin' 'bout war,
I'm talking 'bout style
I hope this time it stays around a little while
Talkin' 'bout style
