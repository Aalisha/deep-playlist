I sold my soul to you, I sold my soul to the Devil his due
I... I sold my soul
I sold my soul, and I sold yours too "To the Devil we're due"

Ohhh... I sold my soul

That night was the darkest of all
That night I sold my soul to you... to the Devil his due
I sold my soul
No point in turning around, there's no way out of here, no!
No point in turning around, just live with the fear
