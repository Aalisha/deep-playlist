I know your leaving's too long overdue 
For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you 
Goodbye dry eyes, I watched your plane 
Fade off west of moon 
Then it felt so strange to walk away alone 
Chorus: 

No regrets 
No tears goodbye 
Don't want you back 
We'd only cry again 
Say goodbye again 
The hours that were yours, echo like empty rooms 
...
