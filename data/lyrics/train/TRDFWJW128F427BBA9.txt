Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Take it Slowly
Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
And Make you want me

Now that I escape, sleepwalker awake
Those who could relate know the world ain't cake
Jail bars ain't golden gates Those who fake, they break,
When they meet their 400 pound mate
If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse
I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week.
Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
A born again hooligan only to be king again

Ready Or Not, Here I Come
You Can't Hide
Gonna Find You
