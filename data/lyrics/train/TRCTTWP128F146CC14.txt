Mom and Dad we're right
Greed will never get anything
When you see the light you'll feel
Like you want to fly
There's birds in the sky
And the trees will sing
And the world looks mighty good to me

The world is out of sight
And now you can't touch anything
But when you see the light you'll feel
Like you're out of time
So just leave it all behind
And go quietly
...
