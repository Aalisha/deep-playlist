Oh you now no wear...
Command baby show wear...
Love keep singing in my mind...

Baby you now man a sound...
A garey if you wich an every day...
Daren wonch a listen...
No world a sou never make my day...
But a one a sign a no hear a call on me...
Crazy things going in my mind...
An a want a feel nedly slowly take a nover...
Never get tell wich you find aiie aiie aiie...
