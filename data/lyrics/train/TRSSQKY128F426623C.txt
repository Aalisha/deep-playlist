Does it feel like you're never gonna find it?
And does it feel like you're always one step behind it?
And does it feel like you're out in this world alone?
'Cause you been looking and praying for love so long

Does it feel like you're wishing on a falling star?
Does it feel like you're lonely and it breaks your heart?
'Cause it feels like you're ready to let down your guard
Finding somebody's just so hard

How do you find the one you dream about?
(How do you find it? Yeah)
If I knew I'd tell you how
(Swear to God, swear to God)
It's kinda hard for me to figure out
(And I know you're ready to settle down)
I know you're ready to settle down
(If there's a God above please tell us)

Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
(Will I ever fall in love?)
Or will I be alone forever?
(I just gotta know)
Tell me, will I ever fall in love?
