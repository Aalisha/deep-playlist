Sunshine when you a re with me I can fly
Sunshine when you are with me I can fly

Every day I wonder why
Peace on earth' s so hard to find
Real peace begins inside
In our hearts and in our minds

Hearts and minds begin to see
That one and all means you and me
And what we know can set us free
Rearrange reality

Reality is what we know
We can change a river' s flow
Plant a seed, watch it grow
Build a shelter, build a home

Home is where my heart will stay
Even when I' m far away
Makes no difference what they say
As long as you will be my

Sunshine when you' re with me I can fly
Sunshine when you' re with me I can fly

When I' m feeling sad and low
And I'm not sure where to go
And all the good times that Iâ€™ve known
