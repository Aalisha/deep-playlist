Tomorrow comes a day too fucking soon
And the world that you've created, it falls apart beneath you
Live like a king, die like a pig
Wallow in the dirt and breathe in the shit

[Chorus:]
We all burn at the sound of your voice
Crushed by the weight of your fist
We all burn at the look in your eye
And die just to live deprived
