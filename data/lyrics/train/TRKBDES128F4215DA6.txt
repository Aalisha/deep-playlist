Stronger
Stronger
Stronger
Stronger
Stronger
Stronger
Stronger
Stronger
Now now
What a feeling
You're the reason
Can't conceive it
You can't beat it
You are viable
To my survival
Come and skydive
Into my life

We're inseparable
No one is acceptable (but you)
Our love's indestructable
Our bond is unbreakable (that's true)

Let the feeling take control
Now that I've got you baby
Now that I've got you baby
I'm feeling stronger
Now that I've got you baby
Now that I've got you baby
I'm feeling stronger

All stand up
