I know I'm not a bad guy
when I try to do what's right
everyone who comes to me don't understand or see my plight
everything I've ever done
all the plans I've had in sight
always missed and gone wrong in a way
until I gave up and said alright, alright, alright,

Let me alone cause no one wants to be
hanging around with someone messing up like me
...
