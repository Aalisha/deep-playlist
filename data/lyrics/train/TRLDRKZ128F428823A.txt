I used to date and never fall in love
Just lookin' for an experience
Spending my time wasting it foolishly
Exploring my possibilities

But then one day I ran into you
You gave me feelings I never knew
I'd like to spend my weekends with you
And weekdays too
Wouldn't that be cool
I think I'm fallin' in love with you

So I'll be spendin' my time with you
There's nothing I'd rather do
I never had a lover like you
That makes me feel like the way that you do
...
