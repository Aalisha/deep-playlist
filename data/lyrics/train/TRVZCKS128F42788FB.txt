It's only two o'clock and the temperature's beginning to soar
And all around the city you see the walking wounded and the living dead
It's never been this hot and I've never been so bored
And breathing is just no fun anymore
Then I saw you like a summer dream
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said
I saw you like a summer dream
And you're the answer to every prayer that I ever said
You can feel the pulse of the pavement racing like a runaway horse
The subways are sizzling and the skin of the streets is gleaming with sweat
I've seen you sitting on the steps outside
And you were looking so restless and reckless and lost
I think it's time for you to come inside
I'll be waiting here with something that you'll never forget
...
