Hey

You've got them trophies of selection
Hangin' all around your house
And then you kinda run make believe
And you're quiet as a little mouse

But there are people
Who've seen this thing before
Two months spill 'em out, tell 'em what it's all about
And then you close the door

All in all
I've been wonderin'
If you're insane

You've got that bad baby passion
...
