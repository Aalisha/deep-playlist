Louis Collins took a trip out west
And when he returned little Delia'd gone to rest
The angels laid her away
Louis said to Delia, "That's the sad thing with life"
"People always leaving just as other folks arrive"
The angels laid her away
When the people heard that Delia was dead
All them gentlemen they dressed in red
The angels laid her away

The angels laid her away
Laid her six feet under the clay
The angels laid her away

Louis went downtown for a new suit of clothes
Gonna dress up for Delia like a fine red rose
