Hey, it's me.

Six-foot me,
From down the street
I drive by (drive by)

To say "hi," (mm)

And you be

My baby,
Though sometimes we

Fuss and fight
Then you leave,
Not to-night.

(Just see) (refrain)

Love ev-er-y inch of your body
The scent of your skin I can't live without it
Wanna scream, shout it (eh)
Tell the world about it
(you should know)

Your love is supreme
You're everything I dream
Your soul the same (babe)
The summer, spring
You're the queen of queens
