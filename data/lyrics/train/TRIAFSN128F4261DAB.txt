Close your eyes
Give me your hand, darlin
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming
Is this burning, an eternal flame

I believe
It's meant to be, darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong to me
Do you feel the same
Or am I only dreaming
Is this burning, an eternal flame

Say my name, sun shines through the rain
