Well I'm truckin' on down from Memphis
Cruisin' down to New Orleans
Tonight he sleeps alone with a Cajun Queen
Well there's smoke from the stacks a-blowin'
And he don't care where he's goin'
The only time he feels right is when he's rollin'

He's got road maps in his hand
Lord, drivin' just as hard as he can
Trying to dodge all scales and the man
Well I'm talkin' about truck drivin' man
Yea he'll always give ya the best that he can

White cups and coffee, Lord yea
It's all that he needs and he's all right by me
Truck drivin' man, truck on
Truck driver, shift your gears
