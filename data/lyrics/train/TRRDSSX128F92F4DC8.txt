From our lives beginning on

We are pushed in little forms

No one asks us how we like to be
In school they teach you what to think
But everyone says different things
But they're all convinced that
They're the ones to see
So they keep talking and they never stop
And at a certain point you give it up
So the only thing that's left to think is this
I want out

To live my life alone

I want out

leave me be
