Reality suspends my present life
Curious thoughts, I confront my mortality
Uncertain to the laws of the unknown
I have no fear in facing trials of the mind one by one
Sifting through ossuaries of creation
Looking for a worth, is existence pointless?
Perceptive to the truth, I never may return
Resistance falling short, I sever all my ties one by one

Vanish into the unseen origins of infinity
A pleasant swim in the seas of dormant ecstacy
A state of being I could spend with all of eternity
Suspended above the remains of what I used to be

I can see things not capable of imagining
