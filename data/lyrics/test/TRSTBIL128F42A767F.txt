Don't need a justify who I am what I am,
I just wanna be me!
Don't wanna live a lie who I am what I am,
how can I make you see?

I'm just myself like noone else,
I've got to walk my own way.

I'm not your everyday girl,
let me show you my world,
I am ready and nothing can't stop me now.
I'm not your everyday girl,
be a part of my world,
are u ready common let me show you how...

Let me do my thing, not givin up, givin in,
they can't keep me down!
