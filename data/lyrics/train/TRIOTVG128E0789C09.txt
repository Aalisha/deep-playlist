Girl I caught you in your little white lie
Red handed, red handed
You said you had to work tonight
But here you are dancin', slow dancin'

In this honky tonk with someone else
And all you got to say for yourself is so so?
I'm sorry, so?

So, so long bye bye baby
I'll catch you on the flip side maybe, don't you
Slip slide on a tear when you find me gone

Go, go on, cry crybaby
Those tears are gonna drip drop maybe
But you're gonna miss my good love baby
For so so long, so so long
...
