Hey
Hey come on let's go,
I wanna see your soul,
running through that door,
I've got a seed to sow,

hey come on let's go,
I wanna see your soul,
running through that door,
I've got a seed to sow,

hey come on let's go,
I wanna see your soul,
are you running through that door?,
are you running through that door?

Oh the sand sand sand,
the sand scratches my face,
while the tears tears tears,
they fall in my embrace,

and the waves crash down,
where the rocks meet the sand,
why do none of these fears come out on dry land?,
just when I'm drowning,
just when I'm drowning.

Hey, Hey come on lets go,
I wanna see your soul,
...
