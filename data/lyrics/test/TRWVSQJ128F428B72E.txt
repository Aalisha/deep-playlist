I said hey! Hey! Hey!
I said hey! Hey! Hey!

I see the faces everywhere, wanna see them all
And I see the monikers written on the wall
Starts like an echo turns into a roar
The sound of silence never heard before

We meet them everyday
The ones that gives us strength
To make it possible all in all, all in all
To find it right here
It's nothing new, yeah! Yeah!
To find it right here
Within all we do

Stories have been spoken, struggles we've been through
...
