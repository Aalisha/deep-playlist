Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved, and she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
