If I could find a way
To soothe your troubled mind
Then I would erase your fears
And help you to unwind

I would ease the burden
That you carry everyday
Oh, don't you know I'd find a cure
And take your pain away

Take your pain away
Take your pain away
Take your pain away
Take your pain away

And even though you're far from here
...
