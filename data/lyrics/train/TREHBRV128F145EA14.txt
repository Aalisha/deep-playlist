I don't wear my shirt tucked in
I like a little barbecue on Sunday
Well, I hang with a rougher crowd
Who drink too much, who talk too loud
Don't you know that it's all right with me
Yeah, I don't go to church too much, but I know that Jesus truly loves me
And if he was here I'd be drinking beer and
Hanging out and saving all of my friends, Amen

Who's to say and who are you to judge me anyway
This is my road, I take the corner as fast as I can go
Who's to say at how I got so lucky anyway
I am my own at least until the Man come and take me home
