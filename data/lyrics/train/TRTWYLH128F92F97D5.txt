Ah 1, 2, 3, 4!
St Louis hot Summer
Got the sudden urge to call my number
I feel it another scene is comin' down down down
She answers she's cryin'
Says she's tired of all the hurt and tryin'
I feel it I can see us goin' down down down

Whatcha gonna do about your lover
Whatcha gonna do about your friend
Whats it gonna take to find another
Another one to break your heart again

Rough landing late night time
See my hand against the New York skyline
