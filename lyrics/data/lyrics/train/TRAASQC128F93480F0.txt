Information kept to myself
And everybody wants to know
I trust the words of no one else
'Cause I've been there before
Your voice is wasted 'cause I'm not listening

These calloused fingers are wrapped around a black ball-point pen
These eyes don't wonder as far as they at one time did
I've seen the future, it's fading faster

No place that I'd rather be than right here, right now
