[Intro]
Ohhh yeah! Petey Pab' is in here
Yo what's up y'all?
Yo let me hear y'all make some noise
C'mon! Get 'em up!
Y'all ready to get it on?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
[Petey Pablo]
With it with it one mo' 'gin, Petey back in this bitch (HA!)
Wit-a wit-a wit-a new-new damn flow that's sick
Get ready to change it back, it's a new ball in the game now
New rules, ain't no out of bounds
Nigga nigga this shit's storm, them boys
Keep your, proper composure, your p-poise (y-yeah)
We don't want a forum, we just wanna show 'em
That-that we got somethin if we need to throw 'em
Maaaan, we the coolest that there is (nigga)
This here, this year, came with the papers and package, it did
I'm a, I'm a real gangsta
Slash, rapper, you the dick?
Greasy grimy grid-itty, ain't no playin Pid-etey
