In heavy constenation
I move across the hall,
I pictured this so many times,
I wasn't scarred at all…
But everytime I got this far,
I never felt so small…

My mind was full of questions,
Arguements and lies,
But every word was melted down,
When I looked in your eyes,
And I don't need these memories,
For now I'm mesmerized…

And I'm staring down
The barrel of my life…

Now I'm in trance,
You posess my full attention,
To how my thought stands
Freely on the journey you attended all along,
To somewhere I belong,
Like a pilot in the sky of dreams.

Can you promise me the world,
And everything I need,
Can you promise me the world?
Can you promise me a sky,
That's trouble-free and clear,
So it's safe for me to fly?
