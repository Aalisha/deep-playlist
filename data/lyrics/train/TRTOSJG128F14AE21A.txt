You wanted to know if
If it was worth the pain that it has caused us.
Both our lives - subtract one life
To know why it was you deserved this

As simple as I can
I'll tell you the difference
Between a pencil and a pen
And where it will leave us now
As your body lets you die,
And I sit here still alive

In my memory I wrote you down in ink
I never wanted to erase your story
