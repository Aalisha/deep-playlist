I need to see you step away from the edge,
I've seen this coming and you're better off alone.
Well it's safe to say,
That you were the one without a plan.
And you've missed the point,
You put the blood on my hands.

Why aren't you trying to escape,
From the fire that I have made.
I won't be the one that kills you...
Now you will find your murderer is.
You build the walls that kept you alone,
I tore them down, just to watch you rebuild.
You built this house to hide from everything you fear,
I merely showed you how to tear that building down.
