Well the first time that I saw you
You were runnin' with the wrong crowd
With your head up in a dark cloud
You know I had this funny feelin'
That you were gunnin' for trouble
But I never knew
So here I go just-a-runnin' after you
Hello Miss Mystery
Here you are so far from me
Someday Miss Mystery
You'll spare me all this misery
We had a big misunderstanding
You said love could tie you down
