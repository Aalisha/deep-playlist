Miss you more than ever
I will wait forever (I will wait)
Until we are together
Trust in yours faithfully (Hey)

My love every time I hear our favorite song
Tellin' me a house is not a home
I learned that it's true
Just being without you

Now I know what love is all about
And I know for certain, there's no doubt
I guess you know how foolish hearts can be
But baby, that's not me

Miss you more than ever
I will wait forever
Until we are together
Trust in yours faithfully

No need to worry
People are lonely
Baby, I will be yours only
Always yours faithfully (Hey)
