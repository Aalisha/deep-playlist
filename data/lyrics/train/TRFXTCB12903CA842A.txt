Before there was time
There were visions in Your mind
There was death in the fall of mankind
But there was life in salvation's design

There were nights I could not see Your face
But the night couldn't keep me from grace
When You came and You took my place

Begotten Son of God
And sing the praises
Of the One who saved me
And the promises He made

Before there was time
