Stop, now, let's go again
Go, don't stop again
No, I don't want to be alone

Yes, it's a time for fun
Dance 'til the night is done
Look, it's a motion picture show

Dancing in Berlin
Dancing in Berlin
Dancing in Berlin
Dancing in Berlin
I want to see you

East, such a mystery
West, open history
You, just a moment flashing by
...
