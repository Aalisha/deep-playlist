In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound

I know it? s been far too long
In stormy weather
My arrested hope won? t choke forever
Like a memory, I needed never

We walk wrapped in thought
Some are vacant, some have grown too short
It? s the only thing I? ve ever had
That keeps me lonely

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
When nobody is around

In the sun we are found
To be reflections of a sound
When nobody is around
