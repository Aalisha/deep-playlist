I found my fickle friend
out in the alley way
He said, You don't look so good.
I said, Hey doc, that's great.
You started practicing?
I never got the note.
So let's shake and trade
and be on our way.
Let's go, go, go.

So here we are again,
inside your neon shrine,
sharing a chopping block
beneath embarassed light
that tries to hide from us
it tucks itself away.
So we both grab hold
and say no you don't.
