She looks in his eyes
He looks away.
She chalks it up as another-one-of-those-days
If there's a reason he's coming home late,
She hasn't heard it yet.

She warms up his dinner,
But he can't eat.
She makes conversation,
But he doesn't speak.
He shakes his head as the silence screams.
'Cause she hasn't heard it yet.
