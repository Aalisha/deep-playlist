Well I'm a hunchback superblack tower block core
Fine tooth whale bait cowering boom bait
Simple boy, simple girl, simple world, so I heard

Landing down feet first smokey Joe *cheeba* thirst
Hairy back tracker side step a little further on the
floor for the more
for the more more

She's a coward she's a cheat and she speaks
She's a coward she's a cheat and she speaks
My mother of Earth where are you when we need you
My mother of Earth where are you when we need you
