[Written by: L. Rutledge & W. Dane]

I've passed into the afterworld
To a place where light can't intrude
I bear this curse transcending time
My pain denies me your truths

Dreaming to be free, yet damned to eternity
Dreams can set me free for awhile
Chained to this burning, yet only a child
My soul must feed, their blood has made me King

Look deep in my eyes
And see the calm before the
Storm winds of the damned are unveiled
And so with your blood
...
