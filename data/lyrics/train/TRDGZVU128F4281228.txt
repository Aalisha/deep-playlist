Yeah, this is Da Vinci

She's blonde as can be
That works for me
Eyes that flash like streetlights
Cash big screen TV
She's perfectly free
Dresses in DKNY

Close the door
Lay down your attitude
Make-up rocks
But freedom knocks
Let me in
I'll show you gratitude
There is no need to pretend

She's another work of art
And she knows it, oh
How she shows it
Just another work of art
(Da Vinci, yeah)
All the girls behind
Every man in line
Working wonders
With her tail-lights
She's another work of art
(She likes me) oh yeah
