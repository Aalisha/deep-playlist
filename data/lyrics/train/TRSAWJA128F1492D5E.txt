Who knows where the cold wind blows
I ask my friends, but nobody knows
Who am I to believe in love?
Oh, love ain't no stranger, mmm

I looked around and what did I see
Broken hearted people staring at me
All searching 'cause they still believe
Oh, love ain't no stranger

I was alone and I needed love
So much I sacrificed all I was dreaming of
I heard no warning, but a heart can tell
I'd feel the emptiness of love I know so well

Love ain't no stranger
I ain't no stranger
