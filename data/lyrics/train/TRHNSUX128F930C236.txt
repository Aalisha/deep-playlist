Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

Here come Mr. 'I ain't like that'
Mr. 'You can count on me'
Here come evolution, walkin' with stupidity

Waste a' time, waste a' my time
Give it up, lay it down, play the bottom line
Waste a' time, waste a' prime time
Hey, let me shut that for you
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey

Yeah, gotta gotta get gotta get me some
