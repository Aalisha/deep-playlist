Songs for my valentine
Give the game away
In rhyme I make mine
Sing all that I cannot say
I know mine are the tears I never cry
I know mine is a love I must deny

We go our separate ways
With nothing but a smile
Hearts break in many ways
Oh how, you've broken mine
I know mine are the arms you'll never hold
I know mine is a love remains untold

Hey, hey, hey!
