Bare my teeth in a fit of stability
Cling to level ground
Balancing ability
Side with the positive
More and more progressively
Scale the negative mountain
Always seem to loose my foothold
Got enough gear
To settle in for the long run
One false move
Precautions elude
Tumble in the mood
Never seem to gain my foothold
...
