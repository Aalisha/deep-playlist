Crimson cardinal sees his life,
Into the glass he fl ies.
The perfect partner he does spy,
A moment's glance of eyes.
Refl ections of a future love,
Feel the pull of fate.
The perfect love turned out to be,
Himself in haste and vain,
Passion's fl ash of red,
Bloodied on the pane.

In your eyes I fi nd,
You are my lovelight,
You are my lovelight,
...
