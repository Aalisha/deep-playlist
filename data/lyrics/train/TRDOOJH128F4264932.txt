[Background singers] + (Acey)
Fa-fiii-yah, fa-fa-fi-yahhhhh (Love life let it love you back)
Yeah, what's really goin on?
Ha, yeah love life let it love you back
Yo there's somethin wrong with my radio dial
Some of these fools just ain't got style
I don't know why and I don't know how
But I do know a dude low and you so foul
Let's do the thing most people do with it
Who could it be but the one that done did it
I come with it, yeah rain or shine
I lit it up I hit it up I came to grind
And the game ain't mine but it will be when I'm done
Right now I like to kill MC's for fun
Let your momma know, she'll feel me like a son
And when I'm dead and gone I'll still be #1
I got heat like underneath your seat like
Stoppin at the street light, but I ain't the beef type
I got the herb though, when it's green and crystal-ly
I smoke a joint and hit the mic the rest is history
Aceyalone, but you can call me Acey
I'm a real O.G. like Count Basie
Hook up the recipe so nice and tasty
When I'm done they screamin out Aceyalone, lace me
I'm outspoken, I'm not about jokin
I'm from California but I'm not from Oakland
But they my folks now, fool I'm from SoCal
Put it down like a champion on vocals
Yeah! We always rockin
It's always tight around here
Pull everybody in this bitch close the doors up
