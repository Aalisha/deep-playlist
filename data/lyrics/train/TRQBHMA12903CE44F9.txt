He spends his time or maybe half of his time
Or part of the time wandering
'Round the creeks and cobble stones
Of hackney lanes

With a tear in his eye
As the children walk by, he's thinking of a song
Then stops to paint a picture of a frown
Walking around

Dan Treacy's smile, leaves you trying
To decide who's the victim, what's the crime?
No rest for the mind
That's seen it all before

And I don't know where he lives
But he's a myth of a man
And Texas Bob the cameraman
Is off to fix his sit before the show
Yeah, but where did he go?
