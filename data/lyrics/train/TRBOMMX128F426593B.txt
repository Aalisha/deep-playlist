Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping
And a vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains -
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a streetlamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
-That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
-And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fools", said I, "You do not know"
"Silence, like a cancer, grows"
"Hear my words, that I might teach you"
"Take my arms, that I might reach you"
...
