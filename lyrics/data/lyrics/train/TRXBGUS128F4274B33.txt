Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through.
An' just an old sweet song keeps Georgia on my mind.

Georgia, Georgia, a song of you,
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines.

Other arms reach out to me;
Other eyes smile tenderly.
Still in peaceful dreams I see,
The road leads back to you.
