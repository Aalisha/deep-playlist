Ooooooh Wooooooh!

Ooooooh Wooooooh!
Give me freedom, give me fire, give me reason, take me higher
See the champions, take the field now, you define us, make us feel proud
In the streets are, heads are lifting, as we lose our inhabition

Celebration its around us, every nations, all around us

Singin forever young, singin songs underneath that sun

Lets rejoice in the beautifull game.

And toghetter at the end of the day.

WE ALL SAY

When I get older I will be stronger

They'll call me freedom Just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes back

and then it goes . . . . .
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom Just like a wavin' flag

And then it goes back
