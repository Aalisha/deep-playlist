Listen, be yourself
That's the most important thing I can say now girl
Don't, let anyone change you
I know life hurts but you're gonna make it through somehow

Forget, all the others 
Who were scared so they criticised your views
Of course you're special 
And that's why you're different 
And that's why life is gonna notice you 

You're a girl 
You're a guy
But you're someone if you try
I believe in you
I believe in you
