Picture this
You're going down
I cannot stop the fall

Descending fast
And you hit the ground
Is this the end for us all?

No more will I feel this
Itâ€™s not impossible
Too bad to those
Who missed out on the miracle

Down, down
And we're tearing
Change the structure
We have been tearing it down
Tearing it down
Tear it down
