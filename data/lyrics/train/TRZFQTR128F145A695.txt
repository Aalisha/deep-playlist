Blue moanin', you're down so blue
You do your livin'
And it's what you do
Did you listen to what your daddy say
Or did you find it boring
And just drift away

Blue blue moanin'
It's on it's way to you
Blue blue moanin'
It's really comin' through
You're always right
Til the payment's due
It's due, now you're blue
...
