The Flender Sons are out to play a combat on the drums
I don't know if its true but someone said they had a gun.
I told my parents I'll go out I need another scene
I don't know where, I don't know when I don't know what I mean.

And as the story begins to start I think about the end.
I think about marooney and his invisible friend.
A company collects a colony of drunken dogs.
I don't know where I don't know when I don't know what I want.

What I want...
...
