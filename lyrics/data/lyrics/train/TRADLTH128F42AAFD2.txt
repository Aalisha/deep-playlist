Well I don't really mind
Where you wanna go
'Cause everybody sometimes
Feels the need to be alone
Now it's temporary breakdown
When there's nothing left to say
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna ok

Well it should come as no surprise
When you're dealing with the truth
It should be a state of mind
Or another point of view
So if your confidence is shaken
I can promise it won't break
Show a little faith now
'Cause everything's gonna ok

When nothing's making sense
And the questions never end
You gotta let it go
Every now and then
I can't pretend
