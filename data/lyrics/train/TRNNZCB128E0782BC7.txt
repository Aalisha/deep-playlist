You
Must think that I'm a fool
This twisted tenderness
Just leaves me cool
You've got me in a mess
You know it's true
Out in the wilderness
Here without you

Right outside
It's a cruel world
Something happening, it's distracting
You're just bad news, girl

Never let that feeling die
All you've got to do
Is tell a little lie (tell a little lie, tell a little lie)
Don't you know it's true?
I will never let you down
Spread this message all around
That I hope and that I pray
You can turn my life around

Take
A look out there
