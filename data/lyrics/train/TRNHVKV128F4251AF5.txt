She wakes up in the morning
The sun is shining in her face
She turns her head around
She shares the blanket on which the love embraced

She looks out of the window
It's a lovely day outside
She tells herself that things are fine
He pulls the sheets to cover his eyes

The essence of the fresh air
That garden held the love affair
Thinking back their minds
Are torn in muddle and confusion

So far away another sits
Who tries to make the best of it
He don't know quite what's hit him
It's another love illusion

He gazes in his empty room
Eyes fixed upon her picture
The loneliness, dejectedness
God how the fuck he's missed her

His eyes turn turn to the window
The military roar by
He wonders how much hatred
Could evolve out of the sky

What God had done for peace on earth
