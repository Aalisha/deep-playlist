Caedmon's Call
Just Don't Want Coffee
Forget What You Know
My friend why do you whip yourself
With the leather of your life
Why do your memories build like
Poison in your mind

You're re-running the mistakes (of your mind)
In the theater of your mind
Hoping that there'll be
A happily ever after this time
