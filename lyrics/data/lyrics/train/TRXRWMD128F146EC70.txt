This is not a movie
Things just ain't the same as your favourite video
Try standing back and move me
next to you's a very nice place to go

Talk talk to Suzie!
"I went through a million choices."
Talk ... Suzie! (?)
"I listened to a million voices"
And they said...
"Don't let me down" they said
"Don't let me down again"
No no...

Countdown, countdown, countdown to the disappointment
"I'm yours, tonight!"
Countdown, countdown, countdown to the disappointment
...
