Hot sun beating down
burning my feet just walking around

Hot sun making me sweat
'Gators getting close, hasn't got me yet

I can't dance, I can't talk
Only thing about me is the way I walk
I can't dance, I can't sing
I'm just standing here selling everything

Blue jeans sitting on the beach
her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach

She's got a body under that shirt
but all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt
