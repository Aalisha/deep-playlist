And his name is John Cena!
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, boy, I'm shining now

You can't see me, my time is now
In case you forgot, I fell off
I'm still hot knock your shell off
My money stacked fat
Plus I can't turn the swell off
The franchise
Doing big buisness
I live this it's automatic
I witness so you hear those horns
You finished
A soldier
And I stay under you fightin'
Plus I'm stormin' on your chumps
Like I'm thunder and lightnin'

Ain't no way you breakin' me kid I'm harder than nails

Plus I keep it all locked like I'm part of the jails
