hey girl
I'm standing here
reminiscing
since you're gone
all the things I'm missing

I am Mason, follow Mason

now you're said that we're through girl
I just can't get over you no
and all the things we've been through yeah
I thought this love was for two

can't believe you're in love with someone else girl (yes I'm in love)
can't believe you leave me here by myself yeah (I didn't wanna leave you)
