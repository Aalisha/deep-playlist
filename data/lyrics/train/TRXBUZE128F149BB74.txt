Hey, whatever happened to you last night?
We thought we lost you there
Those long days
And long, long nights
They keep you up inside

Stay awake all night talking about our friends
It never ends
Always do it when we're drunk
I just need some kind of meditation
Keep my feet from
Falling off the ground

La-la, la-a-a-a
Life is better with you
La-la, la-a-a-a
Life is better with you
Ooh, ooh, yeah

See the people on the street
...
