What do you want if you don't want money
What do you want if you don't want gold
Say what you want and I'll give it you darling
Wish you wanted my love baby

What do you want if you don't want ermine
What do you want if you don't want pearls
Say what you want and I'll give it you darling
Wish you wanted my love baby
