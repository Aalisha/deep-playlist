Oh, nothing changes around here
Oh, nothing changes around here
Oh no

Oh, but I see you now
On the outskirts of town
But the fog gets so heavy

But if you're looking for comforting words, so long
Just don't tell me that you loved me all along
But if you're looking for famous last words, so long
Just don't tell me that you loved me all along

I saw your sister last night
And we danced, danced, danced
...
