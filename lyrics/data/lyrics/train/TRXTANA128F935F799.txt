White summer, so far I have gone to see you again
Hiding your face in the palm of your hands
Finding solace in the words I do despise
You snatch at every sound

Memories are tainted with paleness
Crestfallen still
Those eyes, empty like a barren well

It was the only task I would undertake
To reap the harvest that was mine
