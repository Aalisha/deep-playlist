You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop, my life will surely stop
'Cause I'm trapped in a dream of needing you so
My heart's in a noose and I can't break loose
I'm not half the man that I used to be, and I'll admit it
Your love has become a habit to me, and I can't quit it
Won't you take this half a man and make this man whole again?
You've got me dangling on a string
Please don't let me drop, 'cause you're everything I've got
...
