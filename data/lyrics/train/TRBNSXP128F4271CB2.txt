Mrs. Jones is 17 and 6 and 24
Moderately pretty
She is all the girls you know
We are going far away
We're going for a ride
Mr. Jones has got a plan
If you just come inside
So good so far
Slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads
And radio define romance
Don't turn it on
I don't want to dance
Mr. Jones is beautiful
