Talkin' 'bout the science of social deprivation
From 'ere to wherever in the council estates the mans is strugglin'.
The poor lower working class.

Blud, you got to sleep round here and have nightmares,
Wake up and find the worst reality is right there.
The difference is, in my dream's I'm always runnin' scared,
But in reality, on road, I'm comin' prepared.
So now who's gonna wanna run up and become a gonner?
Everybody's gonna wanna get us, but they're on a longers.
I'm still out to get the same cats from last summer,
But man can't see them again,
It's like they've done a runner.
I'm still in the same mannor, on the same number
And everybody knows where I'm at and what I'm under,
I'm in the same slums, raisin' the funds.
In the city where the yute man are blazin' the guns.
Just look how this United Kingdom has come,
Within the council estates where man'll fight over crumbs,
We got young single parent mums,
Havin' the hardest time tryn'a survive for their daughters and their sons
Be comin' out their yutes, cause their yutes are left out there,
Raised on the ways of these streets without care.
Now we're havin' our fair share of gun warefare
And it's all gone nuts and that's just cause it's poor here.
People want more here,
We're all on the floor here,
It's raw here, can't even sleep and ignore here,
Cause life's kinda militant,
Stuck in the grime,
Nothin's equivillent to this council estate of mind.

We know that we have been living our lives through the hardest times,
Still we know that we must keep up the faith in our hearts and minds.
