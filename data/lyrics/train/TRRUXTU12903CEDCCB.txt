You target one's with the loose dirt under your fingers
You found ways to make us turn inside
If I lose my ground, I will stand by to navigate
The escape for the silent ones

So take it to the back of the bar
You make me think what you want to tell me
First I will say anything to make sure you don't

So take it to the back of the bar
You make me think what you want to tell me
First I will say anything

You act less blessed
You are sympathy's great deceiver
