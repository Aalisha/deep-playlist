Hmm, closer
I wanna be closer to you

(I like to get close)
Closer
(I like to get close)
Like to be close to you, baby
(I like to get close
To the one I love)

Oh, baby
I like to get close
To the one I love
So I slow drag

My girl, she asked me
How come I don't do the boogaloo
(Boogaloo)
I told her, baby
'Cause I can't get close
Enough to you
(Close to you)
(Closer, closer)

I told her
That's the only dance
That I like to do
It's a dance
I can hold her yet
Steal a little kiss or two
