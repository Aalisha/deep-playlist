You're softer than a cannon blast
But your effects much longer last
And I want you just like a hole in my head
But I need you like a meal and a bed

And you say, "Come on, I'm not what you're after"
But I know you're not just anyone, anyone

'Cause I'm not what you want
No, I'm not anyone
But if you needed me
Then I could be someone

And you're an army in a horse
...
