We are the face of carnage
Hurdle for the poster nation
Reason for the constipation of this frightened world
The lights obscured
The night brings fear
Nightmares flames are coming near
Fire is getting out of control

Keep sinking in the stench of fear
Helpless in their search of freedom makes them hate
I am the one
I am the one to dominate
I deny my teachings in my unexperienced
You'll deny yours
