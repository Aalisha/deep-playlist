And I Believe That Before You Die 
You Get A Fraction Of A Second 
To Explore Yourself 

And In My Life 
I've Always Wanted Much More 
So In My Time To Explore 
I'll Need Much More 

Traffic Is The Enemy 
Traffic Is The Enemy 
Traffic Is The Enemy 
Traffic Is The Enemy 

One Hundred And Eighty Six Thousand 
Two Hundred And Eighty Two Miles Per Second 

To Live Longer 
In The Subatomic Sense 
I Must Drive Even Faster 
Must Run Even Faster 

Time Will Cease 
The Closer I Get And 
On The Shoulders Of Gods 
I'll Surpass Regret 

It Doesn't Matter How 
Minute The Change 
Because My Mind Is Smaller 
...
