Here I sit smack dab in the middle
Tomorrow is a crazy riddle
I wish I had a crystal ball
I wish I could see 5 years on

Like candle rockets you and I
Oos and ahs and shouts and sighs
Is this the storm before the calm?
I wish I could see five years on

But I can't and you don't
And you try and I won't
Broken trust can be repaired
But it'll take some time
To get us there
But I will and you won't
You try and I don't
We lose a little higher ground
Every time we go around

We always seem to look behind
...
