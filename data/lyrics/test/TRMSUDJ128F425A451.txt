I don't wanna lose her
I don't wanna lose her

They told me that she had found somebody new
But I don't believe it
They said, I would soon find out she was untrue
But I just can't see it

Maybe I am wrong to doubt it
And now that I think about it
If ever I lost her love
I'd be nothing, nothing without it

I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl
After all that we've been through
I don't wanna lose her, lose that girl of mine
Lose that girl of mine

I couldn't imagine life without her love
