Hallo
Hallo
Oh dear, you have phone
Yeah, hey guy, tell me about your manicure

I love you and feel the groove
Tell me about it, is it the true
It's true, yes, it's true

Don't fool out, it's dangerous
Don't worry, baby gold
Everything is same as all
Everything is the same

Oh I love you
Me too
I love you

Let me see what you have done
Let me know what happens here tonight
Love for hire is dangerous
Let me know what happens here tonight

Hey hey guy
(Shell I get you)
Hey hey guy
(Oh yeah)

Hey hey guy
(Stay any longer)
Hey, hey guy
(Oh yeah)

Steps to heaven, three steps to me
Let me know what you are doing tonight
You love me, but sorry I don't love you
Let me know what you are doing tonight

Fool for love and shine
