My casket stands alone in the rain
Even after I'm gone, I'm forgotten and ignored
I never thought it would end like this
I had nothing to give, the world abandoned me

So I just threw it all away
I couldn't take another day
This was meant to be

I hoped I'd leave a legacy
I guess it was only a dream,
A wish left unfulfilled.

Where did it it all go wrong for me?
I guess I was blinded by pain
That burned inside my heart
