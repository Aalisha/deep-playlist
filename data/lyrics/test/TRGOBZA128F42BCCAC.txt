Hey
Wait a minute
Hey

I said baby
I love the way that you hold Me
And you touch me like you know Me
See I don't want nobody Else
And I, I'm bout' to Offer All I can give Him
Cause I'm a slave to his Rhythm
I said I just can't help Myself

Cause baby I love ya'
And I Trust ya'
You don't have to worry bout' Nothing
Oh I'm alive right now, Look at me
And I want ya'
No I need ya'
And I'll do anything to please ya'
I just want you to take control of Me (take control)

I said Hey! (hey)
Show me how you want it Now
(Do you) Like it when I take it Down
I got Everything
And anything you need, I wanna bring it to you Baby
Hey! (hey)
Come a little closer Now
(Don't stop) Wanna go another Round
You got Everything
And anything I need, Want you to bring it to me Baby
