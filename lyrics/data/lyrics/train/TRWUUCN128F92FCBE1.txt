I wanna run from the apathy
from the questioning tongues
and eyes that just won't come off
and get a job in a industry
where a smile's not required
and complaints are always the same

cause baby you must be so fed up
with a boy that keeps telling you
how much good he's gonna do
when all that is happening 'round here
is happening in here
and nothing gets out there
...
