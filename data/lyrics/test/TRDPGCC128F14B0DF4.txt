so many of us breathin and thinkin that we know it all
walkin like we're righteous
forgettin mans fall caused
pain from the womb and still men labor in vain
while their prides in the way death invented the tomb
but we can overcome these tragedies in humanity
by lookin at life through the lens of the Almighty
who manifest and died in flesh for our destiny

i have learned a lesson from all the lessons i have learned
our lives have purpose unless we forget to send a message
to the wanderers (wanderers)
dreamers (dreamers)
to all the people with your beamers (come come come)
come come come out your cages called offices
and (pop pop pop) pop the bubbles that you're in
whether you're black, white, brown, gay, or muslim
(where you from where you from kid)
buddhist or christian
come come come out your cages (what what)
and engage this

CHROUS
engage (come on)
engage (come on)
engage (come on)
