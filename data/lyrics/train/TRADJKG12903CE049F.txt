There's things that i've bought
And there's things I need
It's more than a thought,
You know you better believe
I feel it's not what you got,
But what your giving back means
So much
Lifes beautiful,
And that sucks
Hey if you like it or not
So what, that's all we got

Who cares!
Your telling everybody that the worlds unfair, well
So What! So What!
That's life
It's time to get real,
It's not paradise, well
...
