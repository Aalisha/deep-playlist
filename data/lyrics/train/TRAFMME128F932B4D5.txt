"Fuck me? Fuck you, fuck you and this whole city and everyone in it."
Carved your name into my skin, in candlelight.
Sew it up with hate.
Carve, a message in my arm, in candlelight.
Sew it up with hate.

Found my misery, with a match and gasoline.
Burned alive, I`m a killing machine.
A whole life I`m silent.
Found my destiny, with a match and gasoline.
Liar`s burn and scream, a whole life indebted to you.
