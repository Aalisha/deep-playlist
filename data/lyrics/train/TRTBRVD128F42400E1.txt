my love is in america
and i miss him tonight
so much so
i feel like taking the money we've saved
and catching the flight
and catching the flight

the children are sleeping well
and im on my own
even though i've read his letters
again and again, im alone, im all alone

but the money i've sent home is barely enough
there's an ocean that keeps us apart
i've been lonely from home, but i mustn't give up
