I've been around the ladies
Since I was a baby
They're to blame for my state of mind
Lookin' like a Venus
Oh! She's so deceivin'
Temptin' me, my morals defied
But oh, I don't mind

Every Friday night
She dresses out in black
Saturday she's deadly in red
But on the holy Sunday mornin'
She sets her vice aside
Lookin' like an angel in white

I'll wait a long time for your letters
On my lips, your Judas Kiss
You left your lipstick on my leather
Left me alone with your Judas Kiss
