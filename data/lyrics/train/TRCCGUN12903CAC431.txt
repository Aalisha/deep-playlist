Let it go, don't be scared to breathe again
It's alright, close your eyes
And together we can feel what it's like, to live again
Embrace this world and hold on tight until the end

You don't have to do this alone
'Cause I'm right here
I'm right here standing by
You don't have to do this alone
'Cause I'm right here
I'm right here always for you
Always for you
