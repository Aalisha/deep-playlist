(Valure)
Somebody put the juke jonit on, listen to the words of the song, let me prove what i say is true, that i'm realy really feelin you

(verse #1:)

(Eddie)
hey, hey, hey shorty why u here standing alone? do you need a little company? can i help u find your way home

(Gabrielle)
do you wanna talk to me? i don't need no lines boy. what you got to say to me i'm sure i heard of many times before

(Joshua)
you got that sparkle in your eyes that a guy just can't miss, or your cinnamon tone, girl, i can't resist

(Gabrielle)
i hear you, baby, listen to this: you got to win all my affection, if you want to sample my kiss

(chorus:)

(Joshua)
Somebody put the juke jonit on, listen to the words of the song, let me prove what i say is true, that i'm realy really feelin you

(Gabrielle)
i'm sure you do, want to get to know me better

(Joshua)
i want to hold you all night long

(Gabrielle)
you can play whatever

(Ron)
