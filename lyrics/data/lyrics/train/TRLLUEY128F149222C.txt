If I could mail my heart
Right to you, I would
Id pack it up, seal it tight
And Id send it over night

Every time I hear your voice
And I look into your eyes
Sends a burning sweet sensation
Oh, inside of me

The look in your eyes
Has found me
I am sending

Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
...
