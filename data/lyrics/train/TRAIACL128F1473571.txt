So I believe you, with eyes open wide it seems impossible not to
When I received you a child had died, but a better man was begotten

And help me to see continually this prodigal grace abounding me,
And help me to listen, if I could just listen hard enough

And take me away, to heaven above
Take me to what is in my heart
I'll only behold it, I'd never attain this on my own
And while we're away in heaven above
Promise I'll never be defiled
I cannot wait to find out what true beauty is

Will they believe me, the man that I am
Wretched filthy and rotten
Your words relieve me, when I'm in this world
...
