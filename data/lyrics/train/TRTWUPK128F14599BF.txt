Saturday mornin', alone and barely feelin',
Sitting at home after rockin' and a-reelin',
All night in a cat fight with the only one who can make me cry,
Open the blind as the world is in rotation,
Shaking my mind like an Etch-A-Sketch erasin',
Sunshine, you were bad,
I'm still mad, but I can't remember why.

I believe you know me well,
I react like you're ringing a bell,
Are you sorry that you treat me unkind,
Never you mind.

Rolling along to the song that aggravates us,
Beckoned down by the mirage of an oasis,
Hurry, I'm getting blurry,
And it's no longer clear in my mind.
