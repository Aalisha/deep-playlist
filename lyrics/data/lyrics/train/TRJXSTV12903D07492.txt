Dragonfly in the pouring rain
Cast a shadow on halcyon days
Chasing rainbows, running the storm
Unaware that your wings would be torn

Sometimes I think I'm going nowhere at all
Stuck in the shelter with my back to the wall
Then I remember how it felt to come down
So I'm taking my time and I'm not going out

Until it's safe to fly
I could be waiting 'til the summer sky
But I'm standing by
Until I'm cleared to go
I won't be shaken by the undertow
I'm under your wing this time
And I know there's a storm outside
...
