Pain from pearls, hey little girl
How much have you grown
Pain from pearls, hey little girl
Flower for the ones you've known

Are you on fire from the years?
And what would you give for your kid fears?

Secret staircase, running high
You had a hiding place
Secret staircase, running low
But they all know, now you're inside

Are you on fire from the years?
And what would you give for your kid fears?
Kid fears

Skipping stones, we know the price now
And any sin will do
How much further, if you can spin
How much further, if you are smooth

Are you on fire [(are you on fire)]
