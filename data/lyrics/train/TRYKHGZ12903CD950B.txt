Dennis
come back with
My apple pie!
Don't blame the youth
Don't blame the youth
Don't take us for fools
Don't blame the youth.
You know that it's true
Don't blame the youth
So
don't blame the youth
Don't blame the youth.
The youth of today has got lots to say
it's our life
it's our future
Because we're living today
so don't blame the youth - what do you say?
My mother went to town to buy a little bike
And when she see the price she nearly loose her sight.
Ca dis a judgement time slang bong
