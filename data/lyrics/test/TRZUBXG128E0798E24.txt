God aint in my kitchen, and god aint in my room
God aint anywhere iv'e been,
I'll tell yea, i think we're through

Aint over here, aint over there
Where... my gonna find that man

He can be found, he can be found
He might be over there
He might be underground

God aint in my kitchen, and god aint in my room
God aint anywhere iv'e been
I'll tell yea, i think we're through

I looked over here
I looked over there
...
