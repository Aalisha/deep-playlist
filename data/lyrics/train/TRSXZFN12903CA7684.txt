Now my brother, he said to me
(Oh yeah) (mmm)
Look my brother, look what you see is going on
How many youths have been killed, in tribal war
Killed by babylon, ignorant, in a selfish war
Some youths is going to the west, oh yeah
Some youths is going to the north
Some youths is going to the south (oh jah)
Some youths is going to the far east (mm)
Now my brothers and sisters, you better listen to me
Stop the world foolish fighting, its much more that we are lasting
We've gotta fight for our rights
We've gotta see the light
