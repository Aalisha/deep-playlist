Be careful of that mind of yours
And the paths down which it lead you
Well you-u
Don't have to follow
You-u, don't

Keep an eye on the killer
Borrowed from a friend
Cause if he had its ways
Who know where all of this might end

Are you out of
Out of dreams
Are you out of
Out of dreams
Out of dreams
Out of dreams
