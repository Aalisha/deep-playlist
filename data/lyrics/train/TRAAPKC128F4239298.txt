Fine day for fishin! Fine day for wishin!
All that I miss is my fair weather friend
Feelin' like foolin' around. Somewheres I never be found
Wastin' my time. Would it be a crime if I climb
Back in the bottle again.

Where a friend meets a friend
Where the bowed may unbend
Where the fast is forgiven We get what we give in
And livin' is easy again.

High time for drinkin' High time for thinkin'
Down where the cotton would melt in my mouth
...
