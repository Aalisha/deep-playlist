your the ruler of your destiny...

i need to talk to you about a thing or two
its not right that your feeling blue
never ever let them get to you
you know i've been right there where you are now
its alright ill show you how
you can be you can be what you want to be
your the ruler of your destiny...

(chorus)
whatever comes your way no matter what they say
always let your soul shine (let your soul shine)
no matter what they do you know its up to you
