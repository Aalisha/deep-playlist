I hear the sirens start to sound
I see the mighty kings bow down
The end my friend is here,
The enemies arrive
To kill those who've survived
We must fight and show no fear,
We have come upon the hour
Evil reign will show it's power
Like a bolt!
It will fall from the sky
Dark forces take control
And try to rob you of your soul
The strong and pure will die!

The sun will fade to black
And the skies above will crack
And blood will spue from it's wound
Night and day will be the same
Underneath the evil reign
...
