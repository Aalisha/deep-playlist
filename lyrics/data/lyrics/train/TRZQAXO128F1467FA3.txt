I'm alone and I'm tired
I'm afraid and I'm tired
I'm away trying not to see
What the day brings all I need
I'll stay right here

Got a silent radar
And it's watching you

I'm the same yeah I'm alright
Still alone no one's been by
I'm ashamed trying not to be
In my mind I'll always need
You right here
...
