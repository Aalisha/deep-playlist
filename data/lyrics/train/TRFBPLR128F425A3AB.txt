They can take all my money
That won't bring me pain
The power of love inside me
Beats all material things

They can have all me possessions
And scandalize my name
I can handle all the pressure
If your love only stays the same

I don't wanna lose your love
'Cause you mean the world to me
I don't wanna lose your love
And all that we've come to be

As we lay here together
And I'm so into you
...
