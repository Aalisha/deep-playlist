You think you know me so well
You put me down, it builds you up
You're kicking me around
You just can't get enough

And all your friends surround you
Oh, without them by your side
You start to show your weakness
It's something you can't hide

Yeah yeah

Well stop and erase
Cause I'm gonna wipe
That smile off your know-it-all face
Whaoh
Laugh while you can
Yeah live it up, but
Read my lips, the joke is on you
I've figured it out
You're all about
Walking tall on the people you knock down
So stop and erase
Cause I'm gonna wipe
That smile off your know-it-all face

Whaoh
I'm waking up I'm feeling
What I was scared to feel before
