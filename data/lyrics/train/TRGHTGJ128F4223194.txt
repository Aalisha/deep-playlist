A slap in the face,
And I can't erase,
These things that you say,
Don't make it all okay, it's not okay

When push comes to shove,
I'll put on the gloves,
Intentions are cruel,
I ain't nobody's fool you know

It hurts, my pride, step aside,
'Cause I don't need your...

Sympathy
Won't get the best of me!
Misery
That's what you're giving me!
