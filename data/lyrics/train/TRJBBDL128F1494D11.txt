{Interlude}
Akon (akon)
C'mon (c'mon)

{Verse 1}
This is the ultimate journey of your life
Where the weak die and the strong survive
Prepare to suffer 40 days and 40 nights

Ohohohohoh

{Verse 2}

Walking through the dirty streets of Jersey (Jersey)
A dollar to my name, searchin for that key
I'm tryin not to reincorinate my past
Retired from the game, took another path
