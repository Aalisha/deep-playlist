Mind
I want your mind to feed me with the knowledge
Of how to love you
When to love you
And where you want to be loved
Let your mind go
Enlighten me to your thoughts, dreams and fantasies

Body
Your body is an extension of desire and love
I want your body to make love
Express love
Re-create love exclusively to me

Soul
The soul is the breath of life
That comes from the flow of all things
Belonging to your soul is a sweet, sweet dream
Sweet, sweet dream

Mind, body and soul

Out of nowhere
You appear on the scene
I can see you
Like a cool summer breeze
I can feel you
Your eyes burning into me
I knew right away
