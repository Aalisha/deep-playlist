Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves in your skull T-shirt
You say "why did you do it with him today?"
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray

'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore

I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good

Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in a place, but I can't get joy
...
