All beauty all fade away, borrowed
All moonlight return today, borrowed
All sunrise all shooting stars, borrowed
All earth bound bare feet in clay
you know we're standing on

Borrowed borrowed heaven
Borrowed borrowed heaven

All heartache all rivers cried, borrowed
Don't stay out too late tonight, borrowed
...
