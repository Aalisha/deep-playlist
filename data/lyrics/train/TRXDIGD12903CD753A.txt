And now it's just gone after dark
And we move to the other part of it
Secret part of your restless heart
To glide past every city light
Like a satellite careering through the sky
This color, this summer night

It's your heart, it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
It's your heart, it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
Do you know, you give me
You give me this western feeling?
