St. Louis
Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp [unverified]
This house belongs to who

Not in my house
You might catch me on the road
But not in my house
It won't happen, oh no
(Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)

Not in my house
(Check me out)
You might catch me on the road
But not in my house
It won't happen oh no
(Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)

Check it, check it
Now we've come along way, ay
(Hear me out)
And I know you wanna go some more, oh
The only thing keepin' you from
Completin' your mission derrty is makin' it past my door
...
