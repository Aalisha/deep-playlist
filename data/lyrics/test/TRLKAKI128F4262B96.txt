Sad Theresa
On your front porch swing
The lights are twinkling bright
Nobody's home
Umm, sweet country thing
With your dress hiked up to your knees
Waiting on a call
Faith, hope and charity

Oh Theresa, can I come over tonight?
Can I come over, come over?
Would your mother say its alright?
Oh Theresa, can I come over tonight?

Ballerina
On your bedroom door
Well I know that you've got dreams
