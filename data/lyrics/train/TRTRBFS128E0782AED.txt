Yes I think It's safe to say
I feel good about the place
That I've made in the world today
I get all sticky inside when I close my eyes and I open up wide

I see pictures in the clouds
So obscene I gotta laugh out loud
I look back to find my way
Reminisce nice about the good old days

Yeah when I saw my brother above me
I remember the words he said
When you dream you hit bottom chances are good
You're gonna wake up dead
I'll be up on top when the sky falls down
And it all goes wrong again
Yeah...
I will be sittin on top when it all goes wrong again
Yeah...
I will be sittin on top when it all goes wrong
