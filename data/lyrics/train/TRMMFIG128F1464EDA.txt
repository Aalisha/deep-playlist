I don't wanna look
Like some kind of fool
I don't wanna break
My heart over you

I'm building a wall
Everyday it's getting higher
This time I won't end up
Another victim of love

You say that I could show some emotion
That I've been keeping secrets from you
But I can see through all your sweet talk
And all of your affection untrue

I'm gonna find you out
If I scream and I shout
You won't break down my protection

I don't wanna look
Like some kind of fool
I don't wanna break
My heart over you

I'm building a wall
