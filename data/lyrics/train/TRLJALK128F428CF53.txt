(Kix Brooks/Don Cook)

Seems like every time I call you
I'm standing in the pouring rain
I had another falling out with love
I'm back out on the streets again

But I guess I better pass this time
But you could do an old friend a favor
While I'm still on the line

I know you said it's over
But this old heart's still burning with desire
