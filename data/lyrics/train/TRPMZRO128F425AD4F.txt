I'm living in danger
I'm fooling with my life
I'm living in danger
Deep feeling in my heart

Turn me on turn me on turn me on turn me on
Take all of me
I mean sexually
Turn me on turn me on turn me on turn me on
Take all of me
I'm in ecstasy

I'm living in danger
I'm stepping over line
And stranger
There is no reason why
