Time after time, find I question my life
How I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise, will I fall, stand tall?
Continue asking, but I'm knowing, only God know

Time after time, find I question my life
Where I went wrong, will it ever be right?
Will I rise, will I fall, stand tall?
Continue asking, but I'm knowing, only God know

Growing up in the hood as a hard knock
I never knew nothing too much about young
My only concern was making my money
And running these streets as a thug
Instead of the birds and bees, I always talk to murderers and the G's
That coldness inside me, but I ain't trying to hurt nobody
Temptation is keeping me steadily going under
And I wonder, if I could make it through the thunder
