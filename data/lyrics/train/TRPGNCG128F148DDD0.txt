You ain't true to yourself
It's there in your eyes every time you deny that you could need a little help
You think I'm a fool you pretend all is cool and you do it all so well
See I don't know you at all (ooh)

You ain't true to yourself (No, no)
It's like you say you don't smoke think I don't hear you joke and it's damaging your health
You do what you want but you don't give it all coz your saving it for someone else (Mmmm)
I see you setting for a fall... (Mmm, for a fall)

Well it's your life
Do what you like
Oh Lord knows I couldnt do any better
(This is more than a warning, let the truth do the talking)
