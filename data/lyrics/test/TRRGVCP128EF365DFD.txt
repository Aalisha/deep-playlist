Dance, boogie wonderland
Dance, boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts
Of men who need more than they get

Daylight deals a bad hand
To a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says

"Baby, uh uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers, though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt
Dance, boogie wonderland

Dance, boogie wonderland
Sound fly through the night
