I can't think of one reason
I like the things I do
I'll take a ride on a good feelin'
Knowing it'll see me through
Like a drive down a dusty highway
After the sun's gone down
Chasin' shadows into the new day
Leavin' this lonely town
I'm gonna rock, ride, nothin' to hide
Let the headlights guide me
I'm gonna roll right into the night
Take the Midnight Highway
Midnight Highway
