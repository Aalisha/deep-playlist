Oh this death
Moment by moment
Darker and darker
Down and down

I FEEL YOUR COLD BREATH
I FEEL YOUR COLD BREATH

Oh this death
Moment by moment
Darker and darker
Down and down

I FEEL YOUR COLD BREATH
I FEEL YOUR COLD BREATH

We've been going back and forth for a long time
We often did the right thing at the wrong time
We have hurt the ones that we love the most
Till I wonder did we ever get that close

Oh this death Moment by moment
Darker and darker Down and down

I FEEL YOUR COLD BREATH
I FEEL YOUR COLD BREATH

I've been getting over you since the day we met
It might have been as simple as the way we met
