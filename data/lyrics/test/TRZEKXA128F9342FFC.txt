[Verse One]
Highside to the fullest, creepin up out tha house wit my mug on me
Lexus kinda clean crease in my jeans
Ready ta hit dis, want everybody to get wit dis
It's goin down tonight, up in the town tonight
Rollin vegas on omega wit tha chronic sin
Rolex on my wrist because I produce hits
Got them groupies havin fits when I'm ridin past
Tank full of gas, pocket full of cash
Sideshow's goin down tonight, made a right on 73rd
to purchase some act right, bounce back in
Crack that hen, I'm worldwide like a fifth of gin
Plus I'm in it to win, (realize), check it I'm checkin yo' chin
Ak south seven seven
My cousin they keep it up on the block East legend
There ain't no need to be steppin
We flow nine'n, got em all rewind'n, now they all realize'n
We ridin high side

[Chorus:]

Keep it, on the real (high sided)
If you're real with me, I'll be real with you yeah
(3X Krazy's got yo mind realizin)

[Verse Two]
It be astoundin, formatix around it, it paint drank down it
