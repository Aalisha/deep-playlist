Careful when you open
It's easy to be broken
In the strangest fashion
You start a chain reaction
You look my way
Something's pounding away
And I wonder if I ever felt this before

All this time, Oblivious
To what You make so obvious
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before

You are reaching for something that is beating
I can't believe I never noticed my heart before
Over and again, they say I have lost it
I can't believe I've never noticed my heart before

At least until I noticed You and Your ways
