I pretend to walk
I pretend to breathe
I know you understand
You always did

You prefer to talk
(And) I pretend to listen
Three and counting
I'm still waiting

I just want to fly
The morning sun is shattered
The smile is gone
Frozen liquid carving stone

It's time to close our eyes
As we pretend to care
I keep still
Accrete the silence you don't fill

I'm so glad that you can't read my mind
...
