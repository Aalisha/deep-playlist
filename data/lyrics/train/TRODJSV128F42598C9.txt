In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games
Hang on to your love

Take time if you're down on luck
It's so easy to walk out on love
Take your time if the going gets tough
It's so precious

So if you want it to get stronger
You'd better not let go
You gotta hold on longer
If you want your love to grow

Gotta stick together
Hand in glove
Hold tight, don't fight
Hang on to your love

In heaven's name why are you walking away
Hang on to your love
In heaven's name why do you play these games
Hang on to your love

Be brave when the journey is rough
It's not easy when you're in love
Don't be ashamed when the going gets tough
It's not easy don't give up
