Well I am hoping that today
I'll learn how to live my life, 
But I can't, can't, 
Can't see past this crowd, 
But I know that I can feel it, 
Yeah I can feel it

I'm always looking for an answer
Someone to tell me who I am.
I'm always looking to the mirror
There's no one there so I'll pretend.

I don't want to be like everyone else
They by the same rules,
