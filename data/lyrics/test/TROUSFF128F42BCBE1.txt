Mo-mo-mo-money rules the world
it´s still the same old thing
Just if you got some in
Your pocket, you´re fine really
So stack, the cash my friend,
And fly high
But don´t you ever take
A slice of my pie!
Money is the kind of stuff that makes
Everybody bitch on it
Bitch and beat is try to get rich on it
Some people say is the root
Of all evil today
But if you ask for some help
They'll give none away

(Money…Money…Money) (Twice)

Money can buy you diamonds
Money can buy more rings and friends
