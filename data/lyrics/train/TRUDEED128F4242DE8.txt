I'm not talking 'bout locking down forever baby,
that'd be too demanding
I'm just talking 'bout two lonely people,
who might reach a little understanding
I'm not talking 'bout knocking out heaven,
with whether we're wrong or we're right
I'm not talking 'bout hooking up or hanging out,
I'm Just Talking About Tonight
You were sittin' on your bar stool,
talking to some fool who didn't have a clue
I guess he couldn't see you were looking right at me,
cuz I was looking at you too
