Allfathers ancestors 
I think of you in Odin's hall 
Allfathers ancestors 
I think of how you crossed the seas 

Dirty bearded men who slept in the snow 
Can you feel the beauty of Iceland still? 
Eagles and icebergs 
The white nights of the North 

I will fight for your legend 
Never forgotten 
Combat for your honour 
Protect my kin
