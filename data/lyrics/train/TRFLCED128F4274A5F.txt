In the heart of the city, I? m awake now
And the buzz open to the night
You? re the Libertine, you? re Philistine
When I first saw you I knew I was done

With you I feel again, with you I arise
Feeling invincible, this moment? s mine

Strangest landscapes, see the sky flip inside out
Turning nightmares into dreams that bring you? round
There? s danger in the street, that? s the beauty in the beast
There? s danger in the street, that? s the beauty in the beast
