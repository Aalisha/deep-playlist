Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
This is a Jazze-phizzle produc-shizzle
Jazze Pha, Jazze Pha
Ho boy! Black, Black, give it to 'em, daddy

Got somethin' that you need to know
I think I wanna make you my girlfriend
Way too fly, can't let you go
I think I wanna make you my girlfriend
Girl, you the flyest, let me inside it
Don't deny it, come on and ride it, baby, just try it
'Cause I think I wanna make you my girlfriend

I guess what they say, opposites attract
You the first make me, wanna stop my pimp back
My game tight, your frame right
We could do it, 5 or 6 times in the same night
Now I got keys for you, I believes in you
Ma, don't you know I bleeds for you?
Sheeeit, real tall, you was meant for me
No pretendin' to be, somethin' that you not

No frontin', Ma, keep it real sexy
Even though I'm thugged out like Joe Pesci
Test me, I'm a all natural born winner
We could eat Filet Mignon or shrimps for dinner
Then enter my palace, rubbin' skin with baby oil
'Till both of my hands get calloused
Huh, a fly girl in my world
No need to ask, you my girl
Come on

Got somethin' that you need to know
I think I wanna make you my girlfriend
Way too fly, can't let you go
I think I wanna make you my girlfriend
Girl, you the flyest, let me inside it
