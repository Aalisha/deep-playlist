Is the snare primed? Is the click timed?
50p in the meter, so get it wind
if you is a red eye then you best walk with shade
if you is a high top scissors overcomb to fade
we don't do hip hop as we're not hip hoppers
don't diddle enough for jazz so we can't be jazz boppers
but the funk is the chunk of the music that we're making
dig a little deeper and a rootical stand we're taking
destination hazy aint cause we're lazy
