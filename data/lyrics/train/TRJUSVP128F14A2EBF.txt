I saw her stand’n there
The heat of passion fills the air
Drawn into her flame - hot
Can’t break away from her spell

Wanted by many, but few realize
That her every move is a crime
Ooh she’s so dangerous
She’s gonna take me alive

She’s Armed And Dangerous
She hides behind innocent eyes
She’s Armed And Dangerous
Guilty of sensuous crimes
Ooh she’s so dangerous dangerous
She prowls thru my heart like a thief
...
