It's another one of them old phunky Cypress Hill things, you know what I'm
sayin'? And it goes like this

Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah
Of the funky buddha
Eluder
Of your fucked-up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws stridin'
While suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when you see me drivin'
By
Hanging out the window
With my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco
I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid from my vocals

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand

I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
