Warnings around me
Coming on strong
Hear the desire
That young dudes are fools

But systems will break down
The way they all do
A general burden
When ever we're through

Powers are freezing
The way that they are
They're fornicating
With each others minds

Typical outcome in whatever we do
We stand on our own rebellion the groove

Generation Clash
