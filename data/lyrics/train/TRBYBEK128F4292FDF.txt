Shopping for kicks, got the weekend to get through
She's keeping the rain off her Saturday hairdo
She stops for a coffee, she smiles at the waiter
He winks at his friends and they laugh at her later

He's cleaning the car on his pebble dash driveway
New chamois leather, he got for his birthday
He reads Harold Robbins, he flirts with his neighbor
Ignores her at breakfast, he's reading the paper

He dreams of a roller, she dreams of a fast getaway

He's not a prince, he's not a king
She's not a work of art or anything
It makes no sense another year
 (No sense, another year)
What kind of A to Z would get you here?
