mamma can you hear me
mamma can you hear me
I'm going to be a farmer
blowing the fields in the morning sun
I'll have a million horses
take me a ride when the work is done
I'm going to have a sweet life
sweetest life you ever seen
and when the day is over
going to go to sleep in the field of green

mamma can you hear me
mamma can you hear me
...
