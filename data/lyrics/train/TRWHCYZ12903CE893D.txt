["The audience was large and brilliant. Upon my weary heart was showered smiles, plaudits, and flowers, but beyond them, I saw thorns and troubles innumerable."]

It was a pretty good GPA
We got a couple of good grades
And it sounded like a pretty good seven inch

And winter didn't seem so cold
I had a smile for everyone I know
I was starting to get comfortable in the place that I'm in

And it used to not mean anything
It used to not mean anything
It used to not mean anything
But it really means nothing now

Nothing means anything anymore
