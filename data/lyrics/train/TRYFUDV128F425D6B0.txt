Close to me now, drives me crazy, I bet she lives above herself
Talk to me now; drive me crazy, I bet she hides behind herself

Wake up (wake up) A-sheâ€™s a story of the life every night
Wake up (ha ha) We are lovers of the world tonight
Choke it down and tell you a lie, we are on fire

Yeah, Ku Ku Kurama, steal from each other (Me I know nothing)
Ku Ku Iraya, stick to each other (Me I know nothing) ooh ooh ooooh

Close to me now, drives me crazy, I bet she lives above herself
