I always knew that this day would come 
When I would see you again, the pain would reappear. 
When I turned that corner and saw that you were standing there, 
I held back my tears. 
Its funny to be here by myself wishing you were here 
Next to me because all I did when you were here 
Was wish you would leave me alone.
