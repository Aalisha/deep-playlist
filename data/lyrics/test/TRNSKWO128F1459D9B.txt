I've tried some straight conversation
Even whispered the words in your ear
I've talked 'til I'm blue in the face and
Thought I made myself perfectly clear

Now I'm on the edge of leavin'
And you're asking how can that be?
I've wasted too much breath explainin'
Oh, and when did you ever listen to me?

I could stand at the mouth of a canyon
Yell the truth straight into the wind
I can't take being taken for granted
