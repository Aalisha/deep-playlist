Well, are you ready for me? Yeah
Before I start, I just wanna get a few things off my chest
Well, yes, take ya' time brotha

Now being in the business that I am in looks like everything I do
Everywhere I go, well, and everything I see
Seems to be through some kind of magnifying glass
Yeah, can I talk about it? Talk on

While you're looking out I suggest you take a good look, yeah
And I hope you find just what it is you're looking for, looking for, amen
Just like that song says, well, ain't nobody's business what I do?
Now can I move on? Move on, move on, move on brotha Kelly

I remember when I was trying to be somebody, take your time
