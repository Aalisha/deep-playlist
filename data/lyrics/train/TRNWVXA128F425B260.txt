I'm going on a bender this weekend
I'm gonna get real drunk
I'm not going to be able to speak
And I'll pass out on my floor,
I won't be able to answer the door. [repeat]

She said, "you only like me because I take you away from her." Well that's alright.
She said, "you only like me because I take you away from her." Well that's alright.
She said, "you only like me because I take you away from her."

And with his hands in the air
The only one in the crowd.
Gotta got moving, got moving when he heard the sound.
When the music fits, it fits and just feels right.
No need worry, worry never when you're in the night.
His hands in the air,
The only one in the crowd.
Gotta got moving, got moving when he heard the sound
When the music fits, it fits and jus-ahh.
