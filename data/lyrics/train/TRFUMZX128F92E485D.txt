Changes - I know you think you've got me where you want me

Tied up in the chains you know I can't shake free.
Caught up in the trap you call affection.
Now I've seen it all just take your hands off me - changes
changes.
Someday somehow there's gonna be some changes

You can scream and shout but you don't have the right to tell me.
Here and now there's gonna be you're gonna see some changes
