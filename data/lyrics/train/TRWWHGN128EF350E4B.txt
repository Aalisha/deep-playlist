(just one sec)
(lavalamps are good)
Traveled on the f train down
the people press and crowd
they start to fade like footprints worn away
only stop and still i'm waiting
a thousand faces look the same everyone
a thousand different names
they come on two by two
people fade as people do
came here of my own volition
could be my decision
...
