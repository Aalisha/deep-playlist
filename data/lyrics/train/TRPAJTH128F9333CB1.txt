[Intro]
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Boom! Oh Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Fuck me, Fuck me, Fuck me, Fuck me

[Chorus]
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your man
Bitch! I fucked your man
Boom! I fucked your boyfriend
And I'd do it again

[Verse 1]
When I first saw your man we was really fine
And you was getting a little irritated that I was looking
Like you knew what was on my mind (fuck you)
You're not secure
It's written all over your face
You thought it wouldn't last (not tomorrow)
Top kitty in place
You see me as an obstacle
Staying away much as possible
It's mandatory that I command the attention of your man eye
Not to mention he can't help it because I'm fly
The plan is
I stroll by
Big bubble Chanel shades with diamond tips
Get up close and personal
Seduce with my lips
