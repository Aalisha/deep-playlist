Love she's gone 
Maybe too late 
It was a problem for me. yeah 
It was a problem for you 

Now she's gone 
I think that's too late 
It was a problem for me. yeah 
It was a problem for me 

You may keep memories in your head 
you may throw them too the well 
and still wishing you Romeo
Who's promised to be there and never come
I don't think that's we amend
for each other and everything 
life's good and I don't care 
what's your way to the end
