"grand puba" "lord jamar" "sadat x" "alamo"
[puba] "raised in the ghetto singin songs called survival"
[jamar] "i'm only bringin you the real"
"grand puba" "lord jamar" "sadat x" "alamo"
[puba] "raised in the ghetto singin songs called survival"
[sadat] "have a stout if you know what i'm talkin about"
Verse one: lord jamar
Three sixty degrees i stand in the square, right over left
Preparin to fight to the death, you could never stifle this
Not even the triflest, nigga on earth, could ever fuck
With what i spit in a verse, we always hit where it hurts
Underground so we dig in the dirt
Always gotta put a nigga to work, is how it seems
It's kinda hard to hear the silent screams
Through the violent things, turn a deaf ear
Your body might get left there - you better step to the rear
We put it down with premier, rock mad army gear
You ain't heard us all together in, several years
It's like a federal crime, you had to settle for rhymes
That lacked substance, we got that in abundance
Pro-black and you know that
We stay fat like joe crack, lord jamar
Come too far, to ever try and go back
"grand puba" "lord jamar" "sadat x" "alamo"
[puba] "raised in the ghetto singin songs called survival"
