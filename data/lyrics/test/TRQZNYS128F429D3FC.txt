Hey baby
I'm living for you

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, loving you

Day will make the way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a song, soft and long

Well, you'd like to think
We're alone with a love unlike no other
Sad to see, a new horizon
Slowly coming into view

I wanna be living
For the love of you
All that I'm giving
Is for the love of you

Lovely as a ray of sun
That touches me
When the morning comes
Feels good to me, my lovin' me
Yeah yeah yeah
