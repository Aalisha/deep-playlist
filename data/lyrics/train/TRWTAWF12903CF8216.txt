Your whole world has been torn apart from the start.
Your whole world, your whole world...

You're in my heart and in my head.
(...in my head)
A plethora of things that need to be said.
(...needs to be said)
Does it make it alright to wish that you're dead?
(...wish that you're dead)
I feel it's unsaid. Feelings unsaid.
(...feelings unsaid)

No one would care, no one would risk a thing for you.
This is swear, my dear, I fear it's true.
