Spinning your umbrella over your head
You should be in bed but you're here instead
Walking with me towards a midnight swim
I can give you, baby, what you can't get from him

Songbird's singing in an old dead tree
The way you drive honey scares the hell out of me
A hundred miles an hour on a brand new road
Look at me again, you'll make my heart explode

Hey, hey, little fighter girl
It's you and me up against this whole wide world
Sleeping together in the lion's den
Got your earrings in my pocket till I see you again

Clouds roll by, laying up on the hill
Everything is still, do you think we will?
If we do, there'll be no turning back
