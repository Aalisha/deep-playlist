You belong to me
Can't you see you're part of me
We are one
You are mine
Love until the end of time
Did you lie when you said
That you'll never look again
That our love will last forever
And forever ... forever
Every single part of you is mine
Belong to me
Every single move you make
Every single breath you take
Last night I went insane
When I heard you call her name
