The Friday sun bears down again
As we drive with our friends
And on these longest days we spend
All our time trying to pretend
That our stories could be true
Why tend to be cool?
The setting sun says the day is through
If only we knew
And we all sit round here in our home town
Listen to the waves as they all crash down
And watch the fire as it slowly burns away
Glowing embers fly across the sky

You're here by my side, in the summer, our last summer
