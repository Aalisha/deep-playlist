"Christian Or Canadian"

It couldn't be worse. From chorus to verse.
It sounds like Korn but a little bit worse.
Is it Christian or Canadian? Guess!
On 90.7 it's bad 311.
Evidently it's a hit. But it stinks to high heaven.
Is it Christian or Canadian? Guess!

Play the game that isn't fun, can't be ignored,
and can't be won. Someone get me a gun.
