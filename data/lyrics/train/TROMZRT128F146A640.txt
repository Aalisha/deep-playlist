Good love will make you cry
Good love will last until you die

When I woke up this morning
Autumn leaves just pass me by
Saw this couple just crying
And in my mind I wonder why
I could tell it was special
'Cause something felt so true yeah
That's the thing about true love
That is the way I wanna be happy with you

Good love will make you cry
Good love will last until you die
