Everybody, soul and body cold
All this sickness, you lost control
You can't get it you just don't get it, no
You can't get it you got zero

Look within me, am I evil though
Memories bring tears of years old
You can't get it you just don't get it, no
You can't get it you got zero

Life, you take it, lies, you fake it
Suffer, within me, torn, you break it
Life, control it, lies, withhold it
Suffer, you're skinny, torn, you're wasted

Kids with defects we're all rejects, so
Don't forget it, cold inside
...
