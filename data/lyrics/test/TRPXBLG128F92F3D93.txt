I said my momma don't understand me
Daddy never really cared
Fuck the rest
I've failed their test
I guess life just ain't fair
A preacher man done told me, said your ways you better change
But forgive me man, I got a mic in my hand
And it's my time to rock the stage
Misunderstood

One in a million, a million in one
A stoner reeking havoc, but I don't carry a gun
Only a microphone so I can rock the stage
Don't got a beeper But I gots to some page up some dope ass lyrics
From my imagination
Smoked out the officer on my probation
Bustin' caps in the balls of this generation

My bro Mad Dog, the south bay psycho, got the bomb sugar bud
Goin' everlasting cycle, the dank of the dankest don't get no sweeter
My boy B-Dub ain't a motherfuckin' tweaker
He's a ganja man, that's the way it goes
2 turntables always rock at shows
Hey Bobby B, how does your bud grow?
Shhh... That's on the down low
