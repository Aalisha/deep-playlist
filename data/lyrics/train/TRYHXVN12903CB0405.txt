If there wasn't so much tension 
you could've confided yourself in me
If there wasn't so much tension 
you could've confided yourself in me

The only reason I come back here
The reason I come back here because you were lonely

Another nightmare of mine
I'll bring flowers for you next time
You didn't have to die if you were lonely
...
