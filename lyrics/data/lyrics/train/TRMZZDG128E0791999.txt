It's so hard not to blame you
it's hard not to put all the blame on you
'cause you knew from the start
there was one little part you would not let through
I'm sure there were even moments when you thought
You might someday finish what you'd begun -
but that could've been anyone

could've been anyone
I lost my place in the sun
well, never mind
it could've been anyone.

So we all make mistakes
it just figures you'd make me the biggest one
...
