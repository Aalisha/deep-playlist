I've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl till our mouths run dry
Time will crawl till our feet grow small
Time will crawl till our tails fall off
Time will crawl till the 21st century lose
