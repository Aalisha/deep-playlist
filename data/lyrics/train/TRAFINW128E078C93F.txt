Yesterday, I had it all worked out to a T
But now something's wrong between you and me
I was wrong, so wrong
to think that I would stay
Seasons come and seasons go
And today is another day

I wanna say now's the time
to go our separate ways
I don't know I might be wrong
Could we find the strength to say
that our love, our love's seen some better days
And who's to say if I had the chance
well, I'd make the choice to stay yeah
