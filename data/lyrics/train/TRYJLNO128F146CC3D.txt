Hey, hey, hey
What ya got to say?
Hey, hey, hey

Hollywood
Hollywood swinging
Hollywood

And I saw the Kool in the gang show
I always wanted to fit a band, yes I did
To sing my songs, sing my songs
And become a bad piano playing man
So here I am, here I am in this Hollywood city
The city of the stars, movies, women and cars
Well I guess, I guess I have to stay

Hey, hey, hey
