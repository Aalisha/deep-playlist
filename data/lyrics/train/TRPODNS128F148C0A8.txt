Don't let it get you down
When you're not on top
Where else numbers two
Let gets up and never stops, no
Ain't double same, loving me bring me game
Don't let it get you down, oh no

Don't let it get you down
When the cards are wrong
Pick up and let them walked away
Before you loose your heart
(Don't regret, girl)
Ain't double same, loving me bring me game
Don't let it get you down
(Oh, no)
Oh, no

Don't get mean
