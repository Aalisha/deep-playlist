I don't need directions
I can see the course
You don't need to whisper baby
I've heard it all before
Hate and lemon under your nails
I don't need protection
I don't need to show your telling tail

I don't need your prohibition
I don't need to score
You can keep your liquor 
Baby that's for sure
Whine and silver under your feet
I don't know what moves you
...
