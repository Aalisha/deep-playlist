So tell me a story
about something pretty
A gaurdian angel
up in the sky
Make me believe
in the hill for a climber
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies

I'm hangin on
mouth hangin open
World spinning faster
round and around
Hey whats the matter
Look unexpected
You took a right turn. on the wrong side of town

You with the light on
lookin so hopeful
Your just pretending
