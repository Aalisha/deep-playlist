theres something bout that boy thats strange to see
he doesn't look like you he doesn't look like me
i've been meaning to tell ya please don't go wild
theres a possibility that he's not your child
coz

i made love to your father love to your brother
once or twice i slept with your mother
there has to be a father it could be you
or half of the creatures down the local zoo

you wear tartan pyjamas an socks in bed
couldn't be more for him if you were dead
...
