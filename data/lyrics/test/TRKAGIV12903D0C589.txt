She took my hand and watched me sleeping. 
Kissed me on the first night we met.
And all around us the morning came and she said don't you forget
And when you're going
Please be sure to call my way.

You can be sure I got no love to give you. 
Ain't got no money but no regrets. 
And I got myself babe, it's too hard to forget.
