Getting over you
Was the hardest thing I ever had to do,
I'd cry myself to sleep at night,
Although I smiled, it's what I used to do
To make it easier.
I wonder where you are and who you're with,
And if you love them too,
Sometimes I wish I knew.
I know deep down the truth would break your heart,
I still miss you.

Sometimes I do
Sometimes I do
