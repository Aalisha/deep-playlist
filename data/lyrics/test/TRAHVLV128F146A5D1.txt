Yo, who the fuck is this?
It's like 3: 30
Yo, get the phone, bitch
You get the phone

Get the phone
You get the phone
Get the God-damn phone
Alright, damn nigga
Who the fuck is this?

It's my nigga Deezo, what the fuck is the deal?
Huh, huh, know me, keepin' it real
Six-double-o, kid, chrome on the wheels
I got the same problem, nigga, know how you feel

On some real shit, Sauce, I got the kite from Neil
Word on the street, hope you're still holdin' your steel
Niggas talkin' 'bout who cats they gon' bill
Just to gain they cut, that's when your name came up

Oh, did it? You know some more nigga, spit it
Cats hate your ass 'cause of your riches and digits
You probably know this nigga named Bobby
Sister named Ronnie with the two-tone body

Cat fueled with Bacardi, throw parties every Friday
Fake lady lover, fucked his baby mother
Hit it from the back, now I'm a tough act to follow
Made her give my man head too and swallow

That's neither here nor there, he think somethin' is sweet
Fuck yeah, we can dump when we meet
Win, lose or draw, after that I'm dumpin' my heat
Lay him down flat while my music pump in the street

He got four with him, some niggas from Baltimore with him
I'ma sure hit 'em if he come through that door with him
Split your bladder, we spray, muthafucka
It don't matter, BK, muthafucka

Pay attention to the scheme
