Wake up early wipe the sleep from my eyes
Glance across the room its 8: 45
Can't forget to hang the wshing out to dry
Pick out my clothes so I can hit 'em with my style
Wash up my face and brighten up my smile
Fix up my hair and add some sheen so I can shine
Look at my watch it's saying 10: 45
Grab me some breakfast, time to jump in my ride

My family is calling
I've been on the move since morning
Trying to fit it all in
Wish I could add some more hours to the day

chorus:
Check my mum and make sure she's ok
All in one day
Cook and clean 'cos nothing seems to change
It's everyday
Get my nails done, take a trip to spain
Back the same day
Text my friends and drink some chilled Ros√©
