Come lie on a bed of nails and slumber
Rise up but the hands all pull you down
My sunshine is wind and rain and thunder
I sing but I can't make a song

So if you want to know where I've been hiding all these years
Follow the tears, follow the tears

Don't drink from the cup of human kindness
It's a strange brew and poison to the touch
