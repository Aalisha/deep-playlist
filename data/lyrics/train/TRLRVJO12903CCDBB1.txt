Were we still kissing when you knew that we were through?
Were we still holding hands when you began to see us from another point of view?
Tell me was I slipping before I even knew
Did I fall down and make my mind go black and blue?

Didn't I know, and couldn't I see
And why did I have to make those same mistakes
My sweet Marie

Did I hit the wall before I knew which way to go?
Couldn't I just understand when you said no no no no no no no no no no
Were you deceiving me with conscience white as snow
