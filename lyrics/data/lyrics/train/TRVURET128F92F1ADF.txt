Everywhere I go, I see nothing as positive
This is my life this is how I live
All I see is negativity
The entire world trying to enslave me
What do I do with such anger and rage?
I feel like an animal trapped inside a cage
That won't let me out, I can't liberate myself
From this horrible world, please let me out
