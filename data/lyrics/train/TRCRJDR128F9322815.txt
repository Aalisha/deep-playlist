The day without the shining sun
Is a day without your loving baby
One look, one look and well seem as one
That's how easy we communicate
A single match can make a fire begin
A single kiss and I'm warm within girl

Gotta hold on to this feeling
Gotta hold on to this feeling we got
Gotta hold on to this feeling
