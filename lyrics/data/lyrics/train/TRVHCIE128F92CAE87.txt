By townes van zandt
Living on the road my friend,
is gonna keep you free and clean
now you wear your skin like iron,
your breath as hard as kerosene.
you weren't your mama's only boy,
but her favorite one it seems
she began to cry when you said goodbye,
and sank into your dreams.

pancho was a bandit boy,
his horse was fast as polished steel
he wore his gun outside his pants
for all the honest world to feel.
