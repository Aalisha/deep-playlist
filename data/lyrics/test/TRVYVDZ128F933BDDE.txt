I am the one and only man who can lead you to the secret gates
I know the way to burn them down
With my return I will bring doom to them all

A Dreaming City ruled the world, arrogant men acting like gods
They played with life and death for ten thousand years
A court of ghosts in marble halls dance at the sound of death's call
In mind and spirit they're already dead

[pre-chorus]
And so I take my life in my hands, make my own decision
I will embrace my Fate
