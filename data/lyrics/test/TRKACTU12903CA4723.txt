we're hunting open secrets
we're searching high and low
intrepid we might be we'll never know
under a press of canvas
we're on the parting of the ways
we lost the trace

we're gathering life's roses
we're in a quandary
but on the sly we never can't be free
we face the stormy petrel
and beg for wings to fly away
forever away
...
