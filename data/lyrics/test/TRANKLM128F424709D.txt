You took a piece of my heart
I never thought that this could fall apart
You said you fell in love
And this was more than I had ever been afraid of
Another life
Another happy ending cuts like a knife
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine

You got me Deeper Than Deep and I'm constantly blinded
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls have divided
Why can't they forgive me these demons inside
Deeper Than Deep and I'm constantly blinded
...
