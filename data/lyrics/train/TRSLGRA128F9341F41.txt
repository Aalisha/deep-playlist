When you were my girl, there were times you'd look at me
And I knew exactly how it felt to be loved
When you were my girl, I don't know if I told you
But whenever I'd hold you, it scared me so much

You were all that I needed, you were all that I had
The one I could turn to when the world had gone mad
And I guess I just wanted
For you to know that

Not a day goes by, I don't think of you
(Do you ever think of me when you're alone)
Or I don't ask myself why
(Do you ever wonder how things could have gone)
If everything's so perfect now
(Do you ever think of me and start to cry)
Why do I cry all the time?

I didn't cry
