And so we start another day together
You and I and a million miles between us
I train my moods to bloom like flowers unfolding
Instead of fluttering around and slowly drowning in the

Steel rain, steel rain, steel rain
It's taking over, it's taking over

The sky is open and the drones are pouring out
The day inhales in a contagious yawn
And there you smile
...
