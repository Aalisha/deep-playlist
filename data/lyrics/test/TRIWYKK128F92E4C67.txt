Each new life killing time
They must wait can't escape
Clinging on each sad song
Swells the throng millions strong

Unaware if they care

I'm looking past the edge of you and all I see is black
What you steal is energy and you won't give it back
Intimidate interrogate poor you remain aloof
The drama of your misery played out since your youth
