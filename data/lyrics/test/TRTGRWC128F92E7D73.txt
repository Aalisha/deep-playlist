[Murphy] Yo y'all got another pair headphones in there I could use?

[King Jacob]
Uhh, King Jacob
Yeah, Fala Beats
Murph, Durph, ohh (Derrty E.N.T.)
We all we got

[Chorus: King Jacob]
My niggaz we gon' stomp, that's what we gon' do
The girls gon' bounce, the gangstas gon' groove
My nigga we gon' stomp, that's what we gon' do
The playas gon' win, the haters gon' lose
I said we gon' stomp, that's what we gon' do
The girls gon' bounce, the gangstas gon' groove
My nigga we gon' stomp, that's what we gon' do
The playas gon' win, the haters gon' lose
I said we gon' stomp

[King Jacob]
7 in a day roller, bong smoker, dope choker
Fo'-fo' two hundred spoker, Polo sporter, bet I poke her
Call me Mr. Roper, medulla oblongata slicer
Shoot dice up, pursue the juice that move the price up
'F' you if you don't like us, fool, your life up
Me removin my foot from ya ass know that's that screwed my Nike up
