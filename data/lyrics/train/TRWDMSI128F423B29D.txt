I couldn't wait to give you my everything
'cause this is for real
I've been saving up the things i never say
'cause this sense of urgency is getting too close to me
And i saved up all the things i never said
Because it's been so long since i felt a song inside me
And i couldn't wait to breathe it and feel it
