That secondhand junkyard heap
Was freedom with two bucket seats
With two grand on the windshield in shoe polish

I had a stash of summer cash
From cleanin' pools and cuttin' grass
Gave the man that coffee can and I bought it

From the moment that I turned the key
My right foot was heavy
From a mile away folks could hear me
Leanin' on that Chevy

Slidin' sideways through the town square
Peelin' out, Bruce Springsteen turned up too loud
Playin' air guitar, drummin' on the dash
Only brakin' for the badge

Had the man in blue burnin' through
Tickets by the pound
