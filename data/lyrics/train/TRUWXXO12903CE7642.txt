(Run away, run away, run away, run)
A song I heard the ocean sing
(Run away, run away, run away, run)
Shining light in darkness deep

(Run away, run away, run away, run)

(Run away, run away, run away, run)
And both will save me in my sleep

For every season that I slide
 (Sleep)
I prayer the prayer into the tide
 (Sleep)
A shining light in darkness deep
