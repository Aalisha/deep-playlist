Now the world is turning, spinning round the sun
So, we're standing still, but moving fast
One day your breath will be your last
One day you'll breath your last
We, all must one day, melt into the earth
The, only path we take from birth
We must make life have some worth
Dying from our birth
It's a bird that's flown
Through an empty room
