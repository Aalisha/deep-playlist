When you called me on the phone
I almost prayed that you'd forgive me
'Cause with everything you know
There's always something that you don't

But that evening took a spill
And we woke up feeling things might never be the same

Oh oh, 'cause everybody everybody everybody knows
We're the rulers of this place
We're the leaders of the new school

Yeah, everybody everybody everybody knows
We're the rulers of this place
We're the leaders of the new school
Yeah
