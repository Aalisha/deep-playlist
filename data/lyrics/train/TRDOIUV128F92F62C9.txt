its not the way you walk
its not the way you hold your fork
its not those stupid things u say and do when i cum in your face
the way u hold a ciggarette
the way u smilin when your wet
the way you make me cups of tea when i stay round at your place
its just those shoes you wear
its those shoes they turn me on
i dont choose to stair
