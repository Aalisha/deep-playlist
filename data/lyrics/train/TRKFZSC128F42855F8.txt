[D-Loc:]
Neighborhood

[JR:]
Everything that we do everybody wanna do,
we some trend setters settin trends that you're only
pursuin, all of our styles watchin wonderin when we
doin, when it comes to settin trends it all starts with these 2

[DL:]
Yeah these 2 you know D-Loc and Johnny Richter settin
neighborhood trends, ain't nobody slicker.
Since back in high school we was kings of the block,
H-Double Rest In Piece, don't stop.

[JR:]
What's in and what's not, what's cool and what's hot,
and whos the best when it comes to dribbling down the
rock, not sayin we're the first but we changed the
way you smoke, gotcha hittin vaporizers instead of takin bong tokes.

[DL:]
Hey yo, stop look and listen,
I'l serve the cat trippin,
I'll break out my basketball and start driblin,
call you best player out in your hood,
you get him? Got him. With the skills did it, you know I drill em.

[Hook:]
D-Loc and Johhny Richter it's old neighborhood friends,
We some go getters, settin neighborhood trends
Show splitters, settin neighborhood trends,
You need to go get this, and get some for your friends.
D-Loc and Johhny Richter it's old neighborhood friends,
We some go getters, settin neighborhood trends
Show splitters, settin neighborhood trends,
You need to go get this, and get some for your friends.
