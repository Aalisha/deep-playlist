So you've been trying to get ahead
But coming out empty handed
Losing all those friends you made instead

Oh you pushed your way up to the top
You got so tall you had to stop
Did you squint to see who you were stepping on?

It's your secret to the success
That's causing such a mess
And to be honest forgetting all of us
Now that is just bad business
...
