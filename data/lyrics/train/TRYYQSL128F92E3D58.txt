There's a place I go where love grows wild
Forever seems to go for miles
Even when it rains, the sun is shining

Dark woods always in full bloom
On my tip toes I can touch the moon
I'm out of [Incomprehensible] clouds with silver lining
It's like no place on earth

It's bluer skies and greener grass
A little off the beaten path
I see your smile and I hear your laugh
And I'm lost in a world

Where colors shine in brighter shades
My favorite song is always playin'
The center of my universe
...
