You waltz into the room
Just like you'd never left
And for a moment or two
I could almost forget
You take me in your arms
And I fall again

That's no way to break a heart
You call my name I drop my guard
Why can't you play your chosen part
And stay away so I can make another start
That's no way to break a heart
