Yeah! This here's the anthem y'all. That one girl who's always at the show, for one reason only. Next time y'all see her, I want y'all to say.

Hook:
Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi (Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi)
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee (Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee)
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi (Hi-dee-hi-dee-hi-dee-hi)
Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee (Hee-dee-hee-dee-hee-dee-hee)
Whoa-oh-oh (Whoa-oh-oh)

Verse 1:
Now here's a story 'bout a girl that I'm sure you all know
She turns around when they yell (Ho-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You always see her at the shows, Gucci glasses on her nose
Too much make up on her face or hardly wearin any clothes
She ain't interested in flows, and she knows it's a fact
She's always early but ain't trynna see the openin' act
She wants the dough she could stack
She startin' local wit rap
She in the front row but really trynna go to the back
Oh, excuse me, let me introduce you to the groupie
Flash the car keys and the sharpie, you can autograph the coochie
Now ask yourself, "How many stars can one chick date?"
Her little black book resembles Kay Slay mixtapes
She got 2 Source covers, 4 Grammy nominees
