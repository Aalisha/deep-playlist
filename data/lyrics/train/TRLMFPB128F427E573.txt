Lord, I want to know You more
Follow You with all my heart and soul
Lord, I want to know Your voice
Lead me in Your way everlasting

Show me Your ways
Teach me and guide me in Your truth, my Savior
Confide in me speak mysteries
My heart is longing for Your touch
For only You can fill this need in me

Lord, I want to know You more
