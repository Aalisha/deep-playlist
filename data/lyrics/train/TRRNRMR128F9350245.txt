You can say what you want
Find the path that you've lost somewhere
Be the fly on the wall
Take a dive or a fall in prayer

Everyday there's a choice
Nothing gained from the path we know
They're the ones to be wrong
Hiding all of the stars out there

You can say what you want
Find the path that you've lost somewhere
Be the fly on the wall
