And any man who knows a thing
knows he knows not a damn, damn thing at all
And every time I felt the hurtin'
I felt the givin' gettin' me up off the wall
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breathe
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it ride
I'm just gonna take a minute and let it breathe

How did Mandela get the will to surpass the everyday
when injustice had him caged and trapped in every way?
How did Gandhi ever withstand the hunger-strikes at all?
Didn't do it to gain power or money if I recall. It's the gift,
I guess I'll pass it on, mother thinks it'll lift the stress of Babylon
mother knows, my mother she suffered blows
I don't know how we survived such violent episodes
I was so worried, it hurt to see you bleed,
but as soon as you came out the hospital you gave me sweets, yea,
they tried to take you from me, but you still only gave 'em some prayers and sympathy
Dear Mama, you helped me write this
by showing me to give is priceless

And any man who knows a thing
knows he knows not a damn, damn thing at all
And every time I felt the hurtin'
