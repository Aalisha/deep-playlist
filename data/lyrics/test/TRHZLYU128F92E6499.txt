I wanna rock
(Rock)
I wanna rock
(Rock)

I wanna rock
(Rock)
I wanna rock
(Rock)

Turn it down you say
Well, all I got to say to you is time and time again I say
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Tell me not to play

Well, all I got to say to you when you tell me not to play
I say
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you

I wanna rock
(Rock)
I wanna rock
(Rock)

I wanna rock
(Rock)
I wanna rock
(Rock)

There's a feelin' that I get from nothin' else
And there ain't nothin' in the world
That makes me go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Turn the power up

I've waited for so long so I could hear my favorite song
So let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go
When it's like this I feel the music shootin' through me
