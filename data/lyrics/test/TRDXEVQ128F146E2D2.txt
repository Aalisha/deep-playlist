(Stevie Wonder/Syreeta Wright)

*(Just) Spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' around
Painting the town I'm never coming down
Spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin' around
(I'm) out on the town I'm never coming down

God Almighty I wanna live
A man will shower me with expensive gifts
And the cost there's his love
I don't want to be, I don't want to be
Just another feather in a cap you see
...
