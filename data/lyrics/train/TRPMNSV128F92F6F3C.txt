[Blaze:]
Look into my mind, tell me what you see, what you find
Can somebody tell me what's happening this time?
I don't know
I break it down again, losing control
With these demons inside still pulling at my soul.
Still reaching for my coat, I choke and black out
Without a lung to pump anymore oxygen out.
Am I doomed on the Earth with these mental symptoms
Cause your church won't grant the dead an exorcism.
[Violent J:]
Let me get two turntables and a microphone
Black rain, bloody murder means spike your dome
Why, I, don't know why
Pressure released from my head when you die
(Ali Baba)
Empty pill bottles on the shelf
Got this hunger and a sexual drive to end your health.
Fucking aches (ouch)
You gotta die, I'm sorry but you gotta die.
[Chorus x2:]
Come with me, right into the edge of your mind
We're standing on the edge and ready to die
The shit is about to jump off, and I'm about to jump off, damn
Then when the soul around I'm a jump again.
