I sat up here in my window
Lookin down on the street
Strychnine poison woman
Man don't you look so sweet
I said come on up and see me sometime
I'm just a drunken sailor but I'm feeling so fine
I've been out sailin on the seven seas
Baby won't ya give it to me

Baby won't ya drive me mad
Baby don't ya let me feel bad
Baby don't ya leave me alone
Baby won't ya carry me home
Baby won't ya jump and shout
You know what i'm talking about
Baby won't ya drive me wild
Baby let me see you smile

I see all the sickly, salty swingers
Standing on the barroom floor
Sliding and gliding as she past by my window
She was a female mercenary coming home from the war
The ultimate inflection of the word perfection
I thought I'd drop by and say hi
...
