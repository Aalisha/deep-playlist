We collapse, hands interlude
Cheek against cheek a pulse duet hums
Through our veins and I'm not sure why
And I continue

When we start to embarrass each other
As our lies attain bi-partial virtue
And all I want is to die
All I want is to die

I gain and lose control
Like some fucked up lust opiate

And now you will forever abhor me
As I purge myself one piece at a time
