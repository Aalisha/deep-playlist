Come on

First time that I saw your face
All I said was,? Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh?
Imagine us in our embrace as I kiss on
Your lips, your neck, your hips, your back

Who would, would satisfy you?
Who would, would satisfy, would satisfy you?
Who would, would satisfy you?
Who would, would satisfy, would satisfy you?

Let me take these many hands
And rub your body over, over, over again
Make love to you throughout the night
