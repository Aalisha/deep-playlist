I like to sit
Do nothing at home
I disappear, turn off the phone
I lose myself
Hide from the sun
I make a trip, when i'm out of fun
I cut you in, come on let's go for a fall
I cut you in, and you ain't leavin' at all
I cut you in, don't let it go to your head
I cut you in, part-time friend
I call you up
