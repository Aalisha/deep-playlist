When I get to Glory, I'm gonna sing, sing, sing
I'm gonna let the hallelujahs ring
I'm gonna praise my blessed Saviour's name
When I get to Glory, I'm Gonna sing, sing, sing

In this world of sorrow, I've seen trouble and woe
When I get to Glory I'll see no more
For ] I know my prayers have not been in vain
When I get to Glory, I'm gonna sing, sing, sing
