How many times can you put me down
Till in your heart you realize
If you choose to criticize
You choose your enemies

Everything that I say and do
In your eyes is always wrong
Tell me where do I belong
In this sick society

(chorus)
You're no different to me.yeah
You're no different
No different to me
