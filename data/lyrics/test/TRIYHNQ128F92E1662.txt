Push me in the corner, hey don't do that
Push me in the corner, I don't love that
Push me in the corner, yeah
It's alright

Yeah, when I tell say no, say
No push me ina no corner, no way y'all
No push me in no corner, let me tell you
No push me ina no corner 'coz I'm not no doggone boom
I don't sweep out no boom, yes

You and I supposed to live nice, we nice, nice, nice
And I supposed to live fine, so fine, so real fine
You and I should live good, baby, not like puss and dog
So don't push me ina no corner
