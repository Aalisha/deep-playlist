This is a story bout
A little man named Rod
Who did not have a mind of his own
Just went along with his pathetic lonely life.

Even when he went to school
The teacher said "jump!"
And he jumped and he jumped and he jumped
Then he fell on the floor.

Never let his feelings out
Didn't have any friends
Once he left school he hoped
This would
All change now.
BUT
It was not to be
The world for him to see
Mercy!
Oh, mercy!

Arrrggggghhhhhhaaaa!

He had to get a job
Wanted to go somewhere to relax for a while
He went to work on a boat as a cabin boy...

"Get on you knees and scrub the decks,
I want to see you sweating. Make sure you're
In my quarters around half past ten this evening..."

He didn't like this one bit
He got to get another job
So he jumped off the boat
And swam to shore
...
