(Chorus:)
Wish I could f**k her everyday
Touch her in everyway
But she stay so many miles away
She my.
Distant lover.
So many miles away
Distant lover.
so many miles away

I'm turnin' into Mr. telephone man
Girl, you know I miss ya
So many miles away
And I can't kiss ya
Look but I remember everything
The concert, the room
The shit you whispered in my ear when I had you

Now my Jacksonville chick
She an indo shopper
She like to smoke purple
And chill wit her partners
When I come in town, she cook for me
You know she lookin good for me
Momma white, daddy black
So that ass supa phat

My uptown chick
We still be flirtin
When I see her
She remind me of how I broke a virgin
Think I still drive her crazy
'cause she still wanna date me
Got a man and a baby
Do ya thang, I ain't hatin'

Now my Michigan chick
She was too damn fine
Her pussy stay wet all the time
One of the best to ever ride me
Let me get a car and drive it
Everytime she see Lil Boosie she smilin'
