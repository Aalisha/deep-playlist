Calling all cars... calling all cars
Be on the lookout for Dangerous Dan...
This man is wanted by the F.B.I. - 10-4

Said he's dangerous, armed and extremely dangerous

The day he walked into my life he caught me with my guard down
Don't let him talk his sweet talk on ya
'Cause I've hit on the bait that he threw and I got hooked,
Don't let it happen to you
