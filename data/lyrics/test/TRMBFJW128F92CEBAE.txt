Can I feel the sun
Breaking through the gray I'm lost within?
Can I hear the wind
Like a secret telling me I'll live again?
I need you

All your thoughts, let them fall
Like a million raindrops
On this desolate ground I'm standing on
Every word from your lips
Like a father's kiss
That all my life I've waited on

Can I walk the line?
Tell me, will you be my safety net?
Can you save a life
...
