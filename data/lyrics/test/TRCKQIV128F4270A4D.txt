bread and butter tastes more like it could be cordon bleu
mona lisa's smiling like a cheshire cat
even johnny rocker sounds today like nat king cole
every yellow taxi's like a cadillac
and the cup that once appeared half empty
has become a cup that is half full
where there was a space there is now plenty
you're a lucky sign ascending-- no one does for me what you do
...
