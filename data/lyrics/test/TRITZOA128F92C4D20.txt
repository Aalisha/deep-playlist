I'm writing words for you
There's nothing else to do
All my life I feel like I can
I'm writing songs for you
I know it's nothing new
All my lines can't stop you crying

Oh my, oh my, my
You try I wonder why
You came, you came beside
Don't lie, you see another day
Oh my, oh my, my
You try, I wonder why
You can't, you can't decide
Don't lie, you see another day
