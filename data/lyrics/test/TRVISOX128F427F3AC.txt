I'll give you the best I can give you, baby
That's all I can give
We'll live it the best we can live it, baby
As long as we live

What kind of love never turns you down
What kind of love lifts you off the ground
Turns your life around
What kind of love makes you go out in the wind
And the driving rain

What kind of love runs through your heart with
A pleasure so close to pain
What kind of love
...
