Yeah!

I can't believe what I've seen, so scratch my eyes out!
You, were at ease, on your knees, in his apartment!
You said his name, as I came, in your direction!
Now, I can choose, what to do, with both of you

I loved you! (I hate you...)
You hurt me! (I loved you...)
I loved you
You, hurt, me, bad!
GO!

Your words, bury me, of what I used to be
I can't erase all those things I've seen
Your heart, smothers me, now it's hard to breathe
I can't erase all my memories

I, take a step, to the left, now you see me!
