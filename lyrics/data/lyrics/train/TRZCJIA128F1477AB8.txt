In the cool cool cool of the morning
That's when I'm coming home
In the cool cool cool of the morning
That's when I'm coming home

Stayed awake all night
(Stayed awake all night)
Stayed awake all night night long
(Stayed awake all night)
Stayed awake all night
(Stayed awake all night)
Stayed awake all night night long
(Stayed awake all night)
Stayed awake all night
Stayed awake all night
Stayed awake all night
Stayed awake all night

In the cool cool cool of the ev'ning
I'm hitched up and ready to ride
In the cool cool cool of the ev'ning
I'm hitched up and ready to ride

Gonna truck all night
(Gonna truck all night)
Gonna truck all night night long
(Gonna truck all night)
