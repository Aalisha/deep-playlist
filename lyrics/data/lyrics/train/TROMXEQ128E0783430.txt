Any Day Now, I will hear you say goodbye my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown old
Any day now, I'll be all alone, Wooo
Any day now, when your restless eyes, meet someone new
All to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall, all over town, Wooo
Any day now, love will let me down
