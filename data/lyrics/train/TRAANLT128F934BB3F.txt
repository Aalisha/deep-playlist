Waste of flesh
Oh, holy priest, the mighty lord
Will give you strength to rape them all
The punishment the last you get
Will cut your face and steal your breath
Vile We Dwell
These morals cut the play
Is it justice you are crying for
Ok, lets rape the holy whore
With gleamy steel I'll wide your holes
For setting free the holy ghost
Vile We Dwell
I wish them hell
