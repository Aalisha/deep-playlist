OK, it's alright with me
some things are just meant to be
it never comes easily
and when it does I'm already gone

I'm practic'lly never still
more likely to move until
I end up alone at will
my life continues inching along

When Bernadette comes, I get lost on her time
she's much too sweet and she's always gonna be
...
