Yeah-eh-heah
you are, my fire,
the one, desire,
believe, when i say

i want it that way
But we, are two worlds apart,
can't reach to your heart,
when you say,

that i want it that way
Tell me why,
ain't nothin' but a heartache,
tell me why,
ain't nothin' but a mistake,
tell me why,
i never wanna hear you say,

i want it that way
Am i, your fire?
your one, desire,
yes i know, it's too late,
...
