I swear the oath of blood
and tear the virgin's flesh
I gash the wounds of heaven
and rides the wings of death

Tonight the cauldrons are filled
with brewage madeEof hate
Tonight we blasphemy
possessed we desecrate

Tonight we raise our cups
and toast in an angels blood
Salute hell's victory
despise the words of God

Armageddon
