The flashlights came out
The sound of them move
The wet of the ground
You're starting to lose
You took every breath
You traced all my steps
To start in the streets, and end what is left

I know that this is going leave you now
I know that this is going to take you down
I know that this is going to take you out

And I am everywhere, everywhere
