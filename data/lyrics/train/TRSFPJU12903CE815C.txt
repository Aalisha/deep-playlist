Fall fell in Ontario
And it seems like so few days
That the poplar blossoms fell like snow
On the beach at the end of
Cherry Road

That sand is coarse
And the water's cold

No lifeguard on patrol
But I woke up and just had to go
To the beach at the end of
Cherry Road

'Cause in it's wreckage and rubble
And all that broken glass
