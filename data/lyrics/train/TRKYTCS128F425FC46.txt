In a cold sweat of my distress
Need to catch my breath, in this odd mess
Can't abscond from my own prison
Like bashed on the head to death

A crying shame, no vigor for rancor
Can't pin the blame on my lord with anger
Dash my thoughts against the wall
And take my eyes off a glare

Oh, no one can camouflage the
Muck on my reflection

Affection's what I've pleased
At the seventh dawn
Those flaws revealed
A frown again flitted across my face
I couldn't get out of this haze

Reflections of mind, so deep
At the seventh dawn
