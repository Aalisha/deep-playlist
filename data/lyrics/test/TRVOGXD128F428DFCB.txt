Standing there with that killer stare and a body that won't quit
She said, "I don't want a little piece of your love, so give me all of it"
And before I knew what I had to do, she was holdin' on so tight
She said "Just relax a bit, kick on back and enjoy the ride"

But she wants more and more and more and more

You want it all, well little girl, I hope you're ready
You want it all, well I got it, so baby, come and get it, come on
You want it all, up down, all around, straight down to the ground
You say, you want it but your momma won't let it
You only live once, so baby, come and get it, come on, come on
Baby, come and get it, come on, come on

Another night, she's just arrived and she's knockin' down my door
Wearin' nothing but a raincoat and she's beggin' me for more
