And we walked a thousand days
There was nothing more to find
Million peoples in our way
Million ways to loose our minds

Met a girl the other day
Didn't know what i should say

More than those who follow me
If we strike them though their hearts
Then their minds will set them free

Met a girl the other year
Didn't know who I should be
