Baby, I was talkin' all night long
Tryin' to take it home long distance
I guess I lost my connection
I heard you slip away
And then it came in loud and clear
You only hear what you want to hear
And everybody here says
Sonny boy, you're on your way
There's trouble in paradise
The story don't sound too nice
And you just can't sleep at night
In a solid gold room
Well, there's trouble in paradise
You never turn out those lights
You just can't close your eyes
In a solid gold room
Baby, you've been lookin' at the future
And I know you think you found it
But now you want to make me a hero
