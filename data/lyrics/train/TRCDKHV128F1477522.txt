I'm a ragged man with a ragged heart
but I wear my soul with pride
you can see me on the road
see my carrying my home
and perhaps it seems that I'm all alone
but I'm happy here inside
you can keep your fancy dress
'cause to me it don't impress

when I look in your face
that camera smile looks out of place on you
by the look in your eyes
I can see you realize

so lend yourself to me
I'll show you what could be

well I've come so far down so many roads
...
