I got money in my pocket and a guitar in my hand
These lonely nights without you are more than I can stand
I work like a puppet but it's time to cut the strings

Well I hit the ground running and I won't be looking back
I'll be like a locomotive headed down a one way track
It won't take too long just you wait and see

As long as it will lead me back to you
Any old stretch of blacktop will do
