(Teddy)
you know i dont even know why you actin funny
why you let them get in your head like that
or the just gon hate on me

(Eric)
verse 1
they call you crazy cause im never home
they say your to young girl to spend your life alone
but they just dont know they can only assume
bout what i do its about me and you

chorus:
you and i we can make it
if your girlfriends stop hating
i dont want to have to let you go
girl im down with you even if they dont think so
they dont know how we do
