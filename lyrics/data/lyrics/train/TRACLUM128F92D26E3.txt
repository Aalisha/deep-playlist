isn't summer special easy hair
relax it wasn't locked tight
and you cased out the revenue
always look for it easy

look at those girls
so young so young
still piss their pants
with their hope dogs mangey
'cause their heart snakes lazy

isn't summer special easy hair
relax it wasn't locked tight
and you cased out the revenue
...
