Between the seams
are scary dreams
I'd like to be
eventually
able to roam
around so free
I have secrets
inside of me
Can you discover why were even here,
can't you feel, I think the end is near
but are you sure you really want to know
there's so much I fear with such a long way to go
go away
I hear you say
you think you know
it all, hooray
but no you don't
...
