Don't make me speak in a new language
Just let me tell you the way that I feel about you
I sure don't want to offend anyone
But if you take away my words
How can I tell you the truth

An old-fashioned boy and a modern girl
And the way that we talk turns our heads around
Your passion is real when I'm in your arms
But when we speak it gets watered down

I know I'm not very articulate
And I can't express myself innocuously
...
