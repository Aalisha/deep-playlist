Prince sing another song, it's written on your face,
Instead I put pressure on the whole damn place,
I never liked running through the crowd with no proof,
So now I gotta flex in the steps of the truth,
Forever hearing prince has to stick to his kind,
Prince make a love song about a tech 9,
I thought prince be had to be prince be
Yet they wanna riff when they find I disagree
With that dog eat dog, I'm a get mine
Even if I'm stepin on your frame of mind
You can ring things where the ringin' things at.
But prince be thinks it's widdack
So now I'm accused of spikin' the punch
And I'll be the scapegoat for fakin' the funk
But when they set up another prince time beef
What's hard at first, but melts in the heat, they call that plastic
