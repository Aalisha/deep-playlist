I'll cut my heart out and leave it here on the stage

And you can come pick it up after the show
And when you find out what I really meant you let me know
I'll cut it out, cut it out, cut my heart out and leave it here on the stage
And you can come pick it up after the show
And when you find out what you really want you let me know
I'll cut it out, cut it out, cut my heart out, with some more so-called friends
And we can meet at the house after the show
And you will smile and lie to my face, I'll never know
