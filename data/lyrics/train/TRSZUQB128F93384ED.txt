Your stagnant truth, this buried youth
Wake up wrought with atrophy
Your scars will heal
Take my hand, I'll guide you through
Strip your thoughts of this treacherous road
I'll bring you home

Your heart beats with shallow depth
Lividity is certain
Still breathing with shallow breaths
Your failing wish dissolves
