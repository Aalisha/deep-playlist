(Intro-Young Buck)
Young Buck, Lil Flip, David Banner c'mon
G-Unit In This Bitch, G-Unit In This Bitch
The Dirty, Dirty
Show 'Em How The South Do

(Chorus-Young Buck)
Gold Grills, Coupe' Devilles Sittin On 22's
The Dirty, Dirty Baby
Show 'Em How The South Do
We Pop Pills, Shoot To Kill, You Know What We 'Bout
And On Behalf Of G-Unit, Welcome To The South

(Verse one-Young Buck)
Working This Wood Wheel, Ya'll Don't Know How Good It Feel
Just Come To Cashville, Ya'll Gon See How Hood It Is
We In The Projects, Cookin' Chikens In The Kitchen
We Goto Prison, But Get Out And Go Back To Get In It
Your Hood Ain't No Harder Than Mine, Bitch, We All Thuggin'
We Fight In Clubs, Hit The Parkin Lot, And Start Bustin'
I Know I'm Country, I Cant Help It I'm From Tennessee
I'm Throwin' Up This Hennisey, Blowin Up My Enemies
Ya'll Niggas Remember Me? Not Because The Bird's Ten A Key
But Young Buck Been A G', I Give A Fuck Who You Be Boy
I Want In On Everything, A Dime Bag, If So Come See Me For It
To Be A Star, All You Need Is A Pyrex Jar
Some Soldiers, And Some Baking Soda, You Can Buy That Car

(Chorus-Young Buck)
Gold Grills, Coupe' Devilles Sittin On 22's
