Just let me catch my breath
I've heard the promises
I've seen the mistakes
I've had my fair share of tough breaks
I need a new voice, a new law, a new way
Take the time, reevaluate
It's time to pick up the pieces
Go back to square one
I think it's time for a change
There is someting that I feel

To be something that is real
I feel the heat within my mind
And craft new changes with my eyes
Giving freely wandering promises
A place with decisions I'll fashion
I won't waste another breath
You can feel the waves coming on

(It's time to take the time)
Let them destroy you or carry you on
(It's time to take the time)
