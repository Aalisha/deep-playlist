You have the bravest heart
The strongest emotions
After all the harm I have caused
You still want my loving

I think I've lost your love
Oh baby it's a shame
But how can I be mad at you
When I'm the one to blame

You have the bravest heart
The strongest emotions
After all the harm I have caused
You still want my loving

I can't believe
I still receive
So much affection from your side
