Drifting down - descent without sound
Shapes never alike - long beams of light
Thoughtless greed - now I cannot see
What brings life - kills tonight

Metal sky - think before you fly
Rocks flash through time - ropes and knots bind
Often seen - not chosen from the past needs
On ourselves we rely - and let life die
...
