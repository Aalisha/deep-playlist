There's a new kind of music going 'round
It's known as the Boogey Grass sound
So grab your partner and swing her around
And dance to the Boogey Grass sound.

I love to hear Bill sing about Kentucky
And the Almond brothers' "Ramblin' Man"
We put the music all together
So dance to the Boogey Grass Band.
