You are the saint, I am the sinner

Do you really believe
That I can't see inside your cold heart?
I have witnessed you
Now let the truth be a light in the dark

Yeah, I can see so clearly
Right through your crying, there's no denying
You point the finger, cast the first stone
Knowing you're guilty you're
Still blaming me, saying

You are the saint I am the sinner
You laugh as my heart turns to stone
You are the saint I am the sinner
Prey till my flesh hits the bone
