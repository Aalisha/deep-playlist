I remember what we said
I believe in better times ahead
There’s so much unpredicted

I believed in turning trees
how they twist and tingle after light
I believed in turning it all around
overnight

and I do, I do my best not to care
that you still make me blush
if you don’t love me, love,
then love me such
I do my best not to care
that you still make me blush
and if you do love me, love
...
