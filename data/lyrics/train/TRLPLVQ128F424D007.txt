Out of the mist into tropical splendour
With garlands of flowers
In Majestical fusion we see tonight
On to this sacred reunion of pleasure
They row as a rhythm, ten thousands of millions
They touch the Light
King is sailing they say
King is sailing we hear
King is sailing they say
King is sailing this day of days of days
Cocasaya Tay Toca
