La da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, down, down, down
La da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, down, down
La da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, down, down, down
La da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, down, down

Let's hop a train and stow away
Down in Mexico
And on the way as music plays
We'll, let our beards grow tall

And she don't like me singing songs
And she don't want to sing along

It's still the same and
She only likes me when I'm gone
It's still the same and
She only likes me when I'm gone

La da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, down, down, down
La da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, da dee, down, down
