I hate everything I am becoming
This change is torture
There is never enough to give, only plenty to take
And this I wage

When the ground parts from below
Will it feel so?
How can I gain from another
When the other goes?
This hand, this hurt, my heart

I'll flirt with disaster
Just know now, man
The deal is off

I'll be no good, this time defines
I'll put my touch around the grip of this knife
These dirty hands just won't come clean
I'm a murderer, the worst these worlds will see

Mercy, please leave her just a little bit longer
She's all, my world, my love, I apologize
With that, you will see the end of days, just rest assured
...
