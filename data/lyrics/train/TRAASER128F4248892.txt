Yesterday I heard you say
You'd give your soul to have your way
Thrice you wished it, twice you pleaded
Once you vowed and knelt to pray
Seven times I heard you promise
Seven time you called in vain
Your wish is granted, the devil signed it
And now I'm riding to make you pay

I know that your soul has had enough of crying
And I'm here to free you and take your pain away

Scream, if you hear my machine
It's a terrifying dream
There's no time to hide
I'm right beside you
...
