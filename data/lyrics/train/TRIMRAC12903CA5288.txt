I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one who loves you

Little girl again you are blue
Another fellow has gone and left you
I see you've come back to me
Your best frind
To tell another tragic story again
And once more you look into my eyes
And one more time you ought to realize
