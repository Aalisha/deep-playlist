I'm under pressure
Be-gi-gi-ginning to overdrive
I'm a loose canon, mmh
I will not make it out alive

See I'm wrapped around your finger
I'm digging in the dirt
I'm so deep into this shit
I can taste the earth

'Cause you're running me in circles
I'm running out of breath
But you ain't gonna stop
'Til there's nothing left

Don't bring flowers after I'm dead
Don't bring flowers after I'm dead
...
