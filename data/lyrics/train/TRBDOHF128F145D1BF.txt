(Bob DiPiero/Steve Wariner)

Runnin' down the interstate
Coffee drippin' down my leg
Every day I'm runnin' late
Gettin' slapped around by the hands of time.

Next lane there's a pick-up
A girl puttin' on her make-up
Her cellular phone's startin' to break up
She's gettin' slapped around by the hands of time.
