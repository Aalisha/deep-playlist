She woke me up with a bang bang
Lookin' over crossed eyed
Had a big hunch that the world was a big lie
When I got up all the blood to my head
I got so dizzy fell back into my bed
I went over to the wayside
Lookin' for the high tide
What will I find
Will I find
Will I find find
All I saw was a man that had a hat that had a pompom
He's been there for years
Can someone tell me how long?

Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not find
Wake up to tell me
Wake up to show me what I could not

You see this woman woke me up at a quarter to three
And I didn't know it then but she put a spell on me
Said I had to go down to where the cliffs meet the sea
And meet an old man to present my plea
So I headed way down to the big pier
