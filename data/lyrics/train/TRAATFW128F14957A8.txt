Some folks say that I've got the perfect life
Three swell kids, lots of toys and a lovely wife
I fly, I sail, I throw caution to the wind
Drift like a stratus cloud above the Carribean

But every now and then, the dragons come to call
Just when you least expect it you'll be dogin' cannon balls
I've seen too much not to stay in touch
With a world full of love and luck
I've got a big suspicion 'bout ammunition
I never forget to duck

Chorus
Come back, Come back, back to Jamaica
Don't chu know we made a big mistaica
We'd be so sad if you told us goodbye
And we promise not to shoot you out of the sky
