Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise

He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line

Sworn to avenge
Condemned to Hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the Sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins

Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow

Sworn to avenge
Condemned to Hell
Tempt not the blade
...
