Alive, alive, alive, alive 

Never thought the day would come when I'd see
My reflection smiling right back at me
It's been a while since I've been happy
Not sure, that I'm ready
I never planned on letting love in
Didn't wanna go back there again 

But maybe I could (maybe I should)
Take a, take a chance on you

Tonight, I'm lost in the music and lights
I don't wanna let go but I might
If it's right
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Is this real? Cause this heart is just startin' to heal
And you're so close to makin' me feel (me feel)
Alive, alive, alive, alive

I didn't ever think that I'd be given
