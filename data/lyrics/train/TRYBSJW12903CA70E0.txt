There's something in the way
She mixes up the chemicals
Next stop battaries
We'll crank it on the radio
Sunday morning she'll never leave me waiting
She wouldn't wanna see me dried up in the sun

We'd be staggering
Like sid and nancy
Up all night
Drinking nothing fancy
Tossing rings
And passing packets
Underneath our leater jackets
...
