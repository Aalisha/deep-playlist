As they
Dig your ditches
Count my stitches
Generation justice wishes for
World at war
Final score
Media come and abhor us

As these are hard times
We´ll work harder harder
Through these hard times
I´ll work harder harder

Divided nation
In sedation
Overload of information that
We have grown up to ignore
Mediocrity applauded
