She was A Jezebel, this Brixton queen
Livin' the life like a back street dream
Tellin' mi lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinnin' mi 'round like a wheel on fire
Walkin' on tightrope, my love's high wire
Fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream

Love is never what it seems
When we touch
And you're holding me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true

You make my dreams come true
I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you (Huh)

And show you the way I feel (Huh-huh-huh)
