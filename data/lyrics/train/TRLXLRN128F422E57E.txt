Once again, Jekyllish I follow the trail of fireflies - and diamond eyes
And moving like fog, I starve to raise
Sleepwalking hunter in the night

Step into an ongoing nightmare
Go - ride into blistering trails below - tear heart and soul
Stop - for jekylish I'll haunt you, though
A sleepwalking hunter in despair - take care of you

I brave for sin - shedding my skin

Curtains fall over my shroud, around my wrists the orchestra plays
Frozen, this bosom aches, piercing lullabies, piercing preys
...
