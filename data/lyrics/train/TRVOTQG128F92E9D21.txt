The time has come for me
To leave this place of complacency
And step out across that line
To the place where I
Can leave all that I have behind
And give you this heart of mine

But what if I'm the only one to break the silence
What if I'm the only one to crack the ice

(chorus)
I'll join the rocks with their singing
I'll join the ocean as it harmonizes with the shore
...
