Like Miles Davis, I've been swayed by the cool
There's just something 'bout the summertime, 
there's just something 'bout the moon
So I laid a kiss on the stone, 
tossed it upside your window by the roof
Before you change your mind,
 Miles, bring in the cool

Honey, put on your red dress and your diamond soled shoes
Climb on out from that window, climb on out of your room
Cause I've never had a good thing, and I always had the blues
But I heard that you always kinda wondered, Miles, strike up the cool

Don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
And the night is our own
Don't wait too long
