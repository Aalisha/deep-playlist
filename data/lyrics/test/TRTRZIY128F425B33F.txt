Well I don't wanna hang around with you
I've got my motor baby and I'm gonna see you through
You think I wanna be alone with you
It doesn't matter baby cause you're overreacted too
But since you're down there, where will I just be
I'm getting fine girl, dressing up for stormy weather

So touch me down in the past where my mother will last
And it's true that I'm in for a punch and a blast
Yeah down in the past where my mother will last
And she will make sure that you remember yeah yeah
