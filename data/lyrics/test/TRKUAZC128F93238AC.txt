I've found so many people like to smile a lot
Smile a lot 'cause they're having so much fun
Even when they know they're not

They'll wear some tiny little hat and they'll feel
good
They'll feel good 'cause their hat is silly
And silly means that their time is good

I've learnt that indecision only brings no joy
So much joy to a fickle little world
That every night I do TV, film my own self CCTV
And there's panic on the street when it's not around

So we go to
All those African children
Who live far away
On the back of a big bus all the way to Bombay

When they go I am with them
But it won't be long
...
