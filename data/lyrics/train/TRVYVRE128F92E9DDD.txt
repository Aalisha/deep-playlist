I wish you only knew
All the days I've made it through
Because of you and your sweet love

I wish that I could count the times
Peace and comfort filled my mind
Because of you and your sweet love

You're what keeps me going
The sun that lights my sky
The rose that blooms in winter
The rain that cools july
