1ST VERSE
Living life
Early morning love
Summer days and getting paid
Friends from around the way
Rain done gone away
Favourite songs
Knowing where you belong
No place like home
Whatever your vice
That got you nice
At any price

CHORUS
And it feels so good
So good the simple things
The way it should be (simple things)
Can't take it for granted
