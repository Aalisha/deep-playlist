I always thought it was a hard thing to do
to leave someone behind, but it's easy with you
just drop it, stop it, leave her and forget her
live your life again as if you never met her

But then you think back to the times you shared
and suddenly you become aware that
forgetting her is not so easy to do
you can leave this lady, but she never leaves you

whoohoo
I've got a passe partout
whoohoo
on the girls you do
whoohoo
oh if you ever knew

whoohoo
so don't put up a fight
whoohoo
just stay home tonight
whoohoo
