I can't believe I didn't say this sooner
I'll just believe that I was all displaced
I'll get to speakin' let you know how I feel
I'll get to judgin' make you see my appeal

No one will ever see things the way I do
No one will try
All my friends think that I'm gone
But I swear, I swear I'm not
I swear I'm not

This makes me feel that I'll never be quite normal
