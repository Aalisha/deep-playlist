Excuse me, yeah I'm talking to you
Look in the mirror, could you tell me
What you see?
Hard hearts are crashing in a crowded room
You never felt so good, you never felt so free

Save you from yourself
Before you start to deal with everyone else
You should have kept it to yourself
Now we're looking to fight, this isn't alright
Alright, you better hold your scripted tongue
If you ever plan to use those words again
The future doesn't make much sense
With you at the helm with your friends
This is where that ends

You've got a problem here
The tide is turning you inside out
