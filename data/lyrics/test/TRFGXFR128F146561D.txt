Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout (oh oh)
Whatcha talkin' bout (oh oh)
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout (what what what)
Whatcha talkin' bout
Whatcha talkin' bout

I remember talking to you constantly
'Cause we were cool like that
Playing silly games with you, we had a ball
Going to the movies, or just hangin' out
Watching a DVD
But now it's let's do lunch
The limo's pickin' you up around three

Sayin' hit me on my mobile
I'm a little busy
Got a lot a people to call (oh-whoa you)

Whatcha talkin' bout, I don't really hear it
Cos you keep on fadin' out
You're not comin' through, whatcha gon' do? (gon' do?)
Whatcha talkin' bout, who you think you're fooling? (oh)
There's no way I'm hangin' out
With someone like you, whatcha gon' do?
