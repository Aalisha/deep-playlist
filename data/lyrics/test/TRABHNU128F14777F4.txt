(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo) (x2)
Some other guy may give me diamonds & pearls
The kind of things that mean so much to some girls
But in the long run, baby, it's love that really counts
Believe me, it's love that really counts
& baby, after loving you
I'm here to say that no one else will do
