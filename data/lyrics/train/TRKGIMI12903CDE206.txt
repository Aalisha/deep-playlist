Two Apache kids
in a stolen car
navigatin by a fallin star ...yeah
Where are they goin?

Towards Jerusalem Mountain
Red amphetamine sunrise
Mesquite
Saguarro
Great Mystical Agave
tell 'em please
Where are they goin?

Past the little white crosses,
the Highway signs
Stay away from the double yellow lines
Jimmy Yelloweyes
take care where youre goin

Aint no alcohol allowed on the Reservation
They're headed out in search of strong libation
Hoyah!
They know where they're goin!

Out where the crosses of San Carlos
shine 'neath a desert moon
near the canyons where Geronimo rode
and the ocatillo blooms
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Hoyah
wheres it all going

Old Mexican Jaguar crossed over last night
near the Agua Priatt
...
