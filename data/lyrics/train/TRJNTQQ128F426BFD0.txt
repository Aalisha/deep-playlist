Walks in the rain, talks in the dark
Old black and white movies, a day at the park
On a blanket on the ground on a Sunday afternoon
Hangin' with friends or off by ourselves
Drivin' around yard sale to yard sale
Droppin' by the county fair, winnin' you a bear poppin' balloons

[Chorus]
If you're lookin' for someone to do that with, here I am
Someone to be the other half of your plans
Don't look any further than in my eyes
It you're lookin' for that man, here I am
