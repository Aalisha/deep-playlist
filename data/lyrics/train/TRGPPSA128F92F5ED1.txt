I know some days are crazy
and some days are a breeze
and some days ware you down
till it brings you to your knees
but now you've got a hero
standing in your corner
so when you're feeling less than zero
you know His love is corner

Move another mountain breach the valley wide
Blaze across your darkness like a comet in the sky
Lift you from the shadows till you're shining like a sun
His love for you will move another mountain
...
