Clash of the titans when rivers we cross
Death of an icon incredible loss
Under the banner we march in the rain
Like when you carry my urn to Ukraine

While the train is in motion
Enbalm me in lotion
And toast magic potions
I drink and I'm dead

Raise a flag on the Russian soil
Kiss the ground on a mortal coil
Slowly progress through Belarus
Cannibals cook a slavic mousse
Cosmonaut bred in Baykonur
Hail contessa hail De La Cour
Phosphorate like a beast to bait
I cremate I delegate

Clash of the titans when rivers we cross
Death of an icon incredible loss
Under the banner we march in the rain
Like when you carry my urn to Ukraine

Sacrificing a has-been
The death of a virgin
...
