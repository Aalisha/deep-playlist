I don't want to live this way no more
I don't want to fight this endless lonely war
I don't want to stand alone, without the only love I've known
And never find that ray of light we had before
I never meant to break your precious heart
And what I did can't be undone and it's tearing me apart
Far too late for promises, but if you gave us one more chance
You would see a better man worth fighting for

Love sweet love I feel your power
