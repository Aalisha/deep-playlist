[Intro]
"You again" - "Are you following me?"
"Why no, I'm stalking you"
[scratching]
From a distance I desired her
Se-secretly admired her
[scratching]
From a distance I desired her
Se-secretly admired her

[Verse 1]
I stroll through the mall
Runnin' my finger along the wall
I just left a restroom stall
Got a strange way of movin'
Strange way of dressin'
Strange way of makin' a, good first impression
Memphis only jacket, unidentified packet
Sunglasses, jeans wash was acid, newspaper in the back
I also got a dagger strapped to my leg
but who knows what I'm gonna do with that
A sick fuck without employment
Hankerin' in every single shopping center for my own enjoyment
I checkin' out a girl that's fly
She's workin' at the mack make-up counter next to Best Buy
Waitin' by the elevator, tryna look busy
So I can figure out what I'm gonna tell her later
First time I met her I didn't really bait her
I was making change as she was purchasin' a peter
I gave her money back, she gave me a look
Batted her, eyelashes that was all that it took
Now she owes me, cause it's obvious she wants me
I'm looking at you, girl I must have you

[Sample of someone talking]
Cause you're the one
