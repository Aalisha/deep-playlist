It'll never happen until you remove
Until you flatten your 10-20-30-40-15 storey halo

Bottle blondes and beach boys
Might marvel at the size
But honey something that big
You now the best don't advertise

Has no-one ever told you
You gotta body build to last?
But with that 15 storey deadstop
You're going nowhere, and fast

10-20-30-40! 15 storey halo!
10-20-30-40! 15 storeys high!
10-20-30-40! 15 storey halo
10-20-30-40? 7 miles wide
