I will praise with all I am
With every fiber of my soul
Every breath I'll ever take
Is because You've made it so
I will give You all I am
Every minute every hour
Won't You fill me with Your love
With Your strength and with Your power

O God above Your love has opened up my eyes
Now all I see is You all I see is You
