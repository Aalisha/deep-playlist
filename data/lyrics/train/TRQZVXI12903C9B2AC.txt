Eight wheels lusting for the lives of infantry. His bearings shift.
His turrets turning from accountability. He takes his aim.
We sing our final song and soon this verse is over.
He makes advances 'till his wheels cease to roll.
His God is smiling.
His God is smiling on his cold mechanic soul.
So say a prayer.
His plot is perfect if it sees no contradiction.

Disagree.

There is no sign that he shows a sign of slowing.
