At the KOC Local 313
There's a fat man standing by the soda machine
And he knows, he knows, he knows
Life can be funny

He calls the hair salon says put Loretta on
Cause the mall just called and said the last guy's gone
And I know, I know, God knows
We need the money

And he's a big red cherry
But it's hard to be merry
When the kids are all laughing
Saying hey it's Jerry Garcia
Ain't he cute?
