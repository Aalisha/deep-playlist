Once upon a time there was a happy family
There was a baby girl, a daddy and there was a mommy
Mommy had a secret, she told a little white lie
When she tucked the baby in at night, she sang her this lullaby

You got your daddy's smile, you got his eyes
I feel my heart breaking every time you cry
I'm gonna burn in hell but it's no sacrifice
Your stability is worth a million lies

I see your daddy in everything you do
And if you could talk, I'll bet you'll talk like him too
But he can't be your daddy, I hope you understand
The man who thinks he's your father is a much better man

Maybe one day, you'll end up crying on Rikki Lake
But baby it's a chance your momma's willing to take
'Cause I love you even if my heart is gonna break
Ain't no reason you should suffer for my mistake

And so I lie and baby I try and it kills me inside, yeah
