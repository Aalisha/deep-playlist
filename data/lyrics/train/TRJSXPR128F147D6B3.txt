Don't get me mad; don't tell no lie.
Don't make me sad; don't pass me by.
Baby are you holding, holding anything but me?
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter, if you know what I mean.
You can bring me love; you can hang around.
You can bring me up; don't you bring me down.
Baby are you holding, holding anything but me?
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter, if you know what I mean.

I've been searching all night, just to find what I'm looking for.
