On days like today
Grace has a way of sounding too good to be true
Could it be easy to forgive and undo?
You choose your direction, lost all connection
Slowly you're falling apart
You call it searching to find out who you are
And I still remember the hope in your eyes
Time is waiting
We were the best when we stood side by side
The bridges have not burned down
I hope you come around
And how far you fall doesn't matter at all
