Don't want your dirty eyes pointing on me! 
Don't wanna see your face tricking me another time! 
My life reached it's pinnacle
But your wet touch isn't my goal.
I fly to different skies, 
I can't stand no more your lies! 

Bridge
Another stupid soul has fallen into my trick again! 
Another pure soul will increase my reign! 
I am the rainbringer, the ruler stronger than your gof! 
And you will drown forever lost!
