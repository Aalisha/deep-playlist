There's magic in seven virgins
After you've gone through a million whores
All the longing is still for nothing
And our time gets cut short

Lead me out of despair
It never leaves my stare

Roses withering in graveyards
How useless gestures can be?
No dreams ever came from the ground
There's nothing here for you to see
