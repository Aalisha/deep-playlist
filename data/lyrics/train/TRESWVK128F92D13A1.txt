When you got a headache
A headache powder soothe the pain
When you try to rest, Lord
You feel all right again

When you got a backache
A little rubbing
Will see you through
But when you got a heartache
There ain't nothing you can do

A man can't break a stone
So he tries another lick
Iceman can't cut his ice, no
