One with the voices
Better left unheard
One with the dark side
The force that turns the earth

One of the mortal
That ignorance protects
Some unleash a future that takes foundation
In their certain death

And I'm seeing red
When I see your face
And I scorn your name

There's a vision brighter than a thousand suns
Rulers fear to face the violence
As stronger it becomes
