Do me a favor
And tell me what you think about me
Tell me how you want this to be
Go out on a limb and just
Dream
Paint a picture
Choose your colors extra wise
Especially what you put on my mind
Imagine what it'd be like to touch
The sky
(Yeah yeah!)
Whoa oh
Your thoughts are gonna pick me up.
Do you know
It's good to feel too much
Whoa
You got my head in the clouds.
Whoa
You got me thinking out loud
The more you dream about me, the more that I believe
