Sweet kind of life

Oh,
ya'all can dance to this if you want to
ya'all can step to this if you want to
ya'all can slide to this if you want to
ya'all can do whatever you want to

so, so sweet kind of life
this sweet kind of life
sweet kind of life

life is one big party when you share the wealth
wouldn't mean as much if i just spend it on myself
while my cup is running over let me give you some
life is good life oh, its something got enough for everyone - i just wanna have some fun

and take a moment, and sugarcoat it, cmon and party down

tell you what i love to live
this sweet kind of life, sweet kind of life
i'm a star and i'm shining bright
this sweet kind of life, sweet kind of life
oh, baby it feels so right
this sweet kind of life, sweet kind of life
