I can't count the barns I've past
Painted red, white and black
See Rock city
And up ahead there's a turn
Take me right through Gatlinberg
I hear it's pretty

Maybe some other time
I can't slow down
Right across that state line
Right about now

Her hair's still wet from her bath
She's sittin' on the front porch
With a glass of iced tea
In my sweat shirt and her bare feet
This I gotta see
