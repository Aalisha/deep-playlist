I look for trouble and I found it son
Straight down the barrel of a lawman's gun
I tried to run but I don't think I can
You make one move and you're a dead man friend
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?

He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
And left me reeling on a steel reel rack
They got'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this, can I baby?
