You will find that some of the most exquisite eyes
Mask the cruellest secrets
A villainess in a goddess disguise
I grew to easily distinguish your lies
Your glossy, sincere smile, always too eager to please

Everything good, everything hopeful that you ever said
An obvious falsity, another loss of innocence
The only truths you'd rarely let escape
Horrifying enough to chill even the most shadowed soul
You fucked up everybody's life you touched
How's that for an accomplishment?
Surprise! I made you this exclusive key to my closet.
Well I never asked to see your skeletons.
