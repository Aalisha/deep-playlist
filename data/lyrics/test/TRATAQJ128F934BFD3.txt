It's not my responsibility
If you say you love me
(ooooooh)
(repeat paragraph)

I know for sometime
One day I would see you
(? ) what you say
Did I get it right
Is it you and me tonight?
And you looked at me
And I knew we'd be together
(be together)
You feel it too
What can we do
(feel, what can you do)
Come on, move up to me
I wanna whisper in your ear now
(do you want me)
When I get you home
We're gonna be alone
Disconnect the phone
When we wake up
You know the room is full of sunshine
We close our eyes and make a wish

It's not my responsibility
...
