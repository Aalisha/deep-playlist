I know we're broken, I can feel the pain
Million words unspoken but your eyes say everything
You say it's over, you wanna be my friend
If I could reach inside your heart I'd make you mine again

It doesn't really matter who's wrong or right
Baby just pretend until the morning light

Let me love you tonight one more time
Maybe I can find a way to change your mind
Let me love you tonight, it's alright
I'll take what I can borrow, baby you can leave tomorrow
