Well, well, hey hey yeah now...
I got a brand-new baby and I feel so good
She loves me even better than I thought she would
I'm on my way to her house and I'm plumb out of breath
When I see her tonight, I'm gonna squeeze her to death

Claudette, pretty little pet
Claudette, never make me fret, Claudette
She's the sweetest little girl that I've ever met
Got the best love that I'll ever get from Claudette
Pretty little pet Claudette
