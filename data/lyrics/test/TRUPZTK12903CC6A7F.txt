We'll scream it loud!
This is a melody; it's time to sing it out
So give us words before we all forget!

This is where I lift my hands and say enough is enough!
So many people are broken and they're not getting up
This is our offering; this is our hope!
This is what we believe in, and we're not giving up
...
