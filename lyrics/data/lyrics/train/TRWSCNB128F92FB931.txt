Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it?
Life is a song worth singing
Why don't you sing it?

You hold the key in the palm of your hand, use it
Don't blame your life on the master plan, change it

Only you generate the power
To decide what to do with your life
You're a fool if you think you're helpless
You control what you do with your life
