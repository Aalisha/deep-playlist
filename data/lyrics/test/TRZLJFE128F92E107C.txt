O' mighty Lord of the Night. Master of beasts. Bringer of awe and derision.
Thou whose spirit lieth upon every act of oppression, hatred and strife.
Thou whose presence dwelleth in every shadow.
Thou who strengthen the power of every quietus.
Thou who sway every plague and storm.
Harkee.

Thou art the Emperor of Darkness.
Thou art the Emperor of Darkness.
Thou art the king of howling wolves.
Thou art the king of howling wolves.
Thou hath the power to force any light in wane.
Sans mercy. Sans compassion
nor will to answer whosoever asketh the why.
