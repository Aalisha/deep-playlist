I've got trials and tribulations 
Troubles all around 
My desires and expectations 
Have me lost more than I'm found 

And Lord knows I often falter 
In the smallness of my pride 
But when I kneel down at His altar 
I am lifted up inside 

'Til I stand upon that mountain 
'Til I sit beside the throne 
'Til the waters of love's fountain carry me home 
'Til I rise up from this mortal clay 
Of blood and bone 
Let the rock that was rolled away 
Be my cornerstone 

Help me face every tomorrow 
...
