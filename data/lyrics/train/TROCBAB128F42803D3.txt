Aaaaaaaa!
Oh no! Gotta get away!
Man see that girl she's pushing right there man.
Oh! Nice one! Where you make it she's been?
Plus then I can find lace that never end
She don't have heart, man, hell nah!
So don't let her rip you apart, hell nah!
She's so bad, so bad it hurts.
So if you got the chance you better splurk
Some says life's short but she don't care
Cause she's made to live a paradise like me
But she's got her hair done right
She's got her nails done right
She's so fine, a whole lot of more,
Make it high but sling me down to the floor
Play with fire get burned
So it's time to make a U-turn

Fire fire she's all in my veins
Takes me higher higher, I'm in love she's cocaine
Fire fire, fire you good
