She pays no mind to methods you employ
She wants a big city man, not a country boy
Go get your long hair cut
Scrape the mood off your boots
Wash the hell behind those eyes
Buy yourself some tailored suits
Buttermilk Boy better gain some pounds
Before she lets her knickers down
She wants a musclely man all gristle and bone
Makes no difference how you strive
She couldn't care if you're dead or alive
A burly, beefy, strong arm man
Is all she cares to meet
...
