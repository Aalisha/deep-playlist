Ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, yeah

I always like to strut my thang
Shakin' my pants to the rhythm, swing, I'm hot, ow
Do you wanna dance
Uh, you know that I'm the one who satisfies you
You know that I just can't be without you
I wouldn't even get down, we always turn the place out
So shake your pants, and we can feel that thing, ho

Feel with me, touch with me
Let them see, yes siree

Ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, yeah

I'd like it tonight
'Cause that's when my body feels just right
Don't stop me, no, no
Just watch me and I'll show you how

Be a freak, feel the groove
And we can move all night
('Cause that's when my body feels just right)
Work your body with my body
And we'll sex away till the time is right, yeah
(Just watch me and I'll show you how)

Go with the flow and I'll let you know
Just how to move
('Cause that's when my body feels just right)
Shake your pants, shake your pants
...
