Ay ma, could we talk about you hopin' the flight
No moonwalkin', good to see Gotti, they droppin' the price
Now look at miss hotty, rockin' the ice
Used to be rockin' the Nike's, now it's Prada for life

I'm in the ATL club and wit crazy hoes
Most of 'em hot, but most of 'em J.D. hoes
Ay ma, I wanna know what's poppin'
I'm tryna give you this cock from Rockland's hot man

Shorty is tryna talk too much
I might say slick shit just to toss you up
By the end of the night, I'm tryna toss you up
So fuck what you tell me

We could get it crackin' wit this bottle of Belve
Cranberry and mix, show me how you movin' them lips
I'ma show you how I move in the six, I gotta sweet top, floor to twist
We could fuck all night, 'til this young nigga bruise them hips, c'mon

I gotta get some
Shorty I ain't trippin' we could do whatever ya like
I gotta get some
We could see a movie, go to dinner by the end of the night
