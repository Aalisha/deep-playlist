Ain't it funny how the time slips away
'Cause now I'm leavin' and I wish I could stay
People wonder why they don't get a chance
They wait for music but they don't get to dance
Mmm, well now I know when my work is through
I'm gonna be with you
So goodbye
Is only for now
'Cause I'm comin' back
I swear it somehow
