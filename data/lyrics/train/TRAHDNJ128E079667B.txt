Everything's in order and filed inside my head
I know our match was made in heaven and that love is made in bed
You have my complete approval
I'll put an 'X' within your square
All the power to you, I know how much you care

I guess I'm just a slow learner, I know I know I am
Just a slow learner, I know I am Just a slow (learner)
But I know that I am...

Always telling truths and I expect the same
