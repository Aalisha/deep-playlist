Please don't mind what I'm trying
To say cause I'm, I'm being honest
When I tell you that you
You're part of the reason
I'm so set on the rest of my life
Being a part of you

You tell me what you think about being open
About being honest with yourself
'Cause things will never be the same

So I guess I'll see you, I'll see you around
I'm spinning, while falling down
Now you know why I'm begging you to stay

Don't waste time getting to the point
