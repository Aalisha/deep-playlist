Time, space all over the place
Whenever you're near me
I'm here my feelings are clear
I've never felt so sure
You've changed the way I create
I'll go wherever it takes me
Pain, tears, lead us to here
You bring me so much joy

[Chorus:]
I don't know what you do
But I stagger and fall
Trip up in my shoes when I'm walking with you
