I'd love to go to a brand new place
But recognize the sky
A brand new motion yet same old people
And thats the reason why
The colours of honey are in you're eyes
As you're life flies high
But before you know it, you've fallen
As your life flashes before you're lies

And the lights, just march, on by
And the crowd, they walk, and sigh
Yet time is slow

Feel the world on my hands
Trust insentives of a band
Cos' the weight is thick and thin
Drop it now and destroy what's in
...
