So I'm sitting on the couch holding the remote
Flipping channels, I'm a rebel
Eating a bowl of them Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
How gangsta is that? Not gangsta at all?
Aw you judging me, dogg? Please, you shop at the mall
Me, I shop at boutiques, limited quantity sneaks
Where do these quantities be? Maybe they all on my feet
But I don't get it tho, about a year ago you said my gear is wack
Nigga now my gear is dope, I guess it goes full circle like a Cheerio
'Cause you rocking what I was rocking like a year ago!
You said my chain was lame then you go and get a rope
You clown jokesters pose for poser posters
