If you love somebody enough you'll follow wherever they go
That's how I got to Memphis that's how I got to Memphis
If you love somebody enough you'll go where your heart wants to go
That's how I got to Memphis that's how I got to Memphis
I know if you'd seen her you'd tell me cause you are my friend
