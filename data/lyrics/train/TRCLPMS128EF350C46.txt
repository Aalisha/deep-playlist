Oh lover don't turn away
The futures bangin' on your door
Wont you just let it in
With teeth sinkin' in
Beggin' you to sin
The sirens sing so say it now
Before the candles out
Before the clocks tick off their arms
And our memories are sold
When hope was still afloat
Now we make love by rote

We could make it right
We'd save our souls tonight
And with a word I'd take back all the shit I've done
...
