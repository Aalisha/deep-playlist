Jeru: Yo Afu

Pugilistic linguistics, check out the mystics,
we're fantistic (You mean fantastic)
Fuck it, you'll get your ass kicked
Challenge my verbal gymnastics
(Vanacrobatics) Vocabulary calisthenics
Can't understand the mathematics are esoteric
Watch the style but also peep the lyrics, my lightning, my thunder
Way back I stomped out Her-cu-les
But now I stomp out MC's
Can't chill, because the Sun don't freeze
Heavy metal, hard like titaniam
Alchemist, I turn wax into platinum
