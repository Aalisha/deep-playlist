Take a look around
Open your eyes can you stand what you see
Without a doubt it is frightening to the bones

Use your voice as the weapon drop the words like bombs
Open your ears hear the screams now it's time to act
Use your hands to rebuild their hope

There won't be silence no more, silence no more
Take a look around
Without a doubt it is frightening to the bones
