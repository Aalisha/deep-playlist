My girls best friend she told me
She said "All your love's in vain"
Said "That girls gonna leave you"
So I sing this love refrain

That girl she's gonna walk out that door
So you better treat her right
So I'm treating her right

I ran back home to tell her
That I still ached for her touch
A man don't wanna believe none
That he hurt this woman oh so much
