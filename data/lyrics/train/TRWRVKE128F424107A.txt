Put down the phone you, 
Know it's better off that way, 
This conversation, 
Has gone stale, 

I fell sorry, Oh ever so sorry today, 
Feeling convicted but nobody's here to blame, 

Walking the line, 
Is wearing away my shoes, 
I'll stand aside as all the daggers fly across the room, 
As the night grows older the mood becomes bolder and course, 
The vultures and spies, 
Are out to build houses from straw, 
...
