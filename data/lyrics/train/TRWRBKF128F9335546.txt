The mystery of death before us...
Soon every night can bring the light, and close my eyes.
Sometimes life in here is too limited
Sometimes we don't care at all.
Sometimes...

Time will change the familiar face.
Brightest colors fade to gray
The fear is real, one winter's day brings the clarity.

I feel the time is catching up with us
How many days until its hunger is satisfied?
Leaving the final golden days
We are the last amazing grays
Hoping the young will lead the pack now.
