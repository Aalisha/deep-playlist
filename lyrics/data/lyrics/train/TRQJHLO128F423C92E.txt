Haunted in mind bear the blackest of hates
The darkness has started to rise
Evil as one in the circle within
Let the orgy of death now begin
Invertedly tied hangs the Jesus so pure
Demonic love from you all
Rape of the whore in bestial lust
A sacrifice to our lord

Do what thou wilt sacred law church of hell
Death is the realm swear the oath thou shalt kill
