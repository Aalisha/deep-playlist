So Young And Vulnerable
Told Myself
In Order To Feel The Joy
I Had To Go Through The Pain
(I) Lost Track Of Tears
I Cried Through The Years
Even Convinced Myself
That I Was The One To Blame

All The Searchin'
Left Me Broken
Had To Pick Up The Pieces
Be Sad For No Reason

Now I'm So Glad
To Be With You
Had A Breakthrough
Finally Know How It Feels

To Be Loved By Somebody
Be Loved By Somebody
To Be Loved By Somebody-Body
Be Loved By Somebody-Body
To Be Loved By Somebody
Be Loved By Somebody
To Be Loved By Somebody-Body
Be Loved By

You Make Me Say
