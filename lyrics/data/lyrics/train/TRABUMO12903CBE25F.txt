Just another lesson learned
Wear a scar, a bore repeating
Take a simple fateful turn
Opened up to stop the bleeding

Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding

Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining

Just another bick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
...
