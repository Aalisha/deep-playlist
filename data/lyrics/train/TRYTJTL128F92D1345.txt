City lights are calling - slowly coming back to life
Speeding in the fastlane - Mama let us waste no time
Devil in the doorway - selling any kind of hell
We're just coming out to play the game

We're superheroes
We are back where we belong
We never cry for pain
We're superheroes
Make a stand where we belong

Way too long I've tried to be what I could never be
