A wailing phaerytale of benighted pain from profound abyssic dreams
And from a dark, mysterious, equivocative morrow... I now take heed
I drown in the verses these pages encompass - enthralled to quicken time
But Envy she stirs 'midst sweet slumbering purrs; poised unto lesser rhymes

A decaying memory slowly fades
As I realise what game thou doth play

Through the candlelight this scripture's blight summons a mortal in spite
My enchantress falls foul unto a deeper drowse
Wherein wakening garners a serpent's bit

Choking the liars in thickets of briers
Aflame, smouldering upon the stake
Conducting the fear I have wrought in the victim's pride
I reminisce a romance not lived long
As I gaze at him in her eyes as she dies

I am the one not overcome by sorrow or fear
Bawl unto me now my Lord? my saviour and my soul
