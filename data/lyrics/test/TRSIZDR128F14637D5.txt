Well I've been lookin' after number one for too long
And it seemed that love was passing me by
So I thought I better do something about it
And that's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you
That's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you

Well a lonely man needs a marriage bureau
Where they sit you right down and you fill in a form
Would you like a blonde or a black or a blue rinse
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall
Oh no, too many questions
