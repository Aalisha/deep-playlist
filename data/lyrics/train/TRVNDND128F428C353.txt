One by one my fences fall
In your eyes I see it all
You tell me dreams
No need for talking
Its by your side
I want to walk in
I watch the sun fill up the room
The world it flowers begin to bloom
You’re moving like the world a lover could do
I need the rest of my life to get over you

Here comes heaven now before you
I was feeling lost inside
Here comes heaven now you’ve touched me
I can’t feel, I can’t breathe, I can’t love, I can’t fly.
