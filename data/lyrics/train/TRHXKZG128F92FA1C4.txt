Slowly bleeding, watch the vortex feeding
Like a swirling vulture on your face
Every hour the unseen rays devour
Your screaming eyes cry out, but they are blind

Father forgive me my sins, give me the nails,
I'll hammer them in

The road to hell is full of good intentions
Say farewell, we may never meet again
The road to hell is full of good intentions
Down the lefthand highway with no sinister regrets
