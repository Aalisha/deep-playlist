I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever, again will i trust you
I never wanted to be like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you

I'm tired of sittin' home waiting for the phone to ring
While you're out doing any and everything
And everybody sees how you're playing me
Calling me your girl

But I'm not gonna sit sround and take this foolishness
You're acting like I can't see a man and take my pick
You better play it cool
Or this game you'll lose
I'm telling you the truth

So don't you try to tell me
You've been true to me
When I can plainly see
That in your heart you're still a cheat
And I know that you're lovesick
It's not happening
So don't you come to me
Thinking I'll believe 'cause
It won't work for me

I never wanted to feel like this
I never thought you'd make mistakes like this
It never was that you
And now it's time you knew
I never ever again will i trust you
