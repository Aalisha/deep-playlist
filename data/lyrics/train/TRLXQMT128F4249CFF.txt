Don't believe those clouds in the sky,
Cause they'll be movin' on and the sun will shine,
If the world's been passin' you by,
Just reach for a star and you'll realize,

Chorus:
Got to put back all the good times that we had,
We can make it better with a little bit of Razzamatazz.

If you feel your life's in a rut,
Just come on out tonight, and we'll pull you up
...
