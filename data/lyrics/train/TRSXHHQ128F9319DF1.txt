Hey
I read one day
On the bus to Sydney
Catching public transport
Reduces pollution
Death become the outcome, brother
So does catching public diseases
Reduces your white cells, son
All that fun and games
Now you six feet under
Covered
Tears of sorrow fall of a cheek
Not just your mother
Mother
Close to your roots 
There before
Nurtred by the earth
