You can cry, cry, cry like the rain
Ocean full of tears won't drown the pain
Take all your whiskey, pour it down the drain
Ain't nothin' gonna make you feel better
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker

You can beg, beg, beg like a dog
Chase her 'round the world but she'd still be gone
She did you right once but left you all wrong
Now you're chewin' on a Dear John letter
Ooh, she's a little heartwrecker

She takes a big black ball
