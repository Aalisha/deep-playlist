Lost and found, a wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
Lost and found, a wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
And all the streets are paved tonight,
And we won't be their slaves tonight
And I ain't gonna feel bad at all, feel bad at all
Lost and found, a wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad
Lost and found, a wallet from a man, careless man, careless man
...
