Woke up at 5 a.m., put on my camouflage
Wiped off my .243 and fired up my Dodge
Headed out to my ol' deerstand back in the pines
Gonna get me a ten point buck with 11 inch tines, yeah

Settled in Hidin' from the wind, waitin, on the sun
You might end up bein' my supper if you get in the way of my gun
It's so stsill I can hear the train from ten miles away
If I'm here eight hours from now it'll be okay, yeah

CHORUS:
'Cause I'm a Backwoods Boy
Grew up on a dirt road
I'm a Backwoods Boy
...
