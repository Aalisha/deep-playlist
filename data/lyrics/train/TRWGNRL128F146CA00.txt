As I walk in you get up to leave,
You head straight for the door
Is it because what happened between us
I liked it better before

My comment really wasn't that funny
You were never polite
I recall your laughter as sweeter
I guess those things can change overnight

Forgive me, I take it back
Forgive me, I'd take it all back if I could
