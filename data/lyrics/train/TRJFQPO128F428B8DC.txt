He was one of the few true rebels, a small town bomber
Drew his final tag and ran out of sight
And he was no simple thief or dirty robber
21 years of age, he kissed the world goodnight

He said, "I'm leaving, I've seen it all
Your name is written on the wall"

Your name is written on the wall"

2 o'clock in a weak condition
Riding on his bike through the old neighborhood
Accept the truth, see the death of a vision
