Don't let her cry
Don't let that little girl cry

Bootzilla's here!
The world's only rhinestone rock star doll baba!
I wanna be your toy.
I wanna play for you
Created by Funk-A-Tech Incorporated,
Makers of funky things to play with.
Wind me up, people!
Say what the

Wind me up, wind me up
Won't you!
Simon says do this
What you to!
Simon says do that You got to pull my string
You got to pull, you got to pull my string
Rock star doll, baby.
You got to pull, you got to pull my string
Fourteen carat funk!

Wind me up!
Child, Funk AWAY! Wind me up!

I come equipped with stereophonic funk producin' disco
Inducin' twin magnetic rock receptors.
I'm perfect for bumpin', you see

Just wind me up!
Put me on your credit charge and at no extra expense
Comes this remote control unit.
Oh yeah! I'm programmable!
