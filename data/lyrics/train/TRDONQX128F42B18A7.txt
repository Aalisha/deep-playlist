This is your life, yo
You got ups and you got downs, man
You got downs and you got ups
We all go through the same thing on different days, man
Don't act like you ain't like me
What, you don't put your pants on one leg at a time

What's going on with you, playa?
Let me tell you somethin', man
I'm ready to tell you about
Your life on this one, look at here

These the things we all go through
It's everyday life for me and you
Don't feel bad, I know you feel bad

Things that happen everyday
Around the world or around your way
We just just tell a story, tell a story

Where can I start? Start at the part
Me at the part, playin' this part
Provin' this role, waitin' on old
Just got fronted at eight for that blow

Now you run the pot, watch me rock
Back on the block with a few in the sock
Doing the heavy, cops in the Chevy
Scopin' his every move already

Smooth and deadly, cool his belly
Probably get popped right in front of the deli
The ghetto to mallon, his tools was heavy
His crew was ready to do whatevy

Got juice but not tryin' to turn in the power
Ain't burnin' the pot, now you watchin' me rock
Chop, drop, swap, we cop, chop, drop, swap, we cop
Chop, stop, you pop, we cops

Swallow that working [Incomprehensible]
Only thirteen, he ain't know what it mean
But he lovin' the green the American dream

His momma says stop, his father was hot
