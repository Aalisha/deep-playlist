Camouflage!
The shadow!
We in the darkness!
The dragon snatches the pearl!

Hey man, you want a sip?
I got the cup of knowledge
Rinse but don't... spit
Ebonics, burnin, that's the shit
And that girl by the bar with the waistline
Shakin her hips (okay!)
This is the last crusade, I might
Fix your edge up when I juggle my blade (whoa!)
My hydro's hidden believes
My swordstyle's hidden believes
There's no honor with thieves
That's why you keep that Great Adventure bat up the sleeve
You know the one that fits the forearm
When the 5-0 hit the block, you walk calm
Like "I ain't do it!"
"But you've been cutting school all day!"
You're damn right I'm truant
All emcees repeat after me
Or you can catch a gasface fuckin with V
A-S-T A to the I to the R and the E
So syllable free
Therefore you ain't the King like Coretta
Man, I defeated you with eight letters
So imagine if I formed a sentence
