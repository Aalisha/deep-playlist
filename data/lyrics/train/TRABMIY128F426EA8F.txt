Sitting by the window all day thinking of you
Watching the days go by, I started to cry
But they weren't tears of sadness they only meant I love you
And I wanna tell you girl that I, oh, I

I'll travel 'round the seven seas for you
It's written in the melody I adore you
I wrote my love a symphony
To show you there's nothing I won't do

Baby I'll walk around the China Wall for you
If there's a way I'll do it all for you
Anything you want me to
You know I would do

People think I'm crazy, they say I'm just a nothing
Letting my life pass me by, believing you're with me
...
