My fingers burn in the breakdown
This part of everything behind me
I fade into off the headlights
Crushing every feeling that's in me

These walls you've built never come down
One's a crowded number when you're one
Lights flicker still in your eyes
All across the ground I own

You hear things that you can't see
Echoes on and off
Thoughts spinning out of me
...
