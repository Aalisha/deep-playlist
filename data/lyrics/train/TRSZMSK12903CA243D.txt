[coolio]
Get on up on that funk
And maybe you'll feel better
(repeat 2x)

I got the funk inside me, yes it guides me
The light in my eyes, is shinin brightly
Just give me some deep bass, a snare and a kick drum
Turn it up loud and listen to the rhythm run
Whenever i'm feelin bad, angry or upset
I grab a cassette, and pop it in the tape deck
Album or eight-track, as long as it ain't wack
Funk is addictive, but not like crack black
I'm hip to the old shit, the shit that still hit
The louisiana chicken and homemade biscuits
Is makin my feet move, it sure does feel good
My head is bouncin, cruisin through my neighborhood
But this ain't pop though, r&b or disco
Reggae or calypso, that's playin in my radio
It's that funk yes, won't settle for less
Sheeit, i must be blessed, now check it out

[w.c. and coolio]

Get on up on that funk
And maybe you'll feel better
(repeat 2x)


[w.c.]
Check it out
Now turn up your radio, eq the stereo
I'm glad that y'all could make it to rock with the maad circle
