And then, with a glistening beam of vivid light
Spring was gone and summer drew near
Pervaded our minds and our eyes were blinded with delight
For a short moment, we joined in the dance of life
And time disappeared, leaving us behind in our embrace

The air massive like lead
Too sultry to give, to give a sigh
Sheer unbearable, she lies on me
Your love to me feels so dry

The heat unable to move
...
