It's like a flood, heads rush when the doors open
The record stores stack they shelves with the most potent
With the commotion
Of a firearm shot in the air
Niggaz scramble, like mammals from the front to the rear
Son you gotta get there
Before the shit sold out
Ask your man if its dope and he like "no doubt"
This niggaz got lyrics yo a stupid amount
So many compliments I fuckin' lost count
So many continents enjoy the sound
When I'm clowning the beat
I bring the heat
Of the Cannibus and LL beef
My records leaked
So what! another one will fallow
And that's the shit that niggaz find hard to swallow
Nigga hollow like points
So they stay on the shelves
I'm so full of my self
That my shit gon sell
My soundscans, won't get me on your top 40
I'm in the laboratory
Create a category, for that
