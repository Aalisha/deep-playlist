Poke me with your talk, Ben, fuck

I'm too close to decide
Seems like the page never lied
Do you see the fiction at your front door?
This time it's not like before

Just like your shadow in public
Your secret floodlights the floor
You got too nervous and left it
And now you're looking for more

Reads just like revenge fiction
Some 40's novel re-lived
Reads just like revenge fiction
No more excuses to give
No more excuses to give
