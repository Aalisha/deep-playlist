Hey everybody wherever you are
There's a new way of talking and it's gonna go far;
You take the letters in the words,
Turn 'em all around; you say the last ones first
And you check out the sound
Talk Backwards

I know what you're thinking;
That sounds strange
You've talked forward so long that it's hard to change
But it's just like metric once you get the drift
You twist your tongue and you give your palate a lift.
You take your favorite phrase,
And you read it in the mirror,
Practice that about a half a year,
And then sdrawkcab gnikiat mi em ta kool
You're a regular talking bassackwards fool
