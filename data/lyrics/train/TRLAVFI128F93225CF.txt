I'd hate to break it to you now
But that reoccurring sound
In you ear makes it perfect
Was it clear, my whole purpose?

I'm just fine with or without
Having this inner selfish doubt
I'll fall hard
You'll fall harder
I'm along
You're so startled

Break a sweat, desperate lover
Do you feel all alone?

I fell asleep on your deathbed
In a hole where your head rests
I'm facing truth so unfamiliar
I just close my eyes and

Fall asleep on your deathbed
...
