This is the ending of an age, the closing of a chapter that
Was just beginning...
Battered senseless, this is not what you deserve
Stripped and left defenseless, this is not what you deserve
Stabbed and left to die, all alone forsaken
Life palns gone awry, precious life blood taken
And your dignity is gone
You thought you had found something that was stable
...
