All night drive from Cafalonia, the sun at our backs
There's change in the cracks from my pocket in the cushion in then benches of the van
Hey Ian, who's this band
You keep playing on the iPod, I nod in out of sleep to the rhythm of the beat
Awaken to laughter and war stories, turn down the radio

I wanna talk about adventure and where we been
New York and SF with DTM
Triple Rock, getting lost, google maps
Home? Remind me why I'm coming back

Swing Ding in Tuscan, I sing along, I don't speak Spanish but I know the song
I need a Red Bull and the Arrivals on
Hey Eric is generic okay? Like the Pine Hill Hantis say we're living on a dollar a day
