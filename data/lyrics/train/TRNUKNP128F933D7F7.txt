Mmm... Hmm... Mmm...
You can take away all my love, what do I need it for?
You can take away all these words, there's no meaning anymore
You can take away everything, leave me lying on the floor
All those sorry's, we can't go back to the start

You can't fix me, I'm torn apart
I wanna run away from love, this time I have had enough
Every time I feel your touch I'm broken
Shattered all the pieces and parts, never thought I'd fall so hard

I'm putting back together my heart, it's broken
...
