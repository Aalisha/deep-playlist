Yeah, Yeah, yeah

Sitting here alone
Thinking it through
Trying to convince myself
That I'm not losing you
Why can't you just forget the things I said
I was angry at that time
But now I've cleared my head

It was so strong
Where did it all go wrong

So tell me why
I'm swimming against the tide
I'm praying for a lifeline
Cos I'm losing you
So tell me why
You don't care enough to try
