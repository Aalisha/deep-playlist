Ain't no rules when you're at the top
Money talks but it's all you got
Sell your soul for wealth and fame
And you can never buy it back again
They pay a lot to keep you free
But you're guilty of impunity
A million fans look up to you
And you can get away with murder, too

Too bad you really couldn't play
And you got nothing to say
