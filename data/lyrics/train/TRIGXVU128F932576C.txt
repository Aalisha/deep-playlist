Sarah has her dreams and makes her plans
To get what she wants when she can
A little bit of heaven was all she asked for
In those silent moments deep in the night
She'd find herself make it feel all right
Hungers for the bright life and something more

With her young heart so gently beating
A secret rendezvous lovers meeting
Out in the night, out in the night night night night
Played on the radio, heard on the news
Baby's gone lost they found her shoes
You can turn out the light
You better turn out the light
