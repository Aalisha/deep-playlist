Give me one more chance
And you'll be satisfied
Give me two more chances
And you won't be denied

Well my heart is where it's always been
My head is somewhere in between
Give me one more chance
Let me be your lover tonight

(Check it out)

You're the real thing
Yeah the real thing
You're the real thing
Even better than the real thing
