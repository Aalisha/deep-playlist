a perfect world to spend your money in
a perfect girl to spend it on
a promise to the working man that defies all reason
a brother you had best believe
who will always drag you down
a losing card, in a winning hand

It's too late to change your mind

and you decide to walk on home again
a fallen soul or broken man
a promise to an also-ran that defies all reason
...
