Yeah
All alone, I must stand
Even when I'm running
And it feels like a dream
I need to awaken from

I believe, when it hurts
 (Ooo)
We must keep on trying
But I want and I need
 (But I want)
(And I need)
Like a river needs the rain

There's a bridge I need to burn before I leave
 (Breathe again)
I just wanna breathe again
Like a summer's day I need to feel the heat again
 (Summer's day)

I only wanna keep the stone from rollin'
I only wanna learn to feel the rain
Then maybe I could stop the leaves from fallin'
I only wanna learn to freeze the flame
I know I'll be alive again
I wanna be alive again

Here's the night, where's the stars
'Cause I need some guiding
...
