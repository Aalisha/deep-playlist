Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
 (Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
 (Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
 (Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
 (Dum dum)

Aiyo peep it, can you keep it down while I rock
Tick tock about this chick around the block?
She was high host, to the most hostess, no boastin'
Back in '85, she was live, yo no jokin'

A real go-getter, didn't try and sweat her
Fifteen years old and she was pushin' a jetter
She had loot, moms and pops dukes had the bankin'
She walked around school and the stunt would act stankin'
Bitch, young Miss, only dated older fellas
My slang couldn't hang, no thang, I wasn't jealous of her

Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
 (Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
 (Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
 (Diddy diddy dum dum)
Dum dum dilly dee dum dum
 (Dum dum)

Oh yeah, where was I? Bustin', now I'm ready
Now it's '87 and Miss Thing is goin' steady
She was schoolin', chillin' 'cos her man was makin' papers
Tellin all her friends that these niggas caught the vapors
