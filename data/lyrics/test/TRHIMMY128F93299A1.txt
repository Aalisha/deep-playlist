You're the boss and from you, we learn
You're the boss and from you, we learn
We stay quiet in your presence... We can't talk
We stay quiet in your presence... We can't talk

And whoever leaves you doesn't understand, he'll regret one day
And whoever leaves you doesn't understand, he'll regret one day

And don't listen to who deceives you, you're the boss
And don't listen to who deceives you, you're the boss

You're the boss and from you, we learn
You're the boss and from you, we learn
...
