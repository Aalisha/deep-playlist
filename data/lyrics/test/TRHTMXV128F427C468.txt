[Intro:]
...yea this some personal shit here nigga!
I'ma take it there...

[Hook:]
You can kiss her, You can hug her
You can tell her that you love her to her face bro'
But that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg
Said, that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg

You can lick her, You can stick her
You can give it to her right all nite bro'
But that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg
Said, that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg

You can like her you can wife her
You can get married and fight her all nite bro'
But that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg
Said, that bitch ain't yo bitch dawg

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
