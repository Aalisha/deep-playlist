It's almost night
The clouds are streaked with violet
And the moon is bright
Banish your innocence

There is no breeze
Disquiet lurks in silence
By this place of power
Your sins must escalate

What has come before
And recurs perpetually
Is on it's way
Cherish each atrocity

Woodland dark surroundings
Ill lit by twin beacons
A black car approaches
With two men inside it

With the right temptation
...
