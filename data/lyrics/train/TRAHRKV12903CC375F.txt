Yeah, oh yeah
Mmm, oh yeah
Mmm, alright
Oh you got me
Living on the front line
Oh you got me mama
Living on the front line
Oh mama
You gonna mourn me in the wrong time
Oh you got me mama
You gonna mourn me on the front line
They got me living on top of my existence
Oh appreciating my resistance
Oh mama, mama you got me
Living on the front line
Oh mama, mama you got me
Living on the front line
I said yeah, yeah, oh yeah
I said yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Oh what kind of man could I be
If I can't talk about what I see
Oh they tell me do beware
Take your little money and go
Me, no want no dirty money
No, me, no want no dirty money
Oh mama, mama you got me
Living on the front line
