We run in circles
That never connect at the same time
Heaven help the lonely ones
As another day older we get, and here we go
Spending our money
Filling the house with things we hope
Will bring us happiness again
And then we cover empty hearts up
With a full smile that has no joy
Lying for love, were dying for more
Well you can have anything these days Im sure

Making your mind up
It never did anyone no good
For how do you touch what you cant have
You cover the hurt
Pretend you dont care
Its living I guess but it hardly compares

Gimme some time
Lend me a hand
Reach into the dark and youll understand
Only the lonely know
Would you go anywhere
