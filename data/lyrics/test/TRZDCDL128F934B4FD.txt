At the jaws of death I am my own prey
Rely on a needle fare, a twisted mind insane
No sun to announce tomorrow
Nocturnal of one kind, hallucinated mind
It's a godless fucking ride

No control to save the day, there's no light to follow
I interrelate
Damage done
To kill the rage I embrace the sorrow
I hellucinate

Schizophrenic mental warfare
Abusive suicide
