You were my sun, You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say, what you did, I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be.And don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me, Why did you leave me, all alone?
Now you tell me you need me.When you call me, on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy

Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn To cry
Cry me a river.Cry me a river-er
Cry me a river.Cry me a river-er yeah yeah
I know that they say That some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it(Don't act like you don't know it)
And all of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head(Messing with my head)
