Written by John R. Cash

Hey Porter, hey Porter, would you tell me the time
How much longer will it be 'til we cross that Mason-Dixon line
When we hit Dixie would you tell that engineer to ring his bell
And ask everybody that ain't asleep to stand right up and yell
Hey Porter, hey Porter, what time did you say
How much longer will it be 'til I can see the light of day
When we hit Dixie would you tell that engineer to slow it down
Better still just stop the train 'cause I'd like to look around
