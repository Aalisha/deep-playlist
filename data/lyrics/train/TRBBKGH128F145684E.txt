I've been searching for someone
But never looked before my eyes
There you were to my surprise
It was so obvious looking into your face
After playing a game of truth or dare
I wanted to stay at your place
I never thought that I
Would fall in love with you
But since the day we kissed
I knew it had to be you
I never thought that we would be together
I can't believe I just made love to you
After all the things that we've been through
Now what are we gonna do

Chorus:
Monday, a friend of mine
Tuesday, we played a game
Wednesday, you went away
Thursday, things weren't the same
On Friday, you came back
...
