Oh, I have lived for ages I'm a thousand turns of tides
I'm a thousand wakes of springtime and thousand infant cries

When they plowed in the pastures, oh the mighty heart will sing
Oh, the mighty heart will sing

But I'll always be blamed for the sun going down with us all
But I'm the light in the middle of every man's fall
