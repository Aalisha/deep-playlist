I was lost, I was desperate and broken
Wounded heart and the wounds were still open
That's the way You found me
That's the way You found me

Turn the page by Your hand
Yesterday washed away as You write in the sand
My accusers, where are they?
One by one in the silence they all walk away

And I will worship You for all that You are
And all You've done for me
As long as I live I'll sing
I'll sing redemption's song
...
