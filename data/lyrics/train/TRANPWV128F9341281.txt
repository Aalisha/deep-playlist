Inflict the seed ov Even upon me
The heritage ov Cain can't be undone

Into rivers ov purgatory
For such is a consequence

Abortion ov god in my leprous womb

Soiled with the miasma ov the bleakest hemisphere
The formless fires ov Amenti unfold
Not nearly as frenzy as discordia that breeds within
Not nearly as frenzy as disorder that I bring
Universe in drained
