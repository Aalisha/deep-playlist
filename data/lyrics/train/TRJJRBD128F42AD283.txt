Chillin' in the club in my b-boy stance
My hoodie on with my gun in my pants

Yeah, okay
I'm ready to get my drink on, on this one
Let's go

Chillin' in the club in my b-boy stance
My hoodie on with my gun in my pants
I'm fresh yes, I'm fresh yes
I'm fresh yes, I'm fresh yes

I said I'm chillin' in the club in my b-boy stance
My hoodie on with my gun in my pants
I'm fresh yes, I'm fresh yes
I'm fresh yes, I'm fresh yes

I'm fresh to death, dressed to impress
Fresh for real, nigga dressed to kill
I'm the best for real, I was blessed with skill
The FS in my necklace still

I'm a threat for real, I come at niggaz necks for real
Tryin' build my success got me stressed for real
I'ma gain my respect 'cause I'm extra real
And I'm extra fly, you just extra high

If it wasn't for them drugs, you'd be extra shy
Knowin' if I throw them slugs you gon' testify
F' the extra shit, get an extra clip
I get some extra lip, just expect to die

I'll put a whole in your head, 'cause I hold bread
And my lawyer Johnny Cochran old head
Clappin' a pound, he ain't pattin' me down
And I stay strapped man I got my gat on me now

I'm just chillin' in the club in my b-boy stance
My hoodie on with my gun in my pants
