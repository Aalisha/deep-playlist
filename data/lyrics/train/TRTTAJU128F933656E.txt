Harvey PJ
Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea
The Whores Hustle And The Hustlers Whore
Speak to me of
Universal laws
The whores hustle and the hustlers whore
All around me
People bleed
Speak to me
Your song of greed

Speak to me
Of you inner charm
Of how you'll keep me
Safe from harm
I don't think so
I don't see
Speak to me
Of your inner peace
