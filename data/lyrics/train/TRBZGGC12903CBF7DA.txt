Listen everybody
especially you boys
it is right to be left alone
when the one you love is never home

I love too hard
my friends sometimes say
but I believe I believe
that a man should be loved that way
but it hurts me so inside
to see him treat me so unkind

Somebody somewhere
tell him it's unfair
