I hear the sound of bells & sirens 
Wired alarmed & face to face 
Intruded in exclusion zone 
Looking for a sleeping place 
Locks & clocks & iron bars 
Barking dogs, securicars 
Electric lights & concrete grass 
Getting scared to even ask

Somewhere to go -- Without being arrested 
Somewhere to go -- Without being scared 
Somewhere to go -- Without being questioned 
Somewhere to go -- Where somebody cares

Put on screen to serve the public 
Here's the problem now drop the subject 
Asked some questions un-requested
