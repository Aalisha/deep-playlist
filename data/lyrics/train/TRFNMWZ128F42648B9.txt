Steam from a summer raindrop
Rising off the blacktop
I wipe the sweat from my brow
Steam from my radiator
I'm late and getting later
Should be at your place by now

Bank sign says a hundred and two
But that ain't nothin' when I'm next to you

There's fire in your fingertips
Flames in your touch
Desire in your burnin' lips
Can't get enough
Today was a scorcher
But I'll go you one better
Tonight when we get together
...
