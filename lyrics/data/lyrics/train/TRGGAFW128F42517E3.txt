I'm working hard at breaking down evenly
The sun will set soon enough eventually
So why did we breathe if not to bother
Close to selling out fully and completely

And I know this will come down
I wish that it weren't so
There's always a let down
This is what I know

I know this will come down
I wish that it weren't so
May be heavy
This is what I know
This is what I know
This is what I know
This is what I know
