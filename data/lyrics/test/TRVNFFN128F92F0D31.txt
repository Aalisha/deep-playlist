Don't hang up
Cause I've got some things to say
You can't stay in this forever
Living for your yesterday
You know that I told you
I've always been for you
Stop and think about it
Don't hang up
You don't need to be alone
I only wanna be there for you

Come around this time
I don't wanna be the last to know
Come around this time
