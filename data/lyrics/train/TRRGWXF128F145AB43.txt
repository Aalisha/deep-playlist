Here I am
I want you to know that I understand
What it is you're giving me

I've got it all brand new

Here we are
Put up a show of hands
But I've got the feeling that
They don't know what they're gonna do

We don't live there no more
We've got the room on the second floor
Oh, we don't live there no more

Stay with me heartache so I can keep it right
Another day with the heartache
You know I can't stand the night
