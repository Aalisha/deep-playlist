I will rock you like a baby, Lover,
Cradled in my arms,
I will keep you safe from danger,
Shelter you from harm...
There will never be another lover,
Who treats you like I do,
We can drift into forever,
On a love that's made for two...

Don't you ever say this loves not special,
Don't you ever think its not essential... Baby...

I was only thinking of you,
Hoping you were thinking of me,
Two hearts beating just like one,
Against the world... Baby...
I am always dreaming of you,
Hoping you are dreaming of me,
I could never live,
One day without your love...
...
