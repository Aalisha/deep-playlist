We fake it all & make it real
We sign the line and break the deal
We take it all and give it back
We talk of peace and then attack
Start a war and then retreat
Win the game and then get beat
Break on out and then get stuck
We keep on fucking it all up

Like it, hate it, leave it, take it x4
What we've got is what you're getting
