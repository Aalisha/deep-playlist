I dreamed about a reefer 5 feet long
Mighty miff and not too strong
You'll be high but not for long
If you a viper

I am the queen of everything
I got to be high before I can swing
Light a tea and let it be
If you a viper

Then your throat gets dry
You know you're high
Everything is dandy
Bust on down to the corner store
...
