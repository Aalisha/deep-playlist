Every morning as I wake to another day
I bow my head hit my knees and I begin to pray
I search for answers that I wonder if I'll ever find
Running circles in the mazes deep inside my mind
You always take me to a higher level
Show me something that's deep inside
You show me things I never knew

You push me you pull me

You set my soul on fire
You take me so much higher
Higher again
Thank you for it all
