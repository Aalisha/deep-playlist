Ain't no man to be found
I know you ain't b.s.'in
so just remember that i'm hip to the lip
before you ask any question
i ain't no young silly girl
so move out of your hard-rappin world
you're gonna be downright shame*
if i found out you're playin any games

make me believe in you (make me believe in you)
show me your love can be true (show me your love can be true)
anything you want me to do (anything you want i'll do it)
just make me believe in you (make me believe in you)

I can't deal with temptation
you know it leaves me with no inspiration
another man playing on me
may have a hard time succeeding you see (you don't seem to be)
you don't seem quite like the others
