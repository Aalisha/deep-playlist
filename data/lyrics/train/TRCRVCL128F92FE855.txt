Which came first, the love or the love song?
Which is more important in the long run?
Do you really wanna talk about it?
Take it to the back veranda
Have a drink and talk around it

In the end it doesn't matter
In the end we all go home
I thought about it for a minute
Music's in the kiss we hold

Which came first, the love or the love song?
I'm sorry, I guess I was wrong
Let us find a tune without a sound
Find a place that no one's found
...
