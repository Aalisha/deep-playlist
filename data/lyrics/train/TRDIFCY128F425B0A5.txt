Once I had a fortune ridin' on the shoe
Of a field goal kicker from LSU
I never broke a sweat
Hell it was just a bet

Now I've climbed mountains
And jumped from planes
Even played chicken with a couple trains
Lord, I've been a fool
Still I kept my cool

I don't mind admitting this heart of mine starts to pound
Thinkin' 'bout

The day my son starts asking me
All about my history
The things I don't want him to know
The sex, the drugs, the Rock N' Roll
...
