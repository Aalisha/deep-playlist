I wake up every day between two and three
I roll out of bed between three and four
I stare in the mirror from four and five
I wake up every day between two and three
I roll out of bed between three and four
I stare in the mirror from four and five
And from five to five-thirty
I thank god I'm alive

I put on my lipstick, my make-up, my hair up
Eye shadow and blush, tease my hair with a brush
I spray my perfume from head to toe
Grab my purse and sunglasses, and I'm ready to go

And you might think I'm crazy
But you don't even know me
And if you think I'm crazy
Well then I'm crazy, well then I'm crazy

But I'm doin' it my way, I'm doin' it my way
My way, my way, my way, my way
...
