Love serenade,
Soothe me with the morning sun.
Help me find someone,
Peaceful and non-judgemental.
Holdin' me back,
And make me feel whole with life.
And stay the same.
Life.
Without the pain.

Why must we dream in metaphors?
Try to hold on to something we couldn't understand.
Couldn't understand.
And why must we argue loudly?
When peace is our one salvation.
I couldn't understand
Couldn't understand
Yea...

Ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh
Ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh, ohh ohh

Someone lost their faith in, seeking God so they.
...Someone lost their faith in seeking God so they...

Turn to the needle, back to the cradle. They were...
...Turn to the needle... ...back to the cradle...

Rocking it all too long.
