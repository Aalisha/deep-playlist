Don't ask what am I gonna do
'Cause it hasn't even started sinking in
Need time, time to think it through
How am I supposed to know where I begin?

Suddenly, I'm alone here
Loving me isn't in your plans
Since yesterday, you were mine
And my heart was in your hands

Could've fooled me
Turned out I was wrong
You knew all along
That one day you'd be leaving

Could've fooled me
I was so secure
Confident and sure we were meant to be
You could've fooled me

So sad, I'm the last to know
...
