empty a clip to ease my pain
all I have is hate for everything
I'll clinch my fist if you insist
show you every reason I exist
apologies up front?
yeah right we fight to let it out, blow
I want it right now, revengence is a must
I'm about to bust well that's fucking tough
I see you blow me off, I've had e-fucking-nough
Of this pain and this bullshit
cause that's just what it is
I'm getting fucking pissed
nothin ever seems to go my way never, ever, ever, ever
I'd rather sit and suffer than accept these games you play
stuck I feel as though I'm fucked
shit out of fucking luck
but I guess I'll deal with it fine whatever, nevermind
you must be fucking blind if you can't see it's killing me
