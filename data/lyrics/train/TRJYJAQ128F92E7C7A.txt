help me, these kids have escaped the life i condemned them to live
i am the law of the youth i'm armed to control not protect
childhood's spent in school to teach them the ways of the world
then send them to work and to war cause this system's what they reject
i feed them my morals to live to live for the state and the organized church
anyone who thinks for them self is different and doesn't belong
these kids are rebellious and now they need to be stopped right away
they have no respect for the and their will to live is too strong
fuck you you bastards
