[Termanology:]
Yeah, my 22 long years y'all, 22 long
[Termanology:]
Age 1 almost died, age 2 in the ghetto
Age 3 seen a nigga get popped by the metal
Age 4, just the same as 5
Trying to dry mami eyes
Can't forget about 6
That's when crack hit
My city extra hard, my aunty extra hard (uhuh)
And these extra bars, hit me extra hard (damn)
Can't forget about pops, he was out that year (uhuh)
Had no santa, he was out that year (no santa)
Had no plan of being out that year
Just happened he was out that year
Gods plan, damn
And age 7 ain't get much better
My sister here, but we get less chetter
So how that work like
Age 8 (Age 8), 8 apartment (8 apartment)
Never knew that I'd be selling eights
Just wait
Age 9 (Age 9), just starting to get my grind on
Plus I get my rhyme on
[Chorus: Termanology]
I swear we'll make it outta here
Mama, it's been 20 long years
We been going through our ups and downs
