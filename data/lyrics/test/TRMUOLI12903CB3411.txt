Hy-Tone, Hy-Tone

All the fellas call my baby, Hy-Tone Hy-Tone
They all think she's always acting, Hy-Tone Hy-Tone
Sweet sixteen, doesn't wear jeans
Walks around the campus
Like a high school queen
That's why all the fellas think she's, Ty-Tone

But when I'm the only one around
She lets her hair down
She's just-a boppin', baby
An a crazy little clown

She may be shy
