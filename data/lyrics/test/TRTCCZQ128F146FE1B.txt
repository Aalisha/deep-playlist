I had a dream we went away,
Left this city for a day,
You took me southwards on a plane,
And showed me Spain or somewhere.
But in reality you're,
Not so keen to show me anything,
And I thought you liked me.

Hey show some love,
You ain't so tough,
Come fill my little world,
Right up,
Right up.

Someday you're going to realise.
(I want you to) To fill my little world,
Right up,
Right up,
Right up.

So what you gonna to do with all this stuff,
Pilling up, filling up, taking up. (My little ...)
You misunderstand me,
All I wanted was some evidence,
That you really like me. (You really liked me)
