Have you ever felt the scars
Touched the wounds of a slaughtered heart?
I greet you to my world, come join me, I hope you'll learn
As your emotions burn
There's nothing more to say, don't walk my path, just turn away
So wipe that smile my friend, this is my life in vain
In a race towards time
I'd drink the world to drown the pain living in me
...
