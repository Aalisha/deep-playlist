[Andi Deris]

It's the night I'll be with you
Lovely to see you, lovely to hear you
You're TV-acting pulls me through
Side by side I dreamt to be with you
It's been a long time that you've been gone
I wanted for you longing to tell you
I have missed you for so long
Side by side I dreamt to be with you
Only with you

Looks like one step into paradise
Silver screen lights in my eyes
One step into paradise
