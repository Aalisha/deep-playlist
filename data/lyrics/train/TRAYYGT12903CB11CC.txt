Nothing has changed!

I see fountains of blood
Devastation birthed of greed
Billowing sails beget a cycle of genocide
The soil is cursed, the souls suffer plague
A grim reminder of an earlier age
At what price do we acquire?

At what price do we acquire?

I see bodies swinging in the wind
Faces bloated and bruised
Burning crosses brand terror into
The heart of a race, the soul of a nation
...
