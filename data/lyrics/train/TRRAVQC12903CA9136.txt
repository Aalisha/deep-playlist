All the maps on the wall
Are held there with pins
to show where we've been.
A box of our memories
Are back by the door
The end of a war.
As I watch you sleep
Your hand still reaches for mine

You are so beautiful
You are...

I want you to know
I won't let it go
I won't let it sleep
Anyday of the week
I should not talk
But I would like to say
I want you to know
I want you to stay.
here
