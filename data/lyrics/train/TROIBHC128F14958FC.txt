Poison
Poison, uh

Girl I must warn you
I sense something strange in my mind
Situation is serious
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time
It's all so beautiful
Relationships they seem from the start
It's all so deadly
When love is not together from the heart, yeah

But it's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her

That girl is poison, ooh
Never trust a big butt and smile
