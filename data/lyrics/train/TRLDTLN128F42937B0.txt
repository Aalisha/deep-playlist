Your love was reckless baby I fell deep
Easy to hold but you were hard to keep
You were a heartache waiting to be
We took off flying down a dead end street

I never knew that love could hurt so bad
When you said goodbye with a tip of your hat
I watched you leaving across the welcome mat
And though I know that you ain't coming back

One solitary tear is all I'll cry
One solitary tear falling, falling,
