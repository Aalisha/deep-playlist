Get a life, get a grip
Get away somewhere, take a trip
Take a break, take control

Take advice from someone you know, oh
Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
Come on over, come on in

You can unwind, take a load off your mind
Make a wish, make a move
Make up your mind, you can choose
When you're up, when you're down

When you need a laugh come around, oh
Come on over, come on in
Pull up a seat, take a load off your feet
...
