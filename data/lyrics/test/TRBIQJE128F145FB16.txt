Ow, she's a brickhouse
She's mighty mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
Ow, she's a brickhouse
Ah, like lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back
Ow, she's a brickhouse
Well, we're together everybody knows
This is how the story goes

She knows she's got everything
That a woman needs to get a man, yeah yeah
How can she lose with what she use
36-24-36, ow, what a winning hand

Ow, she's a brickhouse
She's mighty mighty, just lettin' it all hang out
Aye, she's a brickhouse
Ow, like lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back
Ow, she's a brickhouse
