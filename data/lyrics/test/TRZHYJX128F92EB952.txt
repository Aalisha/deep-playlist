Every time I think of you
I feel a shot right through into a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine but it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind

The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
And every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
