One small blind guy
Watches the other...

I'm looking for you
For it stops at you
What you said is the same thing teacher says
Down on the creek bed
In the big water
See me hide the pearls up your dress

Night crawler, midnight caller
Should've been me, baby don't look down
It should've been me
Night crawler, tightrope walker
Should've been me, baby don't look down
It should've been me
