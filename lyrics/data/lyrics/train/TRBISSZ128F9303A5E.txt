I've seen the shadows fall
Colors that fade on my wall
Dressed up nowhere to go
It's all in my mind I know

But it's alright now
We're on our way

Lay me down in the moonlight
So close to you
(So close to you)
Maybe we're just dreamers
Some dreams come true

Lips move but not a sound
When the words fall to the ground
Ooh, eyes watch but seldom see
The possibilities

But it's alright now
We're on our way
...
