(Murray on lead, w/ others doing supporting harmonies)
Now all of the planes have landed
And the soldiers are in their beds
Smoke rises from their clothing
And sweet dreams through their heads

Truth faced leaves a strange taste
When joy and sadness meet
A country rain on a city street
This life is bittersweet

The boy with the bloated belly
Hears today's trucks arrive
...
