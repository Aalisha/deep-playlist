Day after day, another minute sold
Day after day, feel the bite from the wind and the cold
Seems fair enough, an even trade
Your time stolen for a minimum wage

Night after night, with an end in sight
Night after night, just in time for the death of the light
The greatest times you've ever known
Never scared, never go it alone
Night after night, this feeling never grows older
Know you could do this over and over and

Hey World, you'll break me
Bring it on, give me your best shot
Hey World, you'll never break me
Try your hardest, try your hardest

Day after day, keeping you awake
