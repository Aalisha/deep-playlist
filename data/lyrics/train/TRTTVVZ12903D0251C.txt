Ambulance, sirron spinning
The street is blocked on eather side
A crowed that lingers looking in
Field mullisha
Colt bolt blue
Broken glass on top of streets
Through tv camaras straight to you

And Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
The world is spinning out of control
And Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
The world is spinning out of control
...
