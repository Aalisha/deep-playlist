I want you to know
That I'm thinking about you now
Time passes so slow
I remember goodbye and the tears in your eyes, but
Who's to say why we stay with another
Counting days till we're holding each other
I can hear your words, the sighs I heard still ring in my ears
I can close my eyes and feel you beside me
While I hope and pray to find a way to hold you somehow
I'm just loving you without you now
I want you to know
That your face is all I can see
