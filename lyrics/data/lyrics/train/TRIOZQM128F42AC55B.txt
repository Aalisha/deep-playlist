Woke up in the middle of the night and saw you sleepin'
I was hopin' you were dreamin' about me
Kissed your cheek and said "I love you"
You reached for me and then you mumbled
"I love you too, is everything ok?"

I said I'm fine baby, go back to sleep
I've just been thinkin' life is changin' 'round us
And I hope you believe

I'll still be me
Just a normal girl from small town nowhere
I'll still hold your hand and wear this ring
I'll still be me
If you can count on one thing, I'll be here
The same girl that you've known for centuries
...
