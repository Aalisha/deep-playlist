for you
i would tattoo me
with lines crossing into a hand
and a heart that would never bleed
with the twilight
and the horse drawn on my arm
standing for an addiction
pray we go unharmed

here is my love and anger
you see now
these are my gods
these are my scars
here is my love and anger
well these arms are burning
but they're open wide

some things
i hold too tightly
some things
i'll never
...
