Rumor has it that there's been a job botched
That the ball's been dropped by hands made of blocks
Blame bounces back and forth like a shuttlecock
But give it back to me and it gets ill got

Oh no, you must be mistaken
I abhor your tortures but there will be no confessions from me
My lips are locked like vaults
Well you can call me San Andreas but it's not my fault

I heard the rumor had a rendezvous
Well, yes, it came on by my place but it passed right through
I've made mistake before, yes, I must be fair
...
