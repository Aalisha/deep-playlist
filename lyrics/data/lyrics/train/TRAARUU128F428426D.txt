Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby baby, b-b-baby baby, baby
Baby baby baby
Come back, baby, I wanna play house with you

Well, you may go to college
You may go to school
You may have a pink Cadillac
But don't you be nobody's fool

Now baby
Come back, baby, come
Come back, baby, come
Come back, baby
I wanna play house with you

Now listen and I'll tell you baby
What I'm talkin' about
...
