Now I know so consider yourself told
You fall for two women you'r living a joke
This will be my coming down
The final curtain, the final frown

'Cause that ain't love, no that's a lie
I know this baby I won't deny
The cold inside, the cold is good
And I know, I shouldn't go down

Cherry Lane, I walk down that street again
Cherry Lane, I walk down that street again
I know I won't give it up this time
I've been walking down a thin, thin line
