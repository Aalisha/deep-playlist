Living in the present tense
When you lose the past
The future makes no sense

Living in the present tense
When there's nothing to blame
No victim of consequence
Living in the present tense

Crawling out
Secure and confident
Imbued with innocence
Ready for the world

Suddenly
The view was more intense
Living in a different
Kind of world

You're living
Living in the present tense
When you lose the past
