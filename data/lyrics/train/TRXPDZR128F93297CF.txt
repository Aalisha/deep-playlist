I’m pleased to meet you boys, you know it’s been a while
Since I have had to fake delight just to raise a smile
You’re squeezing hands and squeezing hits as good as anyone
And everybody’s numb

And the sun’s been slowly setting on your golden age
And you’ll recheck the figures but you’ll skip the page
Where the one thing that won’t fit into your final sum
Is everybody’s numb
Yeah, everybody’s numb
