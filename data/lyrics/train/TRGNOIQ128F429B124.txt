[spoken:]
this the oldest story in the book... he desires the one thing he cannot have...

my darling queen, I lay myself at your feet
and I shall stay the hands of fate

wind cries out, heavens boil above voicing discontent to my sins
I have found the way to trick the ferryman
I have deceived the ancient Gods

cold flesh lends to me its secrets for a price too high
I shudder at what I have done
...
