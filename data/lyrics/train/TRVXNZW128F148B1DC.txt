No rain but I felt the thunder
You came and my ship went under
With a white light shattering the night
As you smiled like you do
I could take evasive action
But I need the satisfaction
And I know, oh
I could learn a lot
From someone like you
Who knows what will happen
I'll keep my fingers crossed and
Hope for some reaction
Here it goes, it's chemistry tonight

My eyes are open
All the electricity seems right
I can feel a change in me
It's chemistry tonight
I know that I'm onto something special
Writing on the wall in neonlight
Telling me it's got to be
It's chemistry tonight

You turn and you look
Right through me
