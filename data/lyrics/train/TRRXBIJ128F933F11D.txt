Even tho' you took the sunshine out of my heaven
Even tho' you took the twinkle out of my eyes
I will always be in love with you my darling
Even tho' I sit and wonder if I'm wise

Since the day that you first told me that you love me
I have been head over heels in love with you
Now you say our little romance has to end dear
