Won't you look into my world
What do you see
Can't you free the chains
Or do you hold the key
When you reach the end
The corners of your mind
What will you be what will you find
Will you find the answers
To the questions that you ask of me
Will you find your answers or will you
Find out that you weren't meant to be

He floats through the air free as a bird on a wing
A bat out of hell
Just waiting for someone to sting
...
