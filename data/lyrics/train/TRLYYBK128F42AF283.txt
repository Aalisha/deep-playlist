Old Tuck was a cowboy I knew years ago
Could put a stretch in a story like a forty foot row
Young an' wide eyed, I believed every word
As he rambled through the canyons an' stampeded herds
Swore there were still Comanches in them breaks to the south
He'd seen good hands ride in there an' never rode out

He had a horse he called Dollar that twice saved his life
He lost him to Jim Shoulders playin' poker one night
When I turned eighteen, I packed up an' left home
Tuck was pretty old back then an' by now he's long gone

But I've heard it said that ol' cowboys don't die
