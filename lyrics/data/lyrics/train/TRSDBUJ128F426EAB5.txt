You've been in love with her
And went away and broke your heart
Darling, dry your eyes, I realize
That you have got to make a new start

'Cause your baby's gone and left you
And you're making it hard
It's an uphill climb to the bottom
When your love has gone
When your love has gone

Some relationships produce anew
Something about your heart
