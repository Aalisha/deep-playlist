Marching on the land of the enemy
Extents paved with corpses
Mirrors of their own fate
Atmosphere of cadaverous smell
Stench of rotten flesh
sounds of the menacing abyss
Scenery of scathing brutality
Nothing left than the
Souls of the damned

I found myself
In this morgue of war
Hidden in the ruins of
Generations' passion
To be witness
Of the senseless butchery
Dead soul staring
Through the eyes of the dulled
...
