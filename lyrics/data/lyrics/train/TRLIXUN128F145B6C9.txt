Come and look out through the window
That big old moon is shining down
Tell me now, don't it remind you
Of a blanket on the ground

Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slipping out of town
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
...
