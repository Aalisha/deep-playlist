If you got something to say
Then come my way
I'm guarded by satan
I'm riding on baphomet
I'll teach you a lesson in violence
You won't soon forget
The pleasure of watching you
Is whati will get

Fight! - for what you believe to be right
Crushing with all your might
I laugh at their pitiful cries
...
