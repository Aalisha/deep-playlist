Everywhere someone's getting over
Everybody cries, and sometimes
You can still lose even if you really try
Talking 'bout the dream like the dream is over
Talk like that won't get you nowhere
Everybody's trusting in the heart
Like the heart don't lie

But that's all that I need, yeah
Someone else to cling to, well
Someone I can lean on until
I don't need to
Just stay all through the night
And in the morning let me down
'Cause that's all that I need right now

Everywhere someone's getting over
