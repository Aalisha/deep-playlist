Daylight turns to moonlight and I'm at my best
Praising the way it all works, and gazing upon the rest, yeah
The cool before the warm, the calm after the storm
The cool before the warm, the calm after the storm

I wish to stay forever, letting this be my food
Oh, but I'm caught up in a whirlwind
And my ever changing moods, yeah

Bitter turns to sugar, some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet for me won't be too soon, no
The hush before the silence, the winds after the blast
...
