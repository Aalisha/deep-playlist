You swore you'd meet me on the other side
Your alibi is intact and your story clears
Honesty puts you in the clear
My dear you're more than a drama
More than a struggle
More than a two-bit faker of a lover
That stabs you in back
It's a peaceful type of heart attack you give

Got my questions
Got my answers
Exude sincerity
(Your alibi is intact and your story clears)
(Honesty puts you in the clear, my dear)
