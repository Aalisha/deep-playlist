Please kill me in my sleep so I get stuck in my dreams
I'll keep exhaling the rime of my chaotic harmony
But the wrecked parts of that ship keep floating in
So I see, this time was never made for me...

Never wanted you to know what was inside of me
And all the things I ever wanted was things I had before

(Chorus)
Making my way to heaven
