LOST IN THE FIFTIES TONIGHT (In the Still Of the Night)
Ronnie Milsap

- #1 in 1985 in country charts
- Part of the song is exactly like the "In the Still Of the Night"
done by The Five Satins but only because he's remembering how they used
to dance to these old tunes and he added some extra words to describe
these olden days, making a "medley" more or less.


Close your eyes, Baby
Follow my heart
