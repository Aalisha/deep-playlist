Pale and dark and tortured blue,
Behind a veil you find serenity.
I guess that's something we share,
Violently fading into nothing to find peace,
Or escape it.
Curious, majestic black strands cover you entirely,
Yet I know you're there.
Always being tested,
An eternal game that must leave your soul in shreds,
...
