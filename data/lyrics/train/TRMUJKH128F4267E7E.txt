Stand, in the end, you'll still be you
One that's done all the things you set out to do
Stand, there's a cross for you to bear
Things to go through if you're goin' anywhere

Stand for the things you know are right
It's the truth that the truth makes them so uptight
Stand, all the things you want are real
You have you to complete and there is no deal

Stand, stand, stand
(Everybody, yeah)
Stand, stand, stand
