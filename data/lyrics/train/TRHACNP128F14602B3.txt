Follow the lifeline I labelled so neat
Through every lifetime from scars that run deep
Follow the love tracks unrivalled unmatched
Book me the right train I'd love to nip back
Set up high above the Pyrenees
Set up high on the road of release

My brain, my arms, my chain, my charms
My aims, my itch, my foes, I've licked
My bed of flame my name
Spread myself round again
Spilled out my guts again
...
