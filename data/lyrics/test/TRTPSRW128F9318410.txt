It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May all be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
...
