And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
We'll see if Jah wills that we're alone again
Let love slip through our fingers I say

Live up, live up, live up
I wanna get up
Instead I give up
Sometimes life dictates what we hate

And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
(Who knows if it'll go our way)

And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
(Insha Allah, it'll be okay)

And when the sun runs out
No doubts left standing
Would it be different if we knew we would win
Let love slip through our fingers I say

Live up, live up, live up
Sometimes
Even the season's change
All patterns rearrange
...
