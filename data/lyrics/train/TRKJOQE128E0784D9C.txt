They say the end's near
But I'll approach it with no fear
When the smoke clears I'll find my spirit is still here
May take years to find it the prophets are real
Too much damage to inhabit the planet, that's severe
I talk shit you heartless paupers can't feel
With concepts the smartest robber can't steal
Your fears will cause all ya'll to pur tears
Cause the bomb that I'm droppin is landing, so stand clear
Are there any clears here in the theater tonight?
We'll get em up against the wall and stick em with dynamite
Cause there's something going on in my head that ain't right
But I'm getting ready to take flight, so hang tight

It don't matter if you're standin tall
If your thinkin small, we all rise and fall
Don't gonna try to abide by the law
No one alive is surviving the holocaust
