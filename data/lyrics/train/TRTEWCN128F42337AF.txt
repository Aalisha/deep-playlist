Where are the ones who carry their guns to the far away lands with the blackened suns from the smokened narrow minds. The half-truth trails and the holy lies of an empty heart and overflowing mouth, a plastic smile and a coward's frown. Reprecussions come around when the word named free burns to the ground somehow.



Where are the deaf and where are the dumb from the side of the tracks where no reason comes from and the tables never bare. The water runs and momma's always there so who separates the world from the start. Where such words would come and such thoughts would cause a shot heard round the world. Or just as sad never heard at all.
