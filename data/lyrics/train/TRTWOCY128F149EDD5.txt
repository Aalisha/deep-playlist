Street Science, you're on the air, â€½Staticâ€
What do you feel when you hear a record like Tupac's new one? Static
I love Tupac's new record, â€½Staticâ€
Right but don't you feel like that creates, â€½Staticâ€
A tension between East and West? Static
He's talking about killing people, â€½Staticâ€
I had sex with your wife and not in those words, â€½Staticâ€
But he's talking about I wanna see you deceased, â€½Staticâ€
No doubt, to live and die in L.A.
California, what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
And everybody got love
To live and die in L.A., where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, warrior faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted 'bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, tryin' to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin', plea bargain
Ain't an option now, so I'm stressin', cost me more
To be free than a life in the pen
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset likin' the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
