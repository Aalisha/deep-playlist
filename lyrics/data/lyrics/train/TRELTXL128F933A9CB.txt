The message is in the music
Now if you're ready the band's got the notion
To in motion
Shimmy shimmy coo coo bop
You're rockin' with the Doc

Come on and do it
Come on and do it
Come on and do it do it do it come on and do it
Come on and do it
Come on and do it
Come on and do it do it do it come on and do it

Well now it looks like the big fun has just begun
Well I've been watching you all night
Don't you wanna dance
Don't you wanna dance

Tang tanga boogie bang
Let's rock the house
Let's shock the house
Boom boom shake the room
Let's rock the shock the house all night
All right don't stop don't stop
Don't block the dot
