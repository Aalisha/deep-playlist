All we shared was a mattress, and a lie, and an address
Baby I don't need you, well baby I don't need you
Once occupied by a goddess, now it's a room full of boxes
She said, 'it's time to leave you', but baby I don't need you!
In a perfect world... her face would not exist
In a perfect world... a broken heart is fixed
In a perfect world... I'd see no therapist
In a perfect world... this wouldn't make me sick

I never got the whole story, not 'til after she left me
Baby I don't need you, well baby I don't need you
Word on the street is she fucked him, while we were playing in Cleveland
Well baby I don't need you, you're fading in my rearview
