Caught your eye, you are my streetlight
Throw off your blues and use your red and whites
And the waves to caution your days and nights
Been wanderin', been wanderin', been wanderin'

Carolina was a gambler
So she came into the city
Where she died when she was twenty-one
'Cause big city life is fun
Yeah, big city life is fun

Tough it out!

Cut your heart out, you are my starlight
