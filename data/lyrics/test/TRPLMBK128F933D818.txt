Oh yea... In my dreams I 'vision myself at the ocean
Beautiful girls rubbin' me down with some lotion
Even though you know I flow as cold as an ice cube
Let me tell you how it is to make love on an inner tube
Floatin' on water while splashin' waves on your body
Flwoni' and goin', now pump it, pump it, Hottie
See, I wanna get loose with you, is that all right?
Girl, I wanna' do it outside, under the moonlight
And get on down so we can make that love
You be the hand and Iceman'll be the glove
This is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures the utmost extreme

Yea... Life is just a fantasy... Yea...

Now, let me take you out so we can wine and dine
As I pull you close you pull your lips next to mine
Oh yeah, you like it like that
...
