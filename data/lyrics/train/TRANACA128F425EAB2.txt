Mary was the first one to carry the gospel
When the angels brought the news of the precious little boy
Mary was the first one to carry the gospel
When that news brought joy sweet joy.

Mary was the first one to carry the gospel
When the angels brought the news of that precious little boy
Mary was the first one to carry the gospel
When that news brought joy sweet joy.
