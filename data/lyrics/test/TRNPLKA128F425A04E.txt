Lover don't love too much
It's a bad thing, a sad thing
And it's heaven to the touch
Hey, everybody's got some moment in their life
They can't change (don't they baby?)

I know you don't care what's right or wrong
All that I know
Is that love don't belong here
And so it's better to turn the page
And watch me walk away,
My dear, watch me walk away

But you say

I can't stop but you know that I want to
