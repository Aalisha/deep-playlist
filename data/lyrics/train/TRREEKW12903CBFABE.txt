Congratulations and Celebrations
I want the world to know that you're in love with him and I'm fucked
Cos I'm not ready for the fall
I'm not ready for the fall
I'll bite lip, bite tongue, have a ball
I'm about ready to go and I hope you will follow
Cos I'm not ready to fall alone
I just called to say that I'm destroyed
I've crawled further now than I did when I was a young boy
Cause I'm not taking to this fall
I'm not taking to this fall at all, at all
