Dream Of A Nation
Blasted By War
Millenium, Close To The End

This Liquid Of Power
Makes The Worlds Spin
Metalians Forces Will Be Sent

Forget Your Fears, Nowhere To Hide
Watch Out For The Trial's Light
Follow The Telepathic Call
Deciding Cards Will Fall

Fight, You Gotta Fight
All Through The Night
So You Might Live Forever
Shout, You Gotta Shout, Try To Be Proud
That You Might Live Forever, Ohhhh
