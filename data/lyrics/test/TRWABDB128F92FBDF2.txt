Good to get your message
So you're coming back home again
Just can't wait to see you
No need to explain
A friend of mine told me
That you've found yourself a new man
I'm feelin' really good for you
Hope you understand
I've still got your picture
I'm sure you know
We had something special
Where did it go?

One more time
