Ooh boy, I love you so, never ever, ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so, never ever, ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

Some of the sun shines Saturdays, you better watch out girl
'Cause I'm on my way to put a piece of my love inside your heart
In other words, I'm looking for a real love

I want you walking by my window
And I don't even know your name
Well my heart skips a beat, yeah, yeah, I feel weak
When my eyes tell my heart he comes again

Ooh boy, I love you so, never ever, ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so, never ever, ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
