The swarms that I speak
are the wrists I have cut
by flooding the tubs
Where the warmth held her up

The lockets believe
that the secret of love
has caught its own tail
and it just won't give up

When I breath the heavens can't hold me
and I can't believe anymore
The light brings
the highest execution
Show me the wings I must cut

In your landfill days
these are desperate graves
Give me the alter
red will shine
This pendulum won’t wait
In your landfill days
these are desperate graves
Give me the alter
red will shine
This pendulum won’t wait

If I slay your spirit
with twin current volts
...
