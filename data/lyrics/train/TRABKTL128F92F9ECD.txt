I turn back time and now I'm back again
The world is mine I'm on the road again
I'm fanatic, fanatic, fanatic
On the run, with the feeling I'm feeling now
I never gonna back down
I'm just the man with the plan
Here I am with my crew and with the
Mic in my hand I'm here to entertain you
Right here right now (nothing's gonna stop me)
I won't back down (never will surrender)
Right here right now (nothing's gonna stop me)
I won't back down (yeah yeah yeah)
Back again! back again!
Now I'm back again
Back to turn back time and now I'm back again
I'm back where I belong
