You can take your precious CD
I will take my luther with me
You can take
I let you take my undergrads
You can keep that ghetto chain
Better leave that diamond ring
You might as well get used to your mom wearing it
You can tell your friends things wont be like they was before
All your flossing all the shopping I was paying for
You can act like you aint sorry now but I no I'm gunna be this, when it all comes down to this

Were going outta business
Shutting down the door
Everythings so clear 'cause were closing up the store
Don't act like you dont hear it dont act like you dont know
Were going outta business everything in the store

You better pay your cable bill
Common girl lets be for real
