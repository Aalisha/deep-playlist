Well now early one day
I was a-on my way
to my favorite fishin hole
I's a thinking I could sure use
Another bottle of booze
My baits a-runnin a little low
yeah and a box of twelve gauge would be all the rage
when I'm all liquered up and I'm feeling good
Well just down the road there was a place called Bubba's
Man he's got the goods

*Chorus*
