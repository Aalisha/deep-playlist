Well, I got a woman way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah
Said I got a woman way over town
Good to me, oh yeah

She gives me money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah

She saves her loving early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah
She saves her loving early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah
