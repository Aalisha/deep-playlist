Tear it down and start again
If you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose
Come to terms and understand
If you've got nothing, you've got nothing to prove
Hey, what are you so afraid of
Why do you waste your time trying to escape it
Everybody lives in a world they created
Everybody gives up, everybody breaks, aches, aches

Pour a bucket of water on a burning house
Let the fire spread from room to room
It's a bath tonight with devastating hands
Consuming walls and all your had
You're never gonna get it
Never gonna get it back
Bask in the aftermath

Bend it up to break apart
A razor to remove
...
