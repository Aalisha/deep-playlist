(Chorus)
You ain't gotta be no superstar
I only want to find out who you are
And we gotta be no Superman
So if you wanna talk to me, you can

My girlies caught me on a good day
I was (something) to move a job
So we took it to a club
Nigga we would make out a little
And plus at the time I was single, a little
So I said "Fine, we could meet up about nine"

So anyway we crossing the place where bub is flowing
We walking around, giving up peace to everyone we knowin
Some people in the joint is yellin "Hurt me, Hurt me"
I'm working my way over to the bar cus I'm thirsty
And then I see this guy
Oh no, I think he sikes me
I smile cus he's fly
He smiles back, I think he likes me

Well then it takes a twist
He sends his homeboy to talk to me cus he's scared to get dissed
I don't walk baby
