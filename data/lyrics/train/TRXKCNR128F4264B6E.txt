(Chorus)
Right away, love me right away
Won't you come on girl, there's no other way
If I were you, I would see it through
I'd be loving me, I'd know what to do right away

How do you feel about me now
The time has come, you must decide
Where you will run, where you will hide
How will I know if you're alright
