It's my life take it or leave it
Set me free what's that crap papa-knew-it-all
I got my own life you got your own life
Live your life and set me free
Mind your business and leave my business
You know everything papa-knew-it-all
Very little knowledge is dangerous
Stop bugging me stop bothering me
Stop bugging me stop forcing me
Stop fighting me stop yelling me
It's my life

It's my life it's my life my worries!
It's my life it's my life my problems!
It's my life it's my life my worries!
It's my life it's my life my problems!
