Yellow moon shining like fool's gold
Slipping softly into the sea
Memories how they linger
Guess we weren't strong enough, you and me

Still I look to find a reason
Search my mind for a vision
Hide from the answers as the questions
Burn in my head

Shining like a fool's moon
Shining like a fool's moon
...
