Top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted

Are you putting us under
Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination

Well, see you later, innovator!

Some want to kiss some want to kick you
There's not a net that you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
...
