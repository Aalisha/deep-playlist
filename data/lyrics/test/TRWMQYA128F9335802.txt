Broken free... almost
Prettier than that butterfly i watch you head off through this night sky
The thought of you lingers like the smoke that's drifting from my fingers
While I sit, i see, there's a tree outside my room
My face reflected in the pain of this moon
Outside the cold rain cleanses my soul,
Whole, the distance between the rooms of my thoughts of us all
Sitting in that room sometimes i get to thinking about myself
Love, where does it come from?
For days on end i would plead to the moon
Where can i find someone to strip my flesh back bare to where the word begins,
Strip my flesh back bare to the wind that violates my skin

Washing away, under the sun, I vanish in the street heat
Melting on tar, lost in a wave of cut-throat urban values
...
