LIZA MINELLI
The sun comes up - I think about you
The coffee cup - I think about you
I want you so, it's like I'm losing my mind
The morning ends - I think about you
I talk to friends and think about you
And do they know it's like I'm losing my mind?
All afternoon doing every little chore
The thought of you stays bright
Sometimes I stand in the middle of the floor
Not going left - not going right
I dim the lights and think about you
