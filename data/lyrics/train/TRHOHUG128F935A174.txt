I looked in the mirror
(What did you see looking at you)
I saw a nine stone weakling
(What will you do)

Dynamic tension waiting for you
Dynamic tension make a man out of you

I opened my magazine
(What did you see)
I saw Mr. France
(What did he have)
A girl on each shoulder
(What else)
And one in his pants

Dynamic tension can do this for you
