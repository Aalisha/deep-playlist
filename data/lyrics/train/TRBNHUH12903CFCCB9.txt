From the corner of my eye
There's a tear I'm trying to cry
But the feeling can't be found

Like a note thrills in a song
When I play it again, it's gone
Cuz it was never in the sound

And it keeps me wanting
That mysterious thing
Like a night is waiting for a dawn

Every prayer I say (a little closer)
To my resting place (a little closer)
Where my final breath
is the beginning
To never needing
And I will find my last Amen
my last Amen
