He took on a shade of green long ago. 
and many a fool along the way have been lost to this. 
i know you can't afford to be wrong. and we can't either. 
we want it back. i can't afford to lose you. but that's not what this is about. 
if love ever had a second name it's attachment. 
and if you had an ounce of common sense you would be witness to this. 
but try your best not to be of this world.
fly with the rest of your glassy eyed angels.
