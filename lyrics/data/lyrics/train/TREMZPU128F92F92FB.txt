Forgive me if I seem a little distant
It's true I was a million miles away
Calling on a world that's far behind me
And still it seems like it was yesterday

Yesterday and just around the corner
I was playing cowboys in the sun
I had a little dog that really loved me
There's times I feel like she's the only one

Oh darling, you know I'm just fooling
