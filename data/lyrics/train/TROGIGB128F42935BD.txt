All of those things
yeah, that you got to give

Yeah, you wear it so well
hey, you wear it so well

All of those stories
honey, that I know you could tell

Yeah, you wear it so well
and your face hides it so we can't tell
That you knew we would wear it so well
you wear it so well

Yeah darling, you wear it so well
(you wear it so well)
