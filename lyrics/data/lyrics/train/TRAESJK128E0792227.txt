Once you call my name out
Things will never be the same
They should have never let us
Get off foot in this game

Ever since I was duced to rap music
I been missin' a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it

So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode and
Have another episode where I let it go
As far as the one with Benzino did

I'm waitin' for that next beef
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin' bananas
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fuckin' pole vault with

Oh, shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name, it's a game
'Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for ten minutes of fame

Everyday, it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy, buddy us
