[tek]
Grab a hold of your heart and visualize it's a kickin
A hollow point slug comin outta black biscuit
You ain't just from death, we round to the corner, comin quick
We method outta minds and just don't give a shit
God damn it, gun shots we bust from the clip
Wicked bad boy, snatch the burner on my hip
So feel ya hopes and get dead mr. buster
Cuz we ain't got love for none of y'all muthafuckas
Chief the black bar hard, to do a rabbi
You're too leary to live, but you not wan' die
All these mc's wit they fancy names and games
I know from the heart, that them not mean a thing
Big up to all the real heads, wit the knuckle game
Rest in peace to all my niggas that was murdered and slain

(talking)

[steele]
All heads realize, recognize, smif-n-wessun on the rise
You better recognize, i'm beamin each and every individual
Who listen to that voice in ya head when it be kickin truth
The heads that represent around the way
Showin and provin, keepin it movin, until they break day
Realize what's before ya eyes
