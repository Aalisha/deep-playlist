I won't ever leave, you want me to stay
Nothing you can do that could turn me away
Hanging on anyway, believing the things you say
Being a fool

You've taken my life, so take my soul
That's what you said and I believed it all
I want to be with you as long as you want me to
But don't move away

Ain't that what you said?
Ain't that what you said?
