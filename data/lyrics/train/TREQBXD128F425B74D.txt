It's impossible
It's impossible to love you
If you dont let me know what you're feeling
It's impossible for me to give you what you need
If you're always hidin' from me

I dont know what hurt you
But I just, I wanna make it right
'Cause boy I'm sick tired of tryin' to read your mind

Cause it's impossible (impossible)
Ooh baby it's impossible (impossible)
For me to love you this way
