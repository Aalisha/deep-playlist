Ooh I remember those old love letters
Plagued with memories, I can't forget us
Trying to fight it, trying to hide it

Rekindled flames are not recommended
But it never went out boy, it never ended
Trying to fight it, trying to hide it
But your love it shines

In a cruel hard world
It's a miracle to find
