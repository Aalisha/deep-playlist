I get lost, messed up, and bored when I'm alone too long.
I can't sleep, function, or eat when I'm not with someone.
late last fall she ended it all and moved to who knows where
Just like that
she vanished and packed, and never even called.

Do you feel a certain sense of synergy between yourself and me?
A kind of macabre and somber wondertwin type of harmony?

What if it was you? You that I needed all along?
I felt it like a fool
Kicking and screaming and pretending we were wrong

Let's get wrecked on pop-tarts and sex and see the Taj Mahal
Let's save birds from Prince William Sound and skateboard through the mall
