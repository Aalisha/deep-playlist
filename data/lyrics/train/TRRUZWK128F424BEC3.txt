Gotta make a love work out
Before you get you got to give
Gotta make a love work out
Before you die you got to live

If that's what it's all about
Then there's nothing standing in my way
I'm telling you all I've got to be on my way

I used to keep on trying from day to day
To keep from dying and fading away
