I'm living in a bad dream.
They're supposed to be here by now.
What the hell is taking them so long?
I parked the car just like they said.
Now, I'm sitting, waiting for a bullet in my head.
I'm living in a bad dream. 
I'm living in a bad dream.
I'm living in a bad dream gone bad.
I'm living in a bad dream. 
I'm living in a bad dream
I'm living in a bad dream that's sad.
I'm supposed to be feeling better by now.
What the hell is taking me so long?
I hit the hay just like they said.
