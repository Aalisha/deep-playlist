I came to town to search for gold
And I brought with me a memory
And I seem to hear the night wind cry
Go hang your dreams on the hangin' tree
Your dreams of love that could never be
(Never be)
Hang your faded dreams on the hangin' tree
(The hangin' tree)

I searched tor gold and I found my gold
And I found a girl who loved just me
And I wished that I could love her too
But I'd left my heart on the hangin' tree
I'd left my heart with a memory
(A memory)
And a faded dream on the hangin' tree
...
