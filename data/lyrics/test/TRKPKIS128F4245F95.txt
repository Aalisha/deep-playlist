Brother Martin was walkin' with me
And every step, I heard, "Liberty"
Though he's fallin', come a million behind
Glory, Hallelujah, gonna make it this time

No easy walk to freedom
No easy walk to freedom
Keep on walkin' and ya shall be free
That's how we're gonna make history

Across the ocean, the blood's runnin' warm
I, I hear it coming, there's a thunderin' storm
Just like we lived it, you know that it's true
Nelson Mandela, now we're walkin' with you
