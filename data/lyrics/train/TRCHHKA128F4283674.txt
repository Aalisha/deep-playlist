The silence kills the calm of the night
I force an anxious patience
Counting every beat and waiting for my turn to die

Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for the same things
Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made
Don't turn away

I understand your ways
Won't give it up

It's not me you're waiting for
Alright, stop waiting
It's not me you're waiting for
It's time to let go, time to let it go

And when you've become
All you've lost
Wandering the streets and searching for a place to die

Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for the same things
Give it up, give it up
Don't fall for mistakes that I've made
...
