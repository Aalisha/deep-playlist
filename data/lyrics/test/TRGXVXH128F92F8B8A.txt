From the moment you were born you were dieing
With one foot planted in the grave
Programmed by your surroundings
To react in a given set of ways

You can't think for yourself so you are already dead

Follow only the ways of your own, abandon lawsof god
Held in check by convention, strangling free thought

Your choice is only consequence, eyes are stricken blind
