Hey nonny ding dong, alang alang alang
boom ba-doh, ba-doo ba-doodle-ay
Oh, life could be a dream (sh-boom)
if i could take you up in paradise up above (sh-boom)
if you would tell me i'm the only one that you love
life could be a dream sweetheart
(hello hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again)
Oh, life could be a dream (sh-boom)
if only all my precious plans would come true (sh-boom)
if you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you
life could be a dream sweetheart
Now every time i look at you
something is on my mind (dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-duh)
if you do what i want you to
baby, we'd be so fine
