If I should die this very moment, I wouldn't fear
For I've never known completeness like being here
Wrapped in the warmth of you, loving every breath of you
Still my heart this moment, oh it might burst

Could we stay right here till the end of time
Until the earth stops turning
Wanna love you until the seas run dry
I've found the one I've waited for

All this time I've loved you and never known your face
All this time I've missed you and searched this human race
