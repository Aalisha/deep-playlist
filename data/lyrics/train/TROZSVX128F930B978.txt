Hey, you know just how to hurt me
And how to take all my fears away
Girl, you must be the devil in disguise

There were times I thought you knew

Well, you know a place buried deep in my heart
Nobody else could see
Something in you has taken some kind of hold on me

I don? t know why I keep coming back to you, baby, oh, no
