Periscope extends the lens
Veiney hands can't mend
Your broken little baby's remains
We all fall to bits just the same
Eyes down for a full house
Yeah I love you long time
They christened me just to give me a name
Now know that I'm to blame

There was no man in his eyes
No lights to beam home those ships
Can't even extend out his arm
To go and cash in his chips
I wish that I could not so rightly place this
But at least I can say that I was there
...
