A few more hours, that's all the time I got
A few more hours, before I tie the knot
There'll be drinks and girls all over the town
And I gotta track'em down
In just a few more hours.

I'm gettin' married in the morning
Ding-dong the bells are gonna chime
Pull out the stopper, we'll have a whopper
But get me to the church on time.
