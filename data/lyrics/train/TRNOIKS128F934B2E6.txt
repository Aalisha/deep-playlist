Icy stares from upper echelon, 
So confused, I just don't belong, 
Out of place, the spotlights glare on me, 
When you don't fit in, nothing comes naturally.

Ah, they're watching as I fall.
Ah, I'm not invisible - not like the rest.

I am an outcast, free at last, 
So long, don't need you anyway.
Outcast, I am who I am, here to stay.
