Stewart Rod
Every Beat Of My Heart
Red Hot In Black
I met her in a little French cafe
Legs like a young giraffe
She was sitting reading Baudelaire
Not exactly working class

She had a studio in St. Michel
Crucifix around her waist
Che Guevara all over the wall
She can't stand the sun on her face

Hey boys, what a look
Stop a train at fifty feet
Matching hair, matching clothes and eyes
Kinda like a tiger in heat
Red hot in black
