We're alive and we're among you, we breed and we conceive you, you live because we allow you to live and you breathe because we allow you to breathe

You're incapable to think of breathe for yourself.
We pull the strings, cut out the wings
We're in charge of all the peace and of all the noise.
You think there is a God, you are only toys
You're toys
