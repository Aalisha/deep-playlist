I don't know how to tell her
That I didn't get that raise in pay today
And I know how much she wanted the dress in Baker's window
And it breaks my heart to see her have to wait
And cancel all the plans she made to celebrate

But I can count on her to take it with a smile and not a frown
She knows that life has its little ups and downs
Like ponies on a merry-go-round
And no one grabs the brass ring every time
...
