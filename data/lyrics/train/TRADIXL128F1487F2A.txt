She's such a different girl, she looked at me
My head's in a whirl, she looked at me
Such a pretty face I don't know what to say
I hope she might even stay a while
Not to mention, not to mention her smile.

She just fascinates me, I must talk to her
She knows how to be, I must talk to her
She's makin' me feel I just can't go wrong
