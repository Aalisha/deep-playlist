Backed up against the wall
The animal makes his final stand
He spits and growls and shows his teeth
He's a foreigner in his own land

When there's nowhere else to run
You're a rebel
No more battles to be one
You're a rebel
Stands out there with his pride
Fights with no one on his side
You're a rebel
...
