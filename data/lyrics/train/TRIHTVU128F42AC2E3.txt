Efficiency and progress is ours once more now that we have the neutron bomb
It's nice and quick and clean and gets things done
Away with excess enemy, but no less value to property
No sense in war but perfect sense at home

The sun beams down on a brand new day, no more welfare tax to pay
Unsightly slums gone up in flashing light
Jobless millions whisked away, at last we have more room to play
All systems go to kill the poor tonight

Gonna kill, kill, kill, kill, kill the poor
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill the poor
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill the poor tonight
