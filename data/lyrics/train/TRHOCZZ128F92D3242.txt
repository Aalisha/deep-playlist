MICHAEL BEDFORD â€“ TONIGHT

Tonight
Tonight

So many ways I'm gone
So many words I said in vain
How could I be so sure?
Hearing your voice has called my name

So many nights we shared
So many days you're far away
I didn't realize
Wishing you here

Tonight, tonight I'm close by you
I know you changed all my life
Tonight I stay with you
Don't turn away, there's much to say
...
