Fourteen years have passed since that day
Your stories are the same but the ends have all changed
You carried on like you were some type of god
Some things will never change

We went home to see our folks
We laughed and we told jokes
It was like we were young again
On that deathbed our mother lay
How long she's got they still can't say
It took all this to get us back together again

How long is this going to last
You can't keep reliving your past
Screwing over the ones that you love
In the name of some new drug
