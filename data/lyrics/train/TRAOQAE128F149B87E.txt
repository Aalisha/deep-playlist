Potent mix of wonder
Ignorance and fear
A place to hide under
A secret place to keep
Self serving answers
Paper-thin belief
Bury your soul with me

I know I'd like
A conscious life
I don't know how to get there
I don't know how to get there
So keep me right
We're wasting time
I don't know how to get there
I don't know how
