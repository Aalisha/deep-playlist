Can we try again to start a new and lovely story
That will shine a ray of light upon our hearts
And bring back long lost glory
Of how it used to be, baby you and me
Convinced we were each others destiny

My heart cries out to you, you must forgive me
I've been dancing in the dark
I've been searching for a spark of fire still burning
I believe we'll make it through if you stand by me
We can weather any storm
And keep each other warm as long as there's love
