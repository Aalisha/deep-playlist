Got that feeling inside
like fire that will never stop
as the clocks run down
got to show me what you want

Move move move a little tigher
Think think think a little sharper
Breath breath breath a little faster
Can you catch yourself

Told you once, told you twice
anywhere, anynight,
told you once, told you twice
anywhere, everynight
tell you once, tell you twice
comming for a second bite

I've been watching you
