A politician lies, [?]
Screaming out in pain
Squirrels are hooked on crack cocaine
It's just another day at the office

J-Lo tries on her new fur coat
Of rabbit, racoon and fox
She's still Jenny from the block
And it's just another day at the office

Watching the clock
Answer the phone
Taking stock
Until I go home

Our Father who art bigger than
Your father's will be done
With the rocket and the gun
...
