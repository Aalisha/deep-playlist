There's nothin' for us in Belfast
The Pound's old and that's a pity
OK, there's the Trident in Bangor
And then you walk back to the city
We ain't got nothin' but they don't really care
They don't even know you know
They just want money
And we can take it or leave it
What we need is

(Chorus:)
An Alternative Ulster
Grab it and change it it's yours
