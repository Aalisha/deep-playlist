Don't know what to do
Don't know how we made it this far
This California weather
The summer in December
Let me go just let me go
Finally found a way
Finally found a way to shut you out
I'm lost and gone forever
Now has turned to never
Just let me go

I'm just slipping away down the coast
And I'm so far away from home
Never returning
Paradise burning

Don't know what to do
Don't know if it's true anymore
(You can lie about it)
Like a wave that's finally broken
(Tell me why about it)
