I can not bear this faking anymore
So damn full of yourselves
Ignorance has dragged us down once again
My clenched fist is all i'll ever need

No i won't stand the beating anymore
This will all be useless
When we fall to the floor
My soul fights to break itself free
Screaming out the hate
Just to make you see

No more it's all washed out
Truth knocks you down
