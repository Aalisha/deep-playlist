[MJG]
I'm so cold, I need a coat in the kitchen
I bust two verses, then go into intermission
No way you can provoke my vision
I, dont play I make a hoe pay a commission
Baby, come on you know I wrote compositions
That make niggaz wish they never spoke while they were spittin
I'm so ready I'm bout to blow from the tension
Like surprise you dont even know what you gettin
I'm becomin quick at gettin slow?
Cant throw my position, I flow with persition
Is a must a keep it on the low in addition
To all my weapons and no ammunition
MJG, and I'm so in attention
I see you tryin to creep me for my dough, why you trippin
Youse a shipwreck nigga when you broke co-mission
Jesse Jackson cant help you with the Hope Coalition

[Chorus - Shannon Jones]
Well, I'm spendin loose
Got nothing to lose
Got nothing to prove
Its not easy to do
I got the streets in my pocket
With the hating better stop
Straight Cadillac Pimpin'
Young nigga better listen
