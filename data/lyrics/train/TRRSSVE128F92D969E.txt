The Jackson Sisters - Miracles For Yuko!

I Believe in Miracles Baby
I Believe in You
I Believe in Miracles Baby
I Believe in You

They say the day is ending
Lets watch the sun go down
And plan a holiday for two
For All Eternity
We will ride a cloud so you can see
The world i created just for you

I saw you standing on the street
I wanted to meet just stop a while
You give me smile to say hello
You make me feel so good inside
That i realised i could not hide
The feeling that came when you failed to say

I Believe in Miracles
