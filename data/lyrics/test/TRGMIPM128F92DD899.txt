I can't weep, I can't eat
Since you walked out on me
Holy smoke, what you doing to me, yeah

I can't eat, I can't sleep
Since you walked out on me, yeah
Holy cow, whatcha doing, child, child

(Holy cow, whatcha doing, child)
Whatcha doing, whatcha doing, child
(Holy smoke, girl, it ain't no joke)
No joke (hey, hey, hey)
