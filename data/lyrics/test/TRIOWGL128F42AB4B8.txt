It's over your head and you don't seem to understand
One word I say and you can't live your life trying to run away

You're fighting your friends all you win everybody
But it never ends you wearing me out

Come on, reach out, reach out
And let someone in to your life

Don't get me wrong you always apologize
It's just your way of making a scene
