Sleepless nights and endless days
And all I do is promise to change my ways
Leave the lights on, you know I'll pretend you're on your way
You used to say that there's a time we all deserve to lose our minds
So I lost my mind now I'm ready to find my way

Back home
Today
To stay
The way you wished I would
And I swear
To stay
The way you wished I would

I don't know if I'm gonna have to redesign my mind
But tonight I made a wish and I so hope that it comes true
