Your hair hangs in golden steps
You're a bonafide, in every respect
You are walking through streets that mean nothing to you
You believe you're above it and I don't really blame you
Maybe that's why you speak like a child
The things you're saying like I'm so free and so wild

And I believe it when you look in my eyes
You offer me a life and never lies
Least only the kind to make me smile

Your clothes are clean and your mind is productive
It shops in stores where only the best buy
You're cool and hard, never sound like a lecher
It's probably true but at least there's no lecture
I really like it when you speak like a child
