In conclusion Ladies and Gentleman 
A New World is emerging
It is a New World Order 
A new World Order
A new World Order

We're running out of time
When will we ever learn
History	 repeats itself
The people always get burned

We're running out of time
We'd betta kill em first
I'm not fuckin around
I'll cut that fucker down

Bloodfire Bloodfire

Hit em back x5

What will it take for you to wake the fuck up?

Can't you see they're comin for
you, Poisoning you,
Programming you?
And you don't even know it.
