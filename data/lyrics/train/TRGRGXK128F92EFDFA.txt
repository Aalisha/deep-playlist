It came without warning
A love like I ain't never felt before
She's like my destiny calling
And she's lying there all naked on the floor

And suddenly, out of the blue she's singin'...

Bring your burning skin to my river once again
I'll give you life
Oh baby, let my lovin' ease your pain tonight

She came without warning
like an angel come from heaven in the night (in the night)
