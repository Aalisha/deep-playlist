She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind

She's a lawyer's queen, a trucker's dream
With a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine

Cadillacs and caviar
Well, that ain't how she rolls
Implants and tummy tucks
She sure don't need those

She's a cool drink of water
When the summer's mean
Poured into those Levis jeans
She's country as the day is long
