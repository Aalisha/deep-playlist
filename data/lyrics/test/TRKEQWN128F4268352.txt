All that's bright must fade
Like your hand on heart
All that's dark must hold
All that once was thrown
All that's bright must fade
Like your hand in this
All that's dark must hold
All that once was thrown

Too close for comfort
But it's all that I can do
Too hard to feel
But it's all that I can see
...
