Buck 65-Square 1

(Some mumbling?)
Pretty soon the hippies of today, will be the squares of tomorrow
It was the echoing voices of the old ones
Through thick steeled forests and over scorched earth
Always just out of reach
A herder of crows judged my every footstep
My bones were frozen
Penniless and entirely out of breath
I washed my beautiful hands in the black market dog water trough
But through it all the real stick in my spokes
Was the torment of my dreams
I fought of sleep with both fists and sometimes fire
With no more then a blow gun I made from an exhausted pen
I shot the stars out of the sky
When each one fell sparkling to the ground
I made wishes that never came true
Apparitions of angels with angry eyes
Appeared at each new moon
My own ghost be gain whispering
Trees died if I tried to climb them
The decision was made for me
To begin interpreting real life just as I would nightmares
(More mumbling?)

Buck 65, Buck 65, Buck 65, Buck 65, Buck 65, Buck 65
Watching an already dead world vanish
We the banished and outlawed wander
Hither and yonder
Like dogs gone hungry
Funky and angry and sometimes ugly
Drums like drugs have turned us to scavengers
Pathfinders, addicts and mathematicians
Practicing is a black magic
We make music from used up junk and bad luck dreams
Liars and losers
Emus and aardvarks
Gypsies and pint thieves
Peddlers, Card Sharks
All of us fortune tellers home in the forest
Hard core, building a cardboard fortress
Fore ward fast and backwards blindfolded
Trying to find gold buried in flood planes
Covered in blood stains
Fly bites and egg yolk
Running away with one of my legs broke

Sometimes it? s lonesome
Traveling homeless
Not knowing where you? re going
Riding the railroads
Pickups and sailboats
Most of the loco-motives
Once we decide to see some of the country side
Working with circus
Performers and cut-throats
Discussions with perfectionists, perverts and poets
Haven? t you ever heard of the?
1200 hoboes?
We aren? t vampires dressed like rock stars
We build campfires and ride box-cars
Town to town, we just write songs
And plus we stay up like all night long
Cuz we aren? t vampires dressed like rock stars
We build campfires and ride box-cars
Town to town, we just write songs
And plus we stay up like all night long

20 some years is a long walk
Even if its night in a straight line
You see a lot of things in the distance
You know what they say about great minds
You and I think about the same things
Dream the same dreams
Play the same games
