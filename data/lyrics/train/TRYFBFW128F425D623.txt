Walking in the shadows of the echoes of goodbye
Closing the gates inside my mind

Each man kills the thing he loves,
Yet each man does not die
The feeling is keeping me alive

CORO:
I heard you call
I watched you fall from grace

CORO2
Tears keep falling forevermore
Feel the rain
Feed the pain
Tears are drowning me
Searing, healing me
Healing me

Feel the rain
