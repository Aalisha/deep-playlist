I'm sick of you

Hurt me, like you've never done before
Make me, do what ever you want now
Desert me, leave me like you always do
Hate me, as long as this is the last time

I'm Just letting you know, it's time to let you go
I know you hate it but I'm still not sorry
You can blame it on me, it's still a lie you see
I know you hate it but I'm still not sorry

Watch me, as I begin to walk away
Miss me, and see if I care now
Catch me, try and see now if you can
Kiss me, you know it's the last time
