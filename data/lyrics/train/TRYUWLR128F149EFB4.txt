Kiss me on the forhead angel
Before I go to sleep
I can't remember if its Thursday or December
I've been keeping track of days by counting hangovers
And the bottles on my floor
My mangled memory is making me mistake misfortune for forgivness
I don't think I'll make it out alive
So promise me that you'll survive to bury me

Just empty all the alcohol
And chronicle the chemicals
But don't forget the cigarettes
...
