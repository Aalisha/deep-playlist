Earthquake in the makin'
I'm gonna love you
when you persist in all that shakin'
What you expect me to do
It's more than just the bacon
It's sumthin' about yo' insides too
You know I've been waitin'
Waitin' on the wall for you
So if ever you should question...

If I spend the nite with you
You and me what we gonna do
A temporary nite for two
