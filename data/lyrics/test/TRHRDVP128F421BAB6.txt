Longing for silence...
"Always faster" is the way that we go.
Not a little patience...
Higher, farer, better we grow.

The beast is rising. It's tantalizing
those who are taking the time.
Alienation... A revelation...
Straight to the end of the line...

The cold Chill you feel is no dream it's for real.
We don't follow!
