Not Of This Earth, Unknown and forgotten by time
evil in nature with power of flight
Not Of This Earth Lurking the shadows for flesh
sent from the heavens descending with death
Snatching the weak from this world, gone from the night and to never be heard
Ominous figure of blood upon us feed
Creeping the darkness unfurl, venting it's self with a murderous thirst
abomination of birth
Not of this earth...
