We're running on empty
And every heartbeat's out of time
It's hurting within me, oh yeah
We have to slow down here for a while

And just make the time for some loving again
Save a better tomorrow
Let's take it back to where we started here and now

Chorus:
'Cause tonight it's our time
There's no reason for pretending
