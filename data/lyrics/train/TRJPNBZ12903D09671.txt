On a cold dark winter night
Hidden by the stormy light
A battle rages for the right
For what will become

In the valley of the damned
A warrior with sword in hand
Travels fast across the land
For freedom he rides

And the sign from the master on high
He screams aloud and across hear the cry

For the kingdom of fire and ice
And the power to be alive

Be strong, ride on
Carry on through the war
Come along carry on
Living for ever more
...
