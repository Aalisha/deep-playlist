And it's all for me grog
Me jolly jolly grog
All for me beer and tobacco
For I spent all me tin
On the lassies drinkin' gin
Far across the western ocean I must wander

And where is me shirt,
Me noggin noggin shirt?
It's all gone for beer and tobacco
For the collar it is gone
And the sleeves are ripped and torn
And the tail is lookin' out for better weather

And it's all for me grog
Me jolly jolly grog
...
