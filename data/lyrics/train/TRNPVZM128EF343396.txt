And if you look into my eyes
You'll know that there's a mystery
And I'm not giving any clues
I'm doing what my mama told me

She used to say that every woman
Should learn to play the game
So when you're questioning the answers
You don't have to take all the blame

There's no kiss and tell
Won't confirm or deny it
I won't buy or sell
Cause I'm keeping a secret

And though you think that you might know me
You're not about to burn my soul
And there's no use in me confessing
...
