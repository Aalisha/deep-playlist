I'd like to sit on the grass for a while
And wear my favourite dress for a while
I'd like to sit on the grass for a while
And wear my favourite dress for a while

You would drive your car
And your life to the sea
Speaking your mind about
All you wanted to be
Have you ever felt this free
In such a small world
So light that if you'd leave
You may not return

And this way you'd drive us away
Without words left to say our souls
Drowning into the night
We would know how our secrets were there
...
