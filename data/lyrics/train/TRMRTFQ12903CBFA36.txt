ah
Oh well, the music is coming to an end
I fell for you and the love pretend
You know, I smelled the truth
But denied my instinct
I left the city, my family, my precinct

And now I'm looking
At liberty, good belief,
Revolution, new obsession,
Ideas, like new years
And good things
I've grown wings
With hope and dope and charity

I ain't being disarmed like this
I don't seek your foolish kiss
This is feeling victory
And I won't tell you what I see
No more, no more

Don't think it- i'll feel this time
...
