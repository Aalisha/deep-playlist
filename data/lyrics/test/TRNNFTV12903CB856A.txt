St John got gunned down with a cold ‘38
Why don't we pin him to the sky….
The rarest of the specimens are neatly locked away
It's all in my collection…
It's all in my collection…

You know that bird has flown
Can you forgive?
A bird you'll never own

And your love is a graveyard
Where the grasses grow low
And the people that lie here
...
