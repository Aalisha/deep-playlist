(words & music: D. Snider)

Wow, alright
I'm not bad, I'm damn good
But I'll admit I don't do all I should
I don't kill, I don't steal
Well, maybe only when I need a meal

All I'm saying's true but there's one thing that I do
And I just can't explain it, there's no way to restrain it
If I quit the rest I still couldn't pass the test
Cause I could not give up this one last thing

CHORUS:

I got one bad habit (one bad habit)
