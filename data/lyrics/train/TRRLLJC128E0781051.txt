Written by: Lucie Silvas

I'm alright.

Tonight, let's all get down on the floor
I'm feeling alright
I've got the need to explore
You can leave your inabitions
Make no conditions
Leave them at the door
Nobody's uptight
It's clear what we're waiting for

Take a deep breath
Let me stimulate
I don't ever feel the need to imitate nobody
The way you move your body be turning me on
We're gonna party all night long (oh-oh)

Spin that bottle
Play my game
Come on over here
'Cos I called your name
Move your body close
Baby, it's your turn
Spin that bottle
Don't be shy
Everybody here's got a one-track mind
I f you don't know s'about time you learned

Yeah.

Shivers are runnin' right down my spin
You give me pleasure
There's no words to define
There's no need for confusion
