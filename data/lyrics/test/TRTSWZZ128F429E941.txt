I'm five hundred miles away from home.
Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote
She said, "We miss you son, we love you come on home."
Well, I didn't have to pack, I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home.

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles
