Yeah, yeah, have you heard the news today?
People right across the world
Are pledging they will play the game.
Victims of the modern world,
Circumstance has brought us here,
Armageddon's come too near,
Too, too near now.
Foresight is the only key,
To save our children's destiny,
The consequences are so grave,
So, so grave now.
The hypocrites we are their slaves,
So my friends to stop the end,
On each other we depend,
Oh, we depend.

Mountain high and river deep,
Stop it goin' on.
We gotta wake this world up from its sleep,
Oh, people.
Stop it goin' on.
