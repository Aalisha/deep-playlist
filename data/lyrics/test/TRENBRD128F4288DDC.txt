*Girl whining on telephone*

(Chorus - Planetary)
Be careful who you talk to
The places that you walk through
You never know when somebody is creepin', tryin' to hawk you
Better grab your gat too
'cause niggaz will attack you
And blast you, right behind your back
'cause the cash rules

(Crypt the Warchild and Planetary)
Yo
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty:
Record execs are made shady for gravy
Protecting your neck can save you and save me
We step on the set, like fuck you, pay me
Give 'em a chance, and they'll take food from your babies
And stress you out, to drive a grown nigga crazy
Now ain't that crazy? You ain't kiddin', man
They run for cover when the shit really hit the fan
The snakes in the garden, pray on your downfall
Abondon shit, it's hazardous, and they can drown y'all
Exploit your people with a image, they can clown y'all
The voice of evil in your ear, you hear the sound, y'all

(Chorus)

(Planetary)
