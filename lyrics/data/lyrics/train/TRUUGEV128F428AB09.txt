This lady in black came to me and she said,
Would you like to come home to my room?
I resisted all temptation, but I took her invitation,
I hope that she don't make me fall too soon

She said "Suck it and see"
It was all new to me,
All in a young child's dream
She said "Suck it and see"
Can't be happening to me,
But it's good if you know what I mean
...
