Wherever we go, bluebirds sing
And the flowers bloom and the grass gets green
It's a curious thing
But it's just our thing

Wherever we go, the bees behave
In the treetops, squirrels smile and wave
It's a curious thing
And it's humbling

Where we go, little glow-worms glow
Little roadrunners run ahead
Gonna tell their friends
Little mice, little men
Get 'em all excited, all invited

Hands up, holler back here
Let? s throw this party in gear
We brought the welcome mat
Wherever we go, that? s where the party's at

Hands up, holler back now
We don? t claim any know-how
We're giving God all that
Wherever we go, that? s where the party? s at

Wherever we go, the dumb get wise
And the crime rates drop and the markets rise
It's a curious thing
...
