(Issergia)
When the sun begins to fade, a blaze of blood embrace between us
Our kisses like a falme reborn, wrigglin', rise, snowin' through death
Ever in our life... Gusts of wind break into out cold
Love has never made a choice I realize it facin' two mirrors
Dreamin', bleedin', like a larva thorn
I groan through this blood full night fallin' from my eyes
