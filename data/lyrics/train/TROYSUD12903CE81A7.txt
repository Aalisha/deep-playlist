A voice from your past
Wants to know you so very well
Now that you're in my life at last
You've been through hell I can tell

There's a broken heart beating on and on
I want you to know
That a little voice carries on and on
I want you to know

Hold on, hold on, I'll be there
Hold on, I'll be there

'Cause I feel what you feel
When you've had enough
Of washing up on the shore
A light will break through the storm
