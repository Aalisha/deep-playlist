pathetic creatures,
walking endless,
pathetic species,
lost in a myth
breeding like rats,
glorious glimpse at the heavens
casting down on shallow threads
over horizons that lay unlimited
sunlight upon my face
crazy world, crazy girl
lost in the sunlight
slaughtered, murdered
over tragic century
spreading claiming
a victim's plea
don't find me misleading, deceiving
i am what i seem
a symbol a product a broken culture
