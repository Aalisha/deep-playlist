I tried to do my best
but nothing seems to be alive
cause every time I speak
I see your walls falling
and now
when I come around you all are
on your knees
So, what can you say?
did I fail?

You know that
I try to do the best I can
but you don't care
and I swear

I swear I'll never be like you
and that's the truth
cause I can see
that you are playing
hide and seek
with all my dreams
...
