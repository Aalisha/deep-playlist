Whitethorn blossom just comes floating down
Down on the June breeze
Like summer snow on the ground
Long grass sways from side to side
The creatures are coming in here
They're coming in from far and wide
Here where everything changes and grows
Here where everything changes and grows
Here where everything changes and grows
They come to see the seasons different shows
