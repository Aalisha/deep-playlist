I am an angel, stands in the corner, nobody sees me
Invisible angel, makes certain signals, only I know what they me

Dogs and demons walks in my head
I am deep under pressure
I understand what I have to do now
I know I'm just following orders

They crucify me again and again
I won't stay on the cross
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows what I've lost
