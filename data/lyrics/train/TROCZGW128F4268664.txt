What is her name?
That caravan girl
What is her name?

You like the sun
A hazy day
What is her name?

You're just talkin'
Like there's something
Like you know
Domino, domino

Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah get away and bring it all back
Wanna run away, oh run away you and me
Yeah get away and bring it all back

Barefoot and game
...
