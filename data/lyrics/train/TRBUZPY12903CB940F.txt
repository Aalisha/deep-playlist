Well it's many a fine lady that's walked along beside me
With their flesh made of velvet and their eyes made of rain
Well some tried to hold me to hurt me to hide me
And some turned away not to look back again

One stood among them I remember most clearly
Well her sorrows were heavy and her laughter was slow
Well I courted her gently and I loved her most dearly
