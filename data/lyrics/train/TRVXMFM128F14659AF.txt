We go walking, hand in hand
All across the land it's East At Easter
People walking hand in hand
When ships are moving south it will be East at Easter
We will rock you, rock you little child
We will rock you, rock you little child
All across the land it's East At Easter
All across the land it's East At Easter

Things will lighten up the sky, East At Easter
