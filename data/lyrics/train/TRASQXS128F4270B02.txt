Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
Now I'm so blue

I'll never find another
Find another like you
To make all my dreams come true
What should I do

Sitting here looking at your picture
At a smile time can't erase
And like reflections in a mirror, I see you
Holdin' hands with a guy of a different face, yeah

Oh, since you've been gone I've been trembling
Of the need to hold you close
