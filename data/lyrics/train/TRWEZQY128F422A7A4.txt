Where's the liberation we've all dreamt of
It has abandoned the world and left us alone

Falling into oblivion
Never quite reaching bottom
No point of collision
Only cold striving the perception

We're without eyes
We're without ears
Lets all gather there
In this hypocrisy

Our lives
Come on, let's waste it away
Our lives,
Come on, let's waste it away
...
