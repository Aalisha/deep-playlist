[Featuring Cheech Marin from Cheech & Chong]
[Dialog Intro]
I said, "I smoke…. ever now and then"
But when I really need one I gotta have one.
Just dying, great tricks.
Yeah, so?
So to the 6.9 that was a double deuce.
You said something about, "It's on".
You see? That's all.
What does this thing do? Oh there it goes.
Where are you going?
I'm right here.
What are you doing?
I'll do black and white trip.
Aha
Yo gotta get 'em X skin on the black and white.
Yeah, of course.
See what it is? It's like an in between thing
I didn't know. Where, where is, where is the switch?
Like, I'm not black, I'm not white
I'm kind, you know.
Where is the switch?
Where is what switch?
The black and white switch.
Oh you gotta get it fixed up? Right over here.
You see, this is dust, every, over here is dust.
Danny.
What up? Is that your love?
Yeah.
Really?
I love B & B que's
So…
So the only reason I barbeque on 'em on Wednesday's
Because he fuckin' fuckin' falls in the grill.
Look here.
What was that?
Little fuckin' tooth.
Carlos did it! [laugh]

Hey now, you can do it on command?
