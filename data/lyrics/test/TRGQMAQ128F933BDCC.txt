By the first rays of dawn, I rise up by the cold morning light,
And I'm on my way
Soon the sound of my horse will be breaking the silence of a brand new day

No one can see my face as I hide in the dark of my jet black cloak
Nor a man or a child could ever know why I ride by their homes

For I bring the truth to all who will
Be wise enough to hear the words I speak
But no one seems to believe

[chorus]
Call me madman, I bring you madness
Call me seer, I bring you fears
