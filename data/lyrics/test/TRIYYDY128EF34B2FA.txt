She's got a little piece of heaven and she hides it in her heart, 
Wears it on her sleeve until everything falls apart
I do i don't it you it's true
We're better off live through this shouting out dying proof
The harder they come, the harder they fall 
Keep you head held high when your back's to the wall 
...
