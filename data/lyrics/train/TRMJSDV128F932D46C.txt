Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart Baby, baby
I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt(Think it over) After I've been good to you?(Think it over) After I've been sweet to you? Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
