Your time has come the full moon's in the air
Hear the cry of the jackal in the hills
Scent of smoke fills your nostrils
as the wind blows back your hair
Paint the canvas black if you will

Watch out there's a man who wants your soul
It won't be long till he finds you
Don't look back at the shadow on the wall
