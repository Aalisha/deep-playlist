We fall down but we get up
We fall down but we get up
We fall down but we get up, oh yes
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down
But we couldn't stay there and got up, sing that

We fall down but we get up
We fall down but we get up
We fall down but we get up
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down and got up

We fall down but we get up
We fall down but we get up
We fall down but we get up
For a saint is just a sinner who fell down and got up
