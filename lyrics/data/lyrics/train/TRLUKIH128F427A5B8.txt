For a time I felt my faith it must be hiding
Searching through the sky
Hoping to find a way, a way
To get me through the day
Wonder where I belong
Is this where I should stay

Chorus:
You Lift me up when I am falling
You're my friend when I was calling
Now I'm on top of the world,
Top of the whole wide world
Yeah you always been believing
Give my life a whole new meaning
Now I'm on top of the world,
Top of the whole wide world

It's the strength in me
