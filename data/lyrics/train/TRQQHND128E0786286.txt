Nineteen ninety mother fuckin' six
That's that shit though
Get the motherfuckin' squad packed
We got to pull these shoes out like carpet, word is bond
Test the crew with the guns and let's get this shit on

Why, must I be like that? Why, must I pack the gat?
On my left, niggaz be rollin' with the ruckus
Ready to get deep bust rounds upon some suckaz
Heard PPP and LOD is a bunch of crazy motherfuckers
Journey to the land is on
The winner of the spittin' bomb marathon
The fuck you up lierathon, whatever you choose
Prepare to lose that title

Turnin' vital situations suicidal, my idols, is my uncles
Who started smokin' weed outta Bibles
Gave me a puff when I bust my first rifle
Menstruation cycles, I give bitches
Bring your craziest nigga, I'll give stitches
Whateva, go crew for crew, blow for blow
Bang your headpiece
And sniff the snow off your hoe

I keep it rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin'
I keep it rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin'

Ask yourself man
How ugly do you have to be to be a hardcore M. C.?
Niggaz be fooled by my plaques and my light skin complexture
