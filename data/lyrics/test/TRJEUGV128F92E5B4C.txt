I-I-I-I-I'm through,
I-I-I-I-I'm through,
I-I-I-I-I'm through,
I-I'm through with you

I-I-I-I-I'm through
I-I-I-I-I'm through
I-I-I-I-I'm through
I-I'm through with you

Right back where we started,
falling apart at the seams.
You tagged your name on my heart and,
I sat there and let it bleed.

Sweetheart so,
Now this is goodbye.

I'm letting you go.
You're letting me down.
Been caught in your rain, and I almost drowned.
I'm letting you go.
Our love's black and blue.
How many words does it take to say I'm through?

I-I-I-I-I'm through
...
