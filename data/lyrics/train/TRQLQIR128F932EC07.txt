You show up like a hurricane
All hungry-eyed and weather-stained
The clock forgets to tick and I the same
I died the day you disappeared
So why would you be welcome here
Ride the wind that brought you back away

No you can't come in
No you can't come in

I cannot stop my rebel hands
From pulling out the pots and pans
...
