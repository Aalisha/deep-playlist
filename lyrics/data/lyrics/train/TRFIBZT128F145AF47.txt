We were just startin' out on a dream,
young enough to believe
Everyone was on our side,
and no one would deceive
But sometimes the truth gets served on a knife,
you gotta stand up and fight
We turned to each other and kicked it in gear
To earn our rock 'n' roll right
Whoa-oh - in a world full of heartache,
jealousy wears a friendly face
Whoa-oh - we can hold on,
you can't keep a fast car out of the race

Chorus:
Give it all you got, rev it up, rev it up
...
