Is it cruel or kind not to speak my mind
And to lie to you, rather than hurt you?
Well I'll confess all of my sins
After several large gins
But still I'll hide from you
And hide what's inside from you.

And alarm bells ring
When you say your heart still sings
When your with me
Oh won't you please forgive me
But I no longer hear the music
Oh no no no no no

And all the memories of the pubs
And the clubs and the drugs and the tubs
We shared together
They'll stay with me forever
But all the highs and the lows
And the tos and the fros
...
