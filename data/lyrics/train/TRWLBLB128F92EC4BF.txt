Who's that girl with the Bible in her hands
The smile on her face, she doesn't get it, I don't understand
The way she walks with her head in the clouds
She doesn't care who laughs, walks right through the crowd

That's right, that's me, I don't care what you think
People talk all day, I don't care what they say

You think I'm delirious, a typical reaction
Aren't you curious about my satisfaction
Maybe you're envious, a little curious
...
