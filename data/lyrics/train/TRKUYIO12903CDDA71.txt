On a pitch black highway lookin' for a road
Sleepin' on a stormy bed, honey, who will be your coat
Came to be my drivin' wheel, you came to be my man
Now you're rollin' like a baby boy in the backseat of a van

Holy waters, holy way
Holy waters, sweetest way

Mississippi and Missouri
Where the sun swims with the moon
Rainbows run through chapel rooms
Pourin' honey by the spoon
