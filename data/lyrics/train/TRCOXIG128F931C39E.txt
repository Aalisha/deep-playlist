I got more glocks and tecks than you
Still seein' bodies wit' da muthafuckin' chalk around 'em
I got more glocks and tecks than you
Still seein' bodies wit' da muthafuckin' chalk around 'em

I thought I told you
Never to trust, nobody but us
Now the gats must bust
Malicious black viper venomous
There's gonna be a lotta white chalk and brains on the sidewalk
I know you hear me, nigga talk

Nigga I'm weak-in, can't move my mouth to speakin'
They caught me creepin', deep in the hood peepin'
Larce was sneakin', they took me off my feet-in
But fucked up because my heart's still beatin'
I can't sleep, thinkin' how I'mma creep
Burners to squeeze but can't get up to help my ememies

Psychopath, when the days of wrath
Resolve the conflict, I'mma lick who did it
And who da fuck was wit' it till they dead covered blood red
Pumpin' lead till them bastards ain't got no head
The raw deal, bad era switched to terror
You could pray all day but still gone die anyway

I got more glocks and tecks than you
Still seein' bodies wit' da muthafuckin' chalk around 'em
I got more glocks and tecks than you
Still seein' bodies wit' da muthafuckin' chalk around 'em

I got more glocks and tecks than you
Still seein' bodies wit' da muthafuckin' chalk around 'em
I got more glocks and tecks than you
Still seein' bodies wit' da muthafuckin' chalk around 'em

When I come, I'm comin' right
Fuck tip toein' in the night
