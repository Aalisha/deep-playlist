This song goes out to everybody
who had somebody and you knew they was right
but some kind of way, you messed up anyhow
i remember when we first met
you said you wanted everything
i tried my best to make it happen but
what you said you didn't mean
now the tables turned
you feel like your bridge is burned
i just tried to be a man babe
you know you did the wrong thing girl
you don't understand me
i don't think you heard me
(i realized, i can't take the pain)
you know you hurt me bad baby
(but now i see, and now i know)
now i see you really wasn't ready for me
you can't handle a true man
one who really, really wants to be
you can't handle a true man
girl i give you my cream and everything
you can't handle a true man
one who really wants you to understand
you can't handle a true man
said i gave you all my lovin' babe, anytime you want it babe
i tried my best to give you right girl
