So quiet.
Another wasted night
The television steals the conversation.
Exhale.
Another wasted breath
again it goes unnoticed.

Please tell me you're just feeling tired,
cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break.
Out of touch. Out of time.
Please send me anything but signals that are mixed,
cause I can't read your rolling eyes.
Out of touch. Are we out of time?

Closed lipped
