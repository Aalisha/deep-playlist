You see it - I'm in it
One man freak show

Walk by me - Excite me
Moving real slow

Can't accept it, a comical parade
Can't accept it, part of the charade

Just hangin' by a thin thread
On borrowed time, think you've got it
The same habits, sure you won't mind

Can't accept it, a comical parade
Can't accept it, part of the charade

You think I don't know
What you're thinking
With my outreached hand
Yeah you think
You're the better man
The look in your eyes
What do you care
Look at all us freaks
Cluttering your city streets

You don't know me
