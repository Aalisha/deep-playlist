His kisses are like drugs... They turn your eyes inside your head
Your skin comes alive... And your brain shuts off.
Then he turns on you and he's cruel and heartless
You can't figure out what went wrong
He's a hungry baby far from his mother
And you're no comfort at all
There's something physical between you
...
