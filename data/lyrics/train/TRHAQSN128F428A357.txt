Sometimes I feel just like a fly in a soup bowl
Sometimes I feel like I'm on top of a heap
Sometimes I feel like I'm the king of the castle
Sometimes I feel like just a bump on a street

I got my highs and lows
Some days it's touch and go
But baby, this I know

When you're with me, I feel like singing
It's like I'm swinging the whole planet on the end of my chain
Oh, when you kiss me, my head starts spinnin'
It's like you're sending the adrenaline straight to my brain
And it feels right as rain, all my worries wash away when you're with me
