Why are you trembling so much
I don't think I ever felt so good
When all I need is to be free
Where I love you and you love me
Follow the circle sur la plage
On a mono coloured trip voyage
This is the colour of my world
Stay and watch me find another pearl.

Follow the gold leaf trail back where
We were young and didn't have a care
Tracing the circles that we made
I don't wanna live life in the shade
