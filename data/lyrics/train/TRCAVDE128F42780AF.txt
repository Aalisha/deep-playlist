With your head held high,
Pretend that you're alright without me.
And I'm better now that I'm without your fears.
And I'll write this down, sound it out.
And pretend there's something more left in your town.

I'll sit through months away from home without you.
And 4, 000 miles away is all I need,
For you to realize what you need.
But you're clean cut and exposed,
And I've never felt more at home.
But I'll pretend there's something more left in your town.

I'm falling in and out of love,
Finally stopping what we were made of.
"Oh, you're done."
