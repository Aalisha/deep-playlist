I can't count the barns I've passed
Painted red, white and black
See Rock City
And up ahead there's a turn
Take me right through Gatlinburg

Right about now

Her hair still wet from her bath
She's sitting on the front porch
With a glass of iced tea
In my sweatshirt, in her bare feet
This I gotta see

If I hurry I can catch
