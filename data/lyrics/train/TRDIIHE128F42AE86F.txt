She lures you in with intention
Looks like the girl next door
But it's blood and sticky floors
that really turn her on

She's got a body to die for
You touch it and you will
She's got a face of an angel
and an urge to kill

She's sanctified by death

Hey! Stay away from the lady night
Hey! Don't you mess with the devil's bride
You gotta pull out!
Can't you feel the darkness falling?
Get the hell out!
Can't you hear the heaven's roaring?
The Deadite girls gone wild
...
