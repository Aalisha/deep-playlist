Jimmy Carter ran for president again
You voted for who you want but the government wins
Its not a question of who can do the job
Its just a matter of how much money you have

(Chorus)

In the world war three
World war three
Where do I stand in this form of power?
Where do I fit in this government?
I find no choice
Third world war
And your the victims
Third world war
