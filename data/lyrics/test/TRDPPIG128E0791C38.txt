Real niggas ride wit' us
You haters gotta ride the bus
Smoke till when my brain gon' bust
Bank account so plush, the fed's on us

Real niggas ride wit' us
You haters gotta ride the bus
Smoke till when my brain gon' bust
Bank account so plush, the fed's on us

Kyjuan's a preppy hippy, cross the bridgy of Mississippi
I slang thangs, make bread, easy like Jiffy
Call me a cool nigga or a Mr. Refriger
Kids ask me "Mr. can you get crunk and jiggy?"

I reply quickly, bottle of Andres or Crissy
Smoke backyard or sticky, my man, watch me get busy
I wake up with two dimes, both named Nikki
I'm a playa dirty, no passion marks, no hickies

Cats make me sick when I roll through y'all city
Lookin' like angry mad, face mad, teeth gritty
You gon' make me go back into my days of U-City
Cornrows, penny bros and new Dickies

Ahh shit, when situation looks shitty
I got that thang with me, plus I Puff like Diddy
You niggas can't hang with me, or pop the pain with me
So wrap some mo' and hop in the Range with me

No picture me rollin', Optimo, glocka four-four
Four-do' Range Rov', mink with matchin' Kangol
Whole hood like "Oh", freakin' 'em out they mind
D's with diamonds on 'em, jackers, I know they want 'em

Not, you see the watch, Rollie or G-shot
You hear me four, five blocks before you see me, that's the knock
I need not speak on that, I speak on Zack
And how he better fix my shit or give my eight G's back
