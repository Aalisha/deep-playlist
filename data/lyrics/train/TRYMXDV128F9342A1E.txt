Link of innocence...
Imagine a link to all humans
The one who's bounded to our life...

See the chains. cycle path... a fragment is deteriorating

Time, the hint is unsealed, noxious mind
Eminent forlorn trade between and his guiltless force
The new born child at the height of innocence
Time, the hint is unsealed, noxious mind
...
