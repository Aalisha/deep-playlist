Don't you love the sound
Of the last laugh, my friend
Don't you love the sound
Of the last laugh, at the end

Down in the gutter
With the mad old soldiers
Down in the scuppers
With the drunken sailors
Down in the gutter
With the mad old soldiers
But the last laugh, baby is yours

And don't you love the sound
Of the last laugh goin' down
...
