She said oh my, oh no, not I
I was just busy watching everyone go by
Outside the shite bar, in your old red car
Me and your girlfriend and your sister with the big scar

I said oh Christ, I told you twice
It's just not easy going through all these things thrice
What's this I once heard, you drive a bluebird
You got no money for the petrol, that's what I heard

And it's alright, she'll be sucking fingers all night
Wearing those shoes, oh any excuse to go to the gang fight
And though she's alright, everybody says she's uptight
Sick in the head, but first in the bed
So easy to be Friday's nightmare

I said oh no, oh please just go
