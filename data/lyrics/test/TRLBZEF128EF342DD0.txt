I'm not gonna to patronise ya
But trying to write down why I like ya
It doesn't make it any better
To just steal kind words off Phil Spector

And I know all these tired cliches
But I don't know which cliche to say
Because cliches don't have any impact
So I guess I will be matter-of-fact

Cos... It's so good to know ya
I just don't know how to show ya

I love you, you know that
Don't you?
I love you
