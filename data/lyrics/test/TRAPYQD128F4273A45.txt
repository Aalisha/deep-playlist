The night we met, I knew I...
Needed you so!
And if i had the chance I'd.
Never let you go

So why dont you say you love me?
I'll make you so proud of me!
We'll make them turn their heads
Everyplace we go

So wont you be my... (be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby. (my one and only baby)
Take me my darling (be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now (my one and only baby)
Wont wont wont you be my. (be my, be my baby)
Be my little baby (my one and only baby)
Take me my darling (be my, be my baby)
Be my baby now (be my one and only baby)
...
