Why must I fit into your box
To make this relationship work
I am human, not perfection
I can't be your superwoman
(La da da da da da da da)
Can't be superwoman
(La da da da da da da da)
Not superwoman

Please tell me what you wanna do
'cause I can't waste anymore time
It seems nothing's good enough for you
Tryin'a please you drives me outta my mind
Who do you think I'm supposed to be
This flawless thing is how you picture me
But I can't measure up to that, and I won't try
'cause I can only be me, baby
So why

Why must I fit into your box
To make this relationship work (I'm only human)
I am human, not perfection
