Oh oh oh release me!
You know not what you do
Oh release me!
You're splitting my head in two
Oh you tease me!
Do you know just what you do?
I have got to reach her
She knows just what to do

And you can do what you want
You always do what you want

Oh release me!
I am a walking arab state
Oh release me!
