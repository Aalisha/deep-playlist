Risen from the ashes, the ashes of the dreams you burned
So many wars these eyes have seen
So many agonies my soul went through

Just in darkness my eyes see the world
There is nothing more to lose

Forlorn in desperation, the fruits of your power
A world of slaves and servants - the only aim to rule them all
