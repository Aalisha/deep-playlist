Bridge 1:
Imagine a dirt road full of potholes
With a creek bank and some cane poles catchin channel cat
I'm a little more country than that

Bridge 2:
Picture a small town, with an old hound
Layin out front of the courthouse
While the ol men chew the fat

I'm a little more country than that
I just want to make sure you know just who your gettin under this old hat
