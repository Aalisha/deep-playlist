You say you want me to say "I'm sorry."
But I don't have to and I don't want to say it
'Cause I'm not sorry

I play the game and I can't really say that I like it
Can't really say that I hate it
Can't really say that I paid attention

When grey skies turn blue
I'll come back for you
My mind can't change my heart there's nothing I can do

When grey skies turn blue
When dreams do come true
Will you be the way that I remember you
