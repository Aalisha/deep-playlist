I will sing you a song, I will save you a dance
If you just give me a chance
A little piece of your mind, little bit of your time
To let it unwind
See...

What is it I don't get, something I'll never forget
Something good that hasn't even started yet
It's so good that it's bad
It might be the best damn thing that I ever had...

Happen to me, well you see
I'm still melting
Over you, I'm still holding on
And baby well,
I'm still melting

'Cause I fell hard, but not hard enough...
