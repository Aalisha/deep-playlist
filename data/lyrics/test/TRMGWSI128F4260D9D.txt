This song is about a girl from? beach

Please forgive me, I know that I've done wrong
Please forgive me, but it's time that I moved on
Please forgive me, I know that I've done wrong
Please forgive me, but it's time that I moved on

It's 3 AM and it's time for me to leave
The real you it's all that I see
You tell me "hey, don't come back again"
And I say "Fuck you!" I know this is the end

And I've been down this road before
And this is something that I can't ignore
And one day you're up, the next day you're down
...
