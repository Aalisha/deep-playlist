what did you think you'd get with me?
what did you think that you still needed?
is this everything you wished it'd be?
that we can both just be defeated?

i don't remember birthday cards
i don't remember easter weekends
i never said this wasn't hard
but my resolve is getting weakened

and if you're tired of waiting
well you can rest your heart right on this needle
...
