She tears you down, darlin'

She tears you down, darlin'
Says you're nothing at all
She tears you down, down, down
She tears you down, when I pick you up!

She tears you down, darlin'
Says you're nothing at all
She tears you down, down, down
She tears you down, when I pick you up!

She tears you down, darlin'
Says you're nothing at all
She tears you down, down, down
She tears you down, when I pick you up!

She tears you down, darlin'
Says you're nothing at all
She tears you down, down, down
She tears you down, when I pick you up!
