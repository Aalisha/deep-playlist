Ah, let me tell y? all a little story
'Bout this time I was down and out
Just goes to prove there's always a light on
But if you look, you'll find it's inside of you
So I want y'all to listen up

I've been sitting here all night
Tryin' to make this thing work out right
I've been getting nowhere fast
Suddenly, as I lay down on the bed
I hear a little voice inside my head
It says, "If you want to do it girl, you got to have some faith
Come over here and listen, hurry up or you'll be late"

Listen to my story, listen to me well
Oh, I will make you a believer
If you're feeling sorry for yourself, I can tell now
Oh, I will make you a believer
