Life - capitulation
Death - salvation
Welcome to the nightmare
Twenty four / seven
Numb reflections of a dying mind
The will to exist long before declined
Thus I leave this mass grave earth behind
When everything seems so trivial, I take a look at you
Children of scorn... when souls search for their haven
