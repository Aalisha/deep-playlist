(intro)
yeah heeey

(verse 1)
We've been together for a while now
growing stronger everyday now
feel so good and there is no doubt
I will stay with you
as each morning brings the sun rise
and the flowers bloom in spring time
on my loving you can rely
I will stay with you

(chorus)
Oh I will stay with you
through your ups and your downs
I will stay with you
with no one else is round
when the dark clouds away
I will stay by your side
and I know will be all right
I will stay with you
