dialing
It's me.
Listen, something is wrong.
The trace. It went dead. Two hours ago.
...
I don't know,
Everything was in place until then.
One second it was there,
And then he just disappeared.
...
Don't blame me.
I told them not to use the cheap stuff!
...
No, we have no idea.
We've lost him completely.
Later.

dialing
Listen.
We found the hotel he was staying in.
Somebody must have tipped him off.
He was already gone.
