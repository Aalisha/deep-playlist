She didn't wanna be, she didn't wanna know
She couldn't run away cause she was crazy
She gave it all away, she saw her baby break
And in the air it hung that she was dull razors
And I said, I wanna fill you up, I wanna break you, I wanna give you up
From one another, another one should come to one another
No one should come between us
Still I was lonely, and she was by my side, my one and only
Knows that she could never hide
I couldn't feel her, and it was just a game, cause I was lonely and she was crazy
Rat-tat-tat, ka boo boom, now take that, and just a bit of this
...
