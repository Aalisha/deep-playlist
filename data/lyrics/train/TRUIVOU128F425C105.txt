When this old world starts
getting me down
And people are just too much
for me face
I climb way up
to the top of the stairs
And all my cares
just drift right into space
On the roof
It's peaceful as can be
And there the world below
Can't bother me
let me tell you knowin
and have come home
feelin' tired and beat
and go up where the air
is freash and sweet
and get away
from the hustlin' crowd
and all that rat race noise
down in the street
all up high on this roof
the only place I know
where you just have to wish
...
