To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean
To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm
To work in the service of life and the living

To be part of the movement and part of the growing
Part of beginning to understand

Aye, Calypso, the places you've been to
The things that you've taught us, the stories you tell
