Father oh Father
hear me if you can
is it true what they say
that life is a dream
I don't understand
the things that make rain in my eyes
are they real or are they lies

You know i hear so much about you now
I'd give anything
to go on a little boat with you
talk about the scheme of things
on a little boat with you

Father oh Father
guide me if you can
or give me the chance to follow you home
