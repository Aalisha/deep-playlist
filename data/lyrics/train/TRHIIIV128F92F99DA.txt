Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
When all is said and all is done,
You shall be the only one.
Can i lay my head down? Will you say,
Every little thing's going to be ok?
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
It starts in the head and it begins,
It starts and it changes everything,
It starts and it never fades away.
Can I lay my head down? Will you say,
Every little thing's going to be ok?
