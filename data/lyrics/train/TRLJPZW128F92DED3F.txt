I'm closing in, I'm feeling fine
You've lit the candles, poured the wine
I've dreamed up great scenarios, won't come down
With my face pressed up to the glass
Your house inviting; night time; jass
And I arrive in this masterpiece, this pumpkin
But despite this romantic range of violins
Detoxication tends to be unkind
And if these laws of love do not appeal to you
I'll try and convince myself these rules are just applied

And this is love I can't defend
...
