Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real

Livin' under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
All's I got is time
Got no meanin', just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn)
(It fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
(This I feel as the dawn)

Well, I'm half the man I used to be
