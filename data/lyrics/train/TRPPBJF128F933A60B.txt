My eyes are closed
I feel alone
there is something
on the inside
dripping and screaming
to get out

to be released and to let loose
and free

how can I feel love
when love was something
I never had?

how can I
feel.

talk to me
do you know me,
and who I am
I am
I am your flesh

tell me who I am,
...
