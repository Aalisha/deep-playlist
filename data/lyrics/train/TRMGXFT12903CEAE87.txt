I bet you think we didn't know
Didn't even see the tides change
But it's a small, small world, girl
Getting even smaller every day

I bet you think we didn't know
Didn't even see the tides change
But it's a small, small world, girl
Getting even smaller every day

You can fake that smile
For a hollow while
But the kids all learn
Once those bridges burn

Ssssssssssssss

The trash washes up to shore
Even in this landlocked place
The shit gets thicker
It's toxic
