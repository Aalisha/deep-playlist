I'm gonna tell all you girls a secret, please keep it to yourself
I'm gonna tell all you girls a secret, please, please keep it to yourself
Why it's a million dollar secret, so please don't tell nobody else
Now if you're a real young girl
And you want to get rich quick
Get an old, old man, girls
And that'll be the lick
You know those old men are fine, yes they know just what to do
They'll give you lots of loving, but they'll give you a whole lot of money too(and I love that part)Now he'll tickle you under your chin
And he'll scratch you on your side
