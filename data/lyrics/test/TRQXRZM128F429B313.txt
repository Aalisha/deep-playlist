I'll understand if you're not feeling well enough to write
I'll understand if you've got way too many things to do
you see I've been sitting here for an hour trying to finish what I started
Now it seems every line gets harder and never really what I wanna say
So I hope this letter finds you well
It's taken me a little while to sit and spell out everything I wanna say
But I think I'm ready to convey
You're the reason that I play at all
You got me thinking how a song can change it all
If there's any wonder how I made it through
Well I tell them that's between me and you, well
Someday I'll thank you if I see you around
But for now I'll just keep this letter to myself
And a song I'll probably never sing for you
Like a satellite
Spinning 'round my head in sound
...
