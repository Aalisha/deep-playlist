Have you ever felt a thunder inside your heart
Holding on to all the shit that's gonna tear you apart
If you can't free yourself there ain't no brand new start
So you gotta let go

I once had a friend who lived in an eastern town
He moved back home and called and started hanging around
But every time I tried to talk to him he'd put me down
So I gotta let go

Nobody knows who you are
Nobody cares who you are
Nobody knows why you feel
Disconnected (Disconnected)
Disconnected

Maybe it's the way I'm told I ought to look and feel
Maybe it's because my mind is so easy to steal
That I'm living in a world where nothing here is really real
So I gotta let go
