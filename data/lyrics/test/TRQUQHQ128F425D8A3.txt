Born Helena Jane
With a restless soul
She moved west to california
Became a center-fold

But once you change your name
Well the pieces fall
Now she hardly recognizes herself at all

And there's never any rain, when you want it
A hollow little game, and you've won it
Looking for a thrill but you've done it all

So long, put your blue jeans back on girl
Go home
Remember hollywood is not america
So long put your blue jeans back on girl
...
