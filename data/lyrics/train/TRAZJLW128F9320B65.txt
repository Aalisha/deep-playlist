I remember when all the games began
Remember every little lie
And every last goodbye.

Promises you broke, Words you choked on
And I never walked away. It's still a mystery to me.
Well I'm so empty.
I'm better off without you

You're better off without me.
Well you're so unclean!
I'm better off without you
You're better off without me.

The lying!
The bleeding!
The screaming!
Was tearing me apart!

The hatred!
Deceiving!
