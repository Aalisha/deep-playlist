The moon comes up and the moon goes down
Another sleepless night, another sleepless town
I got you, I got you
Whenever I think about what I lost
I change my mind instead to what I still got
Cause I got you, I said I got you

You can call me papa
And I'll call you baby
Don't forget your mama's my, baby too
Wherever you go, whatever you do
...
