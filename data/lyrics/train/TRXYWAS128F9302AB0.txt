The Tourists are on a train
The Tourists are on a train
So Far away
So Far away

They'll never be silent
They're always alone
They travel and travel
They want to come home

I just try
all the time
to struggle the history
of my life
The Tourist inside of me

The Tourists are on a train
The Tourists are on a train
So Far away
So Far away
