Well in North Carolina way back in the hills me and my old pappy and he had him a still
He brewed white lightnin till the sun went down
Then he'd fill him up a jug and he'd pass it around
Mighty mighty pleasin my pappy's corn squeezin (whew white lightnin)
Well the G men T men revenoers too searchin for the place where he made his brew
They were lookin tryin' to book him but my pappy kept on cookin
(Whew white lightnin)
