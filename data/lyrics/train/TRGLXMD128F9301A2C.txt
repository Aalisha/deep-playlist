Sometimes the morning coffee's way too strong.
and Sometimes what she says she says all wrong.

Right or Wrong, she's there beside me,
Like only a friend would be!
And that's close enough to perfect for me.

now, She's been known to wear her pants too tight.
And drinkin' puts her out just like a light.
Heaven knows she's not an angel,
but she'd really like to be.
And that's close enough to perfect for me.
