You and I are are two of a kind
Two restless spirits of the same mind
We know the risks and yet we stay
We're brave or crazy or stubborn that way

You live your life
In the shadow of a whirlwind
It might just come back again
I'll hold on to you
You hold on to me
And we'll stand our ground on Tornado Alley

The old ones talk about the one in '43
