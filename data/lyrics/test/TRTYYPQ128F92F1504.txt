On my way home
Oh... on my way home
On my way home
Oh... On my way home
I'm on my way home
Oh oh oh.on my way home.
Fix it Jesus Fix It like you said you would

I have to cry sometimes
Oh.on my way home
I have to cry sometimes
Oh.on my way home
Sometime sangin with tears all in my eyes
Oh oh oh on my way home
Fix it Jesus, fix it like you said you would.

Friends get few sometimes
