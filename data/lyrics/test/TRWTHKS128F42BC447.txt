Like a young and courageous fool
Ready to take on the night
You came dressed to kill all of the boys
And it looks like you've done enough right

You say that love is your only rule
It kinda comes from the heart
When it all comes down to what lovers do
You fall in love and just fall apart

But that's the chance you take with a lonely heart
...
