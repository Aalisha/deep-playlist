He's got a sunburn on his left arm
From hangin' out a Peterbilt window
Got a wife and 3 kids on the farm
Drivin' just as fast as he can go, yeah

Minneapolis in his rear view
He's a dead headin' to Tulsa
Got the hammer down on 82
With every mile marker getting' closer, I said

Hey, he's a trucker man
Tryin' to get home just as fast as he can
Those redeye runs are taking their toll
