Chorus:
Love one another, sisters and brothers
Love one another -- hey ... hey ...
Love one another, father and mother
Love one another

Everybody needs a little tenderness
Everybody needs a release
from the cell they lock themselves in
Love is the only peace

Everybody needs, everybody cries
Everybody bleeds, everybody dies
Everybody dreams, everybody wakes
Everybody makes mistakes
...
