The devil's in the chemicals
The demon's in the DNA
(repeated X 4)

I've got this darkness in me
And there's no one to blame
It's just my human nature
It's just my human stain

With curses on the tongues of angels
And poison in the wishing wells
Our karma's burning down the temples
Without your soul, what will you sell
