you cut her name into your heart
you burn his name into your arm
cast out the pig you kiss as love
heaven is closed for now you are alone

this too, this too shall pass away
this too, this too will pass away
listen, Steven is singing to you
the pain of life you wipe away

a reason,
that a fine gray ash shall recall these days
inquire
the serpent
to become a rag of a dream interred
you arrive
and you wave your hand as if she could care
but she can't
...
