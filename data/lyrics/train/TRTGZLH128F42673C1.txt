You have never changed your ways
You think that you can own me like a slave
And I want to walk away
But every time I try, you're in my face

You say, I could have it all
Trust you, you will never let me fall
And my heart feels bound to your control
But my spirit says no no no

Stop right there, suddenly temptation's flying
Everywhere and you think you've got me down
Well, think again, I'm not your friend
It's plain to see, I'm not your property

Stop right there, suddenly temptation's flying
Everywhere and you think you've got me down
Well, think again, I'm not your friend
Don't play with me, I'm not your property

Ring! Brrp! It's you once again
...
