I'm a homeless man with my thumb in the wind
I sure miss my kin but then again,
I'm on the road with a song for you.

I took a step, I lost a bet,
They cut off my tongue now they're full of regret,
Careful what you say if they ain't gonna listen anyway.

Just make the cash, bet on the past,
Everybody's so afraid to be last,
You can't take back everything you leave behind.

Chorus:
Is everybody so ashamed, for letting it all slide.
Is everybody so afraid, Mr. Dylan's hard rain was fair warning.

On a shake down in the alley,
Breaking people's faces gonna start you up a rally,
I've never seen a day in the sun with gun,
...
