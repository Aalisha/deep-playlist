Jennifer Juniper, lives upon the hill
Jennifer Juniper, sitting very still

Is she sleeping? I don't think so
Is she breathing? Yes, very low
Whatcha doing, Jennifer, my love?

Jennifer Juniper, rides a dappled mare
Jennifer Juniper, lilacs in her hair

Is she dreaming? Yes, I think so
Is she pretty? Yes, ever so
Whatcha doing, Jennifer, my love?
