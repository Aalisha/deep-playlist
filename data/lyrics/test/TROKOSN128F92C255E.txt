If you feel like a spy and your cover’s been blown
and the company’s suddenly bringing you home
and your compass is spinning and you’re all alone
but the bosses assure you of your safety zone

There’s a secret society running the show
and the real information has nowhere to go
’cause the media moguls are funding campaigns
to ensure that the two party system remains
As discussions arrive they hit too close to home
but the only opinion you got is your own

I know the sun is gonna come out again
...
