They call me
... Cool Calm Pedro

Stage is like a sideshow
Watch 'em die slow
Sly flow
Good fellow
One helluva ride, yo
Buck ya lid
Take a supplement
Aspirations on hold
Why fold?
-Madness
Can't miss
There's only one atlas
One world, one girl
And shes probably an actress
Act a part, new year, new cast
Blast off, new pilot still lost
At cost
But much more than you bargained for
...
