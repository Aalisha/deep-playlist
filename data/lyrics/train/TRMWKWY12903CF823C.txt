Stay close, the flames are closing in.
Breathe deep, the smoke is on its way.
Look west, the ocean is calling.
Follow. The air that still remains.
Oh, Can you feel it, the fire is burning.
Oh, can you taste it. the smoke in the air...
That fills up your lungs.

Our world is burning. We're all caught in the flames.
These walls are coming down. this is our time.
I feel the heat is rising. Do you feel the burn?
