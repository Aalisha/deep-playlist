And he's a fucked-up man with a fucked up life
Two dirty kids and an ugly wife
Standard clothes and standard car
Except of all that's what you are
The only time he's having fun
Is when he's up his neighbour's bum
Kids himself that he's a man
Never happy with a plan
The roads are full, he's got no class
But when's his head's right up his arse
But we don't like the things you do
And we will not remember you
