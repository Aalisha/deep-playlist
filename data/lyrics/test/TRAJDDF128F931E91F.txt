Sometimes when the words just fail you
you're scared but you know they're wrong
I find that I get much further when I turn my thoughts to song

You know why you love this season
The joy that the snow can bring
So why should you stop to reason
Just open your heart and sing

Let there be snow
Let there be snow
Deep I remind the autumns behind
You let the wind blow

This is a time of year to make
Figurines across the lake
Such a magical sight
When the world dresses up in white
Whoa let there be snow

The days may grow short and grayer
The cold may nibble at your nose
But once there's a six-inch layer
Those soft flakes beneath your toes
