(Yeah, yeah!)
(Ahh, ye-ah!)

I live my life like there's no tomorrow
All I've got, I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills

(Ooh, yeah!)
(Ahh!) Runnin' with the devil (Ahh-hah! Yeah-ah!)
(Woo-hoo-oo!) Runnin' with the devil
(Yes I am! Yeah!)

(Woooo!)

(Woo!)
