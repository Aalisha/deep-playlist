Oh!
...2, 3, 4!
Helpless!
My eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside!
You sealed your demise when you
Took what was mine!
Don't try to stop me from avenging this world!

No voice to be heard
Waking the demon!
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows!

Watch the blood flow!
There's not much longer
so don't try and hide
Your body's weakening
walk to the light!
Those painful times so alone, so ashamed!
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain!
