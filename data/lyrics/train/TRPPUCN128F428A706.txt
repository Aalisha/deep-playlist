This is so out but I like it
So outside but I'm in
This is so out but it's alright
Way out there in the spheres

Silver streamers streaking strangely
Swirling savage savants grazing
Smoking on a pink pacifier
Genitalia in a hair dryer

This is so out but I like it (maybe)
So outside but I'm in (I think)
This is so out but it's alright
Way out there in the spheres
