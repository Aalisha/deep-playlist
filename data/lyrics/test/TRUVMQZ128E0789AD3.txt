Whenever I meet you
You give me such a runaround
The more that I see you
The more you just put me down

Even in front of all my friends
You just wanna hurt me (Hurt me)
But I'll never give up hoping
'Till I make you mine, ohoho

The harder I try (Ooohooohooohooohooo)
The further away from me it's slipping
I go on trying (Ooohooo) to make you love me
(Love me, love me, love me)

I wanted to see you (See you)
I call you on the telephone
Just to be near you (Near you)
They tell me that you're not home

I guess you could say that I'm a fool
