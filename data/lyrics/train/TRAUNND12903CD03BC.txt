Soon you'll find out
It's all an act
You'll find out
What happens next
In this script
Tell me something

Take your final bow.

Oh, you've failed me once again
You've made another mess
C'mon and tell me
(How this story ends)
Right from the start I gave you my all
I got a ticket in my hand
To get away from it all
But, oh, you've made a mess of things.

With such deceiving eyes
Wrapped up in all those lies
