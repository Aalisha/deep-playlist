First you take my heart
In the palm of your hand
And you squeeze it tight
Then you take my mind
And play with it all night
You take my pride
And throw it up against the wall
You take me in your arms baby
And bounce me like a rubber ball
I ain't complaining
What you're doing you see'

Cos this hurting feeling is
Oh so good for me
