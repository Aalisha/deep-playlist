Sometimes I swear
We’d be better off alone in this world
We’d be better off alone

You push me further and further away
(from you)
I’m beginning to lose, every bit of faith I had in you

We should end this war
With half our men already dead
If I could save them I would
The bodies cover every inch of the trail

You push me further and further away
...
