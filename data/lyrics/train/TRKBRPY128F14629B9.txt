If it don't fit, don't force it
 (Don't force it, force it)
You go out of the room and ease on it
 (Let love just ease on in)

If it don't fit, don't force it
 (Don't force it, force it)
Gonna fucking little help
It needs a chance

If it don't fit, don't force it
 (Don't force it, force it)
Mind control is what it's all about
 (No, no, no)
...
