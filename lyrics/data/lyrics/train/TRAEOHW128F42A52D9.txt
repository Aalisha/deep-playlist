In every story, every secret told
You are not the first to wake up
To learn your lines before you have the part
You woke up early and you walk up torn
You the temporary boarder
The heat wave humming in the house of cards

You spun chapter into rapture there
Yeah, you were as brave as traffic
You chased the spotlight into her arms
And you forgot that you could file the knot
That you were still the person sleeping
The heat wave humming in the house of cards

A play for the girl
A cross for a hook
Sinking into the green sea wonder
Under the sea
Walking the floor
Over the waves the wheeling thunder
...
