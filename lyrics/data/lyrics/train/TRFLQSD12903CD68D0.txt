We have to find a better way
Out of this tragedy
As the battle rages on
Blood stains the ground we're on
My ears hear only screams
Brave soldiers are dying
One Spartan stands alone and shouts
This war is ours.
This war is ours!

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the frontlines of war
We have to find a better way
And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all
We have to find a better way

Through the fire and the flames
A sea of dead, drives men insane
We march the fight into the cold
...
