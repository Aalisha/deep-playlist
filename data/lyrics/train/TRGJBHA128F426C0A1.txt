Left you at eight
You came back at nine
'Cause you got love
It sure is fine

I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door

An hour can be
Such a long long time
When you're in heat
?

I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
I said uh I, I wanna love you some more
C'mon now and open up your door
...
