Its been a while since last we caught up
Collaborate bout old times and those schemes that we thought up
laugh about our mums wooden spoons hitting us
Cocoa brown boys with red bums
Funny ah just to recollect ooh reminess back then when we were kids

My man we got history running deep beneath the physical
Connected together never rolling as individual
though time separated flesh
The spirits ain't departed, we still getting started progressing to catching wreck
Respect remains mutual no speech ever need be spoken
Disconnect affiliation cat you must be joking
It ain't even like we out growing each other ever since birth
We placed upon this earth as brothers

Now I know we said boys up hoes down
Course things going to change when that one is found
Back seat to L.O.V.E
It's all good cause know that we
Can keep it tight for real for life
No matter what communicate for sure even through the strife

I'm a be there for you keep connection tight like family

[Chorus:]

Now bro I'll be there for you
yaw hold tight and I'll keep it true
No doubt
In those times of need I'm there indeed
brother see you don't even have to speak

For real uso I'll be there for you
yaw hold tight and I'll keep it true
No question
In those times of need I'm there indeed
see sole you don't even have to speak
...
