When life has slipped behind this isolation
Cruelty & hatred have become
The cause of those whose eyes are full of wanting
The truth will still abandon none...
So you must carry this light into the darkness
You shall be a star unto the night
You will find hope alive among the hopeless
That is your purpose to this life

The lips draw words
And hands find actions
Still there is more within one heart
And to the silence, will you answer?
Before the chaos, will you come?

Do not injustice to another
Defend the weak & innocent
May truth & honor always guide you
Let courage find a life within
Stand up when no one else is willing
...
