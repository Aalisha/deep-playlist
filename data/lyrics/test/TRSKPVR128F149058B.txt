The agouyadji is sounding
Able bodied men rise up
In today's world, honor is becoming rare
So let us examine our consciences
And seek to refine our race
Our language is not the least important factor
In our dignity
So let us learn it
And let us teach it

From here to the Fouta, Poular is spoken
From Somalia to Mali
From Benin to Guinea
From Cameroon to Gambia
From Egypt to Ethiopia, they speak Poular
If all these people came together
They'd know we have the same mother
Whatever the difference in our dialect
We have the same father
I called Coumba
And Coumba replied
I called Samba, Samba replied likewise
