Are you ready?

This place inside my mind, a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances, what if I should die?
(A place inside my brain, another)

You don't know the chances, what if I should die?
(A place inside my brain, another)
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances, I'm so blind
Blind, blind
