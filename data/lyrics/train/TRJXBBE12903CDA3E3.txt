I don't need no license
To sign on no line
And I don't need no preacher
To tell me you're mine
I don't need no diamonds
I don't need no new bride
I just need you, baby
To look me in the eyes

I know they have a hard time
And your Daddy don't approve
But I don't need your Daddy
Telling us what we should do

Now there's a million questions
I could ask about our lives
But I only need one answer
To get me through the night
