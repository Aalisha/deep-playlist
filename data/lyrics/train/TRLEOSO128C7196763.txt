Stop the war in Rhodesia
Stop the war in Mozambique

When you take up your daily paper
All you read, Mister Editor
What's going on, on the land?
What a ball of confusion

Confusion here
Confusion there
You have the whole men despair
You have the whole men despair

Somebody got to rescue Jah children
Somebody got to give an helping hand

Black against black every day
Too much wolves are in the pack
Got to give an helping hand
