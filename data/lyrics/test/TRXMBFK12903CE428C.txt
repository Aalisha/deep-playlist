Forget the bullshit, turn up the tunes, we don't care for what's wrong or right
Don't be a stooge 'cause we're not in the mood and we're ready to kick ass
tonight
Don't be an ass, just raise up your glass, carving the only command
Smashing the load until we explode and we don't need to hear from you man...
'cause we don't give a damn
...
