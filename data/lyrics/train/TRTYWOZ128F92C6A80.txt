Breakin' it lightly across your back and mine.
Twistin' it slowly as we reach for the line.
Yes they're screamin' it softly now so we can't hear the way.
And it's never too late. Never.

If we don't take the time to create.
Why don't you, why don't you come back love?

If you know why we walk the broken road.
Could you get by if I would take the load?
Pushin' it through avoid a situation.
What's it to you?

Runnin' on empty with a long way to go.
Nothin' upsets me but the fact that I know.
