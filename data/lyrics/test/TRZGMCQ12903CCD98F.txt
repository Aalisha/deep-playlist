Fields of empty feelings
Living life without regret
Walking through the fire
A senseless journey through these times
Living in the fast lane
A moment plots what lies ahead
Rough and ready driver
Don't you want to stop the chase?

Here's someone who stood up
Here's someone who woke up
Someone who learned the meaning
Running at the speed of life
Here's someone who helped out
Here's someone without doubt
Someone who feels true feelings
And running at the speed of life

Life is but a stopping point
A resting place along the road to eternity
