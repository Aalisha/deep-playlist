Our little keepsake patterns, the ones that leave us shaking,
Take rest in sound pollution
Take rest in the vibration
A moment with our bodies exposed and decomposing

I'll stay awake to find this fear of lost & losing
hang on, to whatever that you believe in
(this might mean) this might mean the world to you
but as for me, I've given up on our religion

a safe way (of letting go of nothing)
and they'll lie (why must I do this to myself?)
why can you say? (I've heard this one a thousand times before)
at daylight (I'll break commitments of the night before)
