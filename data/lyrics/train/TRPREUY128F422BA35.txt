Show her the way

Show her the way

Church Lady, can you spare her a song,
Cos Glory Halleluiah, ain't enough for her wrongs,
Church Lady, can she borrow some time,
Cos she needs to sit down and reflect on her behind.
She can't see the forest for the trees,

And no child is deserving
Of an open door policy

Church Lady, can you talk her some sense,
She may be a friend of mine,
But her values are worth two cents.
I've tried my point of view,
All of her friends have tried it too,
So Church Lady, sing her that song, sing her that song.

Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah,
Let them show you the way
(Let 'em show you the way)
Glory, (Halleluiah) Halleluiah,
