Just suppose I’m nearly done
And the crows are coming in wide
I could leave here for a while
At the most I’m leaving inside
Just suppose I’m killing time
Since the tide’s still keeping me here
Maybe I’m just feeling fine
And this smile is never sincere

I could be somebody
I could be somebody else
I could save some money
I could be somewhere else

Sell up and follow the signs
Get up and feel ourselves
