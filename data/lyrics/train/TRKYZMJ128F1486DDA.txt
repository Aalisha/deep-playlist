Yellow sun is shining in the afternoon,
I'd really like to tell you but I feel it's too soon.
My actions are dictated by the phase of the moon,
The phase of the moon.

The sun, it isn't hiding when it sets on you,
It's not a coward like me and I know that it's true.
Waiting for the darkness now is all I can do,
It's all I can do.
