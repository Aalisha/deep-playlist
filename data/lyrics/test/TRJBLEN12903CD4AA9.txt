(Edelman)

Now you and I descended
On a world with innocent hopes
We traveled that criss-crossed highway
And cascaded down the slopes.

It's time to look at who we are
And let the feelings show
It's time to leave the past now
And grow.

I've listened to endless voices
I've proceeded with endless tact
I've figured in endless numbers
And I've worked on the traits I lacked.

I've come too far, the time is right
The devil's made his pact
