(Hey Hey!)
(Hey Hey!)

The cops, the bullies, they're always on my case
The morons, the dickheads, they're cramping up my space
The nazis, the biggots, the crime being done
The left wing, the right wing, their preaching makes me dumb

GO TO HELL! you little twit
GO TO HELL! you piece of shit
GO TO HELL! you low life twerp
