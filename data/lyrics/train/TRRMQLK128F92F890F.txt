The advent of christ shall matter not to us
abortus bastard, our nemesis be gone
Yearning to entice the cowardice in our enemy
so hasten the plague when all the rate shall come

Kings from the east
wise but three
Plotting for the prophecy of the unborn saviour
of bottomless descent
To reap what was sown as the virginborn
at the behest of their death

Enraged in hate
wreaking havoc
...
