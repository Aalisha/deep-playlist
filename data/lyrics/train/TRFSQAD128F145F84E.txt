I? m lost in my head, been thinking all around
I gotta find the off-ramp to my heart

Stop-lights in a row when all I want is go
Drop into first and I? ll get home

It? s okay, I? m alright
I? m just a little rough around the edges of this life
Play it cool, you can always follow
Breadcrumbs in a line when you are lost

Little, little seeds grew into trouble trees
