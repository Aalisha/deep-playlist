Station, happy station
Very special people you can meet at the station
Station, happy station (oh, happy station)
Glad and smiling faces come from different places
My suitcase and me we'll take a trip
It's a magic journey, I feel like burning
Lucky guy, follow me, you'll be alright
I'm crazy, don't you know
I'll never let you go
