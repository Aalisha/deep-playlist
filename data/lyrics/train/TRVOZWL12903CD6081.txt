A place to crash

I got you
No need to ask
I got you
Just get on the phone
I got you
Come and pick you up if I have to
What's weird about it
Is we're right at the end
And mad about it
Just figured it out in my head
I'm proud to say
I got you

Go ahead and say goodbye

I'll be alright
Go ahead and make me cry
I'll be alright
And when you need a place to run to
For better for worse
I got you

I got you
