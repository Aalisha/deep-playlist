Here you are again
Telling me you're sorry, baby
Telling me you wanna come home
Back home where you belong

There you again
Lying and alibiing
Singing that same old
Worn out song
Here it comes now

Hey, hey (I'm sorry, baby)
I can't hear you no more
(I'm sorry, baby)
Well, I've heard it all before
(I'm sorry, baby)

You ain't reaching me
No how, no way
No time til doomsday
I can't hear you no more
I can't hear you no more
