First I will describe the scene to you
Do you have it right?
In 1944 the Riegal she went down
She went down with 4, 000 prisoners
Asleep on board

Well now do you,
I want to know if you
Have it right, is it like
The borders of a dream
Have taken you inside?

The Riegel was a mighty ship
4, 000 prisoners strong
The Captain he was gallant
Or perhaps he was a prisoner, too
...
