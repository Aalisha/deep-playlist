You should have told me
Never should have sold me down the river
Wasn’t fair play
And I’m goin’ away, goodbye

I could do much better
Will you write me a letter of recommendation?
Say what you think
But please don’t stint on the praise

You can play any part
With a versatile heart
Sugar, soft and sweet
You made my life complete

When I sifted through the wreckage
And I read your message, it tore me apart
You’re lucky you can choose
Who you love and who you lose, that’s an art
