Let's go for a little walk under the moon of love
let's sit down and talk under the moon of love
I wanna tell you that I love and I want you to be my girl
little darling let's walk let's talk under the moon of love
You are looking so lovely under the moon of love
your eyes shining so brightly under the moon of love
I wanna go all the time and you'll be my love tonight
little darling let's walk let's talk under the moon of love
I wanna talk sweet talk and whisper things in your ear
