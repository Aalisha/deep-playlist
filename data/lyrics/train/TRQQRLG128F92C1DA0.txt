When i least expect it
the unexpected
when i wasn't looking
when i had no hope

when i stop believing
when i lost my place
it was there i found you
and i found my way

all roads lead to you
no matter where i am
i know that you are standing by my side
all roads lead to you
no matter where i've been
i know you've aways been my guiding light

and how'd you know that
i'd be here with you (here with you)
how did you see that nothing could replace ya (nothing's gonna replace you)
cuz no matter where i turn
...
