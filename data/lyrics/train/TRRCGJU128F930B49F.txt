It's been a long hot summer,
And I'm still trying to leave you alone.
But it's just getting hotter the more I try to let you go.

I don't want to feel this blue.
I want to be over you.
I don't want to feel this blue.
But I do.

It's been a hard year this fall,
And I still don't know where you're running from.
And the sky keeps on spinning.
The stars are running and hidin' from the sun.

I don't want to feel this blue.
I want to be over you.
I don't want to feel this blue.
But I do.

But love lost if the heart needs a reason to cry for,
