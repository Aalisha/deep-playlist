Well she talks with a whisper
And she smiles slow and shy
Well there's a mystery within her
That she keeps warm inside

Well she sits alone at the window
She walk with her head turned down
Would it hurt to let your feelings show
And you could turn your world around

Oh sht Diane
Won't you come out tonight
