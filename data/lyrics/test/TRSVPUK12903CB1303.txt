We're the two new people that moved to the middle of the block.
An' we're the talk of the town, an' don't you think we're not.
For we've got love an' happiness; people envy us, you see.
For we found Heaven right here on earth at Four-O-Thirty-Three.

Yes, we found what most people are lookin' for.
An' there's not a lotta money to spend on a real fine car.
But it's a window where a bird flies an' sings so free.
An' there's a whole lotta windows in this little house at Four-O-Thirty-Three.

The 4, 000 lot proves what true love can do.
