I ain't been doin' too right, since I met her last night
Some kinda burnin' breakfast, lost at work state of mind
We're meetin' here because, she mentioned that she loves
Some kinda sushi, veggie, raw and edgy natural stuff
And I'm feelin' out of place, but baby's on the way

I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy, my hands are sweatin' heavy
Somethin' she's got, got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool and end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey, baby's on the way
