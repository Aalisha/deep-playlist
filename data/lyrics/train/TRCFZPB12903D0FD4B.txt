Intro ' (Verse One)

Hello? [hello] I hear school girl callin,
Callin me on my phone
I tell flavor tell them gyptian aint home
I hear school callin, on my phone
And I tell my friend to tell them that I'm not at home
If they're looking for me, While I'm over here looking at them
I said they're wondering, where I am
While I'm at the studio building new song
I said they want I, to be their man
But they're not the same age as I am
So school girl'.

(Chorus)
Gwan a school go learn di golden rule
And don make no man cum use you turn ya inna foot stool
Gwan a school and take in ya lesson well
Cuz soon you can be da manager fi Sandals hotel. 
[Repeat]

Verse Two

When you check a stack, and ya hear dem whispers back
You see school girl sit down inna conductor lap
You know straight forward say dat him a feel up dat
