are you drifting, is there nowhere to go
life support is down and your systems low
are you cruising on your secondary cells
waiting for the bell (oh do you really think so)

disappointment has a house on that road
best to stay at home (oh do you really think so)

you're safe and warm inside
your chances pass you by
the question fills your mind
are you caught in a slipstream
