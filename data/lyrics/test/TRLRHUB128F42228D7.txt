Boo-Ya-Kaa, check my foul and my style
Never on the Isle, bucked shots as a juvenile
A little freestyle fanatic, I shot the rap addict
With an automatic, now I got static
See back in the days, I was a stone cold hood
Now I'm a paid hood, still up to no good
With my crew from the Heights and the Island
Still flippin' niggas, and we still be buckwildin'
I never changed, never rearranged my faness
Buck one time to your chest, through your vest
F.A.P. Franklin Avenue Posse, you can't stop me, cause my shits never sloppy
I'm always for a pack, a joint, and a burner
Flip a scene, coming from a teen/tin like Turner
Take it from another brother coming from the ghetto
Once I get my five eight, no need for protect so
I get paid to rip, step aside I'm a blow you
Don't try to shake my hand moneygrip, I don't know you
I'm just a hardcore, raw, straight from the ave
Leave another question and you might get blast
What! Bring the drama
I emerged in a rage, catching wreck on stage
Blowing up the spot, I leave my name engraved
