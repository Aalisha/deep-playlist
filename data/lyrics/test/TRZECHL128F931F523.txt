These immortal souls of ours
Scratching the window pane
Leave a ghost blood calling card
These immortal souls of ours
We take a pen to our lives
And a knife to our lies
Lost in a love of ourselves
Still we spit at heaven's gate
Crash the night in our dumb shoes
Driving galaxies down
You said we wore gloves
And spilling our souls
Keep talking
Keep talking
...
