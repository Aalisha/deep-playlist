Kitty calls me on the phone,
To say she's all alone
And needs somebody's there.
Crystal sees into the future,
Tells me that she's an asshole;
Should have, but who really cares.

I sit here and wonder if we are sharing a different world,
And all these making emotions whirling around me swirl;
I'm in love with everybody's girl.

Look at Brenda there with Luke,
She's giving him the boot,
Ah, but Kelly's standing by.
