You're at home, I'm away
And if all I can say
Is that this boy is still the same
It's the man inside that's changed
Front of the line but still behind
Seems like I'm trying way too hard
And like I haven't tried at all
Hard as stone but feeling all the weight
Feeling all the weight that's crushing me
When you come around
You're like a little slice of heaven when I'm coming down
Lifting me up above the clouds

I'll sleep tonight but the war's far from over
Tomorrow is no guarantee
If I don't return from this life of a soldier
Don't you be crying for me.
