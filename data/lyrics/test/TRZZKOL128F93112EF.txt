Dollars in the bank
Dollars in the bank
(Bank)
We be pulling rank
If you coming for the money
He ain't shootin' blanks
I ain't shootin' blanks
(Blanks)
Fire in my tank
That's what keep me runnin'
Got the money
Ru-ru-runnin'
Imma get my cake
You can never take it from me
My mind runnin'
My mind runnin'
Every Everyday
Like I got these bitches runnin'

Go out for the money
I'm always around
To come and take it from me

I let you down
Handle my business
Stay 100
My level is different
And none of you on it
I ain't playing games with you losers
I'm the type that he can do what he want
Got a shawty who gon ride wit me
I ain't gotta ask
You know she gon' run
Cause I come in fully loaded
When it come to this money don't choke me
Somebody shoulda warned me
That you better take notice
