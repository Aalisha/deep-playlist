You know it's about three o'clock when I looked at the time
And I had two more hours to go before I got to your love
And the time just kept ticking slower and slower
When I got to the front door
I thought about openin' the door with my key that
Seeing your lovely face right in front of me

Girl, I've been thinkin' Âbout you all day long
And I just could not wait, baby, to get home to you
Food, forget about the dinner, oh, honey
ÂCause the only thing I'm hungry for, oh, baby, is you
Just keep it comin', baby, come on

Don't stop your love (No, no)
Don't stop your love
Don't stop your love (I need it right now)
Don't stop your love

Unplug the phone, girl, so we won't be disturbed
But the way I want it, baby, is just you and me
Well, run your fingers through my hair, girl [Run your fingers through my hair], and love me down
ÂCause your lovin' is the only thing tonight, girl, that I need
Just keep it comin', baby, come on

Don't stop your love (No, no, ooh)
