Satan's day
Dominus recitus Satan's day
Deus diabolus Satans's day
Infernus animus Satan's day

Pestilence, silence, torture and death
When you wake up from your lies
Born into fire, black is thy breath
Your empire
Sacrilege, fire, murder and rape
Nightmare and torment arise
Burn on the pyre, find no escape
Now the time my dominator
All we need today
For hell we pray

St. Satan, St. Satan
When will you come, to welcome your son
St. Satan, St. Satan
