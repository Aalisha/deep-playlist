(Tim Buckley cover sung by Brendan Perry on the 4AD "13 year itch" Compilation)

Ah, it's a happy time inside my mind
When a melody does find a rhyme
Says to me I'm comin' home to stay
Oh, lord, home to stay
I'm comin' home to stay
Home to stay

Ah, lord, it's just the same old story
Something about love for glory
