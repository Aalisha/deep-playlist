Apocalypse Now
Mind over matter next batter be Tical
Put it on a platter how much uncut
Raw shit we dealin' wit, murder track what
Slang killin' it, touched

You feelin' it, in your bloodstream
Deadly venemous elixir
Hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All and together now, follow me, the Mista
Meth Candyman, farewell to the flesh

Death come in the scripture, two-thousand one
Bring the rap arma-gedde-on, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone
Wit all that wack shit, now you know
You dead wrong, one thousand lashes

Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank, snatch collars off, while ridin' off
Float boat big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation let the sharks, ani-maze

Somethin' sheist like, seven butcher knives, rollin' Rover style
Twice, finger itchy like lice hair fell out somethin'
To conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanca
Toy Tonka truck ten carat on ya monsta
