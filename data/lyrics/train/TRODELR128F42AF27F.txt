Every Friday afternoon, I hitch up the trailer,
Saddle up ol' Rock an' ice down the cooler
Drive that back road until it ends,
At the ropin' pen

There's rusted out pick-ups an' fancy rigs,
Twenty-thousand dollar horses, then there's my ol' stag,
But we're all the same the minute we ride in,
To the ropin' pen

Well I ain't no Clayo Speed,
But I give her hell,
Hell, you never can tell,
Some day, I just might be
