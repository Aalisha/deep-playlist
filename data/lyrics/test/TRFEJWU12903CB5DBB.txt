chocolate makes you happy
and it keeps you awake
as you unbutton
your top pants button
bewildered by the pain oh oh oh
chocolate makes you happy
as you deign to sing along
when you thrust two fingers
down your throat and
wash away what's wrong
oh oh oh
out of your mind with happiness
incredibly dumb, incredibly ugly
to have die the one you await for
all that you sign all that you sign
...
