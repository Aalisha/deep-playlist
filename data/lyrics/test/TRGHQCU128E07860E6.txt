feat. Musaliny-N-Maze

[Noreaga - talking]
Uh, (yeah), gangsta, killa (killa)
killa beats nigga (beats nigga) Iraqians (Iraqians)
Do it like this (send Iraq to the heavens)

[Noreaga]
Yo, yo, yo guns, wars, banana clips holdin
Tec nine's the wet clothin
These niggas heard we mack moldin
It's all gravy how I fuckin my eighties
No women, no babies, Versace niggas get crump crazy
You think I'm soft how I'm up in the loft
And gettin sucked off, with some Cristal on my cock
And plus duck sauce and two Spanish bitches lickin it off
Nah, ain't shit changed I'm still pickin you off
I stay drunk wit a lot of reefer
These niggas gay like the guard that was in "Sleepers"
Two ways without beepers
These little niggas more leapers
I got gangstas that gangbang on all creatures
Shoot your whole face up and fucked up your features
Iraq soldier, see the Henny made me fall over
And still fuck 'til I'm dead sober
I don't care about your balls, your hood, or your weed
Fuck your whack ass thoughts I can throw some speed

[Chorus] - 2X
