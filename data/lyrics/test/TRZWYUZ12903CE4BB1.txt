Mommy says she don't love daddy anymore,
Daddy says mommy walking out the door,
Sister says she's getting married to escape,
Brother says enlisting sounds just great.

Me, I don't know who to believe,
Me, I don't know how to maintain the world that used to be.

'Cause everyone is leaving me,
Everyone is leaving me,
Everyone is leaving me,
Everyone.
