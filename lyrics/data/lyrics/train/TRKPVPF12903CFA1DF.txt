Decisive, the end result is clear
Our future has come to an end
The tables turned now
Too late for final sacrifice
The Hills of Megiddo are near

Relentless, this fury has become
the scourge of our supremacy
A silent witness, the bearer of it all
We all succumb to our own destiny

To face the powers that be
We'll end this journey, and see, only,
That the anger never dies
...
