He was just a boy of seventeen
And I was older by a year
And we spent everything we ever made
To get away from here

We got married in the winter time
At the Open Doors Cafe
No matter how he tried
He couldn't find the peace of mind to stay, oh, no

All the glitter out in Hollywood
All the stars that never shine
Oh, they can't hold a candle to your wind
Could you roll me, roll me back in time?

Got a job and worked the early shift
And I spent hours by the phone
Promises are easy to forget
