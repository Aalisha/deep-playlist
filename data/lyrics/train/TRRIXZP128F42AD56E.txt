While we're young and beautiful
Kiss me like you mean it
Treat me like I'm special
Cover me with sweetness
'Cause a time will come
When I'm not so young and beautiful

While we're young and beautiful
Living free and easy
Here without a worry
Dancing in our bare feet
'Cause when the summer's done
When I not be so young and beautiful

It's a crazy ride
