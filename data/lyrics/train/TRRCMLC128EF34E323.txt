I should've said no no no
I should've taken it slow
You had me falling too fast for his pretty boy charms
But girls can close their eyes pretend to fantasize
That it's alright to lay there in his arms
I didn't know at the time he would take me on down the line
And leave my heart on the roadside broken down
