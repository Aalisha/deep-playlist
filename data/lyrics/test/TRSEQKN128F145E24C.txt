Love has never looked so beautiful

I can't believe it
You're standing here in front of me
Like a promise
Like a breath of honesty
I surrender to this feeling in my soul
And my heart's desire
Can't pretend I'm not about to lose control
I'm falling for the fire

Chorus
Love has never ever looked so beautiful
Never ever felt so wonderful
So wonderful
There's no turning back
I'm falling for the fire
Love is making me believe in miracles
Making me believe I'm home again
I'm whole again
