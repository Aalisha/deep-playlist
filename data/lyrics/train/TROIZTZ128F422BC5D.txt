I've tried and I've tried to forget about you
just little lies for myself and you…
…you were innocent and true as can be
and now you are not here with me

I've tried and I've tried to forget about you
just little lies for myself and you…
…you were innocent and true as can be
and now you are not here with me

I can't go on and keep on and keep on
crying inside and blame destiny...
I can't go on and keep on and keep on
...
