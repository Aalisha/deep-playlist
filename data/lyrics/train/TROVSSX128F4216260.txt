My name is Cool Calm Pete
And I live in America

Cool and Calm
I'm calm and cool
I'm cool and calm
I'm calm and cool

I live in a trusting, forceful, dynamic society and that is why I like to get away from (?) as often as possible

Pardon me sir, could you give us some assistance please?
Yea, glad to help
We're looking for a Dog Creek Road, and that would be near the town of Redwood
If I was going to Dog Creek Road, I sure as hell wouldn't start from here
But supposin' you had to?
