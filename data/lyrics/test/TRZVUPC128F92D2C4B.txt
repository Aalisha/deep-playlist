If you're looking for a star
Then chances are you won't go far
When you're searching in an awful funny way
And there's a glow from above
Your last chance for love
And it won't be here when morning shows her hand
It's a love you've been shown
And a time for being alone
'Cause people like me just keep running back for more

And now Caroline stop crying
It won't seem like a long long time
And I'll be here when the Rockies thaw in spring
...
