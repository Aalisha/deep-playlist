I see the moon, a million stars are out tonight
Gentle reminders of the way You are
A sea of glass, a raging storm has come to pass
You show Your face in an array of ways


My feet may venture to the ground
But You will never let me down
I can't hold it in
My soul is screaming

(chorus)
Hey you, I'm into Jesus
Hey you, I'm into Jesus, oh yeah
Hey you, I'm into Jesus
Hey you, I've seen the truth and I believe


I know You're there
