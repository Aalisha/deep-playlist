Can you help me out can you lend me a hand
It's safe to say that I'm stuck again
Trapped between this life and the light
I just can't figure out, how to make it right

A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more

Something more
I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine

With every tomorrow comes another life
I feel it's gonna rain for days and days
I feel it's gonna rain
I tried to figure out I can't understand
