Ten thirty in this hotel room
You and I locked in the gloom
Lost out of love once again
But I've got you here with me friend

Cos you're here in my arms, here in my arms
Here in my arms, here in arms

Last time I looked it was nine
You know that all things then were fine
Now I've gone and lost it again
But I've got you here with me friend
...
