is this the end of all discretion
has turning in left us tuning out
and so this special song
goes to my first all
the ocean avenue, yeah

and this winter will set aside our feelings
cool it down, we'll set the standards
for the emotionless we'll raise the stakes
cool it down, we're cooling down

is this the end of our obsession
saying you love them just a little to much
...
