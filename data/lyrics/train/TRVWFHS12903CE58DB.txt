Minutely planned professional crime assassination at night
Cold-blooded killers on a midnight hunt for a girl who cannot
fight
Kidnapped, tortured, skinned alive victim of wanton abuse
Without protection a life is lost condemned for speaking the
truth

Manic
Panic will you suffer endlessly
From agents of brutality

Speak the truth pay the price
