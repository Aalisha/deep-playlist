Am I supposed by now just to let it go?
It's been dark and empty since I don't know
On my way downstairs, I had to turn back home
I don't dare leaving the telephone, wait

I pray the rain, the rain won't fall
Oh, Lord, don't let it fall
Keep my brother safe from harm
I pray the wind, the wind will blow
Oh, Lord, just let it blow
Blow him back into my arms

Your mother called me up, said your car was found
It was parked unlocked, but you weren't around
She was crying, saying that there's still hope
I said, yeah, for sure, Lord, but I felt none

I pray the rain, the rain won't fall
Oh, Lord, don't let it fall
Keep my brother safe from harm
I pray the wind, the wind will blow
