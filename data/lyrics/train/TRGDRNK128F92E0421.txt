Homecoming, I'm coming
My sweet mistake
Summer's over, hope it's not too late
I'm pacing, impatient
Up in my head
Taken back to the sidewalk where we met

And carved out our names
Do you remember that?

I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Did you take off while I was gone?
I missed it all, I messed you up, I missed you
I'm coming home, I wanna know
When all the leaves begin to fall
If I'm falling, falling apart for you

Descending, I'm spinning
Lost all defense
...
