Yeah, c'mon, yeah
Some of this ol' hype shit, you know what I'm saying?
Fuck with it, punk nigga, yeah

Here we go with this ill shit, I knew I had to kick it
Bout these punk ass niggas in the town thinking they wicked
It's my time, thought I couldn't spit rhymes?
Well my shit grinds, so kick back and watch me get mine
You fake ass popping that shit but can't fade
Talking about you're better, but nigga who's getting paid?
So wake up, your wack ass is weak as fuck
Raise up off my fucking nuts cause nigga your shit sucks
Fake rapper with your fat-ass ego
Boy you ain't moving shit in the E-A-S-T O
Cause it's the city where the boys side, fool
(Awwwwwwww shit!) Now you know what they riding to
Straight funk from the Crew that's Dangerous
And punk niggas like you can't hang with us
So get your bitch ass back before you get smacked
With the motherfucking rat-tat-tat-tat-tat

Motherfuckers don't fuck around, with the big Banks from Oaktown
