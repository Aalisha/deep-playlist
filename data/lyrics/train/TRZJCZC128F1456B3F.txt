Why are you selling dreams
Of who you wish you could be?
A prince in all of the magazines
They'd have no words for the man I've seen
You talk real fast 'fore they see your face

Would they love you
If they knew all the things we know?
We've got these images
We need them to be true
Not ready to believe
We're no more insecure than you

But then there're girls like me
Who sit appauled by what we've seen
We know the truth about you
Now you're the prince of all the magazines
That is a dangerous thing

Now would they love you
If they knew all the things that we know?
Those golden boys are all a fraud
Don't believe their show
Now would they love you
If they knew all the things that we know
Golden boy life ain't a video

But then there're girls like me
Who sit appauled by what we've seen
We know the truth about you
Now you're the prince of all the magazines
That is a dangerous thing

Golden boy

Place you in these robes
