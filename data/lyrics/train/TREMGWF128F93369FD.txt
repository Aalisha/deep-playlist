1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul, and Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves sex
Count em

Babe, pick a night
To come out and play
If it's alright
What do you say?

Merrier the more
Triple fun that way
Twister on the floor
What do you say?

Are - you in
Livin' in sin is the new thing (yeah)
Are - you in
I am countin'!

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees
And I'm caught in between
Count em
1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul & Mary
Gettin' down with 3P
Everybody loves sex
Count em

1, 2, 3
