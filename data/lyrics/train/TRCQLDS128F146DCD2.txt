There's no use pretending
Things are just the same
When here we are now ending
The laughter's turned to pain
I know when I say sorry
Girl, that no apology
Can say how much I love you, mm
How much you really mean to me, yeah

*Say it's not too late
For me to say I'm sorry
For all the hurt
I put you through, yeah
Say I'm not too late
I'm out of my mind with worry
Say it's not too late

Say it's not too late for us
...
