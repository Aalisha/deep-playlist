Hey girl, excuse me miss for sayin' this but
It's your world can I come inside?
Let's hit the floor dance a bit until we're sweatin'
An so much more I'll take you on a ride oh, yeah

I see that look in your eyes, I can tell you're feelin' me
But actin' like you're shy don't be afraid to let go
Just give into the rhythm and I'll take control, yeah

Let me show you the way I move
You know that you want me to
So baby, groove with me

There ain't nothin' I wouldn't do
I'm gettin' into you
So baby, groove with me

Let me show ya, I wanna know ya

Don't be afraid, I don't bite unless you want it
And so I'll wait till I am invited
I can tell you're turned on by it come on let's play
I promise that you'll like it girl
