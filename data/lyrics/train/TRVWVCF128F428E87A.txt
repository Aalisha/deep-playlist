Fee fi fo fum she said
Something’s wrong
Is this just a breakdown
Yes, another breakdown
And when you’re gone,
yes she said
Can I come?
I never want to break-up
She never wants to break-up
No, I never want to wake up
I never meant to wake up

And now we’ve left our friends behind
Even so isn’t this a waste of time
Giving me a friendly line?
And when our thoughts just last a day
Even so isn’t this the price I pay?
Everything is a-ok
