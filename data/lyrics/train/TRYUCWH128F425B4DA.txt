We're two spinning spheres
Two spinning spheres
In a bed of stars

Silence is super
Staring into space
I wonder where you are

You're all that I've ever needed
I know that you want to feel it

Drift out into the darkness
Lost out on the horizon
It's alright, it's alright
I'll be your respirator
I'll be your pressure suit
It's alright, it's alright

Violently clear
The upper atmosphere
Raging out your heart
Somewhere far beneath
Your pointed tognue and teeth
Is where you really are

I don't want to be be forgiven
But drag you down from where you are
...
