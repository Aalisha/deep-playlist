...and the music don't feel like it did [3x]
When I, felt it with you

Oh uh oh uh

Whenever I hear good-byes
Reminds me, baby, of you! 
I break down and cry
Next time I'll be true! yeah... 

Feels as if we lost romance
Reminds me, baby, of you! 
I took a crazy chance
Next time I'll be true! 

Footsteps on the dance floor
Reminds me, baby, of you! 
Teardrops in my eyes... 
Next time I'll be true! yeah... 
...
