It's goddamn freezing in this city
There's no heat in my room
It's like it never stops raining
And I'm soaked through
My life's become this tightrope act
One wrong step, I'm off the edge
So now I'm scared to death of an ear infection
It's like I'm chasing ambulances
Trying to pull out something from the wreckage
Nothing ever goes the way we fucking planned it

Cause most days are bad days
We can't wait for someone to pull me off of the concrete
We stopped standing proud a year ago now
What you see is just a shell of who I used to be
