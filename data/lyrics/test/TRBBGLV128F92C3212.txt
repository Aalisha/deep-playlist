In my hands, good fortune
Caress my equal, with slightest touch.
The sound of your voice keeps me still
And I'm sorry I avoid your questions.

And I'd never falter now we're even

Take while you can its never even
(WHILE WE LAY STILL)
And I'd never falter now we're even
(EXPLAIN WHY YOU WILL)
Take while you can its never even
