how do i explain myself,
could it be written in a book
is it visual?
cuz everything i'm doing girl it just don't seem to be enough
oh what am i supposed to do?
how am i to show my love for you
everything i do, girl its all for you

Girl give me half a chance
I'll give you what you've been missin' in a man
Girl give me half a chance
I'll give you what you've been missin' in a man

you got your own set rules
and i'm tired of learning from you
so excuse me while i get away
i'll be better off in my own space
