You know you took my heart and you broke it apart
Why did I love baby, you, right at the start
You know you took my love throw it away
You gonna want my love someday
Well, bye bye baby

Well I thought your love was oh so true
Then you stabbed me baby, yeah started loving you
You know you took my heart threw it away
You gonna want my love someday
Well, bye bye baby
