putting filth on the map
for all the changing to reap
challenge the martyrs
who cry wolf in the movements aloud
drain the resource
indelible mark in memoirs of lore
incapacitate-how much more of this annihilation
narrowed, confined, captured, absorbed
cross the evidence to take them out
dodging motive - battle scarred
...
