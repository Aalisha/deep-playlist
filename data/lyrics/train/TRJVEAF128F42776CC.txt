I got the sweetest heist, million in cash, another 3 in ice
Who can I trust? Cuban'll bust plus? good thief the night?
Here's the plan (plan), we nab the man, bring a camcorder
Grab his fam, and run the train on his granddaughter
Nah chill, that's too ill, for real I'd rather kill somethin
Here's the deal, we shatter his grill, and drill fuck him
Oral torture, no doubt, the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops he's guaranteed to cap and give up all the morsels
It's settled, blitt up, put on your metal, foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto, a rebel of chance, the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash, level advance
Takin a chance, I've only got one my hundred shot
tommy shotguns my judge jury and Johnny Cochran

Chorus:

Movin on the stash, first we get the cash
For the fast money, I smash a niggaz shit like a crash dummy
Ask money where the safe, anybody move gettin laced
Look at my face and I'ma shoot the place
