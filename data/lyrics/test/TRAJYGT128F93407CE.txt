Can we sit here for a while
Never like to see you shy
Panic like a little child
Trying to find his way back home
Find his way back home, find his way back home
Feel the air come closing in before the hurricanes begin
Strands of hope come whispering
And you can ask me anything
Ask me anything, ask me anything
