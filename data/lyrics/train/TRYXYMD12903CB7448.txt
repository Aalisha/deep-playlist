I still remember that hazy September
I've been waiting for somebody like you
To come back around

We would walk in the park every Saturday
Brand new, all in love, kissing time away
You was all up on me, it was plain to see
That I was your girl

And way back then it was the simple things
Anklets, nameplates that you gave to me
Sweet Tarts, Ring Pops, had that candy bling
And you were my world

Now I wish I could go back and make time stop
I would take this love throwback from the top
Go DJ, play my song
And I'mma think about you all night long

Back in the day we were in love, we're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish we was in love again
Back in the day we were in love, we're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish we was in love again

Irresponsible things we would do
...
