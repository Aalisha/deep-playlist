To get with me, 2000
Yo Pete, I think they ready for you
Give y'all some of me
YEAH

Petey Pablo - Petey Pab
Petey Pablo - Petey Pab
Petey Pablo - Petey Pab
Petey Pablo Pablo Pablo

Petey Pablo - Petey Pab

Petey Pablo Pablo Pablo

What's up witcha hot boys, hot girls
Came in to see dogg didn't ya 'cause
Uh-huh, love is love
That's the reason I hold it down for y'all
Y'all muh'fuckas do the same for Pun
But I'ma keep fuckin' with y'all
Kick it like I been kickin' with y'all
I owe it all to y'all
Y'all was the muh'fuckas that gave a goddamn
Anything I got, nigga you can get half
Word on my grandmama that passed
You stay right by a nigga like me and you'll get blessed
Ain't fuckin' with that, down 'cause of what I got
That's how a nigga get sprung in the back part
Muh'fucka fakin' the funk, and then a nigga get jumped on
And they don't know where it come from
Bet they do, punk-ass tell the truth
Petey done what he said he'd do
