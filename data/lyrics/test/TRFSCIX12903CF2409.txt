Come into my own
Come into my own
Look inside myself
See the path that I've chosen
It's time for me to lose the pain I've found

Hating every day
Never lived for the moment
I want to scream until this cell corodes
I've thrown it all away
I've thrown it all away
It's time for me, to take this back myself

Chorus
