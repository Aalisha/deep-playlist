Like the moon moves the tides
You influence my mind
Like the planets and the stars
Keep the rhythm to your time
Are you happy with him
Yes, I'll let you go

Girl, I love you
Cherie, I love you so
Girl, I love you
I was a fool to let you go

Like the alchemist
Who couldn't resist the devil's kiss
Base metal into gold
And the psychiatrist
Who's battling deep within his own soul
I was like them down the hole

Girl, I love you
Cherie, I love you so
Girl, I love you
I was a fool to let you go

All the memories of our life
Like Venice in the spring
New York City summers
...
