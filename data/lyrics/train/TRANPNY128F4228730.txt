the meaning my my life is all but gone
i have been betrayed by my own
a rollercoaser ride of emotions
pounding through the chambers of my heart
exploiting me like an open book
as i speak i can feel a tormenting pain within myself
creating an un-nerving disorder
controlling me body and soul until i am none
i fear the end
growing stronger every second increasing every day
there's no way of knowing how much more i can take
will there be a solution to this pain that i feel
wake up mother fucker cause you know the deal
wake up mother fucker cause you know the deal bitch
visions of anger
