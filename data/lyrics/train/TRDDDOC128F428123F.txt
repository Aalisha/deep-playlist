Another morning late in bed
Staring at the ceiling
Thinking of you

Another song within my head
Where did I go wrong
Thinking of you

I will try to carry on
I'll sing another lovesong

I'm no superhero
I'm no Mister Bond
I'm your Agent Zero
I'm just myself
My love is blind
I'll wait until the end of time

Walking tall or standing still
...
