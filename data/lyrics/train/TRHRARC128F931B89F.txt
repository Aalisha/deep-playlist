A fire bun!

Yah hear mi
Life ova death
Hey let me tell yu dis again
I could have been one of the most notorious
I got saved by the king and his grace is so glorious
I could have been one of the most devastating i got saved
By the king and his love is everlasting

Burn away the wicked lifestyle and the wicked in is and the wicked man dem profile
Im so happy to be rastafari style and me ova come the wicked with just a smile
Den me start to live my life and do worth while
In a love n harmony i try not to be vial now bove the well salasi will provide
And my conscious is clear me na nuttin na hide rastafari

I could have been one of the most notorious
I got saved by the king and his grace is so glorious
