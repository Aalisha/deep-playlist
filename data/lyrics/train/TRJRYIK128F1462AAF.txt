I can't believe I hung around with you
All this time
You drove me crazy with your O.C.D
Girl you're out of your mind
I'm counting on UFOs to beam me up
I just don't know
how long I can take this shit
I'm over it, girl you gotta go

It's over, we're over
Just like in crimson and clover
We're sinking and I'm thinking
How the hell did we get so stupid?
It's the end, ex-girlfriend
I don't care what you think of me now
So long you're gone
This is the break up song

One more thing before you go
