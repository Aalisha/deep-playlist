I can't believe how far I've come
now watch me stumble and come undone
if you take away these memories
then all that's left is just me

Cause I don't want this
and I don't need this
and I don't feel this
it seems that even though she's with me
I can't shake this
and I can't fake this
and I won't take this anymore

So you choose to break my heart
I should have seen this from the start
