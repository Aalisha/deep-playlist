I don't care what your name is, I don't care where you're from
I don't care if you're a star and I don't care if you ain't known
I don't care what your name is, I don't care where you're from
I don't care if you're a star and I don't care if you ain't known
If you ain't ready for us you'll be blown to smithereens
Left by the curb holding pieces of your dreams
Shattered into pieces like glass
Nothing left but memories of how it once was
With every single line we crush

Turning everything in your imagination straight to dust
Gats we bust with the lyrical, spit the spiritual on the darkness
Blade you started this now Riq be the artist
Kiss the girls, spin your world, flip your world
Twist your world, trip your girl, strip her pearls
Smear her ruby red lipstick and this chick gets
All physically up on me, my ma warned me
Watch them sweet ones, never eat one, them is tricky
Tried to get me, chick slipped me a mickey

I can't maintain, it's messing with my brain
Good side, bad side is driving me insane
Said I can't maintain, it's messing with my brain
Good side, bad side is driving me insane
I can't maintain, it's messing with my brain
Good side, bad side is driving me insane
Said I can't maintain, it's messing with my brain
Good side, bad side is driving me insane
