I'm the pitcher you're the catcher
I ain't talking bout baseball
You're a sweet switch hitter
I want it all
Ah, if you wanna play the game baby
Ah, wanna play it right now
I can show you how to do it
I'm gonna show you how
Flesh and fire, fire, I want you
Come on give it to me
Burn me with your love
