Today I woke up
And you were gone
The whole day wondering
What I did wrong
It's like I'm falling from a
A mountaintop
My heart keeps pounding
And it won't stop

Can you see this
Hell I'm leaving
I'm not giving up

Will you crawl to me?
Will you fall with me?
I'll never crawl to you
I've done it all for you
...
