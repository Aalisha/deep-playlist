All she knows
Is what she's told
Is fact and fantasy
Life in harmony

She stands alone
Shadow on the wall
Gently lit her silhouette
Reflecting tall
She spins to look
On my command
The shutter clicks she blinks
And laughs offhand

I slow the pace
And pause to stop and think
Here is a moment
Where good fortune winks

Eyes that sparkle
And eyes that shine
Hazel eyes smile
As they peer into mine
Canvas blank
...
