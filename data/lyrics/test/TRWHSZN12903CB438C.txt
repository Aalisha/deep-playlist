It's pain from the start all your dreams are ripped apart
You fall down with this shit with all this hate
With this creature of mine shut me out of your life
Before i reach your heart poison in poison out
We tear ourselves apart

Behind my eyes i keep my truth away from you
I can say that there is nothing new
I've got way to keep you by my side
Holding you till you till you decline

Like disease where i dwell
I leave ruins wherever i roam now you see
I cannot change i cannot feed your love
