Bing Crosby/Peter Matz. Chorus

Written by: Sammy Cahn/Jule Styne

Oh the weather outside is frightful 
But the fire is so delightful 
And since we've no place to go 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 

Shows signs of stopping 
And I've bought some corn for popping 
The lights are turned way down low 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow! 
...
