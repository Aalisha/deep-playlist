Rubber on my tires
Making contact with the road
Sign on the street post tells me
Which way I should go

Riding down America street
Funny that it's one way
I'm riding down from uptown
To where the buildings are broken down in decay
Broken down in decay

America street it's right nearby
Land of the free and the brave
If we can't work and make some change
There won't be much of this land left to save
