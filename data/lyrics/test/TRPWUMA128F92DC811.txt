Didn't I give you my heart and soul
With all that love you had full control
Can't take another day boy, without you

Being away makes me want you that more
Never before have I felt this way
Can't take another night boy, without you

Ten-thousand miles on a telephone-line to you
Oohoohoo - Ohoho
One more night in my lonely room
I can't make love to your photograph baby
