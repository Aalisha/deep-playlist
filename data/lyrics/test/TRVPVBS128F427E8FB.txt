My baby left me now I'm on my own
I don't know what happened
But now I'm all alone
There's a cold wind blowing straight into my face
I was a fool to let you slip out of my embrace

I see a bad life waiting there for me
A desert in my soul I see a bad life
Waiting there for me

I see a bad life waiting there for me
A desert in my soul I see a bad life
Waiting there for me

My baby's gone
and I guess that I was wrong
To let you go
My baby's gone
...
