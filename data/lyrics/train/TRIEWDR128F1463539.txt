Intro:

Ooooh... The way I wanna knock you...

Verse 1:

Girl you got just what I need
Bring it here to me
You can stand in front of me
Or get on top of me
Cuz' I'm gonna do to you
What's never been done to you
Gonna give my all to you...

Chorus:

It just ain't right
How bad I wanna knock you down
All night...
Riding me up and down
It feels so tight...
The way you squeeze it girl
Just aint right, all night, so tight...

Verse 2:

Lay right there and close your eyes
