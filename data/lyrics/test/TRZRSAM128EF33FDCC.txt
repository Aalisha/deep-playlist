Every line of insincerity
Every word I used to bend
Every piece of myself crumbling
Through the cracks I didn't mend

Even if I tried twice as hard
I could not live up to you, not by far
And if I were to give all I got
I could never unify worlds apart

Every fall and indiscretion
That I never meant to make
...
