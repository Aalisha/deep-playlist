when i look around it makes me wonder
am i worthy of the most amazing life that i've
been given
did not care before but i'm older
i see things in a different light
my grateful thoughts i raise to heaven

thank you for letting me dream and hope
thank you for this man who's always been true
and i do know that i'm lucky to be this strong
