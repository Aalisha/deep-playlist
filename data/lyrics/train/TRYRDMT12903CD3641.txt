Mild apprehension
Blank dreams of the coming fun
Distort the odds of a turnaround
Gut screams out next to none

So turn it on, tune it in
And stay inert

You say "I've got the backbone"
the back way to escape the gun
Climbing a tree with a missing limb
And not saving anyone

And now it hurts
to stay at home
and see flash
The mirror ball's throwing mold
you can't get a grip if there's nothing to hold

see the flash catch a white lily laugh and wilt
but if you must smash a glass first fill it to the hilt
Plants, as far as i know are still
still bending toward the light
and if we dance
until the heart explodes
it'll make this place ignite
...
