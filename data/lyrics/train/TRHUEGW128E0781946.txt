weight on my shoulder
but I'm walkin so tall
out into the new horizons

Wonder in everything
no matter how great or small
Howlin like the midnight
howlin like the midnight sun

And this aint no pale reflection
this is the real thing
New horizon
New horizon within

And your heart ain't yours to control
no matter how tight the reign
Love will find it's own direction

A time to reap, a time to sow
...
