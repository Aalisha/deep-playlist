I like to dream
Yes yes right between the sound machine
On a cloud a sound I drift into the night
Any place it goes is right

Goes far flies near to the stars away from here
Well you don't know what uh we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl?
On a magic carpet ride
You don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?
Fantasy will set you free
