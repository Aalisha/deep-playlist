Along the wild Texas border, was no law and order
When Reno brought me to this land
He was after the wild ones, the mustangs, the shy ones
And hoping that I'd understand

But there's too many long nights, a wife should have some rights
It seems that it's so plain to see

Much more than he'll ever love me

He's riding somewhere out there with his raven black hair
And a heart that is loving and wild
He's too much afire with ambitious desire
