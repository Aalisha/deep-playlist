One more hour to go
till he reaches his home
he should've left that poor family
all alone
now he's on his way
you can hear the crowd say
that boy has never had no one to call his own
and as they rallied around the gallows
you can tell he had no shame
he was wanted for the murder
of that poor families name
he was just a child
20 years of age
but now he's down
...
