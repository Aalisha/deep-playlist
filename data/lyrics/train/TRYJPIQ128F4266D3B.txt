Down these halls with many doors
Around each corner, right back where i started
Deep inside my mind it seems
I try to find an open door to go through
So they can see
I'm all right

Wanderin' round inside without a key
Watching with these open eyes
Locked inside the place that no one sees
Talking with eternity, trying to explain

Chorus

Why i'm stuck inside the maze
All the corners look the same
Thought i'd finally found the way
But i'm right back where i started
Now i'm stuck inside the maze
