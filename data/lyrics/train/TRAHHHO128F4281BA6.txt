I've made my reservation
I'm leaving town tomorrow
I'll find somebody new
And there will be no more sorrow
That's what I say each time
But I can't follow through

I can't breakaway
Though you make me cry
I can't breakaway
I can't say goodbye
I'll never ever breakaway from you

No, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I've made a vow to myself
You and I are through
Nothing can change my mind
“I'm sorry” just won't do
That's what I say each time
...
