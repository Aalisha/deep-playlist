Trackmasters Nigga
L.O.X, CNN

I been through, runnin' from cops, eatin' beef on the corner
Been through cold cells, thug in the bench, the rap performer
I been put the Mack upon ya, look faggot
Turn around to shshshsh, to shoot faggots
I been a star since Pat Benetar
CNN, Lox the type of shit that have you fleein' a rock
I been put the key in a lock
Who got a song, hot a Capone
And Nore copped the Benz, first day home
I been beatin' niggaz up, been spittin' on hoes
Thinkin' they too good for hood niggaz
Been in my zone
Been the champ since Larry Holmes, Spinks had teeth
And in a forbuilding,
been had 'em reppin' the street
Caught 'em wide over Y.O, first felony
Solo Eightball and MJG
What is you tellin' me

Yo, yo
I got guns, guns
Mad fuckin' guns, ha
I had them hundreds when you had them little ones, ha
But fuck that, live niggaz, In rap
And you can catch me with a Teletubbie
Holdin' my gat
Yo, I'm a soldier, what
You a soldier, Nigga infact
A wow, niggaz from suddenly just settin' a trap
I murder you, the niggaz fiend
Just fiend to attack
You shut the tunnel down twice like militant night
We at the club tonight, Nore yo
Please be nice
I buy the bar out
Crystal, no glass, no ice
