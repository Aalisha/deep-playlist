I imagine long walks down the road
Things begin to bloom and the sky explodes
The damage is undone, and then I know,
This has got to be a dream
Machines and luxuries don't last
I took my sleep for granted in the past
And I woke up half dead in an hourglass
Now does that sound funny?

Wait - you're almost there, it's gone
You're almost there, it's gone
You're almost where what follows you
Does not bother you

I have walked the tightrope parts of me
