Sometimes I try sometimes I don't
Sometimes the way I feel inside is gonna show
You know we're all the same
I know you're tired you try to talk
But you think I don't hear you anymore
Here it comes again
But sometimes you just take it too far
You can shoot me down and call me names
Scream until the neighbours all complain
I know you'll tell your friends it's all my fault
And I will take the blame
