Somebody told me you're a junkie now
And that you've always been a junkie
Man, I never would've guessed that
I used to sit around and wonder how
People fall into a trap just to stumble off the footpath

And it's all peace, love, and harmony
To politics and celebrity
Second nature to the youth scene
It's a must see

Understand it's a curse
You've got trouble in your blood
Write a song, second verse
Underneath it there's a love
Recognize the things you do
You make a mess but baby, you know who
It sounds impossible but, man, it's true
You are the bad, the bad seed of this town

I bought your record out on Cherry Red
It wasn't good, well, it was great
I believed it was the next step
Somebody phoned and said the dream is dead
He's just busy counting coppers
Man, it makes me see red

And it's all a part of the balance that
You don't deserve all the love you have
It's the fruit of life, but you throw it away like candy
...
