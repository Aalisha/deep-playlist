You've been gone for a little while
I've noticed there's a change in your smile
Oh how you've made your message loud and clear
But these are not the words that I expected to hear

You give me too much, too much, too much trouble
Too much too you give me too much trouble
Too much, too much, too much trouble
Too much too you give me

If you want to try we could just be friends
But please tell me should you have to pretend?
Lovers heartbreaks make the sweetest sounds
...
