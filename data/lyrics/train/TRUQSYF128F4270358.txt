Brand new shoes, they hurt my feet
This nech-tie is chokin' me
Cuttin' off my air supply
When I hang my head and cry
When I hang my head and cry
I see tears on daddy's face
Someone's hummin' Amazing Grace
Rain beats on this graveside tent
Preacher says he did repent
Preacher swears he did repent
They've got him layin' there in pin-stripes
How'd they get him in that suit
I guess the Lord will recognize him
Without his overalls and mule
They all say he looks so natural
