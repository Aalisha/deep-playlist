My friend Marcus, he sleeps in my basement
And his father touched more than spirit
Now he can hardly sleep, sleep

My friend Marcus, he's got such an ego

Find your father and find your meaning
Please

I don't give a good shit if your lonesome
I think that you should go home son
Find your father and meaning
