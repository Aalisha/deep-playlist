I'm gonna spread my wings
And take to the sky
Oh... like a bird, like a bird, on a wing, on a wing

Fly... (Know I can)
Fly...
I just spread my wings
And rise into the sky
Fly... (Just watch me)
Fly...
I just spread my wings
And drift into the sky...

Ooh, I know...
I just know that I could fly...
...
