Welcome to 2003 minus 25
Oh, say can you smell her for the smoke
God's still up there laughin' so He's gotta be alive
Who says He can't take a dirty joke

Power isn't, power does and power slips away
It's so easy to abuse
Who'd've thought them Arabs would've bought
The USA just to give it to the Jews

Singin' crime still don't pay just like it used to
...
