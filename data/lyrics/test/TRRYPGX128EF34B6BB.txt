Hello
My dear friend
Your reputation quite true
These are thoughts I've held on
And saved inside for you

'Cause I remember
Couldn't trust you once
Not ever

Maybe it's been two years
It could be three
You know it's hard to recall
I was younger, I thought it was me
Maybe you were someone else then too
