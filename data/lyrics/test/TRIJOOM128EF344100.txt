A thousand empty windows
And only half the lights are out
I wonder what these peoples lives
What they might be all about
Do they got a lover
And could they have a family
Or could it be they're just as lonesome
As you and me

I want to shout out
Shout out loud
Why don't you walk
Just come on out
And we can
Tear it all down
Yeah
