Now should you expect to see something that you hadn't seen
In somebody you'd known since you were sixteen?
If love is a bolt from the blue
Then what is that bolt but a glorified screw
And that doesn't hold nothing together

Far from these nonsense bars and their nowhere music
It's making me sick, I know it's making you sick
There's nothing there, it's like eating air
It's like drinking gin with nothing else in
And that doesn't hold me together

But for one crowded hour
You were the only one in the room
I sailed around all those bumps in the night
To your beacon in the gloom

I thought I had found my golden September
In the middle of that purple June
But one crowded hour
Would lead to my wreck and ruin

And I know you like your boys to take their medicine
From the bowl with a silver spoon
Who'd run away with the dish and scare the fish
By the silvery light of the moon
