It's a sad song
When love goes wrong
Leaves you feeling
Like you never felt before
Don't it hurt you
And introvert you
Leave you bleeding
Feel so low and insecure

Broken hearted melody
Oh what have you done to me?
I feel that time alone can say
Where I'll end up now

What a sad song
When loves goes wrong
