Adorable, dorable, dorable, dorable baby
You're adorable, sweet as can be
You're adorable, a dream girl to me
You're all that I hoped my love would ever be

(Adorable, dorable, dorable, dorable baby)
You're so lovable, when you're in my arms
You're so kissable, when I hold your charms
You're mine, you are so divine, my adorable one, dorable one

You must have come from he-heaven
Because you thrill me so
