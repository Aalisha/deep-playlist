English girls are pretty when they play guitar
Crazy like a day just a-breaking I ain't sure what for
Ain't got a mother or father or place to fall
She got a brother in the blues, but he doesn't know the blues at all
Said you didn't love me, it was right on time, I was just about to tell you but okay, alright
Said you didn't love me, didn't want a thing, English girls can be so mean

She's got eyes as pretty as a pair of jewels
Falling down a canyon like a couple drunken criminals
She had a messy bedroom on the edge of town
I ain't ever been good enough to ever keep around
Said you didn't love me, it was right on time, I was just about to tell you but okay, alright.
Said you didn't love me, didn't mean a thing, English girls can be so mean
