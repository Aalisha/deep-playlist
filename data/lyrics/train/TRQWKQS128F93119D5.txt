Ahhhh yeah
Love City x 2

Rose & Sly: Love a generation
Who do you want to be
Get into your own thing
Everybody's free free free free

Love City x 2

Look into the future
Tell me what you see

Brothers and sisters holding hands
You sittin next to me

Peaceful minds and beautiful heads
You see short and long hair
