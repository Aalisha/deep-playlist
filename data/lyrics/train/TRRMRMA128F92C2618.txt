God knows I tried everything I could
To stay inside tonight
But that boy's like a sore in your mouth
That you just have to fight
Hand number one is shakin' hands
With numbers two and three
Is it guilty in here or is it just me

I made a point of not mixin'
Love and pleasure in my life
Daytime boys and nighttime boys
Usually don't see eye to eye
But I've been on a roll of late
