everyone came up to me
telling me you're beautiful
I guess they thought that I should know

but there are some things that could've been better
instead of would you might just let her
you know you could be white as snow

why should I explain to you
where I'm from or what I do
I think I know where I'm bound
why should I explain to you
where I'm from or what I do
I don't need no one to say what
or to say where or to say how
