Long view on the eye a pocketful a pestilence
Got a fistful of momories, a long lost innocence
Hey baby, dead baby devil he embracin' you
With a long forked-tongue-kiss
Suckin' all the life from you
If you need to reach me
I'm broaking one through ten
And if you really need me
Can I get an amen...
Passion on a? gotta get it while it's not
With a self-centered psychopath givin'a lorget-me-not
...
