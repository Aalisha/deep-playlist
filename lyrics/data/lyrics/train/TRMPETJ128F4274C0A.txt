If I could ride this slide into forever
What would I give to getaway
That pain that stayed
Seemed like forever
What would you give to getaway

I know this is how I could be over you
You know this is not another waste of time
All this holding on can't be wrong
Just come back to me and I am not alone

You had your man your fan but not forever
You should have let him
You should have let him getaway
But your pride made you ride on this slide by his side to his lies
