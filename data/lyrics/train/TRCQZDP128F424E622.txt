In this room I'm sitting by your side
'Cause it rains for hours and the phone is off its hook
Standing on the edge, casting lot's to set me up
Before you knock me down

Summer's edge and drown me
Betting on our own lives
Making up for all the time we lost

In this house of cards
We're all holding hearts and spades
(One breath, one step could knock it all down)
