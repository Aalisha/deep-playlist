Talk of tomorrow
And you talk of the times that have been
The wheels keep on turning
Turning circles we go round again
Never ending the time is bending
These songs all the same
And we will stand listening
Looking back on the ones that remain

And time hurries on
We are here, we are gone
And time passes on
All the words of your song
