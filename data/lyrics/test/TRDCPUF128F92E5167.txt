As I lay floating inside my mind's corners it comes to me
Darkness it falls when you least would forsee it,
upon your soul

On think again what you think is for real
Maybe in silence there happiness is...

Took us in our darkest hour, brought us down with it
Trapped in an eclipse of sense, oh I should have seen

All with freedom in our minds, yet we were it's slaves
...
