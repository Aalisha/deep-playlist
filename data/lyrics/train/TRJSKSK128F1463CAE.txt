If your body's feelin' bad
And it's the only one you have
You want to take away the pain
Go out walkin' in the rain.
You watch the flowers go to bed,
Ask the man inside your head
Your spirit never has to grieve
All ya got to do's believe.
The faith healer
The faith healer

All ya got to do is feel
Your body's going to start to heal
The fingertips of holy fire
Everlasting sweet desire
It don't matter what the doctor said
