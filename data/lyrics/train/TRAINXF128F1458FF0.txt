Do you know, when to let go
Oh now we can show
The future starts here today
And we calculate, light years away
We're moving to a different beat
Takin' it to the street
Dance away!

Look to the future
Anything you wanna be
Easy like your A. B. C.
Taking some time
Oh look straight ahead
Anything you wanna be
You know it's easy

Can we try
Oh you gotta open your mind
You know you can't buy time
The future is here to stay
