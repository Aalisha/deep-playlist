Subject: Chaos Grin
Status: Mercenary
Have no fear, no feelings
Followers or leader
Guided by instinct
Fed by insecurity
Smell the sweet scent of opportunity

On my right sleeve
I carry
The signs of my ancestory
My left cheek still bleeding the kisses of my enemies
Availability
To the highest bidder is never cheap
Disposability
I have no use for long term loyalty

I'm their heroine
An answer to their prayers
Care and safety
From what they've done
...
