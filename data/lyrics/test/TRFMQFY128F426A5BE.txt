Be careful what you want, it may be what you get
Careful of yourself, you may just kill yourself
Watch out for all the ruin that you ask for
Being trapped below, is that what you need?

Careful what you get, it may just get you back
How much more? Relive the nightmares of the past
Think twice about the ruin that you ask for
Still ignoring all the warnings you see?

A lifetime wronged you
Dark signs warned you
