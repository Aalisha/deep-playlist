You don't know the meanin' of uncontrolled desire
You were always hangin' just above the fire
Now and then you come close enough to just stay warm
And you think that you win 'cause you never give in
Because you've never been burned, oh, but you're gonna learn

That you don't know love
'Til it's chilled you to the bone
Turned you inside out
And left you all alone

And you don't know love
'Til you've watched it die and then
You have to try again
