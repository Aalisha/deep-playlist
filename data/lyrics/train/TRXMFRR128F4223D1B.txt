If you beg a date
She says, "You're too late"
Then later, she gives you a call
Don't hesitate, you're in for a break
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball.

If she winks at you
Don't you miss that cue
For this is no time for a stall
Man, call a hack, and get to your shack
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball.

No use in her denying
...
