Sex always sells, Death is a thrill
Entertain my lack of paticence
How much we pay to be tailor made
The fashion slaves, the trends will change

Now what is your drug of choice, pick your posion and enjoy
What is your drug of choice, pick your posion and enjoy
Disasterbation, The thrill of the nation
Temptation is for sale
Disasterbation, The death of a nation
Manipulate yourself
