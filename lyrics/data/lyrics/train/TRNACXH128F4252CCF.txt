Salutations now you’re facing a real nigga D-E-L, I don’t feel bigger / Up here on stage man i keep it real witcha / I’m here to entertain ya’ll, let’s play ball / I stay raw as coke flawless flows / A novice cant recall why his jaw is broke / Trying to borrow quotes, that his problem folks, we all adults / Let’s see how long he floats / Against the barrage of assaults dislodge his throat / Send death charges to carve his boat / in the cart to Oakland to all my folks / Del apart from most / He hard with jokes / Target scoped and I don’t care how far he go / And the bitch is a party ho / Ain’t hardly no debutante she give head for ones / You said I read you wrong and your head get stomped
