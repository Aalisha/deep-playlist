Julie’s clocking out at the station
Hurry up and get your pay
A two day vacation
Friday, Saturday

Down in the basement
Shower up in the sink
Throw on some lipstick
And look pretty in pink

Short skirts in the cold to the club
Oh, the night is waiting
Getting closer you feel it shaking
On the dance floor

This is the beat, the beat we fight to
This is the beat we live and die to
Here’s to the kids that get it off
We work all week to sweat it off

This is the beat to beat the pressure
Throwing away the world with pleasure
We’re working hard to burn it off
So DJ, won't you turn it up?
