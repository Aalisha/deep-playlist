There's no doubt in my mind who you are
There's no thought other then yours
My heart felt like a rose in the graveyard
But you dug and I knew you you belonged
You found
What was profound
What was around
You and I
A romance fairy tale from the soul
I knew I wasn't alone in this world
My heart keeps beating a melody
