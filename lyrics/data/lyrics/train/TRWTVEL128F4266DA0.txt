(dokken, pilson)

Let go of your mind
And see what there is to see
It can be real
Not just a fantasy
Open your eyes
And leave the world behind
Open your mind
Come along for the ride

Do what you want to do
Be what you want to be
Do what you want to do
It's just a short trip from reality

Chorus

I'm on the inside
