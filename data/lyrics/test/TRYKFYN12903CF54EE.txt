I'm getting nervous, all this loose talk of war
But still so many problems closer to home seem to be ignored
If you want to be a "real hero", it's the mundane things in life
Education and the health of the nation which need putting right

Now, let me take your hand
I'll lead you to the promised land
You know you can trust in me
I'll be right behind you, just wait and see

Don't listen to the mad man, he got insanity in his eyes
Doesn't know what he's talking about, no sincerity only lies
...
