I was sittin’ with him on his front porch swing
Soaking up wisdom and Grandma’s sweet tea
Listening to his stories, man, he’d done it all
His tour in the Army and his wilder days
Raising my daddy and bailing his hay
He cut off a twist of tobacco, stuck it in his jaw
Cocked back his hat with a sideways grin and
gave me that ole wink
He said, I can tell you something ‘bout
most anything

Chorus:
But don’t ask me about a woman
All I know is boy they’re something
They’re tender and they’re tough
Can break it down and lift you up
...
