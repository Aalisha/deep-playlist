When you feel the dream is over
Feel the world is on your shoulders
and you've lost the strength to carry on

Even though the walls may crumble
and you find you always stumble through
remember never to surrender to the dark

Cos if you turn another page
You will see thats not the way
The story has to end...

If you need to find a way back,
Feel you're on the wrong track,
Give it time, learn to fly.
Tomorrow is a new day,
You will find your own way,
You'll be stronger with each day that you cry,
...
