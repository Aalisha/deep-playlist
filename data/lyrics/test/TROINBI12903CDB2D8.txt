There's thieves among us
Painting the walls
With all kinds of lies, and lies
I never told it all
What's in my pocket?
You never knew
You didn't know me well
So well, as I knew you

And I know, and you know too
That a love like ours is terrible news
But that won't stop me crying
No, that won't stop me crying over you

I'm not a prophet
Old love is in me
New love just seeps right in
...
