Living with myself is hard enough
So I get away when things get rough
Famine, strife and thoughts of war
Matter less than the dress she wore

You see ignorance is bliss
Problem solved with just one kiss
Ignorance is bliss
Problem solved with just one kiss

I'm just trying to survive
Pay my bills and stay alive
All the world's problems ain't my fault
...
