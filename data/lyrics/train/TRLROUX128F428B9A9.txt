Look for us in Cali
East Bay to L.A.
Or with our friends in DC, U.S.A
We made it through the Canadian border
Back home next week in N.Y.C

Because we're faster than the world
We're faster than the world
We're faster than the world
We can't slow down

I hear the Windy City calling
"Chitown, Chitown"
As we arrive in Tokyo, edemio
And the kids are cool in Kansas
Tomorrow's the Philly Troc Show

Because we're faster than the world
We're faster than the world
We're faster than the world
We can't slow down
