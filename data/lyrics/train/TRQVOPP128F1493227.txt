Wise up because I'm fed up, you better back up
Wise up because I'm fed up, you better back up
Wise up because I'm fed up, you better back up
Wise up because I'm fed up, you better back up

You got a bad attitude comin' up from inside
You better watch your mouth, you got plenty to hide
You come across so heavy you're a buck o five
Better rest your fist and try to use your mind
I'm not punkin' out, I'm just movin' up
Say your comments loud but try to back 'em up
Keep your ass far away and stay with yourself
Alone in a cage aggravate someone else

Wise up because I'm fed up, you better back up
Wise up because I'm fed up, you better back up
Wise up because I'm fed up, you better back up
