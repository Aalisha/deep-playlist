Going to the race track
To try and get your money back
But caught trying to break in
But just have to say
It couldn't happen, me?

She shaved off her hair
Said that she didn't care
That 'Life is so unfair'
Oh but all she wanted
Was to be left alone

He said he missed Bliss
Smiled and left the kids
And I said this isn't it
But baby please come home
And start again
...
