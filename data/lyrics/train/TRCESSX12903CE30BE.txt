If it's gonna happen, then it's gonna happen
That's just the way that it is
Oh love comes along and it dont take long
Till it slips through my fingertips
I could make some excuses, but darlin the truth is
I'm just the reckless kind
And i dont wanna leave you to pick up the pieces
Oh no matter how i try

Girl, I break everything I touch
Little girl thats close enough
Seems like every heart I've ever loved
I break everything I touch
...
