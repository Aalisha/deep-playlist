Chorus:
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, well, to the New York Island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
I tell you, This land was made for you and me

As I went walking down that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
Now I saw below me that golden valley
And I said: This land was made for you and me.
