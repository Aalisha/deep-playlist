Here's a happy tune you'll love to croon
They call it Sam's song
It's catchy as can be, the melody
They call it Sam's song
Nothing on your mind
And then you'll find you're humming Sam's Song
Why, it makes you grin
Gets under your skin as only a song can do

People that you meet out on the street
All whistling Sam's Song
Everyone you see will soon agree that it's a grand song
So forget your troubles and wear a smile
You'll find you never go wrong
If you learn to croon this happy tune
They call it Sam's song

"And now another treatment of this
Classic American Theme
Brought to you by, Mr. Gary Crosby"
