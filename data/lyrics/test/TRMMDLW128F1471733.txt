A vacation in a foreign land, Uncle Sam does the best he can
You're in the army now, oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

Now you remember what the draft man said,
nothing to do all day but stay in bed
You're in the army now,
oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

You'll be the hero of the neighbourhood,
nobody knows that you've left for good
You're in the army now,
oh-oo-oh you're in the army now

Smiling faces as you wait to land,
but once you get there no-one gives a damn
...
