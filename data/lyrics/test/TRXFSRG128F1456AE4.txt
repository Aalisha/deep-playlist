I wish I was closer to you Than you feel
Our love can't be what it should be Not until
We face our fears internally from the past
And forgive ourselves for moving way too fast'
If we continue not to let it go
Pretty soon we're at a dead end road
With hearts made of bitter stone
Unable to give or receive love, right'?
I Just wanna grow gray and old
And live and die in happiness as one soul
So come on, let's move on Out of this storm'

Everything we want We can have baby
If we both want it bad enough, I know
Everything we want We can have baby
But we must build our faith and trust, our love'
