Out on the plains down near Santa Fe
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
And as he jogged along I heard him singin'
A most peculiar cowboy song
It was a ditty, he learned in the city
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah

Get along, get hip little dogies
Get along, better be on your way
Get along, get hip little dogies
And he trucked 'em on down that old fairway
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
