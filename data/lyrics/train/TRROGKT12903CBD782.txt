You want the world to buy your happiness
Ain't it a shame you have to hurt the ones you love
Never giving yourself taking all that you can get
But you don't take nothing with you except your soul

I'm so tired of hearing that I'm wrong
Everyone laughs at me. Why me?
I'm so tired of being pushed around
I feel like I've been betrayed
