Starlight twinkles mighty
As they celebrate this night
Distant clatter of the horses hooves
Heralds their demise

"Bring oaken barrels, rise your horns
Lay weapons all aside"
A golden shimmer throws its trail
Upon the tavern's light

Mors stupebit et natura
Cum resurget creatura

At midnight's stroke
When two moons rise
And storm awakes
The sleeping child
...
