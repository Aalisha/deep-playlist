When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
Your data, my data
The chromosomes match
Exact as in matter
A matter of fact
These amaranth feelings
A cognitive state
Need the love object
To reciprocate
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
I'm overpowered
When I think that I'm over you
I'm overpowered
It's long overdue
