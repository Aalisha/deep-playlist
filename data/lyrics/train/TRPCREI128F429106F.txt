Egoism dictates human relations
A world where fashion outshines morality
Is written in blood red colors
Designed by the thirst for power

Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference
Gather the faithful
Gather the faithful and propose a toast
To the epoch of indifference

An all to ordinary story
With an aftertaste so bitter, so bitter
Forced to be someone I don't want to be
