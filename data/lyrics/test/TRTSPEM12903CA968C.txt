I don't want to lose you, this good thing that I got cause if I do
I will surely, surely lose a lot
Cause your love is better than any love I know
It's like thunder and lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock (knock) on wood, baby, I better knock

I'm not superstitious about ya but I can't take no chance
