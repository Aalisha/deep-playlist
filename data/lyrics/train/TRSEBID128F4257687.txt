Don't tell me when something is beautiful
And don't tell me how to talk to my friends
Just tell me the names of the stars in the sky
What's your favourite song
Tell me the names of the lovers you had
Before I came along

Don't put your arms around me
And don't hold me tight
'Cause I could get used to
Your vision of paradise

And don't ask me where all of the pain goes
'Cause you make me feel that I don't know myself
You say that you want me forever
