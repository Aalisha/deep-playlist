All the tales you've been tellin' from the start
Said 'em loud but I never believed 'em
I wore an old band of black around my heart
I wore it proud but it never relieved me

Suddenly I got everything I want
Yeah once again we can see the big picture
Its gonna take all the good in all of us
To tear away all the damage you did here.

And I recall, if I remember
The scent of eucalyptus oil
Its like a dream
But I remember it well
