it is a waterproof
windproof
i love youf
i'm on-the-roof-kind-of-way

we're in the grillroom
with the groundwork
you stain your skirt, skirt
i love your hairdo, i hate your way

yes, that's the price you pay...!

i'm just a shipboy
i pay my shiptoll
and every shipday
i take a shipstroll
out on the deck
...
