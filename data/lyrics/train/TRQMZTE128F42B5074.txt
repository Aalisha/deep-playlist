Boom, boom, boom.
heh, heh.
ready for action, nip it in the butt.
we never relaxin', outkast is everlastin'
not clashin', not at all but see my nigga went to do a little acting.
now that's for anyone askin' give me one pass em'
drip drip drop there goes an eargasm
now you cumin out the side of your face
we tapping right into your memory banks (thanks!)
so flickle the tickle lets see your seat belt fastened
trunk rattlin' like two midgets in the back seat wrasling
speakerbox vibrate the tank, make it sound like aluminum cans in the back.
but i know ya'll wanted that 808 can you feel that b-a-s-s, bass
but i know ya'll wanted that 808 can you feel that b-a-s-s, bass
i like the waaaay you move
i like the waaaay you move (whoo-o-o!)
i love the waaaay you move
i love the way, i love the way.
I love the waaaay you move
