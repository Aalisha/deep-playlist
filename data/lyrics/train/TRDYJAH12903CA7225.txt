I'm leaving, so carry on for keepsake
Go find the love you won't save
Kiss kiss goodbye
left cheek to no reply

I practice my fall to make it easier
I say the things that I can never say
Then blink because it's over
I don't care, I don't ever wait
Still remember that look upon your face
When we would start to kiss
Well blink because it's over
...
