I know you see me lookin' at you
And I know he know you lookin' at me
Well... damn

DJ won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freakin' love song
She's lookin' at me kinda hard, 
I can tell that things ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to Beat a beat, 
beat it, beat it

I can see how you want it baby
Wish ya man wasn't here with ya baby
I can see (ha) curiosity (ha ha)
Gotcha wanna try me (ha ha)
Homeboy can't please ya (ha ha)
On this wall in the open baby
You wouldn't care if the crowd was watchin' baby
(Ha Ha) you want it
(ha ha) I know it
(ha ha) Gotta notion to pull yo ass up outta here

DJ won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freakin' love song
She's lookin' at me kinda hard, 
I can tell that things ain't right on the home front
What she really needs is a G like me to Beat a beat, 
beat it, beat it

DJ won't you play this girl a love song
She really needs to hear this freakin' love song
