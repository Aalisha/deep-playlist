Listen to me baby and listen real good
You know you're not treating me
As good as you should
Everytime I call you here by my side
You have some excuse and I wanna know why

Right now and not later baby
Right now and not later
'Cause later may be too late
And I gotta know right now
I need a right-now-and-not-later baby
Right-now-and-not-later baby
