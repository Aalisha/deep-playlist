Midnight bottle take me, come with few of my memories
And everything, well, come back to me
Midnight bottle make it real what feels like make believe
So, I can see a little more clearly
Like every single move you make
Kissing me so carefully
On the corners of my dreaming eyes

I've got a midnight bottle, gonna drink it down
A one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
When everything felt so right
If only for tonight

A midnight bottle, gonna ease my pain
From all these feelings driving me insane
I think of you and every thing's all right
If only for tonight
...
