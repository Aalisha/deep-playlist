This locked door is pushed open
That shining lights the sight of you
We may share pulling hairs
I feel I'm long beside myself
Bad music, no mistake
I'm far away to start to make any conscience

Don't wanna be here throwing stones
Don't wanna run, I'm walking on
Don't wanna be here, the only one
Don't wanna be the only one
...
