It's been a long night... away from it all
The grabbing authority of my peers...
The rusty cage that never seems to open...
When can I escape? When can I swim to the moon?
I've heard this expression my entire life... never realized how peaceful a statement it is.
All alone on the worlds waters... here I am.
The sun's slowly drifting past the edge of the world... (can't blame our ancestors)
I'm the loneliest boat on this entire body of water.
Rest will give my awakening purpose... this is why I have come here in the first place.
A peace I have never felt... a life I did not want to live.
I will awake through sleep...
The drifting drifter... look into the picture...

(The Foreshadowing)
No more panic, no more regret.
