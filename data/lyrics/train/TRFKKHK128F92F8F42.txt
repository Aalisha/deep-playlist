Come my Lucien come and gloat
All our boys are still in town
Hack, hack, hacking off their nose
Went and pissed on all the show

You're pollution [Incomprehensible]
You couldn't blow, blow into your loaf
You couldn't blow, blow into your loaf

Become one pretty tickle son

Plastic grasper is at the punch
