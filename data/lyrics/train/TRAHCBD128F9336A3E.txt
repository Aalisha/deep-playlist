Alright

[Incomprehensible] Etty in the room a cry
Mama say she must wipe her eye
Papa say she no fi foolish
Like she never been to school at all

It is no wonder
It's a perfect pander
While they were dancing
In that bar room last night

Johnson in the room afret
Uncle say he must hold up him head
Aunty say she no fi foolish
Like a no time fi him wedding day

It is no wonder
It's a perfect pander
While they were dancing
In that bar room last night

One pound ten for the wedding cake
And plenty bottle of cola wine
...
