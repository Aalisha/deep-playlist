I'm gon' get up in the mornin', I believe I'll dust my broom
I'm gon' get up in the mornin', I believe I'll dust my broom
Girlfriend, the black man you been lovin', girlfriend, can't get my room

I'm gon' write a letter, telephone every town I know
I'm gon' write a letter, telephone every town I know
If I can't find her in West Helena, she must be in East Monroe I know
