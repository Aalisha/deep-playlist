My lips, on your lips
Your body heat lingers on me
Oh, what a night
God am I obsessed with this man
Of my dreams

So I hide, try to lie
Only the nighting gayles
Sings the truth
But the rushing of my blood
Is like rivers running wild
And I got no control and I know

You're my world!
You're the moon and stars above
You're the reason I know love, love, love
My only cause for being
You're my world!
You're the owner of my heart
Always close though we're apart, you know
...
