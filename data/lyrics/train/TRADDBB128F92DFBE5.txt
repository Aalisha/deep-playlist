I gave you all you desired
All that you needed
Boy I provided
I let you into my head, into my bed
And that’s a privilege
I had your back in the answers
You took the dollars
I took the chances
Defended, battled and fought
Cause I really thought you loved me

I don’t know where to start or where to stop, no
But I know I am done I’ve had enough

So fall out of my hands, out of my heart
And when you hit the ground
You’ll be sorry that I’m not around
I will watch you while you
Fall out of your mind out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall think of me
I’ll be on the top just watching you fall
