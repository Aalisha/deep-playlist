Well all around town my name is mud
Well I can't help it cause it's in my blood
I make no secret it's plain to see
I'll jump on anything that's lookin' good to me

I can't quit it. I can't quit it
Cause it comes to me naturally

Well I like this one over here. And I like that over there
Bring me a dozen. Boy I just don't care
And when I'm finished and I'm all out of breath
Bring me a honey and I'll love her to death

I can't quit it. I can't quit it
Cause it comes to me naturally
