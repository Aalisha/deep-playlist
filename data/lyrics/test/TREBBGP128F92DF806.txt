Oooh, the slightest touch...
Oooh, the slightest touch...

I thought I knew how to handle my emotions
Until you lit the fuse that triggered the explosion
Mm, you turn me on with the power of electric love
And now I can't get enough
Turn the voltage up

The slightest touch
And I go crazy with desire
The slightest touch
Can bring me to my knees, yeah
Watch what you touch
'Cuz I'm a real live wire
And the slightest touch
...
