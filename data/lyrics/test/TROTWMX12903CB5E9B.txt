[Verse 1:]
You knew me better than anyone ever
And I remember your very first letter
We were so young and all that we wanted was more
We fit each other like rebels on Harleys
And I knew how to answer your body
But at the speed that we drove we were bound to wash out

[ChorusÂ :]
We flew rockets to the sun
Knowing we'd crash and burn
And that's the risk we run
When you fall in love

[Verse 2:]
I could read every word you were thinking
You gave me something I never was given
