Once I was happy, once I was alive
The spirit of [Incomprehensible] in the mimic of the sky
Watching lives be taken that make something in me die
That every day is another for my spirit to survive
See how I lost oh where's the key?
'Cause my soul's simply cramped outside of me

Thought it was stayin' but now I know
(Searchin' for my soul)
It left an empty space you know
(Searchin' for my soul)
And if you should see it send it home
(Searchin' for my soul)

I tried to be strong but my strength is getting empty
