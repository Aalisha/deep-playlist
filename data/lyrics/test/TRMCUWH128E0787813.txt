feat. Peter Cincotti

Peter Cincotti:
Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
If you go then I'll be blue
'Cause breaking up is hard to do

Renee Olstead:
Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me and it felt so right
Think of all that we've been through (together)
Breaking Up Is Hard To Do

Together:
They say that breaking up is hard to do

Renee Olstead:
Now I know, I know that it's true

Together:
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up
