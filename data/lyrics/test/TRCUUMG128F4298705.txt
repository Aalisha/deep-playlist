Let's go

They call it a scene I call it disaster
Down here the kids grow up faster
Scared they're scared to the bone
Like a pack of wolves they don't run alone
One on one they won't look you in the eye
But when the pack's together there's a battle cry
I saw it fifteen on one
When the crowd dispersed the kid was done
 
No (no more)
No (bad town)
No more bad town
