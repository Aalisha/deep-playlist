love me babe, love me babe
love me babe, love me babe
love me babe, love me babe

Baby you dont know
what you do to me
Between me and you
i feel a chemistry
I wont let no one
come and take your place
cause the love you give
it cant be replaced
See no one else
love me like you do
thats why i dont mind
