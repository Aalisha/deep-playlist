Run into the sea before it comes
The heavy hand washing over you
I see the face of many men
Beyond the beach, drowning in the blue
They come to seek the open land
They grab a piece before others do
It's all because they masterplan
We're supposed to teach only if we knew

Please, tell us what you want, we'll get it for you
Take us movers from this place we sink ourselves to
Darkness tells us we're awake, we still can come, too
