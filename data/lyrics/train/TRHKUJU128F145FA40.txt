Nigga that shit coming together
Like sweaty ass cheeks, nigga

Keep it gangsta y'all
Keep it gangsta y'all

My niggaz thug out, you getting drugged out
These bitches getting loc'ed out
When we smoke out, 'cause we chromed out
About to bomb out

Here ye, here ye, calling all the hawgs
Fresh outta the whole tank, bouncin' up the walls
Dub-cee, the bandanna president, with the gauge on the ghetto
Rollin' through y'all residents

Runnin' the scene this is the king of the cars
Thugged out baby in my new busta's
Gangstas, all of them gangstas, none of them let me see up
Ridaz throw ya heaterz up

Ladies, OG'z, sorry that I've been gone
But now I'm back to get my walk on
Swang with the game as I reach out and touch ya
Turn the cup up and get ignorant on this motherfucker

Mayday, mayday, back in charge
Calling out cars, calling out cars
Dip, skip through the lane with the bang, bang, bang, jangle
Hoppin' out the SS workin' all them angles
Dub-shiest deep the scrilla, and I've got my homeboy

Hell yeah, the motherfucking villain
1 to the 2 to the 3 to the, hello
Look at these g'z working these fake ass sopranos
Here come the Villain with another heater
With motherfucking Dub nigga in the two-seater

On my nuts while I west west y'all
Grab that microphone and I test test y'all
Villian baritone be like all over y'all

Who wanna ball with that Black nigga Ren?
