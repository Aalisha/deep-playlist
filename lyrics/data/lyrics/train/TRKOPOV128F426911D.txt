You better run,
It's a hurricane on fire,
Nowhere to hide,
Gonna hunt you through the night ya,
You've got it,
I want it,
Presume your gonna change your tune now,
So keep knockin,
Keep rockin,
I gotta, I gotta, Hear you scream.

Chorus:
I'm gonna get you, get you after midnight,
Shock you, Shock you till the sparks fly,
Get you, get you after midnight,
...
