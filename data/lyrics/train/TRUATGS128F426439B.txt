It's Saturday night and my daddy's up late
Pickin' with my Uncle Bill
The neighbors don't mind 'cause they're havin' a time
Sippin' on a pappy's still

Old brother Dan's got a fiddle in his hand
Momma's on the mandolin
When the music is right and the band gets tight
You oughta see 'em pick and grin

And everybody starts movin'
To the sound of the guitar strums
And everybody starts movin'
...
