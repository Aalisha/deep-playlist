I'm Not Tired Yet

Been working for Jesus a long time
(I'm not tired yet)

Been running for Jesus a long time
(I'm not tired yet)

Been working for Jesus a long time
(I'm not tired yet) Repeat

Been singing for Jesus a long time
(I'm not tired yet) Repeat

Been running by day and praying by night
(I'm not tired yet)

I've gotta get going it's a mighty hard fight
(I'm not tired yet)

No...
(No... I'm not tired yet) (4x)

I've been serving the Lord a long time
(I'm not tired yet)

I've been serving the God a long time
(I'm not tired yet)

I've been living for Him a long time
(I'm not tired yet)

I've been living for God a long time
(I'm not tired yet)

I've been praying to Him a long time
(I'm not tired yet) repeat
It's an uphill journey but I'm on my way
(I'm not tired yet)

Working for Jesus all I've got to say is
(I'm not tired yet)
