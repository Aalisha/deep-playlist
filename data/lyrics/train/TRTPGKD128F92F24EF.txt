Good bye Jimmy, farewell youth
I? must be on my way I've had enough of you
Was a young man, proud and true
Just a simple boy with nothing left to lose

Years that I've wasted
These I owe you's

They're just fucking words
This is life or death
It's time to clear the air
You better save your breath
...
