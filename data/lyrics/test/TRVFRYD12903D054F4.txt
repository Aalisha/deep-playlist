You tied yourself to college ground and testing tubes of love.
You found her waiting in the avenue for other boys who were not you.
I took you to my favourite place. I cracked the ice with rocks.
I said that no one would be championed as much as you by me my friend.

In colour, in black and white. In records we both like.
Oh how we dream that everyone else here will disappear.

Come back home tonight. Never was enough for you.
