When you're driving late at night
You feel the mosquitos bite
On your arm
And your legs
Until you
Run for cover
Then you find yourself alone as usual there's no one there
To help you distinguish right form wrong--Yucca man

Anacondas wrapped around your neck--you want respect
But it won't come through your windows or your door
Grab it by the tail

Yucca man
