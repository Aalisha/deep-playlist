Home from prison lying in my bed
Over visions dosing in my head
I've already lost much more than you could take from me
I've already been much more than you will ever be

I don't need it, you don't wanna find me
I can see that you don't even like me
You don't even, you don't wanna fight me
Man believe it, you ain't nothing like me
