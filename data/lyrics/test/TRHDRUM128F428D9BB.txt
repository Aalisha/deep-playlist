We'll be together again
We'll be the same as back hen
I am the love that you were looking for
I'm telling you baby
We'll me once more

The first time I saw you babe
You knocked me off my feet
It must have been the curiosity
That cupid threw you eyes to me
You were giving me a hard time
And then with your games I could
It would take for ever babe
Till you let me get my game to you

No sense in your friends
Wana get rid of me
What's it gona me
It's too late hear say
Menacing rumors and you slipped away
