Seems somebody put out the moon
Now the road is a minefield
I can’t follow the way she moves
I can’t see past the shadows

You make the darkness disappear
I feel found when you stay near
I know where I am when you are here
My way becomes so clear

When you're gone
Will I lose control?
You're the only road I know
You show me where to go
Who will drive my soul?
