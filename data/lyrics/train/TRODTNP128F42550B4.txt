"Drop It Off"

(Chorus: repeat 4X)
Drop it off drop it off
Bitch I got a sawed off
Put that money in the bag
Hoe I'll blow yo ass off

(Verse One)
It all started out cool and calm, we had it under control
We had blueprints to the bank from roof to floor
My nigga Paul had them yawks and bullet-proof vests
Juicy dropped off the 600 the get away the best
We had an in-sider that was working for Union Planners
She told us everyday at 6 o clock they turn off the cameras
At 6 o five the guards go on break for milk and banannas
Six thirty guards come back from break and back on with the cameras
So that gives us twenty five minutes to get in and out
We gotta do this shit so quick and slick without a doubt
I got some folks that be down to ride all it takes a shout
And if its business they comin quicker thats what they bout
God as my witness we gonna get this one some way some how
