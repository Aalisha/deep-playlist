Dreamt I turned my head around last night
when I got up, saw you sleeping
yeah, you were shaking
What am I to do
I've lost my father now
Will I be alright
yeah, will I make it

You're still in my life today
You're still in my thoughts, okay
You're still in my life today
You're still in my life

Who on God's great earth
can take a life of strength and fire
and just start weakening
From the outside in
What I'm thinking now
I'm taking all the blame for
It's a bit relieving
...
