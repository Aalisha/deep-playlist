right from the start i gave you my heart
but you take the other way
deep in my soul i’m out of control
why don’t you stay?
i only wanna have you next to me
i’m waitin‘ ‘til eternity
so if you ever feel the same for me i’ll be
down on my knees
livin‘ in a red balloon with you
we can fly away
all that i need is a little bit of your love
someday
