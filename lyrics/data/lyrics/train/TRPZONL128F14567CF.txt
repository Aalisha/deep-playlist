Life, what does it mean?
Life, check it out

Tell me sometimes do you feel like
You're servin' no purpose in life
And you ask yourself all these questions why
And life still passes you by, tell me

Did you know, did you know
That what you do affects the stars above
And the earth and the moon and the sun
And did you know
That me and you represent peace and love
If you feel like we do

So if you feel like we do
Then vive with the music
Just let us enter your soul
And if you know like we know
Then you've got to use it
Just let it take control
