Cannot believe
What He's done for me
So I had to write a song to say thank you
Was lost now I'm found
His love has turned me around
I just had to take the time to say thank you

Because of you I am able
To say and read all the things I am called to do
And everyday I'm so grateful
That's why I decided to dedicate this song to you

You bring me joy
You've changed my life
When I wake up every morning I just gotta say thank you

Cannot believe
What He's done for me
So I had to write a song to say thank you
Was lost now I'm found
His love has turned me around
I just had to take some time to say thank you

Some people might think I'm crazy
