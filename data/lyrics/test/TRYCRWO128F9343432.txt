Tuxedo waiters, black ties
White tablecloths and red wine
We've been plannin' this night
Lookin' forward to it for some time

Honey, I know you love gettin' dressed up
And you know I love showin' you off
Watchin' your baby blue eyes
Dancin' in the candlelight glow
All I can think about is gettin' you home

Walkin' through the front door
Seein' your black dress hit the floor
