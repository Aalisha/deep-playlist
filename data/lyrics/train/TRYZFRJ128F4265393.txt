[CHORUS]
Ohhh, we movin' on
Hey now playa whacha waitin' on
Come on playa we movin' on
Ha-tah get that hatin' gon
Yeah

[Playa Fly]
Yea I hope you playaz dig this route that Ibn choosin to take
A mellow level big and better still I'm all in ya face
It is a must that I clutch me so much of this P
And spread it out through Minnie Mae cause that's who runnin' with me
We movin' up and stayin' down maan that all that we know
We walk the top of bean stalks
While hatin jackers below
And if I felt that a step taker sat in my place
I'm takin two and droppin' you and Flizy do it so haste
Maan! You and Reg we was down here so young
And Mr Mark from SPL
2nd graders we hung
As years past, I thought I knew what birthdays meant
But never knew until I recalled all the time that I spent
People think they thankin' bankin' but they only maintain
Before they know they bout to blow it and they losin' the game
