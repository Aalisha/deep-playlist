If somebody asks me if I love that girl
You better believe it (You better believe it)
If somebody says she's a whole lot worth
You better believe it (You better believe it)

Since I saw that girl I can't get away
Now I gotta see her every day
You better believe it (You better believe it)
Said you better believe it (You better believe it)

Do I get a feeling when I kiss her goodnight?
You better believe it (You better believe it)
