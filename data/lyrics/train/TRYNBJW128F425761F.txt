At midnight, an hour from now... they're gonna flick the switch
Down the hall, beyond the iron door... they're gonna end my life
I will see you all in hell, isn't that where we all must go?
I will not tell you what I did... it doesn't matter now
I will tell, how weird it is, to know exactly when you're gonna go

I am a killer... I'm gonna get what I deserve
I am a killer, they're gonna fry my each and every nerve

It is not, the soul I sell, it's not the pain from hell
...
