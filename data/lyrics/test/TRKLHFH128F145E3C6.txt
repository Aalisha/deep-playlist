Sha na na sha na na na na na

I don't know what they talked 'bout in my school
but I seem to be like some kind a fool oh yeah
I failed my history but that don't bother me oh no
Sha na na sha na na na na na
Sha na na sha na na na na na

Oh well I know my teacker had no soul
and that school didn't teach no Rock'n'Roll oh no
...
