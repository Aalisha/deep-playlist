I remember a promise for a new tomorrow
I remember a promise to save our youth
Well I remember security for our aging
But when you made the pudding
You left out all the proof

I seem to recall you mentioning the word hope
I seem to recall you mentioning solutions
You made it sound like an angel had landed on our doorstep
Gave us more like two steps back than any evolution

Your empty promises are filling people's heads
You have us crawling round in circles
Instead of walking straight ahead
I remember what you passed for truth
Turned out lies and stay here
Yes I remember what you said
Yeah I remember what you said
