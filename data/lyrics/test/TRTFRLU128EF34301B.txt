I see that look in your eyes
And I wish I knew what you were thinking
You promised me to stay here forever
But words can easily lie
Have a little trust you said, don? t be in a rush
But my fears are not so willing
Have a little trust, mmm
Show me how you feel tonight

How deep is your love?
My love is much higher than a mountain
No one can help me when I fall
Should we stay together, save our dreams forever?
Let me feel the depth of your emotion
