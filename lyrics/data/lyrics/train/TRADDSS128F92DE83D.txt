Got that drink in my cup
Got that, I got that

Radio killa, killa, you know how we do
Ah, you know how we do
Ah yeah, you know how we do
Radio killa, killa, you know how we do

Step up in here fresher than a mother
Yes, indeed I'm flyer than a mother
Two tone phantom hop out hello

So get up on me baby, like you wanna do me
Right here, right here, right here, right here
And I'm a get up on you like I wanna do you
Right here, right here, right here

All my girls
Got that drink in my cup
Got that drink in my cup
Got that drink in my cup
