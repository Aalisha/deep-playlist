Sleeping is giving in
No matter what the time is.
Sleeping is giving in
So lift those heavy eyelids.

People say that you'll die
Faster than without water.
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your sons and scare your daughter.

People say that your dreams
Are the only things that save ya.
Come on baby in our dreams
We can live our misbehavior.

Every time you close your eyes
Lies, lies!
Every time you close your eyes
Lies, lies!
Every time you close your eyes
Lies, lies!
Every time you close your eyes
Lies, lies!
