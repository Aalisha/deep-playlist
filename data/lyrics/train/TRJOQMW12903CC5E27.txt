Here we go again
I brought us here on purpose
I knew we wouldn't make it out
You see it in my face
You and I were born to die in this place

All the walls you built to surround you
Crumble right before your eyes
Yet again gain it seems you have failed
This is how it all ends
We couldn't change It if we tried
Come on come on go ahead try
Go ahead and try
