I'm so hard for a rich girl
My heels are high, my eyes cast low
And I don't know how to love
I get too tired after midday, lately

I take it out on my good friends
But the worst stays in
Oh, where would I begin

My office glows, all night long
It's a nuclear show and the stars are gone
Elevator, elevator, take me home

I'm so hard for the rich girl
Her heels so high and my hopes so low
...
