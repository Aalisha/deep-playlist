Baby, if we leave the clubbin'
Won't be nothing but the lovin'
'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed
Baby, if we leave the clubbin'
Won't be nothing but the lovin'
'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed

Dam it's hot, floor is locked
Can't believe all that ass that you got
Talkin' slick girl might get you got
If you do that again have to arrest you

You telling me don't stop
You must not understand
Why they calling me Foxx
For how long I can stay in the box
I all ready know how I plan to posses you

Kiss you right below your naval
Then rub you with oil right on your ear
Till you stand up, make you turn around
And touch your toes
The next thing, girl, you already know

Baby, if we leave the clubbin'
Won't be nothing but the lovin'
