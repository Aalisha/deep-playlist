Well now your here you are in your life
And now your finding out why
You've got to learn how to fight
Before you learn how to fly

So stick your fist up prove them wrong
Don't lose the words to the song
Coz its a long way down
I guess you know that by now

But if you hold on
Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up
Yeah I will reach up too

Well now your here in your life
