I gave you a kiss last Saturday
And you still will not give one back to me
You never have good apology
And your hooves never wrap all the way around me

And if you want something you gotta give something
You can't take nothing if you don't give nothing away

Sometimes at the movies if I buy you a soda
You do sit just a little bit closer
And while we're all spending my money
Sometimes you do smile but I get mad
...
