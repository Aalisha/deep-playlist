I called this number three times already today
But I. I got scared, I put it back in place (I put my phone back in place)
I still don't know if I, should have called up
Look... just tell me, why, don't you, if I'm. out of place
Cause here's your chance to make me feel awkward
And wish that I had never even called up this place

I saw you though today
Walk by with Hippie Johnny
I had to call up and say
How I wanna take his place

So this phonecall today concerns Hippie Johnny
He's always stoned
He's never straight

I saw you today, you know
Walk by with Hippie Johnny
Look, I had to call up and say
I wanna take his place
