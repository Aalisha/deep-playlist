Whoa! Wild baby please open up the door!
You got all I need plus a little bit more!

Honey-honey
you're so right for me
Baby-baby
you so right for me

Well I've never seen a dolly
had quite so much
big bright eyes baby
and all of that such

Whew! Honey-honey
you so right for me
Baby-baby
you're so right for me
...
