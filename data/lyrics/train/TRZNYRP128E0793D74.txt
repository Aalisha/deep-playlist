She steals my love out a way that she licks her lips
She's got that look right down to her fingertips
My mind says something's wrong when she whips her eye
But when he told me something else that can never lie
And everytime that she touches me I just wanna die.

She's a bad girl
She's a bad girl
She's a bad girl
And I can't explain
How I feel, is it real
Is it love by another name?

Oh, and when I'm all alone in the night
I call her up on the telephone and feel allright
...
