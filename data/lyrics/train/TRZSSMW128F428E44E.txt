I'll be the one to let this roof cave in on me,
Buried in this house this wooden graveyard by the sea,
We push away our families to understand our needs,
The love and all the hate I used to hold in front of me

Restless nights all dizzy spells all sand between my sheets,
Showing signs of thirst like dried out boardwalk-blistered feet,
And now I know I never knew about you, only me,
We carried this inside like some disease we couldn't beat

But we could work, we try to live and get by,
To make our family in a second floor apartment,
Standing on a threshhold body out and flesh cold,
Go ahead and celebrate the things you lost

Try to grieve, to flex and release,
To cry and work out with the underrate apartment,
Moments are a lifetime,
Lockin' in a straight line,
This could take a little while to shake things off

Down by the waters edge,
Under a dying tree,
I let my body slip,
...
