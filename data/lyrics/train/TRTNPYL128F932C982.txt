Walking up to your street
Rehearsing everything I'll say
I know I'll say it different,
Or at least another way.

So if I stay too long
It's 'cause I need ya.

Hope that you won't make me cry
Like you did the other night (do you remember?)
People stopped and stared at me
As if I wasn't right (don't worry).
