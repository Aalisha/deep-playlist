Girl you so hot, you so hot
Like burning you, like burnin you
Girl you so hot, you so hot
Like burnin you, like burning you

Girl I like your style and your attitude
Yore polite yet you're so rude
I want to get in your head
Right before I get in your head

I got some things I wann do to ya
And something that's new to ya
I know you got a wild side
And baby I got a wild side

So back it up and let me put it on you
