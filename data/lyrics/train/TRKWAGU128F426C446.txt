(straight Jacking) [x4]
(grab the nine with the hollow point tip) [x2]
(It goes 1.2.3.)

I'm giving up nuthing.
No maybe on your shit boy, I'm scheming.
I'm solo, numero uno, the Eiht's fiending.
Just to get my hands on your goods.
Give me the slip boy you wish you could.
Geah, you're kinda frightened by the Compton night stalker.
When I got you by the throat you better be a fast talker.
Times running out for your program.
Better hide from the Compton hitman.
What ch'you got in your trunk? Fool unlock it
As I put the pat down on your pockets.
The neighbourhood jacker's on the creep.
I bet your sounds 'll sound good in my jeep.
And tell your freak to get with the program too,
or she becomes black and blue.
No harm done, and I'm out before somebody can be told.
Episode one of the Jack Mode.

(Straight Jacking) Geah
(Straight Jacking) Wut?
