Don't let them rule your world
Don't let them rule your life
Just let your feeling show the way

Don't let them rule your world
Don't let them rule your life
Just let your feeling show the way, yeah

All right
This one is getting out to another out here
You gotta find yourself and don't rely to another
Chose yourself ... in the world
...
