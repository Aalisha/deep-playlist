Tryin' to make a train at sunrise
Gonna have to run a red light
Tryin' to make a train at sunrise
Gonna have to run a red light
Travlin' with my Carolina
You know, the girl kept me up all night
And when my Carolina throw down
You know the girl know how to fight

Don't think we're gonna make it
There's nothin' else that anyone could do
