Can't you see my darling
That the harder I try
The more we grow apart
Please believe me
The sweeter the kiss
The colder turn your arms
And the colder grows your heart
And baby, more I love you
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
I taste it from your lips
And baby more I love you
I see it in your eyes
