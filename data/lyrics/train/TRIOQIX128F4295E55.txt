All the working boys are craning their necks
She knows they love it when she's wearing a dress
She works hard to erase the lines on her face
And the pills to help her cope with the stress

All the office guys are scratching their heads
She won't take any of them home to bed
After she's had her fill she hands them the bill
And laughs on the phone with her friends

But she gets tired
All the games she likes to play wear her down

He got fed up with all the cards up her sleeve
All the half truths he tried to believe
And that night at The Top when she kissed the cop
It just seemed like it was time to leave
