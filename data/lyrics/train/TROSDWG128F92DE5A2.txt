There's an eight lane highway out in L.A.
Headed nowhere
Every day is a rat race, they're fighting for first place
It's like a nightmare

It's a life of mass confusion, it's a heavy load
I'm ready to trade the fast lane for a country road

There's a New York skyline but there's no sunshine
Down on Broadway
Watching the stocks rise keeps them paralyzed
Up on park place

It's a 5th Avenue elusion digging for the gold
I'm ready to trade the fast lane for a country road
...
