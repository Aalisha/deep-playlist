Sitting here forgotten like
A book upon a shelf
No one there to turn the page
You're left to read yourself
Alone to sit and wonder just how the story ends
Cause no-one ever told you child
You gotta be your own best friend

Sunny days cloudy days
Always seem the same
If love were made of clouds I
Almost wish that it would rain
Even when the skies are clear
The weather's always blue
Every day would be nice If I had
Someone I could come home to
