Finding me
Finding truth
Finding love in a changing world
Finding peace in simplicity
Finding now where I come from

Finding courage
Finding faith
Finding acceptance in a narrow space
Finding time when time has gone
Finding now what's going on

I need a house
I need a room
I need a bed to sleep in
I need a coffee and a kitchen sink
Aaahhh-ah
I need a friend
I need a love
I need someone who'll miss me
When I get home
Don't wanna be all alone

Finding the gate
Finding the door
Finding the streets I used to walk before
When I was free
