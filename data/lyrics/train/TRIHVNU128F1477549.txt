Dirty old river must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy make me feel dizzy
Taxi lights shine so bright
But I don't need no friends
As long as I gaze at Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise
Sha la la

Every day I look at the world from my window
Sha la la
Jelly jellys in evening time
Waterloo sunset's fine

Terry meets Julie Waterloo station
Every Friday night
But I am so lazy I don't want to wonder
I'll stay at home at night
...
