You may fall from the mountain, drown in the deep blue sea
You ain't did the right fallin', til you fall in love with me
You's a love makin' mama, sweet as you can be
Ah you may be a little rockin', but baby you all right with me
Now for your love baby, I'll be your slave
When Gzabriel blows his trumpet, I rise from my grave
Cause you's a love makin' mama, sweet as you can be
...
