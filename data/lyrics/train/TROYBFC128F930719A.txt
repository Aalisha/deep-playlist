Come to Wichita
Won't be there in forty days
This an evil land
Brings a devil's cloud

Take a message
To abide in what you own
And there'll be no more
No more people singing
La la la

In one morning you will be mine
Where the fields are smiling
No more people singing, la la la
In one morning you will be mine
Where the fields are smiling
Where the fields are smiling
