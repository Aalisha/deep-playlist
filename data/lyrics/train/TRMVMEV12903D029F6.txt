I was cleaning the ash from the fire
and putting the party away
helping out all of my lost friends
to see the light of day

I was feeling the wind through the windows
Sometimes it crashed through the wall
seems like it comes out of nowhere
theres no warning at all

chorus
sometimes a river
sometimes a river
runs dry
...
