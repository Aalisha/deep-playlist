Where should I begin cripplin' all you villains in
Never injuring the civilians that are innocent
So sick of listening to a bunch of synonyms
Same band every man but aint no need to mention them
You actors had me crackin' up with laughter
Now you gonna have to hear another cracker rapper
Still hearing all of these people callin' me a wannabe
But I'm gonna keep it going 'cuz you heard them all from me

Chorus
You can cover your ears, but the noise won't stop,
Your still gonna hear the white trash hip-rock.
