Dreams drift away like leaves on the water
They roll down the river and slip out of sight
Too many times we do what we ought
Put off 'till tomorrow what we'd really rather do tonight
And later realize

Time passes by
People pass on
At the drop of a tear
They're gone
Let's do what we dare
Do what we like
And love while we're here
...
