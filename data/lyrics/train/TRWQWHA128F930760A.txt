Is it a dream, 'cause I can't believe
We're at the place we're at
When we hang up the phone, I felt so alone
Wanted to call right back
But you're needing some time and I'm needing space
Didn't know just how much this heart could ache

I can't forget the words that we've said
Spinning inside my mind
How we both are the ones that we thought would never come
We thought we'd never find
Oh, you're too great a gift to ever let go
Oh, I love you now more than you can know
And I want you to hear my heart

All of the days of all of my life
I pray will be with you
All of my nights right by your side, oh...
