One night, and the world's your oyster

Night in night in na-na-night in night in Bangkok Bangkok
Night in night in na-na-night in night in Ba-a-a-angkok
Night in night in na-na-night in night in Bangkok and you
Night in night in night in Bangkok, pearls ain't free
Night in night in na-na-night in night in Bangkok and you
Night in night in na-na-night in night in Bangkok and you
Night in night in na-na-night in night in Bangkok Bangkok
Night in night in na-night in, pearls ain't free (free)

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she she she

One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the god's a she
