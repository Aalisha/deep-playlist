Moon is rising for you
Colours are flying for you
Turn your back and paper over the cracks
Poured it all out under that moon

Baby was crying for you
But you know she'll be arriving soon
Mice are all up with your silver spoon

Back there's no turning
Wheels will keep moving
Your lies won't stop me from
Going home going home

And there's no way are they coming back
Paved their way then you covered their tracks
No way are they coming back
Paved their way then you covered their tracks
Covered their tracks
