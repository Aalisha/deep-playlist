Don't say that you care, don't tell me how I should be
'Cause you know it ain't fair to go and try to fix me

You used to love my laugh, now you're sayin' I'm too loud
You used to love the way I dress, now I gotta tone it down
It's like you tryna change things that make me, me
But I can't help but be, be who I be

We can be different people
We can be different people
You gotta love me or just leave me, baby
It's who I am, it's who you are

Sometimes we won't see eye to eye
'Cause we're different people
But I gotta love you or just leave you, baby
It's who I am, it's who you are
