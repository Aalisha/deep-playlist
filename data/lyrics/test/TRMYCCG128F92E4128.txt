Oh, there's something on my mind
Won't somebody please, please tell me what's wrong?
You're just a fool, you know you're in love
You've got to face it to live in this world
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad
You know you love him, you can't understand
Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man
He's got me smiling when I should be ashamed
Got me laughing when my heart is in pain
Oh no, I must be a fool
But I'll do anything he wants me to do
You're just a fool, you know you're in love
You've got to face it to live in this world
