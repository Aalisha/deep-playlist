You used to light up the room
Like a fire in the night
Admit you were wrong
And that I was right
You shouldn't go with him
When you could've had me
You shouldn't go with him
When you could've had me

Then you call me up
In the middle of the night
Admitting you were wrong
And that I was right
I couldn't help you out
You go or you stay
I couldn't help you out
You go or you stay

Go after someone else
Or you'll forever be lonely
What you've already got
Is all you'll ever get from me
...
