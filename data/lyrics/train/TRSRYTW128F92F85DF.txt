Sister Mary discipline, so prim and proper with your pale white skin,
Thought school was for learning, boy was I wrong,
I wanna be your choir boy all night long,

So tell me Joey where you shackled in sin?
Were you screaming Hail Mary when she let you in?
What can I do? What will it take?
To be tied up in the Rosary and feel the heavens shake

Chorus:
She likes it, Tied to the Bells
Such a sweet, sweet addiction when she's under that spell
...
