I am your main man if you're looking for trouble
I take no lip no one's tougher than me
I'd kick your face you'd soon be seeing double
Hey little girl keep your hands off of me

I'm a rocker

I'm a roller too, baby
I'm a rocker

Down at the juke joint me and the boys are stompin'
Bippin' an' boppin' and telling a dirty joke or two
In walked this chick and I new she was up to something
