Rain On My Doorstep
I Got You On The Line
There's Something Missing
That Money Can't Buy
Weight On My Shoulder
Why Would You Leave
I Thought We Were Special
You Got Me On My Knees

Don't Bring It Down - It Down
Don't Say It's Over Now
I Can't Endure The Pain
Don't Bring It Down
Baby Let It Be

Words Being Spoken
Trying Hard To Understand
Life Has No Meaning
