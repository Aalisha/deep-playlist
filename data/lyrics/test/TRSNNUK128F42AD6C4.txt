Jesus are you real,
did we make you up
is salvation what you want or
is faith enough
do you know where I'm bound
you know who I am
are you just a word I use but I don't understand

Standing like a statue in the sea
in a little truck stop in Tennessee
and bombs are crashing down in waves
on a giant TV screen
and I am struck I cannot move
to make it stop what can I do
people are dying in their beds
while this flag flies over our heads.

Jesus are you stronger than a loaded gun
I'm beginning to believe you're not the only one
strong enough to show your love
strong enough to give
strong enough to go through hell
strong enough to live

and all night long I sat with you
in a darkened hospital room
and nurses checked in by the hour
i was made aware of a higher power
