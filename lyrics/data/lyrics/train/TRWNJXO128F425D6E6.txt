Hearts gone astray, leaving hurt when they go
I went away, just when you, you need me so
You won't regret, i come back beggin' you
Won't you forget, welcome love we once knew
Open up your eyes then you realize
Here i stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, girl to be my bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love
>from the very start, open up your heart
