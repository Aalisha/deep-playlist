I want to thank you my friend
For making me feel worthwhile
Sweeter than the honey of your lips
And kindness in your smile
Hand in hand we float across the room
Explosions deep inside
Cheek to cheek, there's clouds under my feet
There's only you and I

Please tell me what you like
Does that feel nice
Give me a sign
If you love it I can do it again
We've got the rest of the night
To get it right
Please tell me what you like
If that feels nice give me a sign
If you love it I can do it again
We've got the rest of our lives
To get it right

Lookin' back on lonely nights
Searching for love again
