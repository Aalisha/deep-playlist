"My Only Star"

After a day turns into a night
I will light up my light in the sky
Don't shead a tear on the ground I once laid cause I'll be here

From your tears I'll make a chrystal neckless
To surround my heart and my cheast
I'll be up here and walk by your side day and night

Look at me
Me here among the stars
