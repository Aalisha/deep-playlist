[playdough]
i swear, i care not what the man thinks
my plan aint paper til drips with the fruit of my lips
yet, if i get no dap from hand clap
from rap that i make, my tangible heart break

[manchild]
with my arms wide open, i hold opponents to my creed
in arrangement, shoplifting stolen moments that i need
play stick ball with my chances, broke the window on a street car named desire
parked next to the chariots of fire

[listener]
held down in this quagmire tarnishing crowns as i perspire
dwindling empires as i plug wires to transcribe my fire
filling ears with my word lives wrapped tight to let you describe
the feeling through your own eyes

[manchild]
and they throw their souls up in the air, cause thats the coin they like to toss
they want life without the loss, they want christ without the cross
pretty faces, empty inside race the runway, although some say
gunplay move the crowd someday, by bloody sunday

[sev statik]
i dont bother writing flows about clothes and cars
record sales is not a measure of how dope you are
and this knowledge is what seperates us from them
i rather snuff the page, then beat it down with my pen

[playdough]
microphone testing, a blessing indeed
i stay pressing the seed, hoping the hearts will receive
in grounds fertile, a brown journal holding the picture
