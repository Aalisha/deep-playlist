The hand is on and I'm on top
Made my quads when we were dealt the flop.
And no one, no one can beat this hand
I'm at the wheel and I'm in command
Now that everything is going my way
Can't be bluffed I'm here to stay
You don't know that you're drawing dead
So call this bet and I'll be the way ahead.
