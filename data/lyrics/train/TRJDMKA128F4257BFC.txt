Out of the corner
Of my tired eyes, I'm not surprised
It's now a quarter past too late,
Nothing new, it's no case out of the ordinary
I'm so very wrapped around your finger this time
Oh, won't you give me awhile to unwind?

You're on top of the world
And I'm just waiting, making up your excuse
You say that love's tough, are you sure?
Ain't it just a piece of cake to make me look like a fool?
You're on top of the world and if you're thinking I've been blinking while you're breaking the rules, don't that make you the fool?
you're on top of the world

You're like a splinter
Just killing me slowly from inside
The piercing winter is so much
