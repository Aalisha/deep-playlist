This can't be love, just hooked up for fun, you couldn't be the one, those things never last
This can't be love, that's not what I need, you feel to good to me, this habits forming fast

I just wanted a kiss, it ended up like this, it's getting so hard to resist

This can't be love
It's not what it feels like, everything's way too good
It's not what it feels like, don't even think I could
Even though it seems so right, thinking maybe I might tonight
This can't be love

This can't be love, I tried to escape, those stupid mistakes, so don't say that word
This can't be love, to feel this free, when you're here with me, everything's been blurred
