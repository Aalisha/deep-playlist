Got six bucks
Thats enough for a beer run
Now all we need is someone to do the buying
My buddy Lendell
He aint never got no money
But he drinks up most the beer everytime

By nine oclock got a half case between us
Pull into the Quick Pick Lendell had to have some smoke
There sit Susie in Billy Scotts Camaro
Lendell gives her a wink
Billy says you want ya neck broke

Their bout to go toe to toe
Here comes a cop car
Lendell says Cemetery Bill
