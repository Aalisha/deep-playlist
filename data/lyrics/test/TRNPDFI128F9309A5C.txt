Remember Rio and get down
Like some other DJ, in some other town
She's been trying to tell me to hold tight
But I've been waiting this whole night
But I've been down across a road or two
But now I've found the velvet sun
That shines on me and you

In the back, uh huh, I can't crack
We're on top
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh
I can't fake, we're on top
We're on top

The day is breaking, we're still here
Your body's shaking, and it's clear
...
