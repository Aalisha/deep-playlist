Mr. Lif
Pardon me / so rude to notduce / my name is Lif / I'm raw, and I be gettin' loose / on the M. I. / the "C". is just a sickle I use / to perforate the neck, and pop the head with a noose / beheaded rappers / usually indebted rappers / factors they miscalculated left them all annihilated / I'm over skilled and under stated / often under rated / overlooked because the market's over saturated / I'm fascinated with this fabricated / reality / we're living in / so imprisoning / a far cry / from what I was envisioning / they took freedom / and made it limiting / imminent / doom awaits / hardships accumulate / assuming you relate to this glimpse of human fate / open your eyes / be wise and stay true / vivid with expression when you're representing you.
