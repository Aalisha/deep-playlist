Little Tom, what will be your fate?
Little Tom, will you be someone great?
Do you know right from wrong, are they teaching you at home?
Or have they turned you loose to roam Little Tom?

I walked into a cafe and ordered myself something to eat
When a little boy walked in with his shoes half off his feet
He said,? Buy a paper, Mister,? I said,? How older are you son?
? Seven, sir and when my papers are sold, I'll be on my way home?

? What's your name?
? Thomas but everybody calls me Little Tom
They named me after my daddy but they say, I look like my mom?
? Why it's almost midnight son, you should be home asleep?

? I know it but I wanted to get me a bicycle
And I gotta help mommy buy somethin' to eat
My daddy's pretty mean to us?
