I got the dark night blues
I'm feeling awful bad
I got the dark night blues
Mama, I'm feeling awful bad
That's the worst ol' feeling
That a good man have ever had

I followed my brown
From the depot to the train
I followed my fair brown
From the depot to the train
And the blues came down
Like dark night showers o' rain

I drink so much whiskey
I stagger when I'm sleep
...
