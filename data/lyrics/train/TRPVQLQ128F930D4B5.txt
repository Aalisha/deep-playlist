The girls in California, they all look the same to me
The way they take for granted living by the sea
They can be your best friends if you don't expect too much
The girls in California, well they all believe in love

I met this girl named Liz in a bar just south of here
She moved to New York City so that she could disappear
I told her she was beautiful and she thanked me for the words
I will never understand just how he got through to her

She moves in such a way
That people fall in love with her every single day
