It's complicated
It always is
That’s just the way it goes
Feels like I've waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows

Head underwater
Now I can't breathe
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn’t stop it if I could

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something’s here tonight

Give me a reason
