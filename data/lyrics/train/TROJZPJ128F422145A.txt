Say it's alright
If you really love me
It's my life
And I really wanted you that night
Was about to break
If I could just take off my pants
Time is not to waste
We couldn't let it slide through our hands

When my heart called
You answered me
When I was lonely
You were there for me

There's no rules in love
Can't you see?
No rules in love
For you and me
No rules in love
