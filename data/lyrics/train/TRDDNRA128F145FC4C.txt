Good things come to you, you stay on that too
Soon you'll never stop, always keep it hot
Ow, ow, ow baby, because I like what you do to me
Baby, because I like it when it's all for me

I like my friends exciting, if they keep my fever rising
'Cause I always like to keep it hot
Little girl, out in the play and I'll bet you'll wanna stay
And I guarantee, "I'll hit the spot"

You be good to me, I'll be good to you
Anything you want or anything you do
I've got my eyes on you and my engine too
Give it all I've got and to keep it hot

Oww, ow, ow, baby, humm
Tell all your friends that we're movin' on the one
He, he, baby, if you can take it you'll have more from here

I hear plenty people talkin' but those same people are walkin'
