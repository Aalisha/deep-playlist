Fill it and thrill it,
then turn back to kill it
just gimme the laughter again.
You were a mistress,
just making me distress
and I'm gonna miss this
I wait and wait and wait...

You're so easy to love,
smile away my pain,
you're so easy to love,
make it right again and again and again...

Easy to love,
always been too late,
you're so easy to love,
...
