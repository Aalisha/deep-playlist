In your face written in, carved in stone
Here comes that feeling once again
Pop the lid, down we go
Falling fast though the undertow
Missing link crossing path
Bleeding eyes see your fractured past
Point of your vision clear
You'll never...

Cut to the point leaving nothing to hide
Nothing to hide
Out of breath, out of time
You're out of time
...
