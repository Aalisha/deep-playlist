Sat down to write you a letter
Promised I'd write it today
Suddenly it occurred to me
That I don't even know what to say

I don't know where to start
Don't know how to begin

When our love was beginning
It was so right and so true
Now here I am and it's ending
Trying to find out just was for you

I don't know where to start it
Don't know how to begin
And I don't even pray anymore at night
'Cause I don't think that anyone hears

All that is heard when it's late at night
Are my tears, oh my tears
So many tears, so many tears
(So many tears)

So long, it's been so loveless
There's jealousy, played its part
Then you begin, but I don't understand
Trying purposely to break my heart
...
