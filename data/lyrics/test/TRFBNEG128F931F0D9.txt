Don't think. Don't speak. I will do this for you.
Every natural thought or feeling you've ever had will change tonight.
Don't think. Don't speak. I will do this for you.
Trust the pedestal, for now we become a higher being.

I am your new mind.
I am your new you.
I am your new sin.
I am your new lust.
I am for you now.

Control... and collapse... collide.
A letter plagued by a twisted word. Slave. You will become mine, for there are no more options.
There will not be a sweet consolation... this is what is supposed to happen.
