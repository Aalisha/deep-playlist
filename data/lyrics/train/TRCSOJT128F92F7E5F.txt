Here you go, way too fast
Don't slow down you're gonna crash
You should watch, watch your step
Don't look out, gonna break your neck

So shut, shut your mouth
'Cuz I'm not listening anyhow
I've had enough, enough of you
Enough to last a lifetime through

So what do you want of me
Got no words of sympathy
And if I go around with you
You know that I get messed up too
With you...

Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
