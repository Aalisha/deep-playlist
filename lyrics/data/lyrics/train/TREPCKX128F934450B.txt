This body feels better now than ever before 
Like a boy playing drums on rusty garbage cans 
I really know how to smile now without laughing out loud 
I just need to learn how to act in one place at a time 

Tomorrow you'll be gone 
Montreal's still singing our song 
Can you teach me how to breathe? 
Montreal is still bleeding
