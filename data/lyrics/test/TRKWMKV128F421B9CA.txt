between the hammer and the holiday (holiday)
I take the hammer each and every time
you just can't wait to waste us all away (all away)
why you save face, I'll be shavin' mine

in the light
in the sound
in the sound, in the light
I've seen rapids
I've seen rubble
you're in trouble
a whole lot of trouble

i have punishment to fit the crime
but if the crime is the punishment
where will you wind up
waitin' on that punishment
you'll wake up and wonder where the summer went
because it's cold up the river
