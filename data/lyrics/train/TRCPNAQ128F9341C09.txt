But what about us?
One government, one world motto,"in God we trust,"

And bank statements that don't make sense,
Around the time it's time for me to pay rent.
My patience is running out, the truth is coming out;
Abusive clout, CEO's using large amounts,
We could never dream ofÂ ?.
It's like we're in a war without a heater,
A broken-up casino staring at the dealer,

They rush to lock you up for puffin on the stress reliever,
And Obama wouldn't stop em neither,
Would McCain? let me explain,
got lost playing your game,
They pumped a couple of slugs in my frame.
