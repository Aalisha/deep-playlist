Oh
Record this one

Let me take you home
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morn'
And she said, "Daddy, let me take ya home
Papi, let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami, you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on", bitch

I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's wilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin' on Crenshaw, cruisin' for food
When she pulled up beside me, set off in the 'Lac

And I said, "Damn girl, you actin' like you don't know
Never seen me before
Episode of cribs on MTV, video what you think TS stand for?"
She said, "Terrific Sex" yeah that too and the diamonds is no facade
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX, now I'm rich
Got the world screamin' Terror Squad, think about it now

Everywhere we go, every other city we tour
They never say no
Seems like every other night
I got a different chick beggin' me

Let me take you home
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the morn'
And she said, "Daddy, let me take ya home
Papi, let me take ya home"
And I said, "Mami, you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on", bitch
