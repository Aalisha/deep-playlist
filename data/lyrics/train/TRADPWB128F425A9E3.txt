I was up this mornin', blues walkin' like a man
I was up this mornin', blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand

Ah, blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Travel on ol' Jeffrey Lee, ya know
Can't seem to turn him around

So preach the blues
Preach the blues now

Blues is low down shaking chill
