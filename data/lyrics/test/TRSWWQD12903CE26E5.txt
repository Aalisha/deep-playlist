Scatman's World
(Scatting by Scatman John)
I'm calling out from Scatland
I'm calling out from Scatman's world.
If you wanna break free you better listen to me.
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy. (2x)

Everybody's talkin' something very shockin' just to
Keep on blockin' what they're feelin' inside but
But listen to me brother, you just keep on walkin' 'cause
You and me and sister ain't got nothin' to hide.

Scatman, fat man, black and white and brown man
Tell me 'bout the colour of your soul.
If part of your solution isn't ending the pollution
Then I don't want to hear your stories told.
I want to welcome you to Scatman's world
