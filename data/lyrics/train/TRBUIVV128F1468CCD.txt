(Liane Foly/Andr√© Manoukian/Philippe Viennet)
adaptation anglaise Peter Kingsbery

In looking for a trace of you I've all but combed the earth
I've dragged myself to one end back to where I started first
I lose count of the miles and all the bubbles that you burst

The comfort of a stranger's touch never did me any good
I ask again and again if I could have been misunderstood
