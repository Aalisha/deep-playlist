I tried to stop myself
Told you those games ain't good for yourself
Gave ya advice 'cuz I thought you could hear
Better listen closely 'cuz your end is near

Won't show you no mercy at all
Gonna kick ya, kick ya when you're takin' your fall
Won't show you no mercy today
Gonna hit ya, hit ya when you're movin' on your way
