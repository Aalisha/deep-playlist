You pull me down to the floor of our apartment
A little while later we are laughing at our carpet burns
I like the way that it glows outside as the room gets darker
How I wish we could stay like this while the rest of the world turns

There has never been a time when I didn't wanna be your boyfriend
There has never been a time when I didn't wanna know your name
Free falling from a work in progress, free falling from a life on hold
There has never been a time when I didn't want you

Yeah, my good lover is my one good thing these days
