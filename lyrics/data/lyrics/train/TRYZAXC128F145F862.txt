Mister, mister push button junkie lookin for some dirt to buy.
Landslide, it's a corporation landslide waitin for a kiss from an atom bomb.

This situation's critical, my back's against the wall but we like it.
You're walkin' in our sleep and I can't feel at all.
I said, "Hey man, just gimmie some truth."

See what you wanna see, feel what you wanna feel.
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna deal, I don't wanna be any part of your stupid
mother fucker machine.
Do what ya wanna do, kill if ya gotta kill, 'cause I just don't believe your
point
of view.

Welcome to the numb, fools.
Welcome to the numb.
Welcome to the numb.
