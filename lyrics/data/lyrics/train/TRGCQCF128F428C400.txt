Wake up and welcome to the realization that it's over for everyone
We'll be bowling out...
Throwing it all away!
I'd say "without a doubt in mind,"
But I've never been so afraid...

Today's the day that you will see everything fade away
and down the drain.
It's closer than you think...
It's closer than you think.
