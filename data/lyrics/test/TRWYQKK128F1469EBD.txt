Doo doo doo doo
More than a woman
Doo doo doo doo
Oh, girl I've known you very well
I've seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
(But now you take my breath away).
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You've got me working day and night
(Just trying to keep a hold on you).
Refrain 1:
Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die.
Bridge:
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time.
Chorus:
Oh...
...
