wouldn't it be wonderful
wouldn't it be sweet
if people came with manuals
for bein human beings

with photographs and diagrams
for helpin life make sense
every answer there in the
table of contents

thrown in this world alone
to figure out on our own

when to hang in and when to walk out
how to go on when you've lost someone you love
who to believe and who not to trust
where to find hope when your dreams all turn to dust
...
