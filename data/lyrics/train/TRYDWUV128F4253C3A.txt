We're as different as night and day
We're the same in different ways
And it's true, just look at me and you

We can change the way we are
The power lives inside our hearts
We can be anything we wanna be

If coal can turn to diamonds
And sand can turn to pearls
If a worm can turn into a butterfly
Then love can turn the world
Oh, love can turn the world

The God who made you made us all
