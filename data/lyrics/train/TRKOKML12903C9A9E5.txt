So everybody is rockin' and everyone is feelin' all right - all right
It's all when the youth and there's soon gonna be a fight - be a fight
It says someone's gonna get their head kicked in tonight!

Everybody is rockin' and everyone just wants more - more
So there's gonna be a pool of blood on the dancin' floor - floor
Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight!

We're gonna rip off the halls, rip off the walls
