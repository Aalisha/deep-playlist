And in the end I'll rise
And in the end I'll rise
Endured the event that (Event that)
Should have been my demise
Looking forward to new life, my second chance
In a candid instance I witness life flash before my eyes
My sense of purpose is encouraged by my will to survive

Looking past that day toward my future
What will it be? Knowing what must be done

And it shows my seams are frayed (Seams are frayed)
