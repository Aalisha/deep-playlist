Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
and as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh...

Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?

Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
although she needs you more than she loves you

And I know it's over
still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
...
