Speed this locomotive on the railroad line
and tell the driver man that I ain't got much time
there's a little lady waitin' down the track
I'm on my way to meet her and I'm not turning back
so hurry on mister, I just learned
my reservation's been confirmed
I ain't go no sleeping car or paid first rate
I'm picking at a chicken in the third class rate
don't misunderstand me 'cause I paid my fair
...
