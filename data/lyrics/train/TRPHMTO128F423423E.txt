Four, three, two, one, go!

This is America, yeah, it's true
Everything else is false that was taught to me and you
But I'll try to sort it out
I'll try to sort it out

This is America, yeah, it's true
Everything else is false that was taught to me and you
But I'll try to sort it out
I'll try to sort it out with you

Did you promise the world that you'd change it?
Sounds like the way that I feel
