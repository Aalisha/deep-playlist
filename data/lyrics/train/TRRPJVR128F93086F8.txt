Afrikaan Beat, We're dancing to the Afrikaan Beat,
I'm burning like the tropical heat
Dancing to the Afrikaan Beat.

If you think I hold you too tight,
Just blame it on the music tonight.
The rhythm soon will make it seem right,
Then your heart and mine will unite.

While they play the Afrikaan Beat,
Keep dancing to the AFrikaan Beat,
You're in my arms, the feeling is sweet,
...
