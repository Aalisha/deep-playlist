The best thing that I ever did
At the time was my worst mistake
Seventeen and just a kid
I was seventeen when I threw my childhood away for a hazel eyed quarter back
Senior year and eight months pregnant
I've never felt so fat
Wishin' I could go to prom
But they don't make dresses for girls like that (girls like that)

I should've been cheerin' for the home team
Top of my lungs sayin' "Go big blue"
Should've been marchin' with band
Instead of cryin' in a delivery room
