don't think that you're a columbine
You gotta face the problem, yeah
We didn't climb all the way up to the top to hit rock bottom, yeah, yeah, yeah
And your life has changed not for better not for worse
Get it rearranged, don't you fall back under curse
Chorus
Carry on and on you know it won't be wrong
