ohhh,
Watch baby, watch baby, so I got it like that
Watch baby, watch baby, so I got it like that

I always feel like somebody's watching me, watch baby, watch baby
he got my back, so I'm down with the king so I got it like that.(x2)

Suggestions, questions
People want to know
Is there life after talk
Cause there's talk on the road
Twistin' words that I've never even said
To the ones that I trust
Or my "Boo" in our bed
Will he make it, man I bet he won't
As they're runnin' through the minutes
On their cell phones
So the picture's painted
You got the point
And that junk's creepin' into my solo joint
