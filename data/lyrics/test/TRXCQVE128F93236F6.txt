I'm still breathing and my heart's still beating
I might as well start living again
And so I threw on a shirt, put on a jacket
Went out to meet some friends
And now I'm acting like I couldn't be better
Like I've always got this smile on my face
Walking around, weaving through the crowd
And trying not to look out of place

'Cause everybody's here
Yeah but if you look close you'll see
Everybody's here
Everybody's here but me
...
