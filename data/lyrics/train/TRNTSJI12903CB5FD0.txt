Let every heart that moves beneath the heavens*
Look up to see the light of our redemption
Together Unashamed
To sing the saving name Jesus
Let every hand be lifted unincombered
To you I only hope our loving Father
To calls us from our sin
From dying to find life again
[Pre-Chorus:]
Come Down
Come Down on Earth
