Once in your life
Love comes along
To take your breath away
Tender and true
Shared between two
To last for always
Love can tell so many stories
Tragedies of fallen glories
Promises are broken every day

Don't break my heart
Don't let me down
Cos you're the only one for me
Don't walk away
Don't let me go
When we have just begun
The only thing I ask of you
Is don't break my heart
...
