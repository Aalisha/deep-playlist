I wouldn't sell my belt to industry
So they carded me and they carted me off
Naked but that belt around my waist
It was my father's once, I still see his face

I fled through field and farm, stripped of natural charm
Naked but that belt I wear so well
Past the pyramids and the liberty bell

I said whoa, they carted me off
Yeah, whoa, they carded me
