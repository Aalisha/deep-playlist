Before the sun has touched the sky
Colors bursting from Your eyes
Before the flood of the morning light

Before the earth has felt Your heat
Before I stand up to my feet
Before I begin to feel this weak

Satisfy me, Lord, oh
I'm begging You, help me see
You're all I want, You're what I need
Oh satisfy me, Lord

And when the day is closing in like the stars in the night
I am falling into the pull of the earth and its affections

In me, O Lord, can You create a pure heart
