You carry the blame
So where's your heart, the devotion you paid?
You're a slave to yourself and the joke of your name
Make your peace and go with him
Leave with us ungrateful sin

I'm not looking for my way out of this
You just carry the blame (carry the blame)
Merciless, now I hold your fate
Confess your shame
No one here will miss your face (carry the blame)
You're a snake in true disguise
Confess your shame, you carry the blame
