We are the revolution and the institution
We are the sons of God and you're demise
We'll cut loose the dogs We're gonna burn your boots
We're gonna start another war

We're right
You're wrong
the end justifies the means

We are the next invasion and the resistance too
We are the wing commander
We are the henchmen
...
