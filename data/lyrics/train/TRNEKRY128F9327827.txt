My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, babe
And as I roam my way alone
I find it hard for me to carry on
I need your strength, I need your tender touch
I need the love, my dear, I miss so much
My world is empty without you, babe
My world is empty without you, baby

You've given me a true love
