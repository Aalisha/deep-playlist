I ride east every other Friday
and if I had it my way
the day would not be wasted on this drive.
and I want so bad to hold you
son, there's things I haven't told you
your mom and me couldn't get along

so I drive, and I think about my life
and wonder why, that I slowly die inside
every time I turn that truck around
right at the Georgia line
and I count the days
and the miles back home to you
on that highway 20 ride.
