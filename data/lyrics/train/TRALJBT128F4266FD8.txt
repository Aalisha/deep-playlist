Uh
Yeah
I could wait all night and day
To go to a party sit down and wait
Give my request to the Dj
'Cause my song he's gotta play
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playin' my song
Play
Come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play
Come on Dj play that song
You know that it turns me on
Dj just play that song
Just turn it up and turn it on
Dj just play that song
'Cause I wanna be dancin' all night long
Won't you play my play my play my play my play my favorite song
I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancin' all night long
It feels so right that it can't be wrong
(be wrong)
I get chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind
