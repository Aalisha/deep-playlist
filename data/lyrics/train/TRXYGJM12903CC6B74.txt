I sang your praises daily
And we let ourselves get swept away
It's true baby
We held heaven in our hands for days, yeah

You wait a long time for something wild to take you somewhere
And all I needed was to fly
It's a long way from paradise to ordinary
Picture us just smiling there, we didn't have a care

And I remember how it all came true
It was oh, so tender
And I was lost with you
By the sweet Sorrento moon

Stars don't burn that brightly
Every season surely slips away
But you baby
You're the reason why I chose to stay, hey
