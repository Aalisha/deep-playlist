[ 1: Elephant Man] (*Woman Orgasm)
Mi mek she seh (*) When mi put it in (*)
Oonu fi listen in, it hot but she still a scream like Friday di thirteenth
Should a see di foot a kick up
When di dick up and stick up pon who she pick up
Flat pon har back couldn't get up
Neva know a so mi sit up
Regula mi run regula to mi sit up
One 'mount a M&M mi see she pick up
Like a monk she feel mi flick up
She seh Elephant to get di cookin kit up
Oonu tek it back wait a fah she get up
When mi get di legs lift up
Mi bend it and send di drill beat up
Amount pound a ram mi see she drip up
Gal dem seh yah bout a talk we a di boss
