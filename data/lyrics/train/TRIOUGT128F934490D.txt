This is not the way i saw anything happening 
I'm only older, screaming over destiny tonight 
Don't hear my laugh echoing through your jealousy 
I just hear my voice, i just hear my voice 

This is not the way i saw anything happening 
We spent our summers hanging under flickering street lights 
Nowadays there's nothing on the radio 
I just hear your voice, i just hear your voice 

Come on and jump in the fire, the first ones on me 
Feel the burn of missing ever opportunity 
...
