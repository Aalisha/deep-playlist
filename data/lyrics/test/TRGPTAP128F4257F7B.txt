Your a
Mental case,
'bout time I smash your face
Got a habit of steppin' out of line,
Oh yeah, well here comes your time
You're a damn disgrace,
A total insult to the human race,
Try and make me feel bad all the time
Good thing your not my sign!
You always want what you can't have,
but baby, you can have me
Your a
Bleeding heart!
