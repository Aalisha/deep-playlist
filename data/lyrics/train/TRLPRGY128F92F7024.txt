Better stop pretending
That this is never ending
It seems the dream is over
And not worthy of mending

Living at a standstill
Pushing rocks uphill
A mountain full of feathers
With no natural skill

Oh my girl please don't give in
Don't listen to your stupid friends
I hear them going off again
So she's leaving

Planting dead flowers
In a cold October
