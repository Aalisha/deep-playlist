Well the sky broke in two,
Found you dancing alone.
then the room filled up with you,
and that song we both know.

About a girl who lived in a shell,
and a boy washed up somewhere else.
With the ocean in between,
oooo Whatever I'm through.

You know I'm talking about you.

Tonight,
I got you where I want you.
Closer I can tell you anything,
You're the song that I sing.

Tonight,
Let the music take us over.
