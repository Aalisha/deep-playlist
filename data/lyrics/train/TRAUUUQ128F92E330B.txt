(God no, God no) (God no, God no)
(God no, God no) (God no, God no)

Can't you see I feel your pain?
I got jesus running thourhg my veins
In this hopeless life that's turned on you
Give yourself to me, I'll help you through
I feed off your unanswered fear
When visions of lifes end appear
Hand over your will and then you'll see
Now get on your knees and worship me

(God no, God no)
Worship me (God no, God no)
On your knees!
Worship me (God no, God no)
