She got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die oh! one of these days
All the medicine I can buy, and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days
When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep
When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep
I'm gonna bury her very deep, rubies and diamonds round her feet
