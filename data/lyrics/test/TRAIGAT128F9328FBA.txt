You say you're leaving, you've shattered my dreams
All of our plans dear, forgotten it seems
Yes, it had to happen, I'm not surprised
But I'll, I'll survive

Your friends have shown you a much better way
All of my loving you baby, all of those years ended today
Yes, you go on darlin', I'll dry my eyes
But I'll, I'll survive

Go on, may God bless you
It was fun while it was fun
Baby, I hate to lose you
