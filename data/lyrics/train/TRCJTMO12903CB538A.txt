Bang bang bang
Feel the killah lead
Whiz on pass miss my head
Left turn watch the crimson flow
Brother man on the floor
Ching ching ching let the dollars go
Cause life ain't messin round no more
Stone cold when they knock me out
In the black of night i heard em shoutin murder

Murder

Bright white light up ahead
Screaming sirens that i dread
...
