Someday you'll find you're left behind
You can't keep up, life's moving on too fast
You're hunted down, we don't mess around
We cut you out, you know you'll never last

You can't keep up with the runnin' & hidin'
You tell yourself that you can't take no more
Time's running out, they say you'll never last
...
