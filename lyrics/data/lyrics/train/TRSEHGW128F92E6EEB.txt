The bio-sphere, the place we live
It seems like we don't give a damn
Other species flushed down the tubes
We need another race to rape
The way we live, we will destroy
Every other living thing
Till none are left except our race
And then we will destroy ourselves

Another oil spill!
Atomic waste displaced!
Another forest dies!
Bring on the acid rain!
