Rollin' the dice
Never thinkin' twice
She took my breath away
And now it's time to pay

I got all my money on thirteen black tonight
Yeah she's a sweet senorita a real man eater
She ain't gonna let me get home alive

Blackjack
She's a hell of a thrill
Blackjack
She's makin' a kill

Fever runnin' high
