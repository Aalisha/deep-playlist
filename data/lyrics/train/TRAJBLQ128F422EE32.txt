She's like the young white rabbit 
With bloodshot eyes 
Dreaming of another place 
Inside it's mind 

Well it's a lonely place 
That houses the suffering 
And feeds the pain 

So what would you do 
For 15 minutes of fame 
Out on your own 

Some friends are out to get you 
Some out to do you harm 
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of 
Sin 
Some friends are out to get you 
Some out to do you harm 
They'll tie you off and shoot you full of 
Sin 

She's been chasing dragons 
...
