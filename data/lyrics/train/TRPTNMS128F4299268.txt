Something's causing fear to fly,
Rising like a dark knight
In silence
Traffic's slow with broken boats
Heading for the sky
And I'm an island

I watched you disappear into the clouds
Swept away into another town

The world carries on without you
But nothing remains the same
I'll be lost without you
...
