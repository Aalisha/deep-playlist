There are times I understand and times I question why
And when the time's at hand sometimes I want to cry
But cannot shed a tear.

There are moments in the shade, there are moments in the sun
And there are certain days that I wish would never come
But still they reach me here.

In the silence of my mind there's a solace that I find.

Chorus:
And when my soul hits the mark and light splits the dark
I hear You
