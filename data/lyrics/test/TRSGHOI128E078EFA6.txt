I'm so glad to see you, I can't believe what I've found
You got yourself together, trying to move to a higher ground
Now what have I been missing beside from the fact that you're fine
Into your mind, and all that comes with it so many feelings to deal with
And I wanna know

Where do we go from here
Can we face our fear
Into a love again and remain friends
I believe that I wanna stay
So once again I'll be finding my way, back to you

That's just what it will be, so won't you lay right there
And create a future, build a life that we can share
That's what it's about, so do you mind hanging out
Now till forever somehow I know we'll end up together
I wanna know
...
