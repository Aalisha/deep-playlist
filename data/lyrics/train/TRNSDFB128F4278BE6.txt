(Opio)
Rap slash out these battleship torpedoes that'll rip through
Your fragile ego, ransack your evil empire like I was Genghis
The con artist, fiendish, on target, laser beam shift
Trackin' your movements like the Pentagon
Disarm the meanest lookin' studio prankster
Endangered, we airborne rangers with the broken language
Absorbin' blows then regain my strength (What?)
The Chinese connection game of death
You might see me in the reflection in the chain on his neck
Controllin' these mikes while he aimin' his Tec
Coward breakin' a sweat
Steady shakin' his shit
Couldn't even hold it still cuz his hands was all wet
Said we a threat cuz we the heaviest
And with a (strobe?) blockin' his progress you'll never be fresh
You can't murdalize a survivalist
Fool we thrive on this shit, the third eye is too swift

(Tajai)
All we gotta do is provide the music, uh
Don't need a Lac on Deez to make your bitch hop on my lap
And lap on these, lavishin' please don't tease
To all these way-below-average MCs
You gon' stay below, don't wish, that's just how it's gon' be
My style is on levels unattainable, recyclable and reusable
But not biodegradable so don't confuse 'em
They last eternal, evil gas that's acid turned
When I spit it, unmatched fashion over da riddim
Unabashedly, leave sights on the extreme sides of gassing
Mike mastery, necessary steps to make you genuflect
I reflect the genuine and accept
Nothing less than your respect in excess
I wasn't expecting the success that I met
When I grabbed my shit and left command
Won't let it get too ahead, I got a check on that
