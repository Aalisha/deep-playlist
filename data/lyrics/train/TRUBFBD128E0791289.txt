Once upon a time, they called me the bleeder
Swimmin' up this river, with sentimental fever
But this ain't my first ride, it ain't my last try
Got to keep movin' on
If they catch me ever, they'll throw me back forever

I guess I should be ashamed
But I forget to be vain
I did the best I could, I guess
But everything just bleeds
They say you're only sad and lonely
And no one is impressed

I sent it off in a letter, I need somethin' better
...
