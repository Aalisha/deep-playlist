I just can't let you go
Oh no, no, not my baby

We were only strangers in the night
Getting to know each other the mood was right
Strolling under the moonlight
Hoping that we could get out of sight
And while the entertainer singing his song
I hold the feeling oh so strong
Never thought love would look me in the eyes
I lift my head oh what a big surprise.
But there are people all around, who try to take your love from me
No, no, no
They don't seem to realize this love was meant to be

Only your love can set me free
I think I won the prize
From the very first time I looked into your eyes
I knew love would last forever
It's a blessing to be with someone like you
Now the ladies realize, I am no longer solo I got you by my side
And this new love I will treasure
...
