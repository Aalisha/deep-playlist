Grind your teeth, bite your tongue till it bleeds
From beneath, they've come out to feed
Only we can mold our own destiny
Believe in me for I'm the light and now I must lead
They'll come scraping like violent wind and we will take cover
We'll be ready on our own, it's been so long, will we ever see the Sun?
We've been alone, counting the days will they breach our hide away
Surrounded by darkness we made it all this way
We'll fight off the darkness and plan for our escape

Sincerely, I knew you could depend on me to get us out of here alive
If only we had more time to plan but now we flee, believe in me
