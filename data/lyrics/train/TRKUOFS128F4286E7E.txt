One who's scorched by the fire, I stand alone brazen-faced
Love's become an open fumace, my follies stoked the fireplace
Blind to the peril around me, my resistance wearing thin
I fell prey to the power of temptation, and the brand of infidelity kissed
My skin
With each kiss a heart breaking, with a touch her love dies for me
Slowly desintegrates
Blackned by coals of deception, I cry for redemption far too late
Here today, gone tomorrow
Trail of tears leads to sorrow
...
