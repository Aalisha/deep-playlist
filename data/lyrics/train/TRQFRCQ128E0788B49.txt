Walking on my way from you
The sun is gone
And all my thoughts turn blue
While I go down this road alone
Finally I'm just taking my time
To carve our past into a stone
Here is the day you found me
Here is the music by the sea
Here is our trip on a sinking ship
Here is the wine that made us free
Here is a dream no one else will see
