Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl I knew
Fairest skin with eyes of blue
I swear to the lord that I loved her true
It's a year now she's been gone

Well her spirit was as bright as the soft sunshine
Lips the color of strawberry wine
I wish to God she still was mine
But the chance won't come again

After first we lay in love's sweet bed
...
