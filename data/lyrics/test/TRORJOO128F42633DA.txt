Had you there in the palm of my hand.
Saw that smile you give that girl.
Haven't seen that smile such a long time.
Don't do this to me, again.

I watched you laugh when you walked out through door,
Couldn't save you from yourself.
Haven't seen that smile for such a long while.
Don't do this to me again.
