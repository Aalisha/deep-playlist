Convalescent livid we succumb
Stagnation now complete
This is the new plague called
Unconsciousness
We're selfcaged in defeat

Inside the tears we obey resignate to our
Self-inflected fears

Voices calm will be never heard
In this mode who will change
Bantised in our minds so absurd
Is this the world sublime
