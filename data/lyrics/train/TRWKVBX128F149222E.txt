Gotta shake myself
Up here
I should run away
Run away, run away
People say
Don t even go near
I can see the danger
I m aware
I see the danger

If I go back once again
It s like
I learned nothing
Standing at the front
Of a queue
Heading for trouble

Hope it changes
Hope my life changes
Gets alright somehow
Oh
I m waiting for tomorrow
I hope it changes
Can t you stay the same
Been out of luck
For so long
And I don t get much
So there s nothing
Much to lose
...
