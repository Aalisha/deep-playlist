I rise and stumble from the bed
It wakes the worries in my head
And I pour myself a bowl of Cheerios

Think about the good and bad
The happiness outweighs the sad
And the balance evens out the highs and lows

Today there's lessons to be learned
And there's progress to be made
Tomorrow I can say I'm a little older and wiser

It's a crazy life, a crazy life
It keeps you on your toes
You never know what lies in store for you
Or where it's gonna go

Hellos, goodbyes, you laugh or cry
...
