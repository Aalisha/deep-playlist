Stolen from an African land
Chased out with a knife
With a face like Bob Marley and a mouth like a motor bike
Oh well the bars are always open, and the time is always right
And if God's good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night

And it goes...
If I was Bob Marley, I said could you be loved
And if I was half pint, I'd ball the lord up above
If I was Mike Tyson, I would look for a fight
And if I was a Boomtown Rat, I would be stayin up all night
If I was the king I'd Rock, I would get stupid dumb
And if rhymes were Valiums, I'd be comfortably numb

If I had a shotgun, you know what I'd do?
I'd point that shit straight at the sky
And shoot heaven on down for you
Because the bars are always open, and the time is always right
...
