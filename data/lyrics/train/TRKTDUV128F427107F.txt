There's been some knocking
There's been some heavy knocking
It sounds like someone wants to break down the door
My super ego where I go, he go,
You come a reeping, come a keeping the score and I say
Lord of karma, your mystic-pain-o-rama
One good reason, keep my feet on the ground and I say:
Lord of karma, your mystic-pain-o-rama
Karma Come on down, oh no, no.

Lord of Karma
Down on bended knees forever
Lord of Karma
Down on bended knees forever

Take fear and loathing and put new clothing on it
