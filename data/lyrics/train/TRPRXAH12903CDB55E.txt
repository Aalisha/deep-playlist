At the rise of dawn
Beyond the lands of man
The beast has awakened
From a deep slumber
For hundreds of years
It has laid dormant
Now again it appears

Into the fires of the mountain
From the darkest day in time
The era of the future begins
Eras of waiting his return
Now the stars are forming his true name

Made of magic
The language of the making
With ironclad rock as his skin
Through cosmos he breathes
Through the stars he sees
An era will end
Rebirth of our kin
