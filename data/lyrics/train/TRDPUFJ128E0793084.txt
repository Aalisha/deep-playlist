I can't believe what I've seen.
I've been forsaken; I've been deceived.
Cast aside and left behind
'Til I can't believe my own eyes

I've been waiting for the glory
Of the coming of the Lord
I've heard a, a lot of stories
But my prayers have been ignored
I been waiting in the wings
Between the ocean and the shore
But this time I'm leaving to stay
I'm fallin' away

I seen the red sky up in the morning
I seen the low tide slippin' away
I do believe I'll take a warning
