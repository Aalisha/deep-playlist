I never asked for to find my twin but there you are
No I never asked for to find my twin but there you are
And I never asked for the spools to un-spin but there they roll
I never asked for the spools to un-spin but there they roll
I never asked for to carve your ribs but here I go
I never asked for to carve your ribs but here I go
And I've never pleaded for a new skin as I do now
No I've never pleaded for a new skin as I do now

Oh, flowers and blood
Build up a new me of flowers and blood
Flowers and blood
Build up a new me of flowers and blood
Build up a new me of flowers and blood
...
