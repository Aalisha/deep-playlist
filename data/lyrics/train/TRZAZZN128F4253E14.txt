We are your therapy cause we call us wild and free
we are the horsemen of the apocalypse
long time we slept in the fire of lust
but now we are awake
we are the ones you can trust
we play for you not just for anyone
we want to free your soul my son
follow us and you will be free
in a world of liberty

We will never die
this is our song
keep the faith
you know where you belong

We will never die
this is our song
keep the faith
you know where you belong

We did not come here to destroy
we want to show you how to live
