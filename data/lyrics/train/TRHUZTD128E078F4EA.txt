Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm So Glad...
I Will Never Find Another Lover
Sweeter Than You
Sweeter Than You
And I Will Never Find Another Lover
More Precious Than You
More Precious Than You
Girl You Are.
Close To Me You're Like My Mother
Close To Me You're Like My Father
Close To Me You're Like My Sister
Close To Me You're Like My Brother

And You Are The Only One My Everything
And For You This Song I Sing...
All My Life
I Prayed For Someone Like You
And I Thank God
That I.That I Finally Found You
All My Life

I Prayed For Someone Like You

And I Hope That You Feel The Same Way Too
