Bless the Lord, oh my soul and all that is within me
I will bless His holy name
Bless the Lord, oh my soul and all that is within me
I will bless His holy name
He forgives our inequities and He heals our diseases
And forever I'll proclaim
He's the one and only true living God
Let the earth rejoice, He reigns
I will bless His holy name

CHORUS
His holy name (ooohh, you're holy)
His holy name (ooohh, so holy)
The Lord is awesome and He's greatly to be praised
His holy name, His holy name

So give thanks (So give thanks)
At the (At the)
Remembrance of (Remembrance of)
His righteousness and say (His righteousness and say)
(I will bless the Lord at all times)
I will bless His Holy name
