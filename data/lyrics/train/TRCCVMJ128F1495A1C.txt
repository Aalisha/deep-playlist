You been cheating on me now
You know I know it's true
Ain't nobody in the whole wide world
Gonna love you like I do
Don't you be no fool, don't you be no fool
(Don't you be no fool, don't you be no fool)
Gonna keep on fooling 'round now baby
Gonna mess up your good thing

Well I might of cheated just a little bit baby
Nobody knows but you
When I get my paycheck darling
Left it all home to you
Don't be no fool, lord don't you be no fool
(Don't be no fool, be no fool)
Gonna keep on jiving round now baby
Gonna mess up that good thing
(Gonna mess up that good thing)
