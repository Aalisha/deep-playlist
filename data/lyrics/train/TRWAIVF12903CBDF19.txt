Open your eyes and you'll see brightly
Provocative shapes make me surrender
Far and away she's an old structure
Rapidly talks so you can fuck her

Call it all off call her to censor
Thinking of fun, we never enter
Cant escape I cant escape

The control it takes, control it takes
I am I am I am a woman
I am I am I am a human
Take it all off, take it all off
Thats what she wants
Thats what she wants

I am I am I am a woman
I am I am I am a human
Take it all off, take it all off
Thats what she wants
Thats what she wants

You came to fight
She moves in circles and
Works undercover
