Hey, baby, how you doin'?
It's really been a long time
You know
Remember that night
You remember

On a starry winter night in Portugal
Where the ocean kissed the southern shore
There a dream I never thought would come to pass
Came and went like time spent through and hourglass

You made love to me like fire and rain
Ooh, you know you've got to be a hurricane
Killing me with kisses, oh, so subtly
You make love forever, baby
You make love forever

I ain't gonna let you go that easy
You've got to say you love me too
I ain't gonna let you go that easy
I'm gonna give it all to you

Portuguese love, won't you say it to me
Say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese love, won't you say it to me
Say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese love, won't you say it to me
Say it to me, say you love me, baby
Portuguese say

Harbor nights, we made love till the morning star
Then you crooned a song to me on your guitar
Was it so familiar calling soft my name, "Teena"
Sunlight dancing slowly through loves window panes

And you made love to me like sugar and spice
Hush my broken heart, this must be paradise
