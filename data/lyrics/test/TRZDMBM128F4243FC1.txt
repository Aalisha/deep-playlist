God's sounded the alarm
Dare not push the snooze button
Your favourite metalhead and mine
Child-molesting freak

Used Seven Seals to scare his flock
So he could sin
Defiled young girls beneath
Posters of Megadeth
But then...

They tried to take his guns
They tried to take his guns
Coulda grabbed him when he's out jogging
Or scamming chicks in bars

But oh no
They brought S.W.A.T. teams and tanks
Waco's a sign
One-World Government

Peeling back the foreskin of Liberty
What do we see?
Ain't God fillin' teeth
It's Jews and Hillary

Communist Chinese
Grind up orphan babies
