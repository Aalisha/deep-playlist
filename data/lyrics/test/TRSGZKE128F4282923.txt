Woke up this morning yawned and scratched my skin
Think to myself now, what would this day bring?

Day after day spent walking the town
I play the fool then I act the clown
But is it my fault that Im unqualified
Clear from JA in Britain to reside
As an unemployed member of the public

CHORUS
Look who's unemployed now
...
