So tell me family now what do you think
Watch it all go down the great big sink. 
Watch how the scum it rises to the top. 
Don't you wonder when it's all gonna stop? 
Sometimes I wonder how we do sleep, 
serving the dodgy companies we keep.
All kicking and scrounging for the very first place
dictionary definition of a rat race. 
Pay off those losers we elect to lead,
stealing from the mouths that we're meant to feed. 
Enslaving the very clothes upon my back, 
I feel the sting but I hear no crack, no crack, I'm saying

Running through the fire, running through the flame,
running through the hatred, pushing through the blame,
running through the hopelessness and shame, 
revolution already underway.
