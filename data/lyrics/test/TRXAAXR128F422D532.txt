I Would Never Let It Go,
I Know, I Know, I Never Gave A Part Of Me

Everyday I See You Walking In My Mind
And There's A Part Of You, I Know I'll Never Find

Deep Within Me, Touching My Soul
I Got To Find Someone, To Take These Tears Away
My Heart It Aching, Soul Is Waiting
I Got To Find Someone, To Take These Tears Away

I've Done My Waiting, I Answered All Your Calls
There's No Mistaking, You've Broken Down The Wall
