She comes on like a rose
And everybody knows
She'll get you in Dutch
You can look but you'd better not touch

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleeping
Poison ivy comes a-creeping all around

She's pretty as a daisy
But look out, man, she's crazy
She'll really do you in
If you let her get under your skin

Poison ivy, poison ivy
Late at night while you're sleeping
...
