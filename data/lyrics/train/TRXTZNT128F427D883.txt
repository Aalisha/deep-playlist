I'm gonna take you down to the market, lover
'Cause that's where the trouble starts
You gotta get it into your heart
There are people out there to make you feel bad,
But don't you listen, Baby
Don't you listen
'Cause I know you feel that way

But I'm getting so tired,
Of people always crossing my wires
Life's just far too short,
