We are the new generation
We got the inspiration
We're feelin' strong so spread the news

The youth of every nation
Will make this declaration
This is the way of life we choose

Together we will rock
Forever we will roll
And someday we will rise
To take control

We are united nations
Under the flag of rock and roll
We are united nations
United we will stand
...
