I didn't say, "Don't do it babe" when she packed up to go
I didn't say "Come back here honey and try with me once more"
And when she asked me if I loved her, I just turned away
She's gone and now I'm hearing all the things I didn't say

I didn't say "I'm sorry babe, 'cause half the fault was mine"
I didn't say "We'll work it out, 'cause all we need is love and faith and time"
