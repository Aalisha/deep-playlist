If I could put you in a frame I'd draw you smiling
With a cigarette in your mouth
And your hands reaching out for something
If I could, if I could wear all your clothes I'd still be different
And if I had your speaking voice I'd never whisper
I'd talk and talk and talk

We will be winners
Our heads glued together
And all is indefinite in you
