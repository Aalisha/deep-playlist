I try leaving you at home
but every thought returns to you
My head, it seems to roam
no matter what I do... yeah yeah, oh no no

You know it's late right now
and every song sings of us
I guess these singers know somehow
and my life they must discuss... oh yeah

(Chorus)
'Cause I left the pictures of you behind
'cause I didn't want to dwell on you
...
