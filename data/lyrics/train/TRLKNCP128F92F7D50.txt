Glan-Kenner-Sullivan-Troiano

I can hear you callin', callin' my name out loud.
Know that makes me wonder; used to be so proud.
Sudden realization goin' need me now, that's why.
I can hear you callin' me and so I'm tellin' you goodbye.
Don't expect no answer I'm tellin' you goodbye.
I can hear you callin'.

We can't get together, think you're just too good.
