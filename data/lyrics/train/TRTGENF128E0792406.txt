Open your arms to the lonely shine
Lonesome as gold in a poor man's smile
See how the moon is full, follow the push and pull
Follow the ebb and flow in the breathing tide
Come on moonchild you're so far away tonight
The door is falling open and we're flying wild
Cat on the road, down in the living night
