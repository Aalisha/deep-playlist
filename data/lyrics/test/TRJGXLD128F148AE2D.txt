I'll qualify this circumstance
Broadcast, renew this chance
Pin hope on this promise

Graduate to a settled score
Projects through mansion doors
Stand up, dust yourself off

This time I'll get it right
You can't defend it

This time, this time I'll get it right
You can't defend it
It's predetermined
