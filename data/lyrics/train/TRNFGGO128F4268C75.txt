We've been through this before

Compromise
With me agree right now
Useless cries
I'm telling you just how
Paralyzed
There is nothing I can do
I realize

Everything about you is strange
Look at yourself, you've changed
With the facts in your face
It's causing conflict

Everything about you is strange
Look at yourself, you've changed
With the facts in your face
It's causing conflict

Hypnotized
By all your complex games
Sacrifice
My own opinions change
Justify
