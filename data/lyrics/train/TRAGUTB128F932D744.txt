Sometimes you go to sleep in your makeup
Sometimes you take off your pants when you wake up
Sometimes you walk a bridge in your girl shoes
Its ok if you're late cos they will always love you.

Sometimes I dream so big
My life just seems so boring
Rock 'n' roll never looked so beautiful
Rock ‘n’ roll never looked so beautiful.

Sometimes you bleach your head till it burns
