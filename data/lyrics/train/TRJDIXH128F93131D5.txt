It's a late night show
don't worry this time I'll speak easier
so you'll be able to understand
but first I have to know
is this something to say?
or just something to write? and all of you
I'll try to be way easier: I hate you
so please, don't try to understand me
I seem deeper than I really am
and now I know my words are scary
so run as fast as you can
whenever we'll be talking again
whenever we'll be closer
just face the truth
there's nothing behind this
...
