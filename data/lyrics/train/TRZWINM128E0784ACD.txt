They fall from your mouth
propelled by your belly and your tongue
i shiver when you shake
and i fold into jelly
i think i loved you more than me
Are you human
or a dud
are you human
or do you make it up
My baby cherry slipped
pass me through your fingertips
throw me down like an old rag
i'm not standing
...
