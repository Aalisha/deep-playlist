My friend the night never lets me down
But i can't keep dreaming for ever
I need a picture for this empty frame
Tell me the waiting is over
Cause i can see myself in you
We are leaves in the wind
But together we can light up the sky
I'll tell you why baby

I will be the sun. you'll be the moon
Won't you let me be the one
To shine a light on you?
The day that we're together
Can't come too soon
And baby i will be the sun. you'll be the moon
You'll be the moon
...
