Once I told you about my secrets
I say I trust you but that don't seem right
Hard decisions is what has made us
Grow ever slowly towards other sides

Forget about the time
It's up to me
You left me now it's over
I'm over again
So think about the time
It's meant to be
You think about it
over and over

You might try and you might wait
and you might erase me cold as ice
and you might care
and you might imagine my decision to stay but
it's over this time glad it's mine

What controls you to that behavior?
