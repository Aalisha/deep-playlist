The sun goes up, the son goes down, and still my life is just spinning around
It builds me up, it drags me down, and keeps me looking for some solid ground

Hai hai, hai hai, hai hai

The race is on, the stakes are high, they want your body better dance or die
The game is up, the die is cast, this roller-coaster may well be your last
