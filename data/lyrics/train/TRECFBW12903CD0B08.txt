Oh, oh, oh

I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey baby come on

I loved you endlessly
And you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye

Bye bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye

Bye bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
Might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby bye bye bye

Oh, oh, oh
