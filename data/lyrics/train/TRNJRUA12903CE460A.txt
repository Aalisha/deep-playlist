You see my hands are steady
You've seen my face before
Soon you can take your last look
And they'll close the door
I stand accused before you
I have no tears to cry
And you will never break me
'Till the day I die

A criminal mind
Is all I
All I've ever known
They tried to reform me
But I'm made of cold stone
My criminal mind
Is all I
All I've ever had
Ask one who's known me
If I'm really so bad...
I AM

I've spent my life behind these steel bars
...
