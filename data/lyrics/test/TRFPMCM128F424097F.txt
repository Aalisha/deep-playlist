Welcome in my friend
Out of the cold where it's warm
Please step in
What's your name my friend
My name's the same
What a strange coincidence
Glad you've come to this place
What's the pleasure you chase
Oh, you like playing with speed
Well I have all the answers you need

I can take you
High and make you
Invincible
I'll never leave you
