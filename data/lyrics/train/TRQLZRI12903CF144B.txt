Operator get me Graham 3865
I got to hear my baby's voice on the line
She got the power to rule my mind
That's bedevilment
Bedevilment
Baby, baby
Let me, let me lick-a your lips
And move-a your neck
And swivel your hips
You got something that's making me flip
Bedevilment, bedevilment
You make me love ya
I have no shame
