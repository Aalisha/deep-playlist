Help me out and hear my selfish plea - he'll run away someday
but he was in love with me
Lord please help me put these thoughts to rest
He has another woman
He'll never be the best
Lord can you expel my evil prayer - I love him all the time
but I know it seems unfair
Tell me now, let me know which love is real
I don't know very much but I know the way I feel
...
