It's good to see our cat again
Do you think she remembers me?
I can't believe you look the same
Tell me how long has it been
I think we've overdone the Beaujolais
I don't know how I'll make it home

If I stay here tonight
I won't try it on
I'll sleep above the covers
In the morning I'll be gone
We can top and tail
Or I'll go on the floor
Would it be alright
If I stay here tonight
