The air tonight is rarefied
It's all I need the air I breathe

You're burnin' all my bridges baby
Set your sights as low as they can go
That much I know

You take up all my time little woman
You take up all my time
You say your sun don't shine little honey
You want a piece of mine

The air is thin up here little darling
The air is thin up here
But I won't shed no tears little sister
I won't shed no tears
...
