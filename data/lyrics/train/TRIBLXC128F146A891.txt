I'm gonna get all soft and smoochy

(Oh yeah) I love you baby (oh yeah)
(Oh yeah) I love you baby (oh yeah)
(Oh yeah) I love you baby (oh yeah)

Yipee!

Oh yeah, feels so good
I'm loving you like I should
Remembering how it feels
Letting go to have you near
Oh yeah, feels so good
I never thought that it could
My feelings all deep inside
This love I found won't ever hide

Let's go from the very start
When we met you and I were inseperable
All at once we swapped our hearts
Knowing that we had it right
People got involved with us
I should have pushed them all away
Now I know what went wrong
Why did it take me so long

Lovin' you, lovin' you, is the easy part
Now I know, now I know, what to do with it
Me and you, me and you, keeping it tight
Cos two of a kind makes us so right

Oh yeah, feels so good
I'm loving you like I should
Remembering how it feels
Letting go to have you near
Oh yeah, feels so good
I never thought that it could
My feelings all deep inside
This love I found won't ever hide
