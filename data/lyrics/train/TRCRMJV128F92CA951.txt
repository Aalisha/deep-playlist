Here I stand, are you ready, to take me in and rock me steady
Feel the power, feel the heat, put yourself in the driver's seat
You're in the air, I feel you surround me
I'll do anything that you want me to, come on

Rock me rock me (rock) rock me to the top to the top, baby
Rock me rock me (rock) don't ever stop, no
