[Chorus:]
I'm in town girl for just one night
You so fine girl you're just my type
You just might make me miss my flight
Lemme lay your body down, tonight
We gone spend time, you name your price
I don't trick, but for you I might
Tryna get deep girl, don't make me fight
Lemme lay your body down, tonight

[Verse 1:]
Open up ya eyes and ya see quite clear
No mo crying, no mo tears, cause ya champion is here
I'm the superman you seek, I sweep ya off of ya feet
From the moment our eyes meet, girl you in for a treat
The attraction is so unique, the conversation is sweet
Love making under the sheets, It'll make the misson complete
Your body language is loud, girl you speaking it well
But baby I do the fool, put you under my spell
I'm suave and debonair, You sexy wit long hair
This chemistry's so rare, just kick back and chill
Let the moment take control, Your pot of gold is my goal
But baby let's take it slow, lemme show ya im real
