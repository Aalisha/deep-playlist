(Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah!)
(I want more)
Friday night and we're just talking
Stars are crashing in the sky
Burning just for you and I
We don't need to over think this
Nothing's gonna bring us down
(Let's) show them what we're all about

All the way. 101 percent. touchdown
We gonna kill it. lead the pack. gon' take this town
()
Let's go whatcha wanna wait for
Let's take everything we asked for

C'mon and turn it up. let's tell them what we want
More More More
Let's go take over the dance floor You be mine and I will be yours
