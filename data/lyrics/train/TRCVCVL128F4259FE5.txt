An officer and an english gentleman
Driving west to see who we are
A Kashmir coat
Just frowns and a smiling face
Well this is our home
Perhaps we're the same

Walking down the street again
With the sleeping bags under arms
And it feels like we're never going home

But you gave us more than we need my friend
And we're so happy
...
