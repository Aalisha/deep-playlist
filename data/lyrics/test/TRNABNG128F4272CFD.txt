I dunno what I was thinking
Leaving my child behind

Now I suffer the curse and now I am blind
With all this anger, guilt and sadness
Coming to haunt me forever
I can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river
Is this revenge I am seeking
Or seeking someone to avenge me

Stuck in my own paradox
I wanna set myself free

Maybe I should chase and find
Before they'll try to stop it
