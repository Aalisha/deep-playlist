It's amazing I can even close my eyes
To hide away from the fear
Although I try I'm losing my whole life
My conscious now is clear

Now I can't explain
I'm not to blame
We are all innocent
Nothing to say
The more we betray
We are all innocent

I long to find the words to justify
The reason now for what we do
You're so damn blind, I'm human, I'm mankind
Perfectly flawed, I'm just like you
