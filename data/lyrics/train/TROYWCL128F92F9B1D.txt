Knew the signs
Wasn't right
I was stupid for a while
Swept away by you
And now I feel like a fool
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?

Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be

Catch myself
From despair
I could drown
If I stay here
...
