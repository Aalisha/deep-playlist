So now we see
Comes burying my burnt remains
These puddled clouds
Oh I, I understand now

But darkness falls likes shattered pieces
Dangling, shimmering
Torn and tattered and crowned
Oh I'll not be told "No" to "No More!"

You must believe to hear me sing these
Messy morsels of my self-assuring love
...
