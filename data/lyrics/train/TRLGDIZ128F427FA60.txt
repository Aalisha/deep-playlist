Try to hold on to sentiments
Growing to some extent
To be the waster of it all

Crowded rooms belie elegance
Truth be told evidence
Will turn your cheeks cold

Pretend I'm worth a million trials
With countless tears
And sleepless nights
Do not ignore the feeling

The fluorescence you wash from your hair
So the cruelty could cling to your pillow
Yet the wrongs you do go unimpaired
You should hope that the ground will not swallow
...
