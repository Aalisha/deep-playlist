The world began to change the children moved and they had children
It was all arranged you couldn't live there anymore
All you had was that old place in the middle of the path of progress
So they took the space and put the ceiling on the floor
In one of the rooms all the walls were blue
It was hidden so well that no one knew
Just the place for taking in the view

The View of the sea crisp and clear and neverending
