you will see
my burning inferno
and there is no way
in your wildest dreams
that you can say no

i suffocate your soul
and drain you of your lifeblood
the breathing darkness here
will make you disappear
there is no return

i steal your soul
and carve a hole right where your heart once used to be
i watch you die
i hear you cry
it fills my soul with such delight

you are lost
you are entering a dead world
wherever you will turn
you will see your spirit burn
your life is over

here in death's dominion
...
