Tom Johnston

The sky is fallin' and the ground is reachin' up
The river's goin' by and the water's gettin' high and I feel like givin' up
Standin' in the downpour with these rainy day crossroad blues
Got those woods on my left, city on my right, don't wanna sleep alone tonight again
Hole in my coat, hole in my shoes, sittin' in Mobile singin' the blues about you
