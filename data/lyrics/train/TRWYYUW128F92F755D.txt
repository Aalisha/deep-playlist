You know me well by now
There's more to be discovered
And baby, my good heart
Might improve your inner life

Listen, I'm your friend
I don't try to be your mother, no
Strange as it may seem
I still believe wrong can turn to right

Against the rule
I'm always here for you
On each other's side
There's so much that we can do

Because no matter where
We are going there together
