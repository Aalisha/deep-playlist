Life... Seeds I Sew
Bomb Dutty Babylon Ah Bury
Cool As Di Breeze I Ah Flow
So Irie And Merry
To Perfect Sun Life Trees Grow
(Sip Life Apple And Cherry?)
Rastafari Neva Go Now
Fiya Burn Cannibal Dreddy

Blood Sheddin More And More
I Still Gatta Fight Doe I'm Livin Pure
See War And Crime Like A Skull A Bore
One Kind Had Vile, Dey Have No Love No More
Tell Dem Til Da Soil Yet Dem Still Ignore
Rastafari Is Life And Of Dis I'm Sure
Fiya Red Flames Hotta Dan Before
Burn Dem Complete From Crust To Core

Life Seeds I Sew
Bomb Dutty Babylon Ah Bury
As Cool As Di Breeze I Ah Flow
So Irie And Merry
To Perfect Sun Life Trees Grow
