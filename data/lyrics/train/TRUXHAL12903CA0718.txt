Name your poison
On this broken floor
I've seen this end before
You are in this trap alone
Don't think for a second you're going home
Rigid fingers won't make it right
Close your eyes while you pray for sight
Only pain in this disposition
Keep returning your strength for this weakness
I say fuck the system
Use the wisdom as the catalyst
Then we'll burn it all down

Do you feel ready?
My back is turned on you
So pure and fitting
