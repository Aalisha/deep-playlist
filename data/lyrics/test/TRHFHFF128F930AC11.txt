I have seen a thousand dreams
believe me they were real
I have touched the skys in foreign lands
It seemed as if they were friends of mine
Do they belong to me?

I made my days with hands embraced
While shadows cover the way I go
To get the choice to choose my place
Reminds me of what my father said:
"You don`t belong to me"
Do I belong somewhere at all?

How many roads how many dreams
...
