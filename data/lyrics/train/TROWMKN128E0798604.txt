(49 percent
1 percent short of half
And less than half
Ain't really much of nothing)

(49 percent
1 percent short of half
And less than half
Ain't really much of nothing)

I won't try to dent your night
Or stop your flight
I know our plight - You know I'm right
I know about your little fling
How you hide your ring
You senseless thing - I'll cut this string
The heat has simmered for a while
It's not my style - so versatile and with a smile
At anytime I could explode
When you kissed your toad
You kill your princely episode

49 percent
1 percent short of half
And less than half
Ain't really much of nothing

49 percent
1 percent short of half
And less than half
Ain't really much of nothing

Bit off more than one could bite
And the taste is slight
It leaves this dullish appetite
'Bout time I've finally seen the light
