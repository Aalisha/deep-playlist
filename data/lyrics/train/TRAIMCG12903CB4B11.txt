inside of life
inside of life
life this way, it takes
no time to tell
week from week
day from day
hours slip by
making a change
you begin to see
out of the ends
however old
time slips by
time slips by
week from week
day from day
no time to tell
whole worlds fall
whole worlds fall
fall apart, who knows
...
