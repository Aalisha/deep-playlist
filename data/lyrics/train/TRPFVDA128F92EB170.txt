You run, you hide
As tears fall from your eyes
They fall like snow
From a wounded soul
You hold inside
The hurt of great divide
The hole is starting to get old

So come back to the light
To the love, you will find
It's been here all along
So come back to the start
And you'll find in your heart
That you always belonged
To me

Just take the rope
I won't let it go
...
