Sat up in the dark for so long
Just living my life on my own
Then right up outta the blue, bumped into you
I was so amused by your smile boo

Wantin' you to call my phone
So me and you can talk just a little mo'
I didn't know what to do, I was feelin' you
Hopin' you'd be cool with hangin' out too

I don't know what happened, got people steady askin'
How you go to sleep mad one day the next wake up so happy
Love works like magic and it's so true my mind can't grasp it
I'm just glad that I got you in my life

I think about us (All day)
Dream about ya (Always)
Love ain't always
(Complicated)
I think about us (All day)
Dream about ya (Always)

Love ain't always
(Complicated)
If I'm lovin' it don't take long
People speculatin' that it won't last long
But that just can't be true 'cuz I been lovin' you
