Hey, hey, yeah
Oh, we'll be, we'll be, yeah
Oh

I been seeking survival, it seems like my whole life long
And I been working so hard and it feels like it's all gone wrong
Time lonely, need someone to push me to help me through
And make my way through the clouds to the sun like that'll make do

(We'll be fine again)
I say we'll be
(We'll be fine again)
Fine again
(We'll be fine again)
Oh, we'll be fine again

I see, people waitin' for answers to questions no one knows
Drinking Joe's, only thinkin' "Oh Lord, whole life blown"
May we pass out hugs to the thugs to heal our souls
And blue collar suffering, oh Lord, heal us all

(We'll be fine again)
