I make a living from a circuit I made
Out of trial and error and gigs that I've played
It might be the money or the town that it's in
But mostly it's people make you come back again
There was one little place that I played every year
It's outside of Pittsburgh, I know it's still there
Just a little old Moose lodge, the crowd was okay
But you'd never get rich from the money they'd pay
