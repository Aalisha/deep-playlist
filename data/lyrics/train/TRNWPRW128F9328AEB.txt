Got Filk?
A love story's what you're about to hear
It's about a girl who wasn't sincere yeah
I asked her out and she didn't refuse
But everyday it was a new excuse
I was confused didn't know what to do
Everywhere I looked no one to turn to lies mistrust and all that shit
She left me vulnerable and in pain
I know its sad but my life's a shame
Simple and complex it always stays the same
Sex no love and no passion
