You got everything I like
Would you bring it on tonight?
Bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, baby

You got everything I like
Would you bring on tonight?

For you, I would do anything
For you, I would go anywhere
For you, I'll climb the highest mountain, baby
Just to have me some of your love, oh yes, I would

You got everything I like
Would you bring it on tonight?
Bring it on, bring it on, baby

You got everything I like
Would you bring it on tonight?
