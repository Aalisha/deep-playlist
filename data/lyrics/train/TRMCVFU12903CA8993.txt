I drew a line in the sand
And made my simple demand
I kissed You one last time goodbye
I watched You walk out of my life

I didn? t mean to mistreat You
I need to reach You, I need to reach You

There? s got to be a better way
Longer nights and brighter days
Better times to make You stay

My heart is buried in the ground
My hands are tied, my feet are bound
And it? s the smoke that wets my eyes
As I burn You from my life
