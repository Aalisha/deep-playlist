Little Dirty Blonde (3: 32) (Winger/Taylor)
She was a classic case, a baby face all
Duded up, but kinda out of place
Out to show the world she was so bad (so bad)


I thought I had it sussed, it was only lust
She's not the type, that I could trust
So how did I end up in her trash?


Tell me is this love?
