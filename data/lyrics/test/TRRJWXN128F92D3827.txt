There should be a holiday for clowns
there should be a big parade downtown
so girls like you could see
what fools you've made of guys like me
a day that clowns don't have to hide
the feelings that they have inside, oh
there should be a holiday for clowns
a day for guys like me to paint the town
festive clown affair
