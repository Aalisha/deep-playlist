Mama she used to say, don't live by your knife
Mama she used to say, gotta get out the ghetto
Mama she used to say, morning comes and goes
Mama she don't know, I gotta get mine whoah, gotta get mine

I'm livin in the age of di chronic, 40 ounce & blunts
the type of dis a women allah know ah stunts
now I got to wear Versace just to get a gal to watch me
an it ain't no sunshine, how can I get mine?
Why I sell myself for modern day slavery
now I'm doin' LP's for 5cent royalties
Mama can ya save ya son? All these leeches over me
feel like gathering my duns, gettin all our guns
count it down 3, 2, 1, come down Mad Lion!

(mad lion)
yo yo roll a spliff... what, yeah!
