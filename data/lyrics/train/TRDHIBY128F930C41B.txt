The sky sheds elegeies
As you pass another cape
A silent company
On a way without repose

Behind the dunes
And the shifting sands of cinnamon
A lost and lonely pavement
Of unconquered sanctuaries
Of untouched reveries echoing

Like leftovers - dragged through time and memory
Like leftovers - that live on as seasons pass
Like leftovers - never let you go

And all that remains
Is moulded in the last light of the setting sun
And all that is retained
...
