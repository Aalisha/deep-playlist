Little baby boy sent as God among us
For Your plan to free all humanity
We sing glory to Your name
Sing glory to Your name

Tiny fragile heart, yeah
Pumped Your blood to save us
For You come to be a sin offering
Singing glory to the Lamb, yeah glory
Sing glory to the Lamb

Singing glory to the one
Who saved the whole world
Born to die but You live again
And take all our sins away

Little Your hands and feet, yeah
