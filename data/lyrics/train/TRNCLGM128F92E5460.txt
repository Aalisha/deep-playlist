We know each other like the palm of our hands
And we have to see each other
Whenever and however we can

I know that I am tied up
Well listen baby
Well, I am tied up too

And if we are caught together
We've got so much to lose
So if you see me tomorrow
And you turn your head, baby
I'll understand, I'll understand
...
