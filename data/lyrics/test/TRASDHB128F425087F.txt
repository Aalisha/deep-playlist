We have journeyed for so long
Many seasons have passed by
Soon we'll there on the Ivory Plains
There we will fight for our lives
And to decide our own future
To protect the ones we hold so dear

But yet the worst part lies ahead
When we will fight for our world
Soon we'll be there on the Ivory plains
We shall grant no mercy
Nor show our fear
This time we'll win this war no matter the cost
...
