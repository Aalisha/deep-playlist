Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
If you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be
Oh God give me the reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me

I'm down on bended knee

So many nights that I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know that I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
...
