Woman I can understand you
Although I love you to my soul
You got me so confused
That I don't know which way to turn

What can I do
(I wish I knew)
If you came back
Would you stay? Stay! (yeah yeah)

Say you love me deeply
But you still got somebody else
Seems like distance,
Circumstance is keeping us apart

I just don't know
And I'm wondering
If you came back
Would you stay? Stay!
