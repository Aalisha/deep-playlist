How many people wanna kick some ass?

I used to be a nerd - Grew up in the suburbs
Nothing there ever went wrong - I made it up in this song
I talk about the hood - I say stuff like "It's all good"
Tell people I'm down with All the cool kids downtown
When I've never even been there...

How many people wanna kick some ass? (I do, I do)
And how many people sick of holding it back? (I am) Well I am, too
So don't lay another finger on her
She's mine and I still want her
If you put your hands upon her
Youre a goner - goner
And how many people sick of holding it back? (I am I am)
And how many people wanna kick some ass? I would if I could
But I'm really just a sensitive artist - Perpertrated like I am the hardest
