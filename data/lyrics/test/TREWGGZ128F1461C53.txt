You look at me from every angle, follow my every move
From the bed to the door
And what you see could mean a million things, too early to assume
I'm the one you've been waitin' for

Hold my hand
Something you don't have to understand
For you to do

Hold my hand
C'mon lover, get under my skin
It'll all make sense to you

Day and night, you watch me from your hiding place and won't tell
Anyone else about us
Footsteps in the shadows reveal secrets of a young male
...
