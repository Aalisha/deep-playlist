There's a stain on my notebook where your coffee cup was
And there's ash in the pages now I've got myself lost
I was writing to tell you that my feelings tonight
Are a stain on my notebook that rings your goodbye

Oh, now she's gone and I'm back on the beat
A stain on my notebook says nothing to me
Oh, now she's gone and I'm out with a friend
With lips full of passion and coffee in bed

With the way that you left me I can hardly contain
The hurt and the anger and the joy of the pain
Now knowing I am single they'll be fire in my eyes
A stain on my notebook for a new love tonight
