My cold, cold sailor heart
Says "Get on your way!"
I ain't too proud to say,
But that's how I'm made.

I'll be that person 'til my dyin' day.
I try so awful hard
But I can't change.

From runways to the road
I ramble alone.
This thumbnail size a' heart
Is black as coal.

Your beauty it still bring me
To my knees
...
