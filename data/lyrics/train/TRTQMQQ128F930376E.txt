Shakem' off, shakem' off
Shakem' off, shakem' off
Shakem' off, shakem' off

Sean Paul, gotta get 'em drunk
Gotta shakem' off in the club, get it crunk
Give you what you want, shawty got what ya need
Set dat thang out, get down on ya knees

You know I'm kinda picky, like my girls tricky
Tricky kinda greasy, gotta be freaky
Sho' nuff, know to blow, that's how thangs go
Charge it to da game, ya know I gotta lay low

So tell me how ya know everything gravy
You're under to the cover 'cause my homeboy paid me
These gulls goin' crazy, ya gotta shakem' off
They be all up in yo grill and I be all up in they mouth, ho

So shakem' off, shakem' off, shakem' off, shakem' off
What's up, it's Youngbloodz, we shakem' off, shakem' off
Shakem' off, shakem' off, shakem' off, shakem' off
What's up, attic crew, shakem' off, shakem' off

Shakem' off, shakem' off, shakem' off, shakem' off
What's up, it's Youngbloodz, we shakem' off, shakem' off
Shakem' off, shakem' off, shakem' off, shakem' off
What's up, attic crew, shakem' off, shakem' off
