Darlin' I don't know much
I know I love you so much
My life depends on your touch
And my love is a river runnin' soul deep
Way down inside me it's-a soul deep
It's too big to hide and it can't be denied
My love is a river runnin' soul deep
I'll work myself to death for ya
Just to show I adore ya
Nothin' I wouldn't do for ya
"Cause my love is a river runnin' soul deep
Way down inside me it's-a soul deep
...
