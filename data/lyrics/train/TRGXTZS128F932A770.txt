See the lovers all gone crazy
Looking for romance it seems
Many sleepless nights will follow
Some may lose but some succeed

Love at first sight
What they want is

Make a play of lust intention
Only just one thing in mind
Make a slip could be forever
Wedding bells, the shotgun kind

Love at first sight
What they want is
Love at first sight
