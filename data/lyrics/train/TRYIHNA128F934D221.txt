Instead of goin' out to dinner tonight
We can grow vegetables underneath our skylight
Clickin' these downloads everyday has its price
We can lounge on our couch and listen to our 45's

So take your dollar, your yen
Those Euros I can't spend
I won't get down with no pounds
Never need to leave this house

Don't need your moneybox
'Cause I got lots and lots
Of what I need right here
Right here with you, my dear
Don't need the cash machine
To make our days happy so do me a favor
Don't jingle your change, sir

Instead of goin' to the movies tonight
There's no shame in us playin' best of that Sega Mega Drive
Hand me your trousers, you got holes in your knees
It's no fuss, patch them up, forget about that shoppin' spree
