I feel strangled
I feel torn in two
Insufficient amounts of two
Is this a sign of what I'm made of or how I allow myself?
Grab the wrists, pull away, I don't want to die today, and so I won't
Can't believe this is me
Well, you're drowning me with my own hate so I won't

Do you feel they're laughin' at you through the TV?
I know I do
And do you wonder how they get away with that shit they say?
