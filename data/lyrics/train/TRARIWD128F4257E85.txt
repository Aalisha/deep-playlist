Turn the lights out, shut the window*
Burn your old clothes - don't use the telephone.
Steal the next car, drive to Mexico.
Back on the outskirts, past the meadow,
This Honda van will take you to anywhere:
It's lower middle-class, but it'll drive you fast.

The sirens cried when we saw them come.
So we stand here stuck on the border,
Its far from hell, yet so close too America.
Don't go back, back to the one you love:
There'll be trouble don't go back to the one you love
