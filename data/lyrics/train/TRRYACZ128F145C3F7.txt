Posing like a statue sitting in my office chair
typing letters for computer eyes to sorta read
drifting like an odor now I'm blending in with the air
I'm becoming more and more of what I've got to be

I'm invisible I'm floating floating
past the homes of the Ozzie and Harriets
Past the plans of moving in next door, cause I'm prepared
I've got it all figured out
...
