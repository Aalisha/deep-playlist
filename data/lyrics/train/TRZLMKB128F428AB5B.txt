Oh nah nah nah nan nap
Oh na na na nam nam
Oh na na, nam nam ohh, uhh
Yeeaahh, yyeeaahh, ohh ohhu ohhwu,

Looking out my window
And I'm a thinking of tomorrow
And I'm a wondering what the future will be
Thinking of the children
Who are the victims of oppression
Beaten down by wars, and eaten up by starvation

And I'm saying
When will this ugly war be over
And the children can go out and play
I wanna see
