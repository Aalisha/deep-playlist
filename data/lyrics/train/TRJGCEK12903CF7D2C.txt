I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up for your love
I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up, I'm burnin' up for your love
You let me down, turned me 'round, you messed around with my heart
What kind of woman with a smile on her face
Can tear your whole world apart, hey
I'm on fire, I feel it burnin' up, I'm on fire
I'm burnin' up, burnin' up, I'm burnin' up every night
I'm burnin' up, burnin' up, and burnin' up can feel so right
