Keep telling me youre skin deep
And i believe you.
Youre telling me talk is cheap.
But you wont need to.

Keep telling me good things come to those who wait,
And i wont be there.
Youll find out for yourself, soon enough.

I wont try to make it right.
Or make it understood.
When that point of view means nothing to you.

The futures bleak,
And youre uneasy.
Target weakness,
Still twisted.
