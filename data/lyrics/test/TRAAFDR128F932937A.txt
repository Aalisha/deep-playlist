If you're sinking
If you're losing control
And your heartache has taken it's toll
If there's things you've never thought before
Like you're all alone
Afraid that love won't come home

You will find me
I'm at the point of your breaking
Behind all the noise
When your world is
Darkest I can still see
Cause when there's nothing left
I'll be

I'll be
