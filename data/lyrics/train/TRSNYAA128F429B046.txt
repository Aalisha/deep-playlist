I know we just got here
but I think it's time to go
I didn't want to believe it but now I know
you know who just walked in
and she didn't come alone
I can't stand to see this get me home

Take me away
I'm gonna hurt somebody
take me away right now
how could she say
she wanted more you better
take me away right now

I thought she was perfect
