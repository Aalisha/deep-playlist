Step right up, from the East to the West, from the North to the South
Sign up right here, your scheduled membership to the drinkin' club
They got you soaked, I see your cup up
Let's get drunk and get my fortune out of my drinkin' club
E-40 in the C L I C, stuck up in the house party top celebrity
Burpin' and gurpin', gel chin the bourbon, lurkin' around I'm seein'
All kinda broads from outta town, top hots, tycoons, big cheeses
Plus the perpetual Jahahnjawel priestess
Homies and lurkers and things like that up under the vertical shade
Rovers in lamborghinis swimming pink bikinis, lingerie
Tryin' to knock her big ass by all bus lights on Fridays
If you're not a member of my drinking club, sideways
What kind of motherfuckin' perculatoins you niggaz
Got up in the refrigerator
Who wanna join my drinkin' club, sign up the legislature might
Not know how to read and write but I do know how to count money
You can call me Lieutenant Fuck a Hoe but all the ruskie runny
You can dip but don't screw up, speakers on sub
Beat your ass, my drinking club
They got you soaked, I see your cup up
Let's get drunk and get my fortune out of my drinkin' club
They got you soaked, I see your cup up
Let's get drunk and get my fortune out of my drinkin' club
I got you perved on some of the righteous, who's the tightest
I'm down with pipes fifth and gallons of the finest nitrous
Oh girl, now pass the joint to the nigga, big head
Where I hear about your scheamin' but the rotations I don't jinn
