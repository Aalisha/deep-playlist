But you don't hear me though
(Funk, funk, funky)
[VERSE 1: Rodney O]
Muthafuckin punk
Look who's hangin out with the Falcons
Just because you're on top of the mountain
But what goes up, must come down, hoe
They didn't give a fuck about you years ago
So what you're gonna do when it's on sinkin
Muthafucka, you probably start drinkin
I don't know, but I'll never be a sucker's friend
Just because a fool's makin dead presidents
Rodney O & Joe Cooley will never quit
And all that bulllshit dancin ain't sayin shit
I'm only down with my homies from the get-go
Fuck O.P.P. and a sideshow
If you don't like it, here goes my middle finger
Rodney O's keepin one in the chamber
Who you're foolin, you puff, you prance, punk hoe
Back to the hood, fool, but you don't hear me though
(Funk, funk, funky)
[VERSE 2: Joe Cooley]
Here I go with the flow, some dope stuff from Joe
Why don't you sit back, hey yo, and bob with the tempo
So what up, niggas? Yeah, I got the funky jam
