Loretta, she's a barroom girl, wears them sevens on her sleeve
Dances like a diamond shines, tells me lies I love to believe
Her age is always 22, her laughing eyes are hazel hue
Spends my money like waterfalls, loves me like I want her to

Loretta, won't you say to me darling put your guitar on?
Have a little shot of booze, play a blue and wailing song
...
