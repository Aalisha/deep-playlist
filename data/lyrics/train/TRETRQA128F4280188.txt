Heading out on the 401
Don't it make you nervous
A bus stop, a truck stop and everything
Just to make me restless
I've got my life on the line right now
Don't it make you wonder
Bus stop, truck stop and everything
Just to keep me under
Each passing moment's a new fright of terror
Taking it's toll on my work
I'm going Further Again
