Your hand in my hand and my hand in your hand
Your hand in my hand closeness of the past
My hand in your hand and your hand in my hand
Jerking back and nothing will last

I have to go before it is too late
Have to wipe out the traces and memories will fade
And tears will stop flowing and tears will stop flowing
And memories will fade and memories will fade

Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done
Over and done Over and done

Dead and frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Dead an frozen my heart Over and done
My life falling apart Over and done
Over and done Over and done
