I could be happy, sitting alone
Walking on my own
I need you, Lord knows why
I can live without you

Putting my heart on the line (You know I am)
Show me a sign
Putting my heart on the line
Yeah...

Coming from my heart, over to you
Don't you understand
You can be me now, just a day
Don't you know that I love you
...
