Seems every station, on the TV
Is selling something, no one can be
If every page was torn from the magazine
Would cash still drive the media machine
The products they mean us to pursue are endless
Identity can leave you selfless

We will not witness, this anymore
This is the end, for you my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
On and on, we sing out songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our song for more, for more
...
