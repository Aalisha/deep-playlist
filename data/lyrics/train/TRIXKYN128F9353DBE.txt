Com-com-com-combat lover
You came here to get some more
Seems like you're turning worse than ever before
Hold hold hold hold my tongue
While I'm talking at you
You won't hear a word
I'm not what you came for
I'm nothing more than a girl

You making my heart spin, you making it roll
I give you my body, I give you my soul
Be careful, don't be so vicious in me
My love can also be a killer machine

Say say say say your name
