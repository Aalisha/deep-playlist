War, inside my head, war, inside my head
The war inside my head ain't a pretty sight
(Inside my head)
But I don't want no sympathy

It's happened a thousand times before
 (War inside my head)
It's just a harsh reality

(War inside my head)
Can you hear it?
(War inside my head)
Can you see it?
(War inside my head)
Can you sense it?
(War inside my brain)

Can you hear my
(Pain?)
Can you see my
(Pain?)
Can you sense my
(Pain?)
Can you feel my
(Pain?)

Can you taste my
(Pain?)
Can you fix my
(Pain?)
Can you hear my
(Pain?)
Can you hear the war inside my head?

The war inside my head, war, inside my head
The only thing real is the way I feel
 (War inside my head)
And that's the pain that's deep inside
...
