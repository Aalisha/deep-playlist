I walk along the cobbled streets of Dublin in the rain
The Man selling papers, I ask him if he's heard her name
Notorious are the stories, you have to meet the girls
If you ask a sailor, they're known around the world
You can meet them on the corner

They are the Moore Street girls
This is the street their world
Their seducing smiles are nothing you'll ever know
They will allure you, they'll put you in a trance
Before you know it you'll be tapping the street
Doin' an Irish dance, hey!
