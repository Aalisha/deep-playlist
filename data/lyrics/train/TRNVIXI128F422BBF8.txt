I'm so scared cause along with this infection I will fear rejection.
She is all I ever wanted,
And I'm not the one, the only one.
Through sheets you will teach and I will learn.
I've always wanted you to know.
Don't care even if these sheets did burn.
I'm scared, full of fear, and so,
You need to know.

I don't wanna be your lover, I just wanna be myself,
You can hide between the covers and taste the bitterness you've given to me.
I don't wanna be your lover, I just wanna be myself,
Why can't we just be together and say this is how we've wanted to be.

I can't stand,
SINCE THE BIRTH OF THIS INCEPTION WE'VE BEEN DEEMED A COLLECTION.
