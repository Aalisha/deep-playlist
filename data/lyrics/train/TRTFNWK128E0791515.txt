(What they do!)
(They smile in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

(They smile in your face)
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

Somebody's out to get your lady
A few of your buddies they sure look shady
Blades are long, clenched tight in their fist
