(A.Pearson, G.Cang)

Verse 1

When you first walked into my life,
Was so happy, you just made me smile.
I'd do anything that you'd like.
But after a little while...

Pre 1
All these questions 'bout,
Where I've been,
Where I'm goin,
Who's that callin' on the phone.
What's become of the,
Guy I met?
I just wish,
You would leave me alone.
