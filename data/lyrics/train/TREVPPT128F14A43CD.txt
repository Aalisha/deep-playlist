Baby you know sometimes you make me want to scream
woo, uhhhhhhhh
suga, suga, suga, yeah, yeah
All was not lost today, your brown eyes converted me
And let me know that your the right girl for me
You don't need to, you don't, need too
Of the same love I offer you
It would be ashame to let someone else take my place
Now, you got me dreaming
I can tell without you being there
So stop this mistreating me
I wanna stay with you, I wanna lay with you
I wanna, be your man, be my girl
