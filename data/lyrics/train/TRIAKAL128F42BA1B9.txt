I'm diggin' my way...

I'm diggin' my way to somethin'...
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better...
I'm pushin' to stay...

I'm pushin' to stay with somethin'...
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin' better...
Whoa ho, oh
Whoa ho, oh
I'm sowing the seeds...
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken...

I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted...
This thorn in my side...
This thorn in my side is from the tree...
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted
Ooh, it tears me and I bleed, yeah!

And I bleed, oh yeah, yeah!
Yeah!
Caught under wheels roll
I take the leech
I'm bleeding me
