Na nanana nanana nanana

Got a certain little girl that's on my mind
Good gosh o' mine, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I've ever had
And sometimes she shows me she feels so bad

Na nanana nanana nanana

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now
Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her lovin' but I love her the same now

Hush, hush, early in the morning
