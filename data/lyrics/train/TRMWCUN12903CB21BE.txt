Is it so hard to remember
When we go back to September
We were
We were like

You're a throw back to forever
In your denim jeans and leather
Yes you
Yeah we were like

All these things that you like to leave behind
All these things that you like to leave behind

And if it matters at all
If it matters at all
You'll wait until your first time
You'll wait until there's something wrong
'Cause you'll always be the one who says
Goodnight, goodnight (goodnight)
...
