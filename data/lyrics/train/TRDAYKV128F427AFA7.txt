I'm really on your side 
Although you may not ever believe that it's so 
I've been taken to looking back 
Across it all, it was never that bad 
Oh you know 

For the minute a pretty face 
In the mirror, to take my place 
To submit to the ... race 
I'm going to see to your immediate needs 
Love's for idiots, so leave me alone on my liberties 
My liberties 

...
