Got some books but I got no brain, I said I try my hardest but in vain
Got my house, but I lost my home, I said without you I'm all alone
Got my bed, but I can't sleep, because your love I just can't keep
Got a license, but I got no car, I said without you I won't get far

I got a phone but you don't call just what to say, forget it all
I got burned and lost my pride, I said without you right by my side
Got a job, but I make no pay I said it doesn't matter anyway
Got no girl to spend it on I said without you my love goes on.

You took my love and then you threw it through the door
