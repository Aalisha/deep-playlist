When God made Adam He made him Proud
He wasn't happy till he made him howl
He made him howl and then he made him moan
He wasn't happy till he made him a home
He said this for your people when them times get hard
And this for your people who heavens left dark
This for your people their days are numbered
And this for their future the past has forgot
He said now

Shake your shimmy Shake it Proud
Shake Shake your shimmy Shake it loud
Shake your Shimmy Shake it Proud
Shake Shake your shimmy Shake it loud
...
