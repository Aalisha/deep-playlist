Talkin' 'bout a hot-wired kid who thought he knew it all
And what he didn't know, he didn't need to
Changin' women like tires when their use wore thin
Retread feelings, that's all we knew
He's been runnin' lights for years, grindin' down those forward gears
He's got a lady in the back seat, lady in the front seat
Eyes on the road and whispers in both ears

Chorus: One too many girlfriends, and too little feeling left
He better find the one, he's gonna take on the run, before it runs him down
He's got far too many choices, he better make a few of them
He wants to have it all, and wind up standin' tall
I hope his dream never ends, I guess it just depends
...
