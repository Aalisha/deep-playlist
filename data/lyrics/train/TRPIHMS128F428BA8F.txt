There was a time we had so little
But we thought it was so much
There was a time we had no control
And we lost all touch
So much emotion, so many days passed
So many things we thought would last
And everything it seemed so big
So much invested in the past

Well we're still dreaming
Still believing
No longer looking for the new thing
No longer looking for the new thing
...
