I can only imagine
All of the magic that would happen
If we all come together
I could sing of your love forever
Tell me I'm never alone and that I'm going home

I can hear sounds of melodies
And the remedy
That comes when you lift me up
From the flood in the sea of faces
And I promise you we'll make it

? Cause in the healing rain
There is beauty from pain
But the scars remain

I will find a way to take my life
And give it all away
And I'll be pressing on
Feel this phenomenon

So turn it up throw your hands in the air
All the people everywhere
Let me hear you say
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah

Turn it up let the stereos play
All the people everywhere
Let me hear you say
Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
...
