The dark hand will call you out of nowhere it seems
The black cloud will bust apart shattering your dreams
They all put up barricades blank you out at first
Then they'll get to you to get to me who'll know what's worse

I say Fear not baby fear not Fear not baby fear not
Fear not baby fear not baby fear not It's going to end

Get your drink knocked over
you're thinking that it might be planned
