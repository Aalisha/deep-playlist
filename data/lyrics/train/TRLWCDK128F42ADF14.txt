I'm happy, so ready, for the next phase in my life
These days are fulfilling
And I have peace of mind
But everytime I get too high
You do you best to knock me down
But I am not who I was back then
Your trying to hurt me, your really trying
I feel like you owe me
No fighting, fussing, caring to start an argument
Why cant I have my peace?
I understand why they say misery love company
But what you failed to see I hold the power I am in control
And all things must come to an end
Your trying to hurt me, your really trying

Your trying, but it's all right
There is no way I'm let you take what I have found within
Your trying so hard to get under my skin
This is a battle that you won't win
