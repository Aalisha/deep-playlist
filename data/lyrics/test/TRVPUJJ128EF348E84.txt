Yeah, yeah, Sunz of Man, Disciples
Got the four Elements
About to take you through the four stages of nature
The combinations of danger
It's like that
Killah Priest

I'm deep into the page
Each stage is like a maze, it's like sperm reachin the egg
I focus on the brain cause it be the enterprise
It's like life within the center of the eyes
Descend off the soundwaves, that are bound for days
The atom is surrounded with rays
My frame be the mercury, it circles degrees
Developed the strength in Hercules
Wisdom changes my continent
When I quiz them I build up the confidence
You burnin me is like tryin to culture a pig
I teach knowledge and culture the kids
I inject the rhyme into the depths of the mind
The proper insight gives effects on the blind
See I don't entertain, I enter the brain
The Killah Priest always come and represent the name
A daily study stimulates the thought
Correct diet, I meditate with less talk
Makes me deep as the ocean floor
The ink soaks in and I'm prepared to explore
MC's fall like the city of Rome
I'm inspiring like Solomon and witty in the dome
