Every time I look at you
You always look so beautiful
Driving on the road again the Chevy's packed
And it is dusk
And I will take some photographs
So I can dream of you

Can't say I've felt such twisting
In my heart this way
we pitch a tent & have one sleeping bag
To stay awake
The fire's burning, softly singing songs
So close to you

Do you believe in love at first sight?
