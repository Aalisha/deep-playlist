C'mon, c-c'mon(say what, say what)
Yo Yo, there she go
Go girl with your fine ass

You keep askin' for my time
You keep tellin' me, that I'm fine!
Give me your number
I won't call!
Give me your pager too
Not at all will I call, not at all

I know that you want a piece of my ass
Don't you know that a guy like you
Wouldn't last

Not a player-don't get paid
I'll leave you hangin'(I'll leave you hangin')
For days
...
