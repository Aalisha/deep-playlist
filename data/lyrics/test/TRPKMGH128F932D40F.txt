This getting older
Ain’t for cowards
This getting older
Is a lot to go through
Ain’t a gonna need this body
Much longer
Ain’t a gonna need this body
Much more

Well I can’t see much
Like I used to
And I can’t run like the wind
I don't sleep more
Than just a few hours
I can’t remember where I’ve been

Ain't a gonna need this body much longer
...
