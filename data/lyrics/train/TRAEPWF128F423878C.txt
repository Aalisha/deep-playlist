The pandemonium is finally setting in
You aren't a winner till someone says you are
Smile like you have a chance to be beautiful and rich
Ladies and gentlemen, come on down
When no one knows your name

Dolled up star shining for this show

Make up, dressing rooms, seating plans, a construed web of vain
This is, where ill, be blessed, god strikes with his microphone
