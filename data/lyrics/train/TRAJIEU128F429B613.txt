And if I die today I'll be the happy phantom
And I'll go chasing the nuns out in the yard
And I'll run naked through the streets without my mask on
And I will never need umbrellas in the rain
I'll wake up in strawberry fields every day
And the atrocities of school I can forgive
The happy phantom has no right to bitch

The time is getting closer
The time to be a ghost
Every day we're getting closer
The sun is getting dim
Will we pay for who we've been?
