You may be a star in your own mind
But you're greatly deluded in my mine
I heard reports that you drink
And you take drugs most of the time
And that your life is in danger
And that you were involved in a crime

Is it over?
Is it over?
Will you come home now?
Is it over?
Is it over?
Don't you let me down
