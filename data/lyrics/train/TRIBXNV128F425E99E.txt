Listen up 'cause I gotta tell you
The way it is won't last the night trough
Done it all to make it happy, how much does it take?
I'm not saying that I won't give up now
But you're acting out of scene you once saw
And the drama's only getting deeper
Do you like that feeling?

Now I'm caught inside
Out of breath now
I'll be crushed alive,
My heart begins to feel the pressure

Stressed out,
Here's the situation,
Stressed out,
With all the aggravation
Calm down, until the complication,
This is not my fault,
Stressed out,
Another confrontation,
Stressed out,
For your information,
I'm out, in need of liberation,
This is not my fault

Riding fast on your roller coaster,
You'll be screaming 'til the ride is over
Can't we skip to the happy ending
If I have no way
...
