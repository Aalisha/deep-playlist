When we were children
You and me, the pack
When I tried to hide in ...
You'd come running back

Swimming in a river
I fell into the sand
And I thought I dreamt
But you held out your hand

'Cause it was always you, always you
And when the night was cold and I needed a shoulder
It was always you

Remember schooldays
I found this photograph
That innocent look on your smiling face
Designed to make me laugh
...
