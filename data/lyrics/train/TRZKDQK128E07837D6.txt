Without you, I have room to breathe
And if I'm weak then you can't see my insecurities
Without you, I can do what I choose
Cause when you got no one to love you got nothing to lose

Will there come a time when my head finds it easier to not think about this
And I would do any thing to stop the weight of my heart getting heavier
My only conclusion is

That nothing compares to you
No matter where I look
No matter what I do
Cause that garden of Eden you took me to
Is now over grown
And the love I've known is gone without you

Is gone without you

Without you, I can kid myself
...
