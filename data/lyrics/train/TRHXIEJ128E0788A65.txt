(M. Riperton R. Rudolph)

The ripples run into the sun
And your smile blends with the clouds that flutter by me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? What do I see?

I see the children playing in the sun
And there is love enough for each and everyone
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! That's what I see!
