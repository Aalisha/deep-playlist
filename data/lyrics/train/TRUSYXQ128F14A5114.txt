This is my city
This is your city
This is our city now

Well I'm back in the land of second chances
And rock'n'roll shows where nobody dances
Back in the land of chicken and chips
Mars bars and roadside tips

And if you don't like it
Then that's too bad
Cos it's the only city that we've ever had
So when the man says
That you gotta pay
You gotta cancel the cheque and you gotta say...

Well I'm back in the land of cheap incense
...
