You say yes
Then it's no
You say you'll stay
Then you go
Your undecided now
So what are you going to do

Fisrt you say you do and then you don't
And then you say you will and then you won't
Your undecided now
So what are you gonna to do

Now you want to play
And then it's no
And when you say you'll stay
That's when you go
Your undecided now
So what are you gonna to do

I've been sitting on a fence
And it doesn't make much sense
'Cause you keep me in suspense
And you know it
...
