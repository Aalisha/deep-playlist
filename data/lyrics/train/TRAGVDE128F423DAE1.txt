this little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
this little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine

All in my home
I'm gonna let it shine
All in my room
I'm gonna let it shine, Shine now

the road was ruff (through the dark)
the way was long
I kept on singing that freedom song
my god promised me a rainbow sign
just gotta let my little light shine

don't give up
don't back down
don't let the liar turn you around

my heart's fixed
way up in mind
I'm going out and let my little light shine
shure gonna let my little light shine
