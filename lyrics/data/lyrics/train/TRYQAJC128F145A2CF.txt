Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me

It's only been a week
The rush of being home in rapid fading
Prevailing to recall
What I was missing all that time in England

Has sent me aimlessly
On foot or by the help of transportation
To knock on windows where
A friend no longer live, I had forgotten

Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me
Will remind, will remind, will remind me

And anywhere I go
There's always something to remind me
Of another place and time
Where love that traveled far had found me
