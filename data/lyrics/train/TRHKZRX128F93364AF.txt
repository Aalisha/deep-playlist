Well this one called the volcano eruption.
Well you see ina '84 crowd of people,
Yellowman a fe come new brand.
Nobody move, nobody get hurt.
Nobody move, nobody get hurt.
The youth them just a dress up in a white collar shirt
And some of them wear it till it resemble dirt.
He said he want me to join the army.
I ain't gonna do it officer.
No way. I ain't gonna do it.
Turn out your left pocket.
A searching for a chrome automatic.
A searching if you have any ratchet.
He said what is your number? I didn't answer.
What is your number? I still don't answer.
What is the number boy? I really don't answer.
Him crank up him chopper. Mi momma!
Then me started to answer.
He say give it to me one time!
Give it to me two time!
Give it to me three time! Lord!
Nobody move, nobody get hurt.
