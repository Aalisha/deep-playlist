Time, I've been passing time
Watching trains go by.
All of my life,
Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly.
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me.

Something's telling me it might be you

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life,
Wondering how they met and what makes it last.

If I found the place,
Would I recognize the face?
