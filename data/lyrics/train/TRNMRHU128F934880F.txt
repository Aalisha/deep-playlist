(Everlast)
We all gonna die telling soldier’s stories
When I buck off the gun watch em all duck and run
P.E. number one, my Desert Eagle weighs a ton

We all gonna die telling soldier’s stories
When I buck off the gun watch em all duck and run
P.E. number one, my Desert Eagle weighs a ton

(Ill Bill)
I got fly bitches twice as hot as Ice La Fox
That’ll get you sliced and popped for that icy watch
Y’all fucking idiots could learn a lot about business
Y’all buying Benzes, I’m putting down payments on buildings
The king of the kidnappings and big ransoms
It’s Ill Bill homie, I break atoms and spit anthems
We Mansons, grab automatics and throw tantrums
Show you how the fuck we pop off the banger
He was an alchy with lots of coke
A perfect stranger like Balki Bartokomous
He saw the Glock, he froze, he fell to his knees, begged for his life
Said he was holding another ten keys with his wife
Told me her address, threw him in the trunk of the car
Got ten more bricks plus twenty thousand dollars
Robbed him of the bread, put the cocaine in the jar
Shot him in the head, took the yeyo then I’m gone

We all gonna die telling soldier’s stories
When I buck off the gun watch em all duck and run
