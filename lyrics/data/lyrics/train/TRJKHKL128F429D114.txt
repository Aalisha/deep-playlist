Let? s sail away, find our own country
We? ll build a house and get tired of palm trees
Let? s get away, let? s push our lives aside

I? ll sport a smile, take in some color
Under the stars, I? ll be your lover
With no distractions, I? m gonna treat you right

And it seems like things are only getting better
Well, it seems like we can never catch a break

Just keep a hold on me, don? t let go
If you float away, if you float away
Waited too long for a ship to come
Don? t you float away, don? t you float away

Let? s go to bed, let? s stop debating
Look at the time, we? re always waiting
But we? re in love and that should be just fine
