chorus:
me and you gotta good thing goin' on
like a classic love song, yeah
see through all the times we never thought we'd last this long
we still goin on strong
like a classic love song

verse 1:
there's never a day that i don't think about your smiling face
(think about your smiling face)
and there's never a day that i don't think about the things you say
(oooh)
'cause all i know is i love you so, and just hope that this love will grow
inseprable till we get old keepin on like the song on the radio

chorus:
me and you gotta good thing goin' on
like a classic love song, yeah
see through all the times we never thought we'd last this long
we still goin on strong
like a classic love song

verse 2:
and there's never a time where you don't supply the things i need
(supply all the things i need)
and there's never a time i don't appreciate your love for me
'cause boy you are, my superstar, and near or far you got my heart
you play the part, like it's an art, venting our love song right from the start

chorus:
me and you gotta good thing goin' on
like a classic love song, yeah
see through all the times we never thought we'd last this long
we still goin on strong
