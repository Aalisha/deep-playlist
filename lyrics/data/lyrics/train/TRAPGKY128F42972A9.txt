your mail's not safe in this town
your mail's not safe in this town
your mail's not safe in this town
your mail's not safe in this town

i strike a red bird on your face
i pour the kerosene in your mouth
i watch the match fall down your throat
i burn all your precious bowels
watch the smoke fold for every crack
and breathe in your secret lives
all your bills pay your welfare checks
but i don't think i can stay for long
there's a lot more that's not yet ash

your mail's not safe in this town
your mail's not safe in this town
your mail's not safe in this town
...
