Had a flash of mad inspiration
And just the bestest of intention
Oh but that's the blood that you need to bleed
Yes that's the mother of invention

When you've had it with the aggravation
And you're swamped up in the complication
Just nothing but the road to ration

Sing!
Na-na-na Na-na-na
Na-na-na Na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

Oh!
Here come

In my past life I was a woman's soldier
And yes I was once a woman's slave
Oh I've been roaming all over for ages babe
Ain't gonna make it in just one day oh no
