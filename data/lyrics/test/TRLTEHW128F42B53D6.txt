All the peacock people left their plumes in a pile
They look good to a fault
And the Gulf water's warm like a bathtub
Full of lavender and epsom salt
See a bleach blond boy put his long board down
Help his girl get her sunscreen on
I thought about you in your little house
Think you're lonely but I could be wrong and

I wanna be a bootlegger
Wanna mix you up something strange
Braid your hair like a sister
Name you like a hurricane

Right there
That's the postman sleeping in the sand
He's got a letter to deliver
But I can't stay mad, oh
Right there
That's the postman sleeping in the sand
He's got a get-well-card to deliver
...
