v1
I wonder how yuh send yuh little youth go to school, and everyday yuh de pan carner ah sharpen up yuh tool,
see me every hour,
everytime when mi pass,
me have fe wonder if your eyes ah magnifying glass,
see mi in ah mi car
look how me glass them dark,
mi have fe wonder if yuh ah spy, or you ah work for yuh boss,
and everyday yuh ah tell me let off ah thing,
me have fe wonder if yuh criple or your hand them fin.

mine off ah me (3x repeat)
duh take yuh mine off ah me,
take yuh eye off ah me
