Another long lonely night
Wrestling with what he's done
And what he might
Do while she cries
She's had enough
She's waking up
And she decides

She'd rather try to brave it on her own
This hollow house has never been a home

Tired of living a life like that
Giving a love she don't get back
Lies as big as a Pontiac
Rolling all over her
Tired of the words that just won't stick
She knows not to believe it
...
