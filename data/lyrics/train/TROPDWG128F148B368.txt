Take me back to see you smile again
And the love you had for your friends
Take me back for the times we had
When we joked and laughed, take me back

'Cause I know you'll live forever
And I know we're still together
Through your music and your love

Take me back, oh take me back
Oh, take me back

You were proud and strong
You taught me right from wrong, what a friend
Take me back for the words you spoke
Always get me home to the end
