The empire is already built in my head
Now I can enjoy a lazy season
This is what I'm all about
No disaster in my pocket tonight

The river runs red, but I don't give a fuck
Do you even care about the bleeding land
When you've got nothing to do with another end
Dust in my head, the clarity is fading away

You wanted more
You ain't got nothing more
You wanted more
You've got nothing at all
