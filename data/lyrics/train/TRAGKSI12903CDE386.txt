It was a Saturday night on the streets of Cali
Threw on my dope silk suit, brushed off my suede Bally's
Threw on enough gold for any girl's pleasure
Left a pound and a half of that shit still in the dresser
I slapped a clip in my nine, threw a clip in my sock
Hit three grand up off the dresser, it was ten on the dot
Now my beeper started beepin, I threw that shit in the sink
I didn't need it no more, I had more money than Prince
See, I was quittin the game and tonight was my fling
You see, on the streets they're players but only one king
Now that's the title I held but the game is real fast
You gotta get in and get out if you expectin to last
Now my homeboy Evil was downstairs chillin in his brand new Benz
I had many adversaries but very few close friends
We broke to the set, E parked the car on the grass
High-signin was his trademark and he did it with class
Hit the door like two titans, the whole jam stopped to stare
