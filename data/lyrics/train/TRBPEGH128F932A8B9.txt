The perfect prey
Deliverance of your end
The rebellion commands
Your doom has now been sealed

Devious Instinct
The killing of all future
Resistance failing
Vindictive torture
The storm churns violent
no one stands in the eye!

Resuscitate
Led to the edge of your life
To be struck down
Inflicted punishing blows
Infiltrate
