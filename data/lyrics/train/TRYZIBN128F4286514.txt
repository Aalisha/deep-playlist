A lie I once heard: "We're innocent until proved guilty"
But the truth is absurd
We're poor until proved rich
And the scales of justice are fixed by lying pigs

A plot of human terror unfolds behind the precinct door
To cage all the minorities, the immigrants and poor
Next they'll hunt the handicapped, disabled blind and deaf
And what will all these piggies do, HA! when there's no one left

Swat police in riot gear, are bombing us tonight
And all our civil liberties will die by morning's light
While crooked politicians lie and rig the ballot book
We whitewash fake democracy and paint another coat

We'll keep you here to stay; you'll never get away
Your property ain't mine, until your dying day
We'll crush your soul inside; there is no easy ride
...
