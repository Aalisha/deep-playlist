My mom told me to get a job
Work with my neighbor Bob
Why can't I get some sympathy
Don't yell at me
I'm almost 18
And not to mention,
I'm so poor I can't afford to pay attention
What can I say
We don't get paid.

we suck (yeah)
we're never gonna make it
We're too dumb to be rich and famous
(rich and famous)

im sick of doin what im told
this is getting old
i sold the family car
but i guess im gonna be a ssss-star
star sss-star

we suck (yeah)
we're never gonna make it
We're too dumb to be rich and famous
Record company's don't even wanna claim us
We suck (yeah)
but who could blame us

we're just like you and we're never gonna make it
