Ben looks, across at, the girl that, lives next door
He's a hedge pig, delicious, he knows that, she wants him more
Than Matthew and Peter, the tree worms, that built her house, in Brighton Beach, with Russian creeps, that Ben found on the floor

Ben could say, anything, to make her happen
And Ben could drink, anything, to make her happen

He's a prickly little porker, no he's not a son of mine
He's a dirty little secret, he's a stickly little swine
You know he had it coming, from the day he borrowed bread
A toasty little trinket, he stole my girl instead
