How did my day just go from bad to worse
Lost my cell phone now I'm late for work
Wearing my favorite shoes and the heel broke
Tell me I'm getting punked
This is beyond a joke

I'm so on edge
You'd think I was scared
Of my own shadow
It's days like these
I gotta live by my motto
Get in the car
And turn on the radio
Turn it up turn it up

I like it loud
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I wanna shout
Turn it up turn it up turn it up
Loud
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I wanna shout
