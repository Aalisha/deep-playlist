Yeah Yeah Yeah
Oooh Oooh
Oh, baby
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Check it out now
Oooh Oooh
Check it out now

I've been looking and been searching
Oh baby
For the one who'll be true
(Oooh Oooh mm Oooh)
And I thought that I had found him
Oh boy
But now I know it's not you
(Oooh Oooh Oooh)

Cause you can see me running
But you're standing still
You don't believe it's coming
But you know that it will

So baby, see ya
All right
(Oh, yeah)
I wouldn't wanna be ya tonight
(Woo)
Let me make it clear
All right
