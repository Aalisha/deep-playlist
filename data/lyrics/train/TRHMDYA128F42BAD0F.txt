All my friends
Shook it up
While i got trapped in time
And documents
Leading up
So everything was mine
And my head won't stop
What happens then
And my heart it closes up

Fucking around
Pretending there's a problem
Figure it out
Fucking around
Pretending there's a problem
Figure it out
Hustling leaves me white-hot,
...
