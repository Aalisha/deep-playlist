An ash painted chamber where death has been
A song of entrails strung upon a violin
On the brow, blood and sperm, with bile thinned
And sealed with the Hecate's nightshade kiss

Five live cats, into a pentagram pinned
To fuel their yowls, be they partly skinned
A will to call the reaper to seal the abyss
Where the half-eaten faces of coranthon grin

And the deluge begins
As a wail runs into course
Defeat devours defiance
Life congeals, unhallowed
Stench billows
Raped into compliance
The strong force yields
To the redivider

Altars bleed their rotting sanctity
Aborted selves convulse
Retch momentity avulsed from bliss

The walls give way
To a trembling pandemonium
