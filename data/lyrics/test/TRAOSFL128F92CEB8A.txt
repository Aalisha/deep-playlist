No one in the world do make me feel
The way that you do
That's all right
No one in the world do make me feel
The way that you do
That's all right
Cause when i'll ever long
And I think of you
Makes me think of things
That I wanna do
No one in the world do make me feel
The way that you do
That's all right

Can't help this feeling
