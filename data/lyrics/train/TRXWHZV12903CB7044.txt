I woke up in new york city
From my sleep behind the wheel
Caught a train to poughkeepsie
And time stood still

She wrote me a letter from san diego
To qualify her luck
These flights connect through arizona
But I think I'll stay stuck

So here I am
Here I am
Well I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog
So I could see the mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
