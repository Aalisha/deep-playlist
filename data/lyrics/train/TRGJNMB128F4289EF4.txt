[2Pac]

It's just me against the world

[girl]

Oooohhh, oooohhh

[2Pac]

Nuttin to lose. It's just me against the world baby

[girl]

Oahhhh, oahhhahh

[2Pac]

I got nuttin to lose It's just me against the world

[girl]

Oh-hahhh

[2Pac]

Stuck in the game Me against the world baby
Verse One: 2Pac
Can you picture my prophecy? Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin
There ain't no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause they're illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin, but will they last or be blasted? Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetary
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

[girl]

Me against the world

[2Pac]

It's just me against the world

[girl]

Ooooh yeah, ooo-hooo

[2Pac]

It's just me against the world

[girl]

Me against the world

[2Pac]

Cause it's just me against the world baby
