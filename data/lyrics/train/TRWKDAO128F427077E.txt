I'm an evil gal don't you bother with me, no
I said I'm an evil gal don't you mess around with me, mmhmm
Well I'll empty your pockets and fill you with misery, yes I will!
If you tell me good mornin'
I'm gon' tell you that's a lie
If you say hello baby I'mma give you the evil eye
I'mma evil gal don't you mess around with me, mmhmm
