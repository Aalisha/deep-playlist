Cover my dreams with veil of sun
This sight obscured where it all began
Ascending from blear, burying all sincere
Hiding light unmasks my deepest fear

Waves abandoned the shore
Dead calm
Like a preceding crackle of the choking fire
Slowly I taste the blindness we fed
Inch by inch, I draw inside to recoil
...
