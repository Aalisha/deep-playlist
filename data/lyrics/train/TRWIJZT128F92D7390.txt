A short life of trouble
In a dark and dusty mine
Has been my occupation
Now I walk the picket line
I was there in Bloody Harlan
When we tried to organize
The miners faced starvation
You could see it in their eyes
The Company hired some gun thugs
Many miners died it's said
They come to kill the union
But they lost their lives instead
