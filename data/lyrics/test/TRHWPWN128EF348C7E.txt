We touched there was temperature
I'm not the same
Now I'm passing through your door
It's a pleasure game

You're the object of my smile
I'm a life machine
Sentimental sound on sound
Time to switch the scene

You're the passion in me
You've broken down the system
You're the vision I see
A pleasure victim
