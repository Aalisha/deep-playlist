We were down on our luck in Houston
We were broke and we were needin' a job
We got a gig in this joint on the wrong side of town
And it was just about as rough as a cob

He looked like trouble with a capital T

He cleared off a whole row of barstools
Just to have him a place to sit
The bartender turned about three shades of purple
And the bouncer just up and quit
He come prowling cross the floor like a lion in a cage
