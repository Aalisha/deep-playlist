You can trip smug smiling in your worn-out shoes
Cast away the rhythm of eternity's fugue
Grapple with the tongue of hope till it abandons you
But you can't deny a gift

Falter at the well, making heroes out of ghosts
Stuffing yourself on thankless boasts
But I have faith in your withering soul
'Cause you can't deny a gift
Oh, no, you can't deny a gift

A gift of one and a gift to all
The wings to soar and not to fall
...
