I bought a new red dress to lift my spirits up
And just like you did, honey, it cost me way too much
Next time you see me, I'll bet you'll take a second look
You'll wonder why I look so good

You'll never know how much I miss you, you won't see it in my face
You'll never know I'll never find another that could take your place
'Cause I'll be smiling when I see you, my tears won't ever show
Yeah, I might always love you
But you'll never know
