They're callin me up what's the move
What time am I linkin up with the crew
It's supposed to be lined up the place is packed
But I got somethin holdin me back
See my babys got some other arrangements
So I might have to miss y'alls engagements
Yes I am sorry but I'm goin out like that yeah
Cause tonight see it's on
There ain't nothin goin on but love
Yes tonight I'd rather be gettin down
In the bedroom instead of the town
Fellas I ain't goin out
Cause my old ladies showin me how
She likes to keep me in the house to do my homework
She's speakin that we can make love
And won't stop until we get enough
So that sure as hell means
