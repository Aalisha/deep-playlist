Something is saying things ain't been right
I can tell in your smile
You're probably thinking I can't see the signs,
but you're wrong
What we been missing is more than a touch
But the words seem so clear
Through the illusions that love will survive
These are words I hope you'll hear

If this is the end then why don't I wanna go
My feeling defends answers we ought 2 know
If this is the end must the story close this way
