Just got home from Illinois
Lock the front door, oh, boy!
Got to sit down
Take a rest on the porch.
Imagination set sing
Pretty soon I'm singin'.
Doo, doo, doo
Lookin' out my back door.

There's a giant doing cartwheels
A statue wearin' high heels.
Look at all the happy
Creatures dancing on the lawn.
A Dinosaur Victrola
List'ning to Buck Owens.
Doo, doo, doo
