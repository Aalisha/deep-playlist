The position being taken is not to be mistaken
For attempted education or righteous accusation
Only a description, just an observation
Of the pitiful ondition of our degeneration

Walls made of opinions thru which we speak and never listen
Ceiling made of pride vicious and self satisfied
Door that's made of rage; hard and slowly aged
Always closing tighter with every war we wage

Room without a window, can't see out
Room without a window, can't see out can't see out

Floor is made of lives, we gladly end to stay inside
Corners made of borders, and borders made of law and order
Painted with the words of politicians and religion
