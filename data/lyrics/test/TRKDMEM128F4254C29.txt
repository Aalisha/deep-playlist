Trod in the valley for the longest time, Jah
And I'll never ever quit
I've just got to do this
Trod in the valley and I'll never ever quit
Trod in the valley and I've got to do this
Trod in the valley to keep myself here
For this Armageddon war
For this final war
This war is not so far away Jah
It's rasta and he's calling Jah Jah
Still I and I live on yah
I smoke a marijuana
Holding off Selassie I corner

Trod in the valley and I'll never ever quit
Trod in the valley and I've got to do this
Trod in the valley to keep myself here
For this armaggedion war
For this final war

When this war start me Jah Jah
Let I and I be far away Jah
