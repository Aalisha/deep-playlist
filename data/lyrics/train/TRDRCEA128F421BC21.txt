On the day i was born
The rain fell down
There was trouble brewin' in my home town
It was the seventh day
I was the seventh son
And it scared the hell out of everyone

They said drop, i said go
They said fast, i said slow
They said lost, i said no
I do the bad boy boogie

Bein' a bad boy ain't that bad
I had me more dirty women than most men ever had
All you women come along with me
And i'll show you how good a bad boy can be
