Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light
Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light

Not yet a man but ready to try
Music playing people saying

Walked into the room I couldn't hardly see
There she was moving closer to me
She told me her name before I could speak
Took my hand and then she said these words to me
