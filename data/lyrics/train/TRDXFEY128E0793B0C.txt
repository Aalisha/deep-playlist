Tears of the feeble, hands of the slaves
Skin of the mothers, mouths of the babes
Building the towers, belongs to the sky
When the whole thing comes crashing down
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why

Under the shelf, the shelf of the sky
Two eyes two suns, too heavenly blinds
Swallowing rivers, belongs to the sea
When the whole thing washes away
Don't run to me

I'll be going down, for the rest of the slide
...
