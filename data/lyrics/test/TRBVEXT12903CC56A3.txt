You're walking my streets,
I don't know who you are.
You don't care for my trees,
I only see you from afar.

You can't see where you go,
I can't find you the way.
You seem you do not know,
I won't tell you to stay.

You're losing your mind,
I don't feel you're alive.
You don't know what to find,
I can't help you contrive.

You're closing your eyes,
I can't bring you to see.
You forget your soul dies,
I fear you won't be free.

You are not the only one,
Lost alone in this world.
Lost alone in this world.
