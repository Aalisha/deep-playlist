My mama done told me
When I was in pig tails
My mama done told me

â€œHoney, a man's gonna sweet talk
And give you the big eye
But when that sweet talkin's done

A man is a two-face, a worrisome thing
Who'll leave you to sing
The blues in the night

Now the rain is a-fallin'
Hear the train a-callin'

My mama done told me
Hear that lonesome whistle
Blowin' 'cross the trestle
...
