There's a dream in your heart and His heart is your prayer

I believe there is divine imagination
Give it wings for it created aviation
Every little hope you're holding inside
Every little gleam you keep in your eyes
A dream, hey, a dream

Before a seed became a flower there was a vision
The dream is planted deep, He'll shower it with wisdom
Flowing with the love that's making you smile
You've waited and you've prayed, you've dreamed your whole life
Your soul begin to fly

There's a dream in your heart and His heart is your prayer
You can move mountains with your life in His hands
He'll tear down the walls and He'll walk where you can't
Have faith in the power to believe
He's given you the dream

I pray your dream will leap beyond you expectations
