You called me up from Amarillo,
Said you were comin' to town,
I thought I'd like to tell you hello,
And drive an old friend around,
I pulled up to the airport,
Confident and cool,
But when you stepped off that plane,
I knew I was your fool,

Blowin' me away again,
I swore it wouldn't happen again,
But I looked at you and then,
I'm like a tumbleweed,
In a wild west Texas wind,
