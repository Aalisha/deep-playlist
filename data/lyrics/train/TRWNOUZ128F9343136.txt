Wise men
Thinking of numbers
Shaken not stirred
But I hang
Hang on your every word
These days
I roll with the punches
Always your clown
Do you remember when
We used to paint this town
Red gold green and blue
If you still believe in me
And you
Don't walk away
I know I'll find an answer
If you stay
Don't walk away
There's nothing in tomorrow
That wasn't there in yesterday
Oh no no no no no
All the heartache
Too many nights
In the heartbreak hotel
