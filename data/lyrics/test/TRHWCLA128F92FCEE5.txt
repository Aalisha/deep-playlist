Big Tymers
How You Luv That - Vol. 1
Suga & Pac, Puff & Big
"Suga & Pac, Puff & Big"
(feat. B.G., Lil Wayne)

[B.G.]
Me the B.G., and Baby my fuckin rounds
Two livin legend paper chasers from uptown
Bout money and bitches, puttin haters in ditches
We roll in trucks like Hummers and Expeditions
Our relationship like Moses and Jesus
Ask one of our hoes, ain't no comin between us
Two black young kingpins, that's how they treat us
Steaks and fettucini is what they feed us
Nigga ridin shinin, me and my nigga be sippin
the finest wine and spendin G's, makin trips
back and forth to Texas, we flyin; tryin to make a mill' y'all
Cause we roll with the motto, "Ball til we fall"
Fuck wit B, you bringin B.G. all the way out there
Fuck wit me G you bringin Baby all the way out there
Since ninety-two ninety-three our love been there
We never spend to a pussy, Cash Money niggaz share
I'm a Big Tymer, that's a fact
Suga Slim just signed a, million dollar contract
Lil' (?) Capone thuggin quick to bust yo' head
Watch your tone in that mansion is where we lay our head at
We play high gold floss rocks and drive drop-tops
Way I bust it look like Suge and 'Pac

[Lil Wayne]
Like Suge and 'Pac, like Puff and B.I.G
Baby and B.G. tryin to clock six figs
Like 'Face and J., like Russ and Run
Baby and B.G. tryin to clock a million

[Baby]
Like J. and 'Face, like Russ and Run
Baby and B.G. comin through like assault rifle machine guns
Worth more money than these niggaz could wonder
You better thank quick nigga we hit blocks like thunder
Comin through a dark tunnel a black on black Hummer
