Have you ever walked down a dark road
Not sure which way to turn
Or been the passenger in a speeding car
So afraid u might get hurt

Somehow someone saved me
An invisble hand and a instrucatable love

There are angels on earth
There right by your side
Your saved and you can't explain why
When you think your alone
And no one can hear your pray
Angels on earth will be there (o yeah)
