(Originally by The Waitresses)

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I've got what boys like

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I see them looking

I make them want me
I like to tease them
They want to touch me
I never let them

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
Boys like (clap)
Boys like me

but you, you're special
(i might let you)
You're so much diffrent
