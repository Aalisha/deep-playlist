I live by the river on the wrong side of town
nothing much to do here but listen to the sound
of the train i'll never catch passing me by
and the muddy water drinking the tears that i cry

with somebody else, well if i had the time
if i had a little help,

Every bridge in Dickson County,
would be burning down tonight,
Every bridge in Dickson county,
