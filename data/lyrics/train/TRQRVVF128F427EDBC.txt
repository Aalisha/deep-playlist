And I'm reminded of the time that I was blinded by the sun.
It was a welcome change from the sight of you hanging
Like a willow off the arm of yet another visionary
Prophetess east van punk.

I didn't stand a chance.
I couldn't stand at all.
You looked ok with the others.
You looked great on your own.
It was 2002 and you couldn't be bothered to say, 'hello' or 'goodbye'.
Or stand the 'test of time' - you did, I just tried to separate an ocean from these tears we cried...

Where did you get that line?
Where did you get that look?
