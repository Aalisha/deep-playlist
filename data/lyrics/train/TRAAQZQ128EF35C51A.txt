A long, long time he stayed in deathrow, now the chosen day has come
Lead by the ushers of the court, let the judgment be done
Long ago he saw the daylight without bars
But this is the last time his sun will rise
Walking towards the gallows, he knows the sling awaits him
From somewhere he hears music, it? s toneless sound makes him afraid

Suddenly the music stops, for him the sign to go
Was it the melody of death or of mercy he doesn? t now
Now he stands on the gallows, face towards the rope
He believes that after his fall, there? s no future, there? s no hope
Now his head? s fills the sling, he feels the agony growing
Executioner? s hand moves the gear-lever, first he hovers than he falls!
