I see you standing at the shore
of stony mountains cold and gray
Our thoughts collide my heart feels warm
We must awake before break of the day

Remember moments left behind
Like stormy seas swept time away
These memories so safe and sound
We must awake before break of the day

Like shadows formed of a human lie
and fragile words which seemed so wise
no luring masks no cruel disguise
Redemption lies in between our soul

Imagine twilight clouds and shame
undoubtful dreams no hope in sight
We'll pass our way but leave no strain
Redemption lies in between our soul

Again she fled, left me behind
With nothing but sadness on my mind
Again she fled, left me behind
...
