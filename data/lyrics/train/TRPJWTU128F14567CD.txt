I give into the moment like I'm standing at the edge (I know)
That no one's gonna turn me 'round
Just one more step, I could let go
Oh and in the middle,
I hear the voices and they're calling for me now (I know)
And nothing's gonna wake me now
Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling,
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
But now I'm falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling,
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

I look up and down,
And I can feel the eyes, they're watching us so closely oh
I'm trying not to make a sound
Cause I'll be found out somehow

So keep calling,
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
...
