I know it's crazy, I know it's crazy
But you can't quite turn away
I know it's crazy, I know it's crazy
But you can't quite turn away

It's foul in the street, criminal in the street
Little child running wild, struck down in the street
I'm strapped for the brawl, story of the hood
It was written, you can read it in the graph on the walls

Long as cash is involved, they blast for the cause
And you better break bread or you asking for war
Trying to come out the hood, pray for him
'Cuz he would put the gun down if he somehow could

Baby being born, teenage mother
Fly baby boy found laying in the dumpster?
She couldn't bare the load, she begged for forgiveness
Because it's just tears of soul

And the world so cold, world so bold
Gotta make it so my boy and baby girl, grow old
Hold my head 'cuz I could be the nigga in the news
...
