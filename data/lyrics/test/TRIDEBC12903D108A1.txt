I want 
to play with you tonight
hold me 
thats all thats on my mind
baby
somethings feel so right
maybe 
we could play tonight
I want to be 
somewhere with you 
I want to do just what you want to do 
I want to be 
all over you
I've got a dream and you could make it true
CHORUS

Cause I'm...
I'm fascinated by your love boy
and I'm fascinated by your love toy
...
