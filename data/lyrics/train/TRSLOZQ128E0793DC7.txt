Hmm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Aye aye aye aye yeah aye
First he said that he wouldn't leave me
What a fool to believe that line
Just another one of his obsessions
To help to pass the time

Get it right, get it right, get it right
Don't get it wrong
'Cos if you want me
Get your ass on over here and show me
Stop wasting time
And if you need me
Get your act together boy and show me
You should be mine

All in love is fair
One of us will lose
Is it her or me?
Is it me or you?
Who's it gonna be?
What you gonna do?
Are you over me?
I'm not over you

'Cos you said that you wouldn't cheat me
That our love was to last all time
She must've been a big exception
If you're not the cheating kind

Get it right, get it right, get it right
...
