If I had wings, I'd fly away
I'd let the stars just guide the way, right to you
Don't care if this journey takes all night
Oh, how my heart yearns to be with you

I thought, I would share with you my dreams
I'm still missing you
But instead of just writing you
I'll spread my wings and

Fly like an angel to you
I'll spread my wings like an eagle
And fly straight to you

I'm gon' fly like an angel to you
I won't be writing you no letters
Loves gon' bring our souls together

And if by chance that we should meet
On an open glide, we'll run away with each other
No looking back we're headed to our destiny
Someday I hope it will come true
(Someday will come true and I)
