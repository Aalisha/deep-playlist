weights bear down pulling me under 
i look around 
shadows are staring at me laughing at me 
letting me know where i stand 
air is taken away from my lungs 
from emotions that form quite slow 
and the pit of darkness consumens my every way 
im scared but trembling keeps me sane 
where along the path did i take so many wrong turns 
how did i end up face down crying letting pillows catch my tears? 
how did i even build up a tolerance to deal with this? 
depression is something i dont miss 
can i keep me from falling into deeper parts of this hell on earth 
exposing my true colors to the world withering from these wrists
