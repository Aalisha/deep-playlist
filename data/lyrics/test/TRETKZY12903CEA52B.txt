There are traces of the people
And the faces I have known
As the bus stops at the building
The place that I called home
Thought I'd left forever
Never thought that I'd return
But everyday, I make my way
I guess I never learn

I never meant to hurt you
No matter what I said
I never did desert you
You are still inside my head
The earth will keep on turning
The sun will always rise
Don't know why, seems like I
I'm always so surprised

I can't sleep at night
Life is black and white
And all I can do
...
