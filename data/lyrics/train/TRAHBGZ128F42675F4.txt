Born at the bottom
Struggle to find a way
You can feel the power
It's growing every day
Fight for a change,
Can't wait until tomorrow
Make a difference on this day
and al the rest will follow
Chorus:
Blue blood
Working class survives
Don't forget your liberty
Blue Blood
Working class survived
That's how we came to be
Blue blood
working class survives
Don't forget your liberty
Chains must be broken if ever to be free
