I wrote the note and I sent it over
It read I'm lonely tonight
She looked up she looked away
I wasn't sure if it reached her
Then that note came back to say
You don't have to be alone
I can't believe that's what it said
You don't' have to be alone, just reply
I stood up, I turned her way
But that's as far as I could get
Before she took my hand
And led me outside

CHORUS:

Let's pretend we can't forget about tomorrow
I make believe we're the only ones alive
...
