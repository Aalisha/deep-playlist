She phones home composed, a bit panicked
Hesitates to confess she misses the Atlantic
The gulf streams, the palm trees, the car keys that took you away
She tries to explain
Oh boy

I wanna be fixed
I wanna be broken
I wanna be closed

The love I thought had died is still alive and I hope that you don't mind

Oh I

The place that my heart calls home
When the pale city lights are aglow
And my heart's feeling empty and cold (oh yeah)
Well there's one place I know that I'm dying to be
