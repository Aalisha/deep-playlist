A new sound heard throughout the land
From which the spirits had left ages ago
Sacrifice and honour replaced by betrayal and usurpers
A trail of sweat and blood, a gathering to the pagan
outer worlds

For ages we have wandered
Under the wings of deception
Too long have we been waiting
For the long winter to end
...
