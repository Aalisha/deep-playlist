Mama's in the kitchen
Papa's on the porch
Junior's downstairs in the basement
Passin' on freedom's torch
They're busy fighting
Fillin' all the jails
But sure as the sun do shine in the mornin'--
There's drugs on sale

They're getting wasted
Wasted
They're getting wasted
Wasted in America

Something's gone wrong with the TV generation
