Well, you're the cutest thing that I did ever see
I really love your peaches, want to shake your tree. [cf. The Joker]
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind.

Every time you kiss me you just thrill me so
Don't never, never, never, never let me go.
Oh lovey, lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind.
