Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
But I know you had some dreams that didn't
quite come true
And now I'm not the one, little girl, who's
keeping you

I was either standing in your shadow or
blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make
it right
For you girl-
There's just not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage they can do,
...
