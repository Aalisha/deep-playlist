Please don't go, please don't go away from me
Please don't go, please don't go away from me
I got my breakfast in bed
You're big stuff in Chicago so get in bed
This bedroom's only twelve by ten
You're all talk
(You're all talk)
I got your number for a real good time
Take the phone off the hook and watch you go wild
Say you go nuts and that's what I like
You're all talk,
...
