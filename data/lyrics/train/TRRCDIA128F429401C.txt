Hey you
are you in there
I'm stuck outside you, ooh

we could use
one another
another like you, ooh

you be my passerby
I'll be your one to pass through
screws inside
turn so tight
turning on you
I'm hanging on you, ooh

Me and you
going nowhere
I'm right beside you, ooh

Me and you
going nowhere
I'm right beside you, ooh
