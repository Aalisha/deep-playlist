when jack frost came for christmas
with a brass monkey date
the rail-king and the scarecrow
hopped a florlda freight
and they blew on their paper cups
and stared through the steam
then they drank half a bottle
of ragpicker's dream where

the whiskey keeps following
cold pitchers of beer
me and my associate
like the clientele here get
the onions and the 'taters
rib-eyes on the grill
toothpicks and luckies
and a coffee refill as

the rail-king lay rocking
he was leaving the ground
then he was flying like santa claus
over the town where
he came to the window
of a house by a stream
...
