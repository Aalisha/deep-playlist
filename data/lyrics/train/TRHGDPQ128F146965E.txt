(Mack 10 talking)
Goddamn! New York City!
Skyscrapers and everything!

(Ice Cube)
Back in the day, we used to respect y'all niggas
We used to be down with y'all niggas
All you have for the West Coast, is criticism and disrespect
So I say to you and your city
y'all niggas will never get our respect again
Westside nigga (Keeping it real)
Yeah! (Keeping it real)

(All)
WESTSIIIIIDE!
Is Brooklyn in the house?!? (Check it out)
What about Queens in the house?!? (INGLEWOOOOD!)
Manhattan in the house?!? (South Central)
Long Island in the house?!? (Check it out)
Is the Bronx in the house?!? (Waddup)
Staten Island in the house?!? (Woop woop)
The West Coast is in the house sayin
why you talkin loud?!?
What you talkin bout?!?

(Ice Cube)
Fuck all the critics in the N-Y-C
Who wants to rock the microphone after me?
Think of who you are and who you be
My energy holds it down like the NFC
I'm going thorough thru your borough
wit my Raider jacket and my jheri curl, gangstas rule the world
On the west, nevertheless, W-S
We got the bomb and you niggas got the stress

(Mack 10)
You couldn't have said it no better homeboy
With my automatic toy, I kill and destroy
These buster ass critics from the N-Y-C
Don't they know that I be from the I-N-G
My peeps play for keeps, deep crews pay dues
by murder ones and twos, rip riders and Damus
Choose to stay gangsta, you never ever ran us
We bustin clips like bananas, sportin colored bandanas
