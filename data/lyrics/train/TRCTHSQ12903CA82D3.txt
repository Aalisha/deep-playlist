Some called him a prophet
Some called him a saint
Some couldn't believe their eyes
Or the words he had to say

Some called him crazy
Some thought he was strange
But I have felt his touch
And I'll never be the same

I call him love
I call him mercy
I called him out of my darkness and pain
And he answered my need

I call him love
