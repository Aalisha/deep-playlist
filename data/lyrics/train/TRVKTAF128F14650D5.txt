It's been so long I can't remember when
We didn't care how deep it was, we dived right in
Watching everything around us disappeared
Oh, I've missed you here

And it seems the little things get in the way
We're so caught up in routine from day to day
Sometimes it feels like we're not anchored anywhere
Oh, I've missed you, yeah

So tell me there's nothing in the world
That could ever come between us
Show me you're not afraid tonight
Baby, make me believe

That there's nothing in the world
That could ever steal the moment
From right here and now
Nothing, nothing in the world

Two shadows falling back together now
Baby, we spent too much time just hiding out
