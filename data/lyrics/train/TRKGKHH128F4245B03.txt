Well I'm searchin' for this feelin'
That's crawlin' in my veins
I'm on the inside, i wanna get out
Oh I need that cure, there ain't no doubt

Oh, well it feels so good
Up and down and in and out, let's make this understood
Oh, 'cause I'm comin' on for you now

I got that wicked sensation
That's crawlin' all over me
I got that wicked sensation
You know that's all I ever need
When I get down on my knees
Gotta give in, gotta put it out
