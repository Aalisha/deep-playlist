I keep having these disturbing dreams:
my final days, the end of me.
for some odd reason, i get one last wish,
and every time, i wish for this:
take me fast or take me slow.
i don't really care how i go.
in the daylight or in the dark,
just don't let me die of a broken heart.
the kind of pain that you just can't take,
will send a strong man to his grave.
there's not a pill that can give you a rest,
