He's on the phone, 
and she wants to go home; 
shoes in hand, 
don't make a sound,  
it's time to go.

(Ooh-ooh)
Someday (someday), someday. 

He's on the phone, doesn't want to go home. 
The hotel life 
forget your wife,  
you're on your own.
Academia girl; 
her life's a gas, 
she loves the trash 
inside his world. 
Can't find his way there, 
got the cash, 
feeling flash 
in Leicester Square. 

Yes.
She never meant to call, 
she did anyway, 
and now he's trying to find 
the words to say 
Someday (someday), someday (someday.)
Yes.
