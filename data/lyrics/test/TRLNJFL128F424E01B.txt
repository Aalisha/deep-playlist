Well I know you think the time has come for moving on,
That a love once new is nearly gone.
But darlin' can't you feel a change of wind coming on,
Blowing warm and strong from now on.

From now on, we'll see a brighter day,
From now on, we'll go a better way,
And you'll be glad that you stayed from now on.
