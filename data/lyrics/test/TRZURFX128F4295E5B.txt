His mama said, "Stay away
Away from all the darkness
It'll haunt you...
And everything we've ever prayed
Is the only thing that will ever save you"

But it all started, with that little taste
It helped keep him up later at night
Helped keep the truth come back in sight
And when she left him, it dulled the pain
He'd hide the marks under his socks
The doctor said he was in shock from what he'd seen

His mama said, "It's the last time,
It's the last time we'll be here to save you
Because you've fucked this up again,
And those kids aren't your friends, they use you up"
