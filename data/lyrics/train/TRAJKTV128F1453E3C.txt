Huh, okay, put the kids to bed
Put 'em to bed now
I said put 'em to bed now
Do it, yeah, yeah, it's goin' down
DipSet, bitch, Juelz Santana, ay

Grip to it, kick to it
Fuck that, spit to it
Sorry people, party people
This ain't kids music

Nope, this is violence
(Violence, violence)
This is violence
(Violence)
Violence

The champ is back
(Yup)
This is my anthem track
(Yup)
This wasn't made for to dance
Or for your hands to clap

This that
Gutter, gutter motherfucker
(Ay)
This that
Get your knife, time to gut a motherfucker
(Ay)

They hand you the snub dismantle your mug
A headshot have you looking like you shampoo with blood
The vandalous thugs, the scandalous thugs
That go to your block, piss on the spot where your candle's put up

This ain't no damn push music, or no hammish music
This ain't party time, it's army time ambush music
This that cripple fly, kill a guy, full blown gorilla-fied
Don't go in the club if you can't get your clip inside music

This that half a pound, back 'em down, ask around
Nobody say nuttin' 'cause they know they gon' get gatted down music
That pop and squeeze, lots of screams, guess what
Coppers, we ain't never forgot about Rodney King music

Grip to it, kick to it
Fuck that, spit to it
Sorry people, party people
This ain't kids' music

Nope, this is violence
...
