I'm ripping your posters off the wall
I'm moving the boxes into the hall
I stop when I hear a drumbeat call
Must be a sign, it is time
I need to take myself away
From the pillowed hand on which I stand
And throw me out of the side of a plane
And I'll just see where I land
I will have to pull my heart away
'Cause if I never leave I'll ruin yesterday
...
