A wall of denial - is fallin' down
Wo it's fallin' so hard - down to the ground
Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears
But this wall of denial was just built on fear

We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies
Dressed them amused them pullin' wool over our eyes
Go so far as to love them to keep from letting them go
