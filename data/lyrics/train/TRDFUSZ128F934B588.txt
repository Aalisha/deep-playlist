When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done

Don't let go
Don't let go
To my love

Can I get to your soul
Can you get to my thoughts
Can you promise we won't let go
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
We can make it feel so real

Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm losing control

Cause you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I see you baby
I just don't wanna let go

When you gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done

Don't let go
