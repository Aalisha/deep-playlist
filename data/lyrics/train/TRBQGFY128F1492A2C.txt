Sing yeah
It's a long long time ago
It was a strange story
A girl loved a boy
But here you have to know
When a witch loves
She looses her magic
One cold evenig at home
The boy found her broom
And lies flew away
And then she looked at him
And was filled with magic
She said to him
Whilst regaining her magic

This is witchcraft babe and it is everywhere
In the wood, in the sea and the moonÂ´s got it, yeah
This is witchcraft babe and it is everywhere
Shimmering and glimmering is what I am

And Miss Elliot with that
Really ugly Tweed Jumper
