Please, don't put it into words
'Cause I fear what you're thinking
It's gonna make it hurt
You better not try to make me
Believe in someone new

Faithless, on my way
Defenseless from my heart, won't you be?
Heartless, here with me
Breathless, from this night's misery
This night will start the exile, run

Now, you tell me what it was worth
