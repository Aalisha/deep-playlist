Two Step, Two Step, Two Step
Two Step, Two Step, Two Step

Bright lights, TV screen,
Feels like looking at a magazine.
You, her, on the floor,
Feels like dancing is the way to go.

But if you let her see that Fancy Footwork,
Show her that you're not that shy.
Let her see that Fancy Footwork.
Show her you're that type of guy.
