There ain't no point holding back the tide,
still gonna get ya
'cause every little bird's gotta learn to fly
sooner or later
i don't wanna lose you,
can't always do what you wanna do
there ain't no point holding back the tide,
don't waste your time
'cause everything is out there
and there's no limits out there
we could be reaching out for anything if we try enough

let the daylight in on a better day
it's been too long we've been
living under a raincloud
Daylight in on a better day
it's been too long we've been
...
