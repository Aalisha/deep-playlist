Yeah
Come on, come on

Nothing left to lose
Except you and your baby blues
Microphone check this rhyme
Pancho villa was a friend of mine

I get fucked up holla back y'all
And I kick it like Jackie Chan
With my kung fu style
I'll get rid of you in a while, yeah
Hey hey hey
All the bitches in the back

C'mon c'mon get up get up
(Woah)
I know you know its never forever
C'mon c'mon get up get up
(Woah)
You wanna hear I'm sorry whatever
Now that you gone I'm moving on
You wrecked it all
