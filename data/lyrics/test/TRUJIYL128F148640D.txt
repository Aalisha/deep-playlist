I'm traveling off the cliff just to fall in love with you
I'm serious, I'm serious
And we ain't got no plans on coming back soon, yeah
I'm serious, I'm serious
I got my bags packed just to hit the road with you,? cause
I'm serious, yeah, I'm serious
And when it gets bumpy I'll be rollin' with you,? cause
I'm serious, yeah, hey baby

Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off

Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off
Till them wheels fall off

Oh baby, I'm runnin' on metal plates
Oh baby, I'm never gonna walk away
Even though we rollin' on metal plates
