Infecting the mainframe with all my rage
fear and anger my heartshaped cage
The circuits scream louder as data flows
with every byte the volume grows

Press play just to hear it loud
and then feel it louder
scream out and keep moving on
like a viral process

Just giving me a V.R. place
and kill me every time you want
keep loading shit into my head
it makes me feel like an empty drone
