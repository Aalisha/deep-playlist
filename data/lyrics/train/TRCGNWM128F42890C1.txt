[Verse:]
Got a story to tell you about some things that I've been through but I'm healed oh I'm healed had some ups and some downs leveled to the ground but I'm healed oh I'm healed had to wrestle all night long wondering what went wrong but I'm healed oh I'm healed had some sunshine some rain heartacke and some pain I'm healed oh I'm healed

[Chorus:]
