Moor the houses, lay low all masts and poles
Shear down the trees, anchor your barks
Gather your children and pray that they will be there when dawn breaks
Sound all your warning bells, cry for the lost sailors at sea
They are the first who will know what a storm can be

You will remember me, you will remember me
