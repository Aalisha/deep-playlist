Hard black soil called the Chernozem
Driving uptown with some per diems
Won't somebody check the hem
Falling down this dress again
Sporting hot jeans on the butt again
Got to get home before the mayhem
Leave that fem for another tide
Before we run and hide again

Got a hornbeam growing in the garden
Always climbing the tree is the morphine
Got a view of the love and I'm chillin'
Got a view of the hem of the horizon

Stole the weel off a car called a Porsche
While I was chewing the fat that disturbs me
It's always there because we
We play the game the we are
