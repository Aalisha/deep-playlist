I can't help but follow in spite of going insane
For I know you'll swallow the whole of my pain
I, I'm stepping out of the light to feel what darkness can sow
I stare at the dead red lie... just one glance and I know

All disguised beneath the smile of the temptress, siren, evil child the devil's sweetest whore

'Cause you're feeding the fire within me
'Cause you're making me feel so alive
'Cause it's only the end of the suffering and I'm drowning in this rush

'Cause you're feeding the fire within me
'Cause you're making it real for awhile
...
