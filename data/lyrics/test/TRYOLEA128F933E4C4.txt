I felt this time that we had something
You rolled your eyes like it was nothing new
You only think about you
Put your shades on not to show it
Don't pretend that you don't know it's true
You only think about
If you look good
And girl you should

Welcome to Hollywood
And boy ya better live it up
Before it brings you down
Welcome to Hollywood
Just got a grip on how to get around

I'm so glad I got to you know
Now I know what I'm suppose do
