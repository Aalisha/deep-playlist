Zion liveth and Zion loveth

Tell them about livity I and I posses, Rastaman
Tell them about livity I and I posses
Rastaman want to go to Zion

Partiality is the condition
Affecting wicked decision
How to hate mankind, and.
I've seen them turn against the brother
'Gainst all races?? so selfish-minded

We living down here, so dis ya living is one
Together we can stand, but divided we fall
Hatred nah walk with Jah, wickedness forever crawl
In them Jah find fault, now their back against the wall, wall

If in Mount Zion we're to live
Then to Mount Zion goes my love
If in Mount Zion goes my love
Then to Zion I puts my trust
And all the livity we posses, oh yah that show
This road in Zion paved, into Zion it's gold
