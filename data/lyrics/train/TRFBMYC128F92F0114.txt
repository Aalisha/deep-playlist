You could've been bitter, you could've hated him
You could've talked about the whiskey and the women
He could've done better but you loved him anyhow
Then you taught us all the power of forgiveness

Mama, you were smiling when you could've been crying all night
Oh mama, you made me believe everything was alright
Mama, you never wore your pain too thick
I'd like to thank you for this
