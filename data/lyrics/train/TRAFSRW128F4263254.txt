All my secrets on parade
These emotions couldn't wait
'Cause I tried to be
Someone who wasn't me
Now I only play the fool when I'm alone
When I'm at home

My mind's a mess in many ways
Got to get things into place
And I'm getting close
But nobody knows
When I only play the fool when I'm alone
When I'm at home
...
