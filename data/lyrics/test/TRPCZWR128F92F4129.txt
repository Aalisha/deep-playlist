Don't move, baby don't move
Ah look at you
I just want to take this in
The moonlight dancin' off your skin
Our time, let's take our time
I just want to look in your eyes and catch my breath
'Cause I got a feeling

This could be one of those memories
We're wanna hold on too, cling too, the one we can't forget
Baby this could be our last first kiss, the dawn of forever
What if this was that moment, that chance worth taking
...
