I put a tack on everything,
It lets me know just where I've been,
Call out these chains and get me home,
I'm coming back but will you show.

Hooray Hooray its not over,
we have got all day to recover,
and I'm on a roll so don't you be late,
Too late too late run for cover,
there is not enough left to offer,
there's more to this than acting my age.

I put a price on what you say,
it lets me know that I'm OK,
but I'm a garbage man tonight,
and I just don't believe my eyes,
...
