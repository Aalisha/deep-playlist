Here I was rollin' in the car
I drove down past the park
Spotted a couple
Who wasn't in trouble
And they were doin' no harm
She leans down and kisses him on his lips
To give her love back he rubs her hips
Oh, I could feel it
I felt their passion
Running through my warming veins

So bad I wished that that was me
Make love like they do on TV
I see, all I seem to see
Is you and me

(Repeat verse)

(Chorus:)
How I wished that could be
Baby you and me
To become reality
In the perfect love fantasy
If I had one wish it would be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In the perfect love fantasy

Now I'm not sayin' something's wrong with this relationship
