Behold the movie of the year
Taste like luck but feels clear
March on nails for bitter souls
Until rust becomes rare and cold

Behold the movie of the year
Taste like luck but feels clear
March on nails for bitter souls
Until rust becomes rare and cold

You've made an error in misjudging us
I'd be really be happy, if you'd just ask
Maybe you've been mislead to believe
That we have nothing less than this

Same stories have been played out for ages
I'm ready to be given the chance
For saying our side, our version or choice
Cameras capture numerous nights of romance
