When you touch me
I feel there's nothing you can do to turn me away
And I know that
In the past you've had bad luck so I should help you stay

You're all I ever wanted
You're all I ever needed - it's you
You're all I've ever wanted
And loving you's the right thing to do
And I'll see it through

When I close my eyes
