(Intro/Chorus: Bone Crusher)
These niggaz talkin hardcore ain't no killers
You don't wanna fuck with these Southern Gorillas
Now take these slugs from my Desert Eagle
Y'all niggaz fuckin with the realla to realla
I'ma tell you one more time nigga - get from around me
Tell 'em, hey nigga GET FROM AROUND ME!
Yeah I'ma tell you one more time nigga - get from around me
WHAT?~! Hey nigga GET FROM AROUND ME!

(Bone Crusher)
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh, the tide keep comin nigga
John Blaze for them heffers it don't, get no better
I got, woodgrain and leather that's sharp like cheddar
When I see a fuck nigga, I'll gamble - whatever
Call me BONE CRUSHER nigga, I'm the hardest thing walkin
When I see a fuck nigga, all he do is talkin
Why he wanna rub against me, I really don't know
Youse a bitch, youse a bitch, by the way youse a hoe!
Don't EVER try to stop me, 808 drop-ping
I watch the bass come in and knock ya {?} out your chin
