Woke up in the middle of the night cold sweating
Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

This situation's gotten out of control
With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload
My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go
The more I hide the more
they thrive deep down inside of my soul
Listen

Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice
Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

[Joyo Verlade]
We have a deep passion
We can't keep dwelling on problems

Close relations past friendships don't last
No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator
