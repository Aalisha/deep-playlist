So Future Boy where are you from?
My time machine crashed over yonder
The syphillis is a bitch, but contracting HIV is much worse
Why are you pushing info into me
I have no need for it, I'm from the stars

I thought you'd like to know the scoop
I'm taking babies back with me, yeah
I'm taking them back home
So they can see there's a much better place
I've got a sister with an open mind
And my friends are all junkies
But they're still my friends
As long as they don't use monkeys
We enjoyed the heat of stolen days in the summer of '93
