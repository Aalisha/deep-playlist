If I was a better man
Would fellow men take me to their hearts
If I was a stronger man
Carrying the weight of popular demand
Tell me would that alarm her
I'd never harm her at all

If I was a soldier
Captive arms I'd lay before her
If I was a sailor
Seven oceans I'd sail to her

If I was a wiser man
Would other men reach out and touch me
If I was a kinder man
Dishing up love for a hungry world
Tell me would that appease her
...
