It's in my head. I'm full of doubt.
Trapped in myself I'm singled OUT.
I have taken much more.
Than I can take I don't know what my.
Limits and boundaries are what else to do.
Now that I'm gone damaged and broke worthless
and shamed who can I blame.
Insanity lurks pent up inside.
Answers I seek can be found in my mind.
