Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Yeah, yeah

I don't wanna take your shine
So it's okay if you
Wanna take mine
Take it from me, baby

Extract the soul from human kind
What a shame
Down the line
Nothing left to lie

So many days I might have wasted
Staring at the picture fading
Get the camera off my face now
Time is running out, stop pushing me down

Just incredible, you shock me daily
Unforgettable, now get some help
Can I mention you sent me to your hell?
