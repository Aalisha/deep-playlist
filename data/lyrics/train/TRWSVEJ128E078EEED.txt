I know how to love you
I know how to do it to you
I know how to make you feel like you wanna feel
But I can't lose what I used

I'm qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to
Qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to

Qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to
I'm qualified to satisfy you
Anyway you want me to

Some times you need lovin'
Morning, noon and night
Makes no difference when it is
My darling, it's alright
