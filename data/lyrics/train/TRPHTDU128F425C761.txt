It's a confirmation for your imagination
This type of situation goes on and on
What to do, how to see
When every little thing seems to get in my way

Well I can't breathe
And I wish that you couldn't take your eyes off me
But it's never easy as it seems, is it?
Please, softly before I scream
Breathe, breathe, breathe

Say you adore me
