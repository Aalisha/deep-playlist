What the fuck? Are we playing?
Periodic reverberations of our gaseous medium!
Yes, I like sequences and repetitions...
But where the hell did you come from?
Auditory communication incorporated by...
These danfangled contraptions.
But I hope we aren't talking
About your pointless bitching...
If I had a rocket launcher!
No wait! breathe still! calm down!
This is not what this is about!

Is it capable of being copied, to another individuals memory?
Will they tell it to others?
Is this noise suppose to be a secret?
...
