So called Mr. Rock & Roll
Is dancing on his own again
Talking on his phone again
To someone who tells him that his balance is low
He’s got nowhere to go
He’s on his own again

Rock chick of the century
Is acting like she used to be
Dancing like there’s no one there
Before she ever seemed to care
Now she wouldn’t dare
It’s so rock and roll to be alone

And they’ll meet one day far away
And say, "I wish I was something more"
And they’ll meet one day far away
And say, "I wish I knew you, I wish I knew you before"
