We got a party right here
Bacardi or beer
Whatever is your choice
It's fun for the girls and boys
Tell your girl to come here
It's the Nuts World Premiere
Exclusive don't overdose and abuse it
This music is like ecstasy
I got the recipe, the remedy
Please don't cock block like a referee
Blast off into space
Who's in the place to be?
The world's famous Beatnuts and the Four Forty
Let's go

New York, New York is what the people in the clubs say
Beatnuts they get it packed like the subway
Keep movin' no standin' around
All the ladies put your coats and your bags on the ground
Let's go have a drink baby see what you feel
It's Apollo and tonight we're gonna party for real
C'mon fine woman won't you back that thing up
There's a party in my pants baby pop that thing up

You know and I know and you know and I know
It's Juju and psycho, it's Juju and psycho
And you know and I know and you know and I know
