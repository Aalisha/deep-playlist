Welcome back
Says the voice on the radio
But I never left
I was always right here

In your hand all the colours
You thought were kings
At the turn of a card
Can just disappear

I wish I could comfort you
If love is our defence
It's alright I can comfort you
If you let me I could love you to death

Need to see
