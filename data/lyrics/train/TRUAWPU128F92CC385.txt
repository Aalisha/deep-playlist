I told ya a million times how I Love you.
But honey your old shriveled heart won't let me in.
So I'll just relax here, with this glass of gin,
Headed for the ozone again.

Here we go now...
I'm lost in the ozone again.
I'm lost in the ozone again.
One drink of wine, two drinks of gin...
And I'm lost in the ozone again.
