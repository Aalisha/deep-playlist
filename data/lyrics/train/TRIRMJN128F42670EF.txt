I know the truth about You
And how You feel about me
I know the price that You paid
To hide the secrets I keep
And I know what it means
I know what I must do

I testify, Your love is true
This I know 'cause I've been moved
I testify, Your love is real
This I know 'cause I've been healed

I know the walk that You took
I know the crown that You wore
I know the blows that You felt
...
