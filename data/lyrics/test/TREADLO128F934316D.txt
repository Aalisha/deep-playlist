Oh
Oh

(Kriss Kross)
I missed the bus.(Oh). I missed the bus.
I missed the bus.(Oh). I missed the bus.

(Verse 1)
I went to bed late but I didn't think late would AFFECT ME
Early came around then late wouldn't LET ME
Wake up - WAKE UP - so I can get dressed
I guess my body was mad 'cause I gave it no rest
And when I finally did awake it was a quarter to 8: 00
Jumped in the shower and I know I was late
Stepped out put on my jeans and my uni'
And said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined
But I ran down hill and I RUSHED RUSHED
