I had a hard time lovin'
When love was all about
I went down on Cherry Lane and wow I found out
What many girls are made of
What things they're not afraid of
And what it is to make them shout wow all night long

I've got no regrets
She gave the chance

When I went down, down, down on Cherry Lane
I went down, down, down on Cherry Lane (Cherry Lane)

I knew I had it comin'
