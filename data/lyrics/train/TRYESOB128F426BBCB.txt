I'd cross the desert to be with you.
I miss you,
I miss you.

I heard the rumors they all were true.
I need you,
I need you.

Oooooh...
Next to me,
Next to me.

Oooooh...
Next to me,
Next to me.

I'll take off my make-up,
I'll stop and listen.
I am alive now,
I watch my head spin.

I'll take off my make-up,
I'll stop and listen.
I am alive now,
I watch my head spin.
