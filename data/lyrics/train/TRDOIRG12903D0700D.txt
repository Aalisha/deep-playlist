Ring a ling ling ding dong
Please connect me to prince charming
Ring a ling ling ding dong
Be my hero be my light

Ring a ling ling ding dong
Please connect me to prince charming
Ring a ling ling ding dong
I wan't wait to hold you tight

All fairytales are filled with love and passion
For us to learn about the true romance
But in real life it's so hard to kill the dragon
