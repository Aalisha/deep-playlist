Baby!...Why are you doing this to me?
Sweetheart!...Are those your eyes staring straight back at me?
Angel!...I see your smile everywhere!
Darling!...Stop!

Night falls and I'm running in circles
Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhh

I'm being chased by my
Imagination
Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhh

Tell me I'm forgiven say you'll always be mine
Say that everything is over, tell me I'm fine...
No one deserves to live like this!
Tell me I'm forgiven say you'll always be mine

Say that everything is over, tell me I'm fine...
No one deserves to live like this!
I touch your lips and stare in your eyes
You smile and it makes me fly

You are the reason my heart beats
Tonight it's just you and me...
Night as dark as my thoughts
...
