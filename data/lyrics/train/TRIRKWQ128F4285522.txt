Who walked out when the times got hard
When the truck broke down in the whole front yard
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
Who shot pool all night long
Wound up bettin' on the crack of dawn
That was you darlin', and that was me

And we are fools for each other, me and you
We are lovers, in fact, we've gone crazy out back
Like only fools for each other would do

Now who gave up when the fire burned low
