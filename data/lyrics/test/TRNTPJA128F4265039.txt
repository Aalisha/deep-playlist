Think about the youth
Never knowing what's in store
Never knowing what they're gonna see
Always needing proof
Innocence is hard to keep
Trust is just a faded memory

What do you need to see?
Think about you all the time
Wondering if you're doing fine
I hope that I can keep
A hold of you just one more day
I don't know what I would do without

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Every time you go
I can't help but hate you so
