I went down baby???
Sittin' in the shade with my lady
??? left the bus
So lets not discuss
I never never never liked a girl that much
But she's so fine
Oh momma all the time
I seen the sister in the moon
And now she's in my room
Well, she's my sister and my lover
And my friend and my momma
Well late at night, late at night
