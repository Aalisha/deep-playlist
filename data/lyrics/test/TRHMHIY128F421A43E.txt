Been trying all night
To make you listen
Say you know me now
I don't know myself
A fight an hour
The lust of power
I won't play the part
Of deeply scarred

Cause I don't think I will be back again
Your words don't bring content
You've said them so blindly as I have bled
And despise all that you've said

I've got a new thing
I've got a new thing
...
