J. Fuller / M. Jones / L. Hodges - Irving Music Inc. - BMI

I ain't got time for chasin' rainbows,
Sitting holding hands in picture shows.
I'm a man, a man of action,
Won't you let your lips give out some satisfaction.
Got a habit of teasin' me,
Sendin' me off instead of pleasin' me.

Bustin' up, or bustin' out, c'mon baby take a choice.
We're either bustin' up, or bustin' out, whatever makes your heart rejoice.
