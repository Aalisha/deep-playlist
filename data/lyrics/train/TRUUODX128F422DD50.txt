International caller on my line
Tomorrow's just another distance
Put in a call to a friend of mine
Just to say hello
But What if there were angels
Oh, sometimes i swear that I can see them there
Making jokes and wearing black
And speaking English just like me
Bright and kind and young and good
So come on
You I know that we could still be that way
...
