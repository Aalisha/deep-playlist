I want to get to know you better
Seems like before belonged together
You rock my body, and I wonder
Fool foster, love to care

Breath to the rhythm as I stare at the way you move
Like two friends head to something bright
I like that groove, boy, you got that groove
Rocking in the streets to this funky beat

This funky beat
Funky little beat
Just you and me
Funky little beat
Rocking in the streets to this funky beat
That beat
Funky little beat
This funky beat
Funky little beat
Just you and me
Funky little beat
Rocking in the streets
