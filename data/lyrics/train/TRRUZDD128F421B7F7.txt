Blessed with thunder
Crowned with rain
Fuelled with fire
As I spit out the flames
I bring you earthquake
I can be blazing
The demon in my soul is aching
To break free
It's the devil in me

Young forever
In my dreams I can never die
Somebody stop the time wheel
Freeze the night sky
So I can remodel history
Before I wake up the world

Search the answer on this stone of pain
