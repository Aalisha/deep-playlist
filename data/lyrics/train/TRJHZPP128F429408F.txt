Underneath my actions
Was hateful intent
Should I have showed that I could be fair
I stood there unrepentant
And remain
Showing those signs of wanting to care

Time on this is broken
To give it more we'll be drifting
But to win

Don't lose control of this misery
Why pacify just punish me
Seperate from this pain up on me
Don't let me take this liberty
I lack the will to make it right
I only know how to start a fight
Giving in to my every need
Only breathe the selfish me
...
