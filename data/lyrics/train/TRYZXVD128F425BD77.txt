She's got it
She's got it
She's got it
She's got it

Who's that girl
Who's that girl yeah
Who's that girl
Who's that lovely girl in the corner
She's so fine
Oh how I wish that she was mine
I want to hold her
To make her mine
Whose that lovely girl in the corner
She dance and sings
She looks like from a movie scene
Maybe a hero is in her dreams
Who's that girl
Who's that girl yeah
Who's that girl
Who's that lovely girl in the corner
She's so fine
She hypnotized me with desire
