As she walks home tonight
To her house and ignores the stars
She knows there's no-one waiting

Tomorrow isn't clear enough
To give her strength or make her want
To wake and walk in the morning.

And there's hope that I've taken
And there's drugs to make it painless
And men, we're quick as rainbows,
Always rare to keep her thirsty
And I've gone, like she'd always known.
