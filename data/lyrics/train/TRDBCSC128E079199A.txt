I should be knocking on the door of the pearly gates 
Why keep a poor man alive in a job he hates 
I've heard that good things will come to he who waits 
I should be riding on a float in the hit parade 
Instead of sitting on the curb behind the barricade 
Another verse in the doormat serenade 
[Chorus] 
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top) 
Won't you put me on top, or change the odds 
Won't you put me on top (oooh, put me on top) 
Or at least put some hope in the bottom of the box 
...
