VERSE 1
Music for a future age
Don't be square, be there
All good clean fun, whatever that means
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople
Get off your knees
And hear the insect prayer

The brain will suffer
So ride hard, ride clean
How reputations scare
And love goes to war, whatever that means
Antmusic for sexpeople
Sexmusic for antpeople
Get off your knees
And hear the insect prayer

Dirk wears white socks
