(Come down)

Hey kid, I'm talkin' to you
What am I supposed to do
You know that you're something special
That's something you already knew

Hey kid, got something to say
But you won't listen anyway
I am only tryin' to help you
But you get further every day

We think your head is getting
Bigger and bigger and bigger

Hey kid, some good advice
To bring your britches down to size
Some modesty would suit you better
So why don't you give it a try

Hey kid ego
With your head above the clouds
Hey kid ego
Whoa, oh, Come down

Hey kid, you're Mr. IT
