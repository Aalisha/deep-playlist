Have we found a sign of life
to kill us when we're done?
We seem to die much quicker
when at port for way too long
I haven't seen the reasons for
This burial unsung
We seem to die much quicker
when at port for way too long

So pack up your bags boys
There's something we must do
From Lindburg to Newark we'll look to the sky
Do you think they will want us?
And how will we get there?
