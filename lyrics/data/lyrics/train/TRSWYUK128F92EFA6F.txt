Forget about it
I'm admittin' I was wrong
And I'll just take what's mine
And walk right out the door

Forget about it
I'll split and I'll be gone
And you'll have memories
You'll find hard to ignore
'Cause after all
I see you sometime
Maybe when I can't recall
How you drove me crazier

Forget about it
When forever's over
I won't remember how much
I loved you anymore
