There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my love can find your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who choose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me
Oh my baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away from me
...
