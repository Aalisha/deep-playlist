Dear Ol' Dirty Bastard, no, no
Dear, Baby Jesus, no that's not it
Dear Dirt McGirt, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Look man, it's this girl that I really like, man

And, I want to get her to notice me
So, I just wanted some advice on
What should I do to like, get her to come my way?
Write back soon, your biggest fan, Rhymefest

Why do you build me up buttercup?
Baby, just to let me down, mess me around
And then worst of all, you never call, baby
When you say you will but I love you still

I need you more than anyone, darlin'
You know that I have from the start
Build me up, buttercup, don't break my heart

Look, c'mon, have you ever met a girl, come into your world
[Incomprehensible], put your brain on sterile
Activate and leave stains like curls
Sophisticate and make you feel so world

There it is so liberated
Ridin' in a sports car so ventilated
Joggin' in a sports bra so titillated
Chick so cool but not refrigerated

Look, McGirt, I don't wanna trouble ya
But this chick on my block, I'm in love with her
I wanna get up in her Bush like Dubya
Tryin' to get up in her Bush like Dubya
