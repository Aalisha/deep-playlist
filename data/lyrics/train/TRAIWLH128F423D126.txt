Goodbye to the make-believe
Goodbye to the foundry
Long have you pumped oxygen
Into everything around me
If you saw the factory
You would know exactly
Time machines, fringe tame freeze
Which one can we reprieve?
We don't see it anymore
Not in this life, maybe yours

We'll not come home
We'll not touch ground
Take me to my favorite spot
And promise me they're still around
What's blown up, must come down
It seems a waste to grow so great
...
