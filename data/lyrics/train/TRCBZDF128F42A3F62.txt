When all the colors begin to fade
And the imitations turn to grey
When the Iron Man begins to rust
And the Holy Water turns to dust
What will be your savior now
Dragon or machine
Who will wear the crown of thorns
In Mother Nature's dream
Who's the one
Who claimed my liberty
Robbed my soul of freedom
How long must I put up with the
Unholy sound of your gun
Tell me, brother
When believers start to lose the faith
And the naked army falls from grace
When all extremes return to one
...
