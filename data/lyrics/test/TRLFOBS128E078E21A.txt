He just wanted us to call him Captain Da.
He said you can call me Da-da, whatever that meant.

Out of gas, still burning.

Hey there... who me? Just your friendly neighborhood speed demon.

I'm out to Nascar in a fast car to the last car
'Til there ain't no cars left
Enough cars go by with enough dust flying around
To make you cry back down and choke half-near to death
I'm up here on your left.

Sorry about that.

See like you I push the bucket
