Girl, don't you know
That you really got me gone
Blow my mind all the time
And I think about you, love

They got nothing on you, baby
Yes, my baby, you're my baby
They got nothing on you, baby
Yes, my baby, you're my baby

Are you really here now?
Tell me where you come from, girl?
Shawty, you can't be for real
You must be an angel sent from heaven
Just for me, teach me how to love for real

Those other girls
They don't mean nothing
'Cause of how you make me feel, yeah

Girl, don't you know
That you really got me gone
Blow my mind all the time
And I think about you, love
