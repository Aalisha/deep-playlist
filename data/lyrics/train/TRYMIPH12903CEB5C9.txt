(I'm not a juvenile delinquent)

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
No, no, no, I'm not a juvenile delinquent

Do the thing that's right
You do nothing wrong
Life will be so nice
Be in paradise
I know. . .ow. . .ow . . .ow
because I'm not a juvenile delinquent

So listen boys and girls
You need not be cool
Life is what you make it
It all depends on you
I know. . .ow. . .ow. . .ow
