There's somebody waiting alone in the street
For someone to walk up and greet
Here you are all alone in the city
Where's the one that you took to your side
Lonely faces will stare through your eyes in the night

And they'll say
Woman, sweet woman, please come home with me
You're shining and willing and free
But your love, it's a common occurence
Not like love that I feel in my heart
...
