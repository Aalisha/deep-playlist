They made something
They played something
Brand new a baby blue machine
Brass tacks, duct tape
For the great escape
Packed in there like sardines

Back and forth
East, south, west, north
Shred the atlas burn the map
Often lost and paths criss-crossed
Wake me up I need a nap

1, 2 what's in the stew
3, 4 no one's really sure
5, 6 what's in the mix
7, 8 this stuff tastes

They did something
Which meant something
And that got them some attention
Eyes wide
