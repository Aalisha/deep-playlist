Well she said jealousy is something that distracts you
I said it's hard to focus with your fingers in his belt loops
Then there was that dream about you naked in the bathroom
Telephone just rang, I heard you say I'll call you back soon

He's been waiting in the ally for an hour
She's been powdering her nose in the shower
I've been trying to figure out where it went sour
But I think the ringing in my ears is getting louder

Hold out your hand, and take it easy
I already know what's been going on
I knew it all along
So just, take it, easy
You're acting suprised and I just roll my eyes
It's gonna be alright
Alright
