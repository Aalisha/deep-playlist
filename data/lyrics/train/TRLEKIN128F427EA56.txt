Baby I'm not complainin' but I think I must attest
U just aint the devil I used 2 know, slippin out that tight blue
dress
Now I know I aint no little boy but I still got lots of juice
I'm still down with your lip smackin ways & little wild abuse

Chorus:
I'd rather die than be without u
No real surprise, what I wouldn't do
Turn out the lights it's time again
