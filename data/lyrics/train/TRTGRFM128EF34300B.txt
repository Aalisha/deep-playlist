I walk ahead alone
you tell me not to go so fast
but i am slower than you think
i am as careful as your touch
when you want me to relax
i am as serious as your looks
when you want me to believe

i sneak around the corner
with a blueprint of my lover
with a blueprint of my life
i would better run for cover

i sneak around the corner
with a blueprint my lover
with a blueprint of my life
