(Hyah, hyah) 

Mule train! (Hyah, hyah) 
Mule train!
Clippety cloppin' over hill and plain
Seems as how they never stop, clippety clop, clippety clop
Clippety, clippety, clippety, clippety, clippety cloppin' along

There's a plug o'chaw tobacky for a rancher in Corona
A ghee-tar for a cowboy 'way out in Arizona
A dress of calico for a pretty Navajo
Get along, mule! , get along
...
