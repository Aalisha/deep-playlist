Tonight
written by Babyface

Verse 1
Listen baby,
Girl I can't help myself
I don't want nobody else
Girl can't you see
I was meant for you
You were meant for me

Verse 2
Listen baby,
And it's clear as a bell
You love me I can tell
So girl what's up
You can not deny we're falling
Falling in love

Chorus
Ooh girl
(Girl tonight, tonight)
I got a feeling
(Tonight, tonight)
Tonight I'm gon' be yours and yours alone
(You know)
Yours alone
