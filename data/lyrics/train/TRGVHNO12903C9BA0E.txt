(God damnit lord, where have you been?)
You heard me praying for love then you came running
(God damnit lord, I'm fading out... again...)
Start tuning in I need attention
(God damnit lord, I got a taste for you blood)
I've been fasting for weeks, half-assed communion
(God damnit lord, god damn)
Somehow it's hard to believe that you put me through this to somehow better me

Don't curse the sky
With words like daggers
The clouds might collapse
Still feeling the weight of the Gods
And no legs to move, no legs to move

In tune with my senses
I was blessed with the smell of defeat
I travel with a lonely soul
Trapped in a broken body

Scavenger, where does the vulture sleep?
(And when you speak) And when you speak to him
Will you bring him to me, bring him to me
Scavenger, bring forth the jackals teeth
