Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin’, stuntin’ is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get, get like me)
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get like me)

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin’, stuntin’ is a habit
Put it in the air
Stuntin’, stuntin’ is a habit
Put it in the air

Stuntin’, stuntin’ is a habit
Put it in the air
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin’, stuntin’ is a habit

I got a chip in my engine, 26 inch rims
Got fade away money, ***** I'm ballin’ out the gym
Got my old school pumpin’, hit wheel on recline
If you think a ***** broke, you out yo' monkey *** mind

Diamonds on my pinky, hand on the pine
Touch and die, yo mama do the second line
Screens fallin’ from the sky, fallin’ in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin’ down, ***** what

Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got g's on my ***, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can go on and pass the mike, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck

Still screamin’ out mayne, ***** in my hand
Southside so throwed, throwed in the game
Big face on my chain, 84's on the frame
Big bodies comin’ down, hoggin’ up both lanes

Stuntin’, stuntin’ is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get, get like me)
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get like me)
