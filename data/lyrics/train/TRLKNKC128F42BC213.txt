In the backseat of a parked car
By the liquor store where the streetlight
Keep you company 'til the next night

In the same town, there's the same scar

Keep her company 'til the next night

Oh! Gravity.
Why can't we seem to keep it together?
Sons of my enemies,
Why can't we seem to keep it together?
