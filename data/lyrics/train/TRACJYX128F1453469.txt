It started at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere
Sitting beside me was a man with no hair
From the look on his face and the size of his toes
He comes from a place that nobody knows

I said or maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
Letting this big-toed bald man sitting here tell me about the sky
Maybe I'm hallucinating, hyperventilating
If you asked me now then I couldn't tell you why

I've been sitting here too long by a man from Milwaukee
He's been talking too long on his yellow walkie-talkie
He's been talking to Mars but I think he's wacky
He says they'll come get him, come get him someday
