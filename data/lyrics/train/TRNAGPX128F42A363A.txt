Shine on
Shine among the stars
Heaven sent an angel
The heaven where you are

Shine on
Brighten up the sky
Tell the world I'm coming
I'll follow you up high

Lost on the ocean
Across the raging sea
An angel came descending
An angel sent for me

Silencing the waters
He kept the night at bay
But only moments later
The Savior's gone away

Shine on
Shine among the stars
Heaven sent an angel
The heaven where you are

Shine on
Brighten up the sky
Tell the world I'm coming
I'll follow you up high

Late in the evening
