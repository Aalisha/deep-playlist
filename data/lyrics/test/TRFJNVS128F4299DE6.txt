Snow falls on New York
And the lights all go out
All the music suddenly stops
Now there isn't a single sound
We are no longer rushing around
We stop to smell the air
Take a breath and close our eyes
For a moment if we dare

She pulls us in
And wraps us in her chill
She holds us close
And now we can be still
We're okay here
We'll stay here
For a little longer
We're okay here
We'll stay here
...
