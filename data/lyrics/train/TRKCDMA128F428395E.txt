I can't fall down on my knees
And apologize to you
but that ain't my style

I remember how me met
it was on the train
How could i forget.
you smiled when you looked at me
The soft of your lips that captured me
the whole ride down
we kept our eyes on each other
and then me sat, down together
you gave me your number
said 'give me a call'
I thought i wouldn't call at all...
but here we are
fell in love
like hand to glove
pure bliss from above
now all we seem to do is fuss and fight
we never seem to get it right.
see there's too much fire so much desire
So i took a little pill to take me higher
I'm sorry if i hurt you when i ran astray
I guess i got caught in the day- heyey

I can't fall down on my knees
and apologize to you
it not in my style

I can't fall down on my knees
and apologize to you
it not in my style

I remember the night
