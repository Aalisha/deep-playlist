Spirit forgive me for I had sinned
Oceans and deserts, lost souls in the wind
Time rolls on like a cold winter's night
To hang from the cross, the child must died

Fire in the valley a suicide
Child in the alley a suicide

No food on the table, with war on their head
The mass graved sinners, the no name dead
Breath of life whispers past your soul
A cavalry blue sinner, as black as coal
...
