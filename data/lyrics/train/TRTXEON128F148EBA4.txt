Beaster music
Okay, young Jibbs
The Beaster

If the party start jumping
And the beat start knocking
And the cuties on the dance floor
Out there popping

Go gurl, go gurl, go gurl
Go on get your money up

The way ya boy flip, makes you say the game over
Sales ice cold, make music called cola
And I ain? t even did commercials for Coca Cola
Start biting on the shock, watch what tough sold her

G, and they wonder why J.I. bragging
I done spit so much fire they should call me dragon
But not like Sisqo, plus I got butter like crisqo
So I copped the iced out crystal

Man, they say my mouth piece is lethal
...
