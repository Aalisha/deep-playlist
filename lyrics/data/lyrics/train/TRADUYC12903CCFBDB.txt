Every place that we ever knew
Just a time we held on... to
Every space that we ever made
Just a piece of ourselves we... saved

Every light that we ever held
Just a fire from a dark, dark... spell
Every love that we ever crave
Just a thing to be kept and... caged

(And sometimes)
Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes)
Like the sea takes the land from under my feet
(And sometimes)
Ooh, you take it all
(And sometimes)
Like the see takes the land from under my feet

Every dream that we ever ride
Just a place for our souls to... hide
Every fear that we ever chase
...
