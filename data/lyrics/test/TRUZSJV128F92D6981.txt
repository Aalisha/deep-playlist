They're jinglin', baby
Go 'head, baby
They're jinglin', baby
Go 'head, baby
They're jinglin', baby
Go 'head, baby
They're jinglin', baby
Go 'head, baby

Uncle L, Future of the Funk Records, I recorded minus all the junk
People spread gossip and believe what they must
But I slam dunk and make 'em bite the dust
A minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed
And put him in a bucket like it's chicken feed
Check out the pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice
And I'ma dust you off and dust you off twice

You never heard this so observant all hysterical fan
Natics of the Asiatic Miracle Man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm Real
Another brother's fan? Forget how you feel
He's so so, I got the instinct, they call me Deputy Dog
Now put your booty in the clink
You dance to the Marty Mars remix single love
Let me see your earrings jingle love

They're jinglin', baby
Go 'head, baby
They're jinglin', baby
Go 'head, baby
They're jinglin', baby
Go 'head, baby
They're jinglin', baby
Go 'head, baby

I chopped you, chewed you, baked you and stewed you
That stopped you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you
No good niggaboo tryin' to base
How we livin' Holmes? Get out my face
I'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall
I rise, suprise, and I advise you all
to stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt
My skill'll get ill, I turn the mother out

I'm top notch, you're playin hop-scotch
Now I'ma do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really try to go for yours
