Yo! Are you ready for some air ball throwin'
Free throw blowin, no look where I'm goin'
Free style flowin'? You are in my house, baby

Well, it's tip off time and I'm off the tip
Walkin' to the bench and I sit, bite my lip
Bustin' out rhymes, standin' in line
'Cause it's garbage time

'Cause I'm calm, I'm cool
And I collected eighteen shots that got rejected
I'm not Corey Feldman, I'm not Corey Haim
I got a license to drive but I ain't got game

Jimmy, what do you say?
You can't play basketball
Jimmy, what do you say?
You can't play basketball

Wear my socks high 'cause it makes me feel cool
I don't know how to dribble, but I know how to drool
People always say that I'm a basketball fool
