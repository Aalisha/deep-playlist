When you hold me close, honey
You're the most, baby, you set my soul on fire
Ever since I met you, honey, I had to get you
You have been my one desire

How could I help, but love you with a love so true?
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part, it wouldn't be your fault
Yeah, it would be all mine
