You're solid, yeah
Like a rush that I don't wanna stop

Saw the signs in your eyes
What was up wasn't right
And none of us was innocent
Baby, still we played our games
Didn't win
Left the mess we were in
On uneven ground
Lost what we found

I had to put away my pride
To find a way that I could love you more
I couldn't keep away from you
Then you walk back in my life
And all at once we were just like before
No one does what you can do

You're solid, yeah
Like a rush that I don't wanna stop
Boy, your love goes on and on
You're solid, yeah
Just when I thought that our thrill was gone
You were solid than a rock
