Speak, speak of freedom
Sing of amber, waves of grain

With every line written and all I have given
Music's been nothing more than a self-made prison
I've taken inmate losses at the hands of this one
My pen's been the poison to family and friendships

Now is time to mend ***, time to bring closure to
The clear conscience of Pusha is long overdue
Thinking to myself what can I be owing you
They only tell you great when they reminiscing over you

Before I trouble T-boy, it's just a D-boy
Let me play the role of a common on his B-boy
Speaking my truth in rhyme no matter how bland it is
A heavy heart lighting that's just what my ransom is

All apologies, I bear the cross I wear the blame
We in the same group but I don't share my brother's pain
Not to confuse our sentiments are all the same
I just don't feel nothing, I'm numb by the will to gain

Same thing brought tears to innocence
I turned away and didn't even flinch, yeah
The music drove me crazy looked up and lost the first ***
I ever wanted to have my babies
