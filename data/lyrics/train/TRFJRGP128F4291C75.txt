Ooh yeah, you know
You couldn't cause me any harm
Although, at times, I may get startled
I'm not alarmed

I can see your eyes
I know when they're telling me untruths
I can feel the heart
Especially when it's on the roof of my mouth

There's no right or wrong, this isn't a test
And I won't lose my experience
I won't try to put it aside
But it's alright
