You're being coy with me?
You were timorous and got me in the palm of your hand
I'm just an idiot wrecking my way to you
But I still get to be your man

Out of my mind
There never was a method to my madness, it's true
But I'm out of my mind for you

What drives a man to madness?
What makes a man come unglued?
What liberates the slaves of sadness?
It must be someone like you
