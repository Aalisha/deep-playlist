How far will you go for me till you break
I know you will leave me alone again
And now you want me to be everything to you
but I need something more than this

Inside of me
All my life I've waited for you to find me
Taken from me and now I'll never know
just how it feels to need you

How far will you go for me till you break
I know you will leave me alone again
And now you want me to be everything to you
...
