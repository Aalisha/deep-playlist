Cruisin', lookin' for my gal
I'm cruisin', goin' don't know where
I'm cruisin', lookin' for my gal
I'm cruisin' for a bruisin'
That man with her is gonna get
Cruisin', got to find my gal
I'm cruisin', goin' here and there
I'm cruisin', got to find my gal
I'm cruisin' for a fight
That man with her will have tonight. (Cruise!)
