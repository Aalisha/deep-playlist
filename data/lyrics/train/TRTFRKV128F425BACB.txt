We don't wanna say goodbye
We don't wanna feel that empty
But it's time to face the dawn
Head on

Then there's something in the wind
When the days go getting shorter
And the nights run cold and clear
Down here

Taking each new day to give
What we need to do our part
We'll keep learning how to live
With a lifelong broken heart

And we never will forget
It's a privilege to remember
...
