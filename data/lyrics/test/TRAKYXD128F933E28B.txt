Just try and give me one good reason
Why I should care at all right now
I've grown weary from your treasons
I think I'm gonna take my bow
I think it is a great injustice
The way that you've been treating me
All this time it has been so clear
But I've been far to blind to see

That this is killing me
And we can't make it
No matter how hard we try
Here I set with face in hands
I've wanted this for so long
And it's all over now
I think it's time that I said goodbye

It's now quite obvious that we're doomed
...
