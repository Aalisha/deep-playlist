Go ahead and laugh at me
Try to be the man you want to be.
Baby it's not hard to see what's going on.
Well maybe we should celebrate
drink champagne.
Why should we wait.
Why don't we ask some friends around.
They can help us play this game we've found.
Hey let's bring everybody down.
Will we ever be ready for what we're heading for.
