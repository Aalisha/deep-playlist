Shake that ass girl!

Fogging up my glasses,
Starin' at your asses,
Bat those long eyelashes,

You dance so nasty!

The room comes alive,
When you all arrive,
Boys and girls mesmerized.

You look so good!
You look so good!

Big hair, nice rack, high heels, sweet ass,
Boy, you're such a pretty lady,
Fake nails, red lips, shaking those hips,
Boy you're such a pretty lady!
