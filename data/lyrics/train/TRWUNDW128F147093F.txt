My radio, believe me, I like it loud
I'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd
Walkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat
While my JVC vibrates the concrete
I'm sorry if you can't understand
But I need a radio inside my hand
Don't mean to offend other citizens
But I kick my volume way past 10

My story is rough, my neighborhood is tough
But I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush
My name is Cool J, I devastate the show
But I couldn't survive without my radio
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass
I keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face
My radio's bad from the boulevard
I'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd

Just stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme
Get fresh batteries if it won't rewind
'Cause I play everyday, even on the subway
I would a got a summons but I ran away
I'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go
But I know I can't live without my radio

Suckas on my jock when I walk down the block
I really don't care if you're jealous or not
'Cause I make the songs, you sing along
And your radio's def when my record's on
So get off the wall, become involved
All your radio problems have now been solved
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond
And my radio's loud like a fire alarm
