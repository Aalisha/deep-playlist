I'm walkin'
But I'm going nowhere at all
I'm 'bout to head any place in the world
But the place that I am

I'm talkin'

But baby, you don't understand
Na na na na na na na na na

Bad times, I can't take 'em
Good times, got to make 'em
Got to find 'em, got to taste 'em
Hey, and I do, I say I do
Mama I do

Two bit manchild I was
Born for nothin' mostly
