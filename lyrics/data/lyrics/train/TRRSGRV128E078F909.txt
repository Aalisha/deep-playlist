The earth is alone
And I give thanks for the fullness
Within the firmaments
Is golden days and blossoming nights
His gently hands Made I I-man, son of him
Life was divided and sweet harmony come in
Women & children

Are We A Warrior? 
Are We A Warrior? 
Are We A Warrior? 

Oh Cupiid. You stupid
Let not you arrow from your bow LORD

FEET is the mountains, so silent. 
And filled Fountains of waters, for all of his loving creatures.
