Make me a deal
And make it good for me
I won't get full of myself
'Cause I cant afford to be
This is small town music
This is big town music
He's ahead of his time, you know
But he can't use it
If only he could prove it

Well, tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
Oh, and tomorrow's just a song away, a song away, a song away
It's just a song away

Hey!

See what your man has done to the world
See what the world has done to your man
You know I'm leaving you
You don't need me
Lovin' you wasn't
Always so easy

This is believe me music
