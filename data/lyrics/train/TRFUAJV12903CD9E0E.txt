Old man rhythm is in my shoes
no use t'sittin' and a'singin' the blues
so be my guest, you got nothin' to lose
won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise?
Oo-ee, oo-ee baby
oo-ee, oo-ee baby
oo-ee, oo-ee baby
won't ya let me take you on a sea cruise?
Feel like jumpin' baby won't ya join me please
i don't like beggin' but i'm on bended knee
I got to get t'rockin get my hat off the rack
i got to boogie woogie like a knife in the back
so be my guest, you got nothin' to lose
