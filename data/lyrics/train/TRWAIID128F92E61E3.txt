Sometimes I like it when you stay
Sometimes I like it when you go away
Sometimes I like it when you check me out
It's ready or not you send me on my way
I want to ask you on a date
Each and ever other night and day
I want to ask you how you scream and bleed its all in between
You send me on my way each waking day cuz
