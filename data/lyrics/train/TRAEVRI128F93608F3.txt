Phil collins - Welcome (brother bear OST)

There is nothing complicated
about the way we live
we are here for each other, happy to give
proud of who we are
humble beneath the stars

we've everything we need
the moon, the sun
there is more than enough here for everyone
all we have we share
and all of us we care

so come on
welcome to our family time
welcome to our brotherly time
we're happy for given an taken to the friends we're makin'
there is nothing we won't do

welcome to our family time
