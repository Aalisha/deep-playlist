Bitter pill to swallow
Slidin' down my throat
Bitter pill to swallow
How it makes me choke
How the hell am I gonna find
Happiness and peace of mind
When I'm losin' all the time?
Yes... bitter

Don't you ever call me
I don't wanna see your face
Don't you dare to call me
Don't darken up this place
What the hell d'ya expect from me?
Emptiness and misery
Took it all away ya see
Yes... bitter

Ooh it means nothin' to me
Ooh you mean nothin' to me
...
