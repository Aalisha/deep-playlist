Marilyn Monroe didn't marry Henry Miller (x4)

But if she did
He'd a taken her to Paris
And if she did
She'd have smoked a lot of opium
And if she did
She'd have dyed her hair blue
And if she did
She might be alive

Oh-ohh Henry Miller
Oh-ohh Marilyn Monroe
Oh-ohh Henry Miller
Oh-ohh Marilyn Monroe

Marilyn Monroe didn't marry Henry Miller
She lived outside the Tropic of Capricorn
