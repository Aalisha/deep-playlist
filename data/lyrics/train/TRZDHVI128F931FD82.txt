It was late last night before she hit me up
And baby, don't you know nothing good happens after midnight?
You see the night before I couldn't keep my hands off her
Yeah I wanted to drink her up

Her body burned like a fire and I knew
I knew I couldn't take anymore from her

I'm burn, burn, burnin', yeah my stomach's turning
My heart's giving into my eyes
I'm stare, stare, starin' at the skin she's sharing
My heart's giving into my eyes
But now it's too late
For me it's too late
I'm burn, burn, burnin', yeah my heart's giving into my eyes

She stood 5'4
