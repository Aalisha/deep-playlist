Day to day
Your eyes are cold
Living turned to rot
Make your way through everything
With never time to stop

And with the way
You're looking everyday
You know that
Things are gonna get worse
And the thoughts
That lead to everything
Are the only way you know to cope

But, but
You've got to rise
Got to rise
To the top
To the top
You've got to rise
Got to rise
To the top
To the top
...
