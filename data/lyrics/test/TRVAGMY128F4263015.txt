Waltzing round the room tonight
In someone else's clothes
You're always coming out of things
Smelling like a rose

You hang your head and your heart is filled
With so much misery
You'd be happy as you could be
If you belonged to me

You say, "Let's go to the rodeo
And see some cowboy fall"
Sometimes it seems to me you've
Got no sympathy at all
