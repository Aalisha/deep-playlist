You are a saint i like to tell you how i'm feeling
You do the same and a part of it's appealing
make or break do you think that you're healing
make a little hole and climb out through the ceiling.

I can not believe you ran away
I can not believe you ran away
today it's not your day
so don't get caught up in all of this mess
you never felt you were part of the rest
just restring like you never thought a thing
it was always in your mind.
your mind.

Free to be stolen by the girls in magazines
they looked so pretty nearly lost it in my teens
but i told them twice
