Here you are
Recorded in stained glass
The devil from the mountains

Born of dragons
Fearsome beasts of legends
Awaken soldier of ancient times
Guardian of all that is known
Your reign has been overthrown

Here you are
Descendant of the fallen star
Dragon iconography

The circle is broken
The bridges are burned
The land is on fire
The dead has returned
For centuries the tales has been told
Through ages your fires grew cold
