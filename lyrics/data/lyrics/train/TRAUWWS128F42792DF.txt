I can't sleep - I can't eat - I can't leave till I have my peace
No more fights - no more wars - No more deals to settle our scores
I won't hide - I won't go - become someone you used to know
Cos there's a little bit of me - in a little of you
Don't deny what you know is true

Jealousy - look what it's done to you - look what it's done to me - Jealousy
