A famous middle-aged rock'n'roller called me last week to thank me
for speaking out against the war, only to tell me he could not speak
himself because he fears repercussions... If you oppose this
administration, there can and will be ramifications

Watch yourself
Someone's watching
Watching you
Big brother
Will discover
Just what you do

Someone's watching
Someone's listening
Watch yourself
Someone's watching
Someone's listening
Watch yourself
Someone wants information
Watch yourself
Someone wants your deportation
Watch yourself
