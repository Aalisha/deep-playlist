You gave him some good years now you'd like them back
Mistakes become clearer after the fact
Now when you pick up the pieces You can't make them fit
Don't waste all your time trying to make sense of it.
Refrain:

Just hurry back to the land of the living
Things have changed since you've been gone
The world is turning in the land of the living
