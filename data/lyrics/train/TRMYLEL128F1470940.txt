He man, I've seen ya, think ya rockin' it on the floor...
You look like a moron! who let you in the door?
To put the question bluntly: maybe your feet's deformed.
They should slap you in the teeth when you put your dancing shoes on.
You can't dance!

Why don't you just nail your feet to the floor?
Homeboy, what's the use?
Anytime you wanna step aside a party,
First think of an excuse.
You dance like a fat old lady
Not sayin' that fat old ladies ain't nice,
But every time you try to get one move right.
The old lady then did it twice.
You can't dance!

You've been a dancing disco disaster,
The worst I ever saw.
They should dropkick you on the neck
