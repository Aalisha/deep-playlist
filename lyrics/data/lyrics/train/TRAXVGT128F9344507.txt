Tension, tension, tension, you like it? 
You are ugly more than ever 
You argue for absolutely nothing 
You're "right" on all the dumb subjects 

Fast or slow? Left or right? 
Grey or black? Fuck you all! 
Close-minded and fucking dumb 
I hate your smile, I want you gone 

Fuck your life of the party 
I drink out of boredom 
I get my best ideas
