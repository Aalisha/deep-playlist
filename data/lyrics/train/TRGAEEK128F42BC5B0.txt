Call it education it was somewhere in between
You gave me some sound advice but I wasn't listening
After we had capsized I couldn't tell you how you'd fall
Well, I'm not sure if I'd laid to rest on the ceiling or the wall

Not quite conversation it was somewhere in between
You said everything is taught and I listened patiently
All this dog and pony still monkeys the whole time
We could not help from flinging shit in our modern suits and ties

Our instincts, they were cringing about how we lived our lives
It didn't seem we'd lived enough to even get to die
All these dense distractions so beautifully complex
