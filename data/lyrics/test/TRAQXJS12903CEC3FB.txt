Yesterdays come easy
They're looking back at you
The sun will rise tomorrow
There's nothing you can do
It's the same old story
Coming round again
What is done is done now
You know you can't hold back the rain

And there's no future in the past
So take it slow Â¨c you're getting nowhere fast
You could be saving the situation now
You'd better run like the devil if you still know how

You know the tide is turning
