To all the farsighted
The skys never been so clear
Hello to the hopeful
Goodbye to the full of fear
Glorious
Luminous

Chorus:
The heavens have painted
Have brushed you with angel wings
And you know in your heart that the farsighted see better things

Hello you daydreamers
Hello to the in-between
Behold all you've wished for
Promising things unseen
...
