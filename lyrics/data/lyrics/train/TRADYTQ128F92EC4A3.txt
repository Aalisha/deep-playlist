Somebody once told me I AWP like Maikelele
But with rifles I just couldn't hit heads
He was looking kinda dumb with a sticker on his gun
Of a kawaii little anime girlfriend

Well the AWPers start buyin' and they don't stop buyin'
Third round glass cannon and they hit the ground dyin'
Didn't make sense not to buy a good gun
Your IGL's smart but his strats are dumb

So many rounds, it's 12 to 3
So what's wrong with a full Tec-9 rush B?
You'll never know if you don't rush
You'll never win if you don't push

Hey now, you're a Nova, get your rank up, go play
Hey now, you're a Nova, get your skins on, get crates
All that kills you's OP
Only top fraggers make MG

You've got cool skins, and they say you get better
