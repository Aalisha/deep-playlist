Living in a whirlwind!

Spiraling out of control!
In the eye of the storm
Disconnected, from the world you were born
Cheating death, just to get your fix
Cannot survive, its the end of the line

They look you in the eye and all they see is an empty stare
Living like a rat, you choke on your own despair
Still you're sinking lower, each day more desperate
...
