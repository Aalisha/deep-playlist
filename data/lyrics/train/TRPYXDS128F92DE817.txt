Wrap me up like a gift
Whisper in my ear say I'm the shit
Can you feel my eyes on your face?
Tears in your mouth, give me a kiss

Now bring your body closer
Pin me to the wall like a poster
Tonight's your turn so baby order
Now I'm biting on your body like an hors d'oeuvre

Tonight you can take what you want from me
Expose my devotion
I'ma do you good from your head to your feet
Expose my devotion

And all you gotta do is ask
I'm right on top of it, I'll handle that task
Tonight I'm all yours baby
Expose my devotion

To you, to you, to you
To you, to you, to you, to you
...
