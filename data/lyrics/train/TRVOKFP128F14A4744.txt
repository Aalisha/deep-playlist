C'mon, everyone, we got to get together now
Oh, yeah, love's the only thing that matters anyhow
And the beauty of life
Can only survive
If we love one another

Oh, yeah, yesterday my friends were marching out to war
Oh, yeah, listen, now, we ain't a-marching anymore
No, we ain't gonna fight
Only God has the right
To decide who's to live and die

He gave us sweet cherry wine
So very fine
We'll drink it right down
Pass it all around
So stimulating, so intoxicating
Sweet cherry wine
(All day and night)
And everybody's gonna feel so fine
Drinking sweet cherry wine
...
