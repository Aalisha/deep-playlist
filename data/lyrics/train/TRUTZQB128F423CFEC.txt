Now listen, I think you and me
Have come to the end of our time
What d’ya want, some kind of reaction?
Well okay, that's fine
Alright how would it make you feel
If I said you never made me come?
In the year and a half that we spent together
Yeah, I never really had much fun
All those times that I said I was sober
Well I'm afraid I lied
I'd be lying next to you and you next to me
All the while I was high as a kite
I could see it in your face as you break it to me gently
Well you really must think you're great
Well let's see how you feel in a couple of weeks
When I work my way through your mates
I never wanted it to end up this way
You've only got yourself to blame
I'm gonna tell the world you’re rubbish in bed now
