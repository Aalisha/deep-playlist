I should have known
You'd bid me farewell
There's a lesson to be learned from this
And I learned it very well
Now I know you're not the only starfish in the sea
If I never hear your name again
It's all the same to me
And I think,
It's gonna be alright
Yeah,
The worst is over now
The mornin' sun is shining
Like a red rubber ball

You never care
For secrets I confide
For you I'm just an ornament
