Pale moonlight, neon-bright
Whispers in the early night
Golden mane, read 'The Game'
Watch them drawn like moths to flame

Studied the practical tactics of pick-ups
Right down to the pitfalls and hiccups
Before you start I say, "Stop, it's a stick-up"

Used to being the guy that gets the girl
But if we were the last two people in the world
The human race would face extinction
Before I'd get it on, honey

Used to being the guy that gets the girl
Not if we were the last two people in the world
Mister, mister, why haven't you gone?
If you're God's gift to women then God got it wrong

Peacock strut, collar up
Watch him while he fills his cup
Sultry glare, piercing stare
Practiced in the mirror
