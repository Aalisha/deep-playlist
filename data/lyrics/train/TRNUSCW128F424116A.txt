I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love

Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits
Baby can't you see, when you look at me
I can't shake this feelin' when it hits
All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you
And I dream of you all the time
What am I gonna do

I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
I want your love, I want your love
