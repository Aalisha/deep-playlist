Go down, Wicked man go down
satan go down, satan go down (satan go down)
Let Jah's word be praised

Dem nuh love when we hail Rastafaria, A so we hail di black king as the most high
They trust in King James, We trust in in the King's name
Haile Selassie I
Satan nuh love when we hail Rastafari, A so we hail di black king as the most high
They trust in King James, We trust in in the King's name
Haile Selassie I

What would we be (What would we be)
If his blessings wasn't upon we... Woee
Where would we be (Where would we be)
Without the guidance of our God & King
How would we live (How would we live)
If the King of Kings did not teach his righteous livity
Hail my God & King, For I would want the lyrics chant his name continually
