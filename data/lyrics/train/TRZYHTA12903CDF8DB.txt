Forget your life and all you know
I'll see more when all the walls come crashing down
White light is your only safety
Any other thing might hurt you too much

Every time a liar's born
There is only one thought and it is murder
Anytime anywhere, take your pick
Welcomed to the darkened place

Men trade their only born son for life
Think there's nothing wrong taking a fee
Nothing I can do can change the past
Can you live without watching? can you?

Why can't you see?
The cancer grows it spreads it spreads until there's nothing left
You'll never know
How good I felt when I thought I was free from all of you
