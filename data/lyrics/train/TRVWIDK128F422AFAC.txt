I'm getting ready to cut off the light pull out the plug
It's the end of a chapter and I had enough
Sick of being flat broke while you all floss
Tired of working like a dog while you all boss
You'll see there's so much to me than just an employee
Getting paid or getting played like a slave to the wage I'm saying

Seems like my sky's always cloudy grey
Ready to pour like in a storm
When the air get's cold & the ground is warm
That combination is raw power
Producing thunder lightning rain storm & hail showers
That's the forecast all the time
In the cumate of my mind
The sun is only shinging when I'm rhyming
That's the time I feel alive and

That's the way it must be some people got it easy
Not how it is for me and probably never wil be
I'm stuck here down in the dirt living with pain and the hurt
i feel inside & I know why but sometimes I just

Break out no filter gotta let my worst out
Something I can't prevent
...
