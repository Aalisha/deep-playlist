The sun has passed from overhead
Let the night come in, let the night walk through your door
For every sleep spent in our beds
We will push our feet so hard the room will tear
In a carnival of smiles our faces glow
Oh the dark can make us feel so bold
There's no cold can make us want to stay at home
Every doubt in turn explodes
We all could pass right through
We all have nothing left to lose
It's not the fire, nor the warm drink that heats my hearts
...
