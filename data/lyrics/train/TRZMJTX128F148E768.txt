Rise up, take your lyre and sing
Listen, to the news I bring

Frosty breath on the window
See a friend in the snow that gently falls
Feel the truth in those sad eyes
See the smile that's so rare just like the love, she waits for

And she plays a game of her own
As she sleeps within the firelight
For her dreams are incredibly wild
But they're lost and gone forever with the dawn
...
