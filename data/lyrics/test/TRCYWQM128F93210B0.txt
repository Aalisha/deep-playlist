You say you've got to go home
'Cos he's sitting on his own again this evening
I know you're gonna let him bore your pants off again
Oh now, it's half past eight, you'll be late

Oh, but you say your not sure
Though it makes good sense for you to live together
Still you bought a toy that can reach the places he never goes
And now it's getting late, it is so straight

Do you remember the first time?
I can't remember a worse time
Oh, but you know that we've changed so much since then
Oh yeah, we've grown
Now I don't care what you're doing
No, I don't care if you screw him
Oh, just as long as you save a piece for me
Oh yeah, oh, ooh
