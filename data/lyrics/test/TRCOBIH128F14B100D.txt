I vent my frustration at you old man 
After years your ears will hear 

You screamed you tried 
But it's words of a weakling 
And promises made by a liar
Fuckin' liar

Now you pick up that splintered chair 
That was aiming for your head
A head that should have been long ago kicked in by me, alone! 

I won't lose a second of sleep for this... 

Not again! 

Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me... NO! 
EVER AGAIN! 

Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me

Orphaned to the dope and drinks
I learned my lessons well somehow from you
