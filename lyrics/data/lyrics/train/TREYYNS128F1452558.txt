Call on the fates, this'll take a second
While I fall on my face, like everyone else
And we can talk all we want, but all I can say
Is that I'm sorry and I'm sorry
But I'm never gonna do it again

Counting on my relevant friends
When this keeps coming up again and again
If everybody knows how it's gonna end
Why doesn't someone stop me?
Because I'm sick of waking up on your floor
For the sixth or seventh night in a row
I'm lying next to you in all of my clothes, someone stop me
...
