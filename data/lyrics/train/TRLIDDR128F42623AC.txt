Great aspirations often fall too short to fly
Life alone can take us down it's twisted path
As I wander down this road not all sure where to go
Sometimes the scenery can just bore you to death

As I sit down and watching another day go by

So little time to live and so much time to kill
How's it that I found time to be bored?

Am I wasting time, my purpose being served?
Am I part of master plan?
