Over through a dark and gentle sea
Open into portal seventeen
I wanna laugh and tape it down
I wanna know you mean to stay

Oh and on and on down
Time, these two things
I don't want to leave

And I, and I'm only dreaming
I, and I'm only dreaming

Running through a coral castle wall
Neon wrapped around your china horns
...
