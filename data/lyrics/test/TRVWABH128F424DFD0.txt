Sit down let me talk to you
Maybe we can get down if you want
Now or later
If you're with it I'm here to make sure it happens
In the best way for you

Sunny days
Purple haze
We chillin in the shade, oh
I can feel myself getting a rush
Oh I'm so high
Apple martinis and buffalo wings
Baby listen to the jay bird sing
La la la la la, la la la la

Baby
Sit down let me talk to you
Maybe we can get down if you want
Now or later
