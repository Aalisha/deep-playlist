Well you did what you had to do
When your back's to the wall what else can you do
And you're pushed just a little too far
Now the heat is on, and here you are

Well I waited my life for you
I said I'd always be there no matter what you do
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
And if that's where you want me, then that's where I'll be

Don't keep me waiting Marie Claire
