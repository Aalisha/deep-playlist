I sit and stare, an empty chair
Another day without you
Each one for me can only be
Another day without you

The tick and tock of every clock
Seems too long
No good and bad
When all you have is gone

I put the street beneath my feet
So not to think about you
But every sound and every sight
Unlocks a picture of you

Each memory a rush
Of joy and pain
If only I could
Hold you once again

But this is the lonely road
This is the lonely road
...
