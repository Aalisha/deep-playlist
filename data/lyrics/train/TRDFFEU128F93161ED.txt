Tattoo'd Lady,
Bearded baby,
They're my family.

When I was lonely,
Something told me, where,
I could always be.

Where I could,
Wish for pennies,
If we had any.
You'd meet me down,
At the shooting gallery.

Yes I'm a,
Fair ground baby.
Wonder what made me,
Fall for the pearly queen.

I spent my youth,
Under canvas roof,
As I roamed from town to town.

I'm not fooling,
When I say I got no schoolin',
Never like the class bell sound.
