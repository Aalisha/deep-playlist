Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It will never do anyhow
When your rooster's a crowing at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason why I'm traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

An it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, baby
The light I never knowed
An it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, baby
...
