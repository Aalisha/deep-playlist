My name is Ted, indifferent to laws I strangle and maim women
January 4, ramming the betrod into her her cattered vagina
Incapable, defined is the hatred that lead to this carnage

Infested by love, a stone cold killer,
hacking and gnashing without remorse
Pipe fed to her cave, blinded by rage
I lacerate her lie spreading throat
...
