Hard to hold sticky fingers got a mind of their own
He's so bold leaves me breathless
Better as friends you need some convincing
Maybe I'll wait it out instead
I'm not afraid of doing time surrendering my life
cause good things come to those who wait

Good thing good thing
We're gonna do it my way
Good things come to those who wait

No control I'm addicted I can't let go
All this wait leads to madness
Love is a whore always pretending
