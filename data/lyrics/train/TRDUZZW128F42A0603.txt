Find your down on your knees again
The question is when's it gonna end
It just seems it will never change
It's the same shit as yesterday
Taking shots all that you can take
And now you hate yourself more than you can hate
There's gonna be an emergency
I swear
It's at the stage where something's gonna break

Running like a freight train
You're going insane
It's just another day for all these bloody veins
It's like a whirlwind
Pushing in the deep end
You're screaming to a friend
Get out get out get out

Soon the shit's gonna hit the fan
You see
