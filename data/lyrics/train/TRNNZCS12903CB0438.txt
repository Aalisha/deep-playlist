Slings and arrows, slings and arrows
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows

No chance for a second chance
When the arrows start to fly
No way is there an easy way
To say goodbye
No dream is ever lost
If you never cease to try
Never thought you could walk away
From my side
I just can't hide from
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows
