The way I feel about you

I had you on my mind
Way we met it all happened so fast
It was love in your eyes
When we touched there was love, so let's make it last

If love is real

The way I feel, yeah

(I've been thinkin' 'bout you)
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
(The way I feel about you)
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

I'm in love
I'm in love

I woke up late last night
