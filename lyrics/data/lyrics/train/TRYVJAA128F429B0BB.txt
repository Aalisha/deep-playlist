You swear allegiance by the glass you drink
A life of thought and process now extinct
Always unravelled always on the brink
Takes a hold of you 
They taught you how to think
Stick to tradition it will keep you sane
Just fall in line, ignore the pain
Increase the dosage it will keep you calm
A mindless drone
Queen's done her job 
Retreating, weakening
A host now feeding it's disease
Foundation, soon broken 
They've got you begging on your knees
And now it's time
To put up a fight
...
