I'm a lovaholic for you
Plus the fact that my love is
(My love is)
Dope

You got me hooked, I got you sprung
Now add that up and you're my love drug
I'm your love drug
You're what I need and I'm your pusher man

You appear as though you're from Columbia
You keep it tight for me like zip locks
And I just got high when we lip lock
And you just got high when we lip lock

So you search for me
With a flashlight in the daylight
'Cause I'm your get right
So no one serves you up, girl, like I can
I'm your Mr. Midnight pusher man

I'm your drug
(Ooh, I'm your drug)
And you can't kick it
(You can't kick it)

You gotta have 'cause you're so addicted
(I got you hooked, got you hooked, got you open)
'Cause I'm your drug
(Yea, yea but it's a two way street)

(See)
You're my drug
