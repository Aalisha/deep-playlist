This is year zero, all we knew has died
The mutiny came so sudden, killing yesterday

Thoughts that forced discordance away
Once more an era is fading
Whatever dreams we're reaching to claim
Decides the path we are taking

Gone forever
We are done with world views mechanical
None shall, none shall ever be a slave
To thoughts inside their heads

Mind is the master, morphogenesis
This structure remained untrodden a new reality
