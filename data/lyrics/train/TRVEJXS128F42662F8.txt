I don’t want to take and baby I don’t want to break and baby
I don’t want to try and make you anyway
I just want to lie down, tell my crazy brains to lie down
And then fall away

I won’t be alone I won’t be waiting by the phone
I won’t be dreaming of you dreaming of me anyway
Tell me where you’ve been and I will tell you where I’ve been
