Setting your sails on endless fight
The war planes are cutting through the night
Sirens are screaming, screaming bloody fright
Hide your families out of sight

In a world with crumbling walls
Faintly destruction still calls
Following, still so blind
Watching the fall of mankind


Looking to the sky, we wait and we watch for the sign...
