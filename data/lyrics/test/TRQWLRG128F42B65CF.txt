Tonight I'm giving you
The chance to show and prove
What you're really all about
Even though it's hard
I'm letting down my guard

There's been times in the past
When true love is what I thought I had
But that wasn't the case

I wish I could erase
The times I've hurt so bad
And now I find myself, here with you
Just as nervous as can be

Trying to give love a chance to live inside of me
Tonight I'm giving you
The chance to show and prove
What you're really all about
...
