Yay!
Lee and Molly
White guy in love with black beauty
Lee and Molly
White guy in love with black beauty

Mama don't want that
Though she know they might be free
Daddy got drunk one day
He beat the hell out of poor old Lee

Lee and Molly
White guy in love with black beauty
Lee and Molly
White guy in love with black beauty

Why should they hide to share strong moments? (Yes)
These days men have no bound'ries
So whether you care or whether you won't - tell you what
They have something a lot don't
They're not just good friends

Lee and Molly
A white guy in love with black beauty
Lee and Molly
A hite guy in love with black beauty
But life is not like that

What are dreams if they can't be
Love can't hurt you
There's more to know than you can see

Lee and Molly
White guy in love with black beauty
