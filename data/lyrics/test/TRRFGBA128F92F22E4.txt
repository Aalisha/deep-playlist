Oh who would have
Ever known this?
Could be this easy
I was a long, long way off
Then just like that it was over
Everything I knew of love
I was a long, long way off

And I think I like
How the day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song

Thank you for opening the window
The sky is clear as my mind is now
I was a long, long way off
Join me in welcoming the sun in
It's much brighter
Than the night I hid in
I was a long, long way off

And I think I like how
The day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song
And I think I like how
The day sounds
Like how the day sounds
Through this new song
