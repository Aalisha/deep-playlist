Lyfe talking:

yeah
alot of mysteries alot of histories
to much blowing up ans showing up
and not enough growing up
i mean it happens people change
you know better changes everything
but um most of all we've changed

[verse 1]
Sometimes, making up
is easier than breaking up
we believe if we just
fake it enough we can
trick ourselves into believing that
we're still in love
