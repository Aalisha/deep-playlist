(John Dowland)

Wilt thou unkind thus reave me
Of my heart, of my heart,
And so leave me, and so leave me?

Wilt thou unkind thus reave me
Of my heart, of my heart,
And so leave me, and so leave me?

Farewell! Farewell!
But yet or e'er I part, O cruel,
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me,
Sweet, sweet my jewel.

Hope by disdain grows cheerless,
Fear doth love, love doth fear
...
