You think you're special
You think you're cool
You're so invincible
You're nobody's fool

Dead man walking
Your ego's high
No matter who you are
We're all gonna die

Your time is coming
Your soul is burning
Your future's fading
I Can't Save You

Your demon's waking
Your will is breaking
Your body's shaking
I Can't Save You now, now, now, now...

(You've got to save yourself)
I can't save you now, now, now, now
(You've got to save yourself)
I can't save you now, now, now, now

The years are passing
...
