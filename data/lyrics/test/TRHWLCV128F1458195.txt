You said you'd give me love
Instead you caused me pain
You made me curse and slam the door
And hang my head in shame

But, it's over now, it's over now

You talked to me of virtue
And sang a song so sweet
All I know is I could smell
The perfume of deceit

It's over now, it's over now

You told me of your innocence
And I believed it all
But your best friend is your vanity
And the mirror on the wall

It's over now
