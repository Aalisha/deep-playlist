In a deep breath
And it all starts to change
Flip my world inside out

Honestly I like it better this way
When I mesh the night
Through the back of my eyes

I have put myself here
I'm the culprit
I am the culprit

I've been swallowed up alive
Shut down building from the inside out
I can finally walk through the walls
...
