LonelyÂâ no one searchin' for you
So lost nowÂâ deep inside your mind
And you feel likeÂâ there's no one there to find you
Oh, what'cha gonna do if your whole world's dyingÂâ whoa
Where ya gonna run if you're inside hidingÂâ whoa, whoa
You gotta let go
Feel the thunderÂâ see the light
You've got the powerÂâ just start to fight
CHORUS:
Let it all come down
