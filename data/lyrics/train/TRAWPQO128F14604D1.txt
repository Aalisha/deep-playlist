Mama, can I huh, mama, can I huh, huh
Can I mama, won't you please let me, mama can I, huh
That's the sweetest little dress, Sally where'd you get the pattern?
Made me one just like it out of yellow dotted swiss

Yes, I guess we got the earliest garden in the county
Beneath the strawberries are a heap of snappin greenbeans
(It's been so long since I saw you, Hows your family
Too bad about your boy)

Mama make Willie quit pulling at my hair!
Mama ouch! ouch! mama, just make Willie quit it!
Tommy, if ya don't put down that stick
I'm gonna wear you out with it, boy, be quick

Come quick, Sammy Jean stuck her finger in a Coke bottle
Can't get it out cause its stuck, stuck, stuck
(Dad finally had his operation
You know how he is at putting off things)

Now I told you my mama didn't raise no fool
I can do anything if I got the right tools

Mama can I huh, mama can I huh, huh
Can I mama, won't you please let me, mama can I, huh
