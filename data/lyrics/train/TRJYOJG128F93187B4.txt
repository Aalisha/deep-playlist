I've had too many days
Where I'm ready to break
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more
So I ingest everything
'Cause I'm in it to win
Nothing but time on my side
Anywhere I choose
'Cause I wasn't built to lose
And you think I'm going to fall
Face down on the floor
Just because I'm
High, High

As for me
I have to disagree

'Cause I'm one who will survive
The ones you eat alive
And nobody puts up a fight
They die!
They die!
Rolling dollar bills
And popping all these pills
But I'll do what I wanna do
...
