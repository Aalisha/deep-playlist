dj paul]
yea-yea chuch ya'khamsayn
once again it's on baby, y'all know what time it is
i know it'sa shame ya'khamsayn,
you gatta actually killa a mothafucka out here
just ta let a nigga now you ain't playin' with him
and you ain't bullshittin' - yea that's some knowledge fa y'all
na'...we gon' get y'all inta this new artist
his new ass - lil' wyte, this boy raw...

get high to this shit - i'm high as a mothafucka

alotta rappers rap gangsta shit but they ain't did nothing
dj paul - lord inf'...crunchy blac fa real bussen
we done rolled down on niggaz, we done let them gats burst
we done seen niggaz blood leak clean through they shirt
i ain't lying too ya boys when i said that cha'll get did
man i keep me some hungry niggaz ready ta spit the wig
of a fake solid nigga, hoes lying in they wraps
cuz they never shot guns and they never had ta scrap

he wore a vest so we shot him in the neck
made his body cold left from red and wet
body curved up like a cornrow
police on the set, i'm a vet from the north - north
pack a rusty tec in the lex' plus a sawed-off
hard makin' money when you watching for the ro-bbe-rers
