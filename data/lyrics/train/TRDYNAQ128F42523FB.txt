In the silence of darkness
Among the shadows of the dead we hear
And a wolf howling hungry
To wake up children of the graves
Unripe vengeance!
The cult that serves as revenge
Has put forward its fangs
To declare a fucking war

Only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by
The altars of Bodom where everything but death is a lie
To spill your blood to become our wine
We'll reborn reality where only the wild will survive
...
