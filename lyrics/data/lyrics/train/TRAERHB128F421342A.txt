Shake off those warrior garments
Shake off your warrior armor…yeah
Shake off those warrior garments
Shake off your warrior armor…yeah

Money for your souls
What if they were to tell the young one
All of them dancing upon the moon let them be so, so, so
Let them become Lord

Is it night time again? (man it can’t be so)
Is it night time again…no can’t be Lord
Well it’s night time again, oh are you…

Sleeping Bag-o-wire
Sleep in a bag o wire, oh Lord
Sleeping Bag-o-wire

Man their armies grow strong, they grow strong
...
