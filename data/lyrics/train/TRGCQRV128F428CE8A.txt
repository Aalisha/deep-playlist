Cold rage festers in my black earth, blind provoked by your hypocrisy
Boastful menace vain disrespect, violent conflict is unavoidable
Veins on fire with lust to kill, locked intention, mind of obliteration I I can't wait to bathe in your blood, to destroy your ignorance

Someone goes down, too long endured, mindless tension it, must end now

FRUSTRATION EXHAUSTED PATIENCE, NO CHANCE CAN'T DEFEAT ME
ARROGANCE HAS BLINDED YOU, WROUGHT WITH UNMASKED DISDAIN
VAIN THREATS, TOLERATED TOO LONG, NOW YOU DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE
LOST MY, FEAR ATTACK IN ANGER, ONCE MY, FRIEND YOU ARE MY ENEMY
NO WAY TO RETRACT YOUR FAITH

When I finally snap it's over, stomping out your fucking
