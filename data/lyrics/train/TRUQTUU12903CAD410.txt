Tear through the ashes of what still remains
The blood runs down my face
Can't find the reason we're all left to waste
You must awaken

See through my eyes

I bleed to let myself know I'm alive
As you hide in denial
Break through the coulds and reach out to the sky
You must awaken

See through my eyes
See through my lies
