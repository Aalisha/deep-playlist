I lay down on snow covered sheets of loneliness
and I weep, I'm crying out for you
I'm longing just to have one more chance

And right now...

...My hands are reaching out to you
I stand here frozen with fear
my heart is shattering in two
please don't leave me here to live alone
my world is grey without you
I am so lost, no where to go

Alone... I'm filled emptiness
alone... I call your name
alone... no hope remains
and alone I bid farewell
so long... I end my emptiness
so long... no name to call
...
