This is not a model fit for any mold
The twisted, old, and bitter tongues are reckless just as they are cold
Dwelling on the dying is wet fingers to the flame
I cannot say that I believe in everything that you propose to me

I'd rather learn from children
I'd rather see their world
In all its natural splendor
All its harsh distress unknown

Not what's old and jaded
Forgotten or ignored
...
