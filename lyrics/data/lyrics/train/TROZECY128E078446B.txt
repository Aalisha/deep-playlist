When you want to impress
(somebody)
and trying to catch
(somebody)
remember the old school
and don't forget the old rule
"Haste makes waste"
and you don't want to worry
keep this in mind
"All things in time"

and all once you're there next to you
and you're burning with desire

look her right into her eyes and tell her
"Baby, I need your fire"

the lady's got a way of knowing
if you really mean it

one thing more
you've got to make sure that
it's the right night
and moonlight
(loving is better with love everytime)

the right night
with the starlit sky
...
