Our love is like a new car smell
Sooner or later it all goes to hell
Somebody farts or spills some taco bell
Our love is like a new car smell

Our love is like a barbeque ignition
You know that button you push lights the propane emission
It works for a month then the spark goes missing
Our love is like a barbeque ignition

Our love is like a video game
