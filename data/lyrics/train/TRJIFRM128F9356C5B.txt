Wild, wild

I go wild, 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken

Wild because the chips are down
Wild because there isn't anybody else around
Wild when the waves start to break
And God knows they're breaking in me now
I go wild because it doesn't make sense
For me to cry out in my own defense
And wild because I would do anything
To tear you off your precious fence

So this is what it's like living in limbo
First I'm high, then I'm so low

I go wild 'cause you break me open
Wild 'cause you left me here
I go wild 'cause your promises are broken
Wild when I know you're near
I go wild
I go wild...

Tell me what you've come here for
Moving like a hunter through my back door
Leaving the perfume of all you adore
To die nameless on my floor
Yeah, well we both know that you don't play fair
I guess you really think that you'd get me there
