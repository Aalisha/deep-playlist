-Mommy?
-Yes Son?
-Where does dirt come from?
-Dirt comes from: The Worms.
-Wow! Awesome!

There is a chipmunk
At the center of the earth
And in his big oven
He bakes his own desserts
He warms the ocean
And from that, life springs forth
Little organisms building trash around the clock

Compost heaps
Or melting pots
For Farmer John's
Smoked Sausage stocks

Worms make the dirt
And the dirt makes the earth
