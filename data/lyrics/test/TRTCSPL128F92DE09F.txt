Hey, fellas, have you heard the news? Oh yeah
The women of this town are being misused, oh yeah
I've seen it all in my dreams last night, oh yeah
Girls leaving this town 'cause we don't treat 'em right, yeah oh, yeah

Well, I'll take a train, take a train
Fly by plane, fly by plane
They're getting tired, getting tired
They're sick and tired, sick and tired

All you fellas better change your ways, oh yeah
They're leaving this town in a matter of days, oh yeah
Girls are good, you better treat 'em true, oh yeah
