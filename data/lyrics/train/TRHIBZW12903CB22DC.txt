Sunshine go away today
I don't feel much like dancing
Some man's gone, he's tried to run my life
He don't know what he's asking

He tells me I'd better get in line
Can't hear what he's saying
When I grow up I'm going to make it mine
But these aren't dues I been paying

How much does it cost?
I'll buy it
The time is all we've lost
I'll try it
...
