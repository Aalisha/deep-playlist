I'm standing on top of a mountain my face against the wind.
My fingers are touching stones millions of years they are old.
The spirit of this old place increases the power in me.
Nature is the real god the reason for our existence.

As long as my heart will pound
And as long I can breath.
As long as I stand like a man
I will never forgive.

That's the way I have to go
My chosen path.
With pride and honour I fight
For the glory of my gods.
My conviction, my destiny
I have the heart of a wolf
