The strong fore is cutting wave and water
Clashing waves bite into the Ebon Queen

Groaning, she's drawn down and pulled to her side

Ghost voices echo in the canvas
Linens get torn by rain and storm

Dark waters burst in and crush her defenses

I will lead you through the dark storm
I will lead you to your end
