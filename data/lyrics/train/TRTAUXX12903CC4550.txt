O my heart it's a fish out of water
O my heart it's a fish on the rocks and it bakes in the bad sun
O my heart it's a rock in the gutter
O my heart it's a rocking great bolder and stuck in the gutter

And I throw my heart back to the ocean
But it don't go far it come back floating
And I watch it wash up with the dead fish
But it ain't quite dead it just is lifeless

O my heart it's a house in tornado
O my heart it's a house in the sky in the eye of tornado
O my heart it's a roof in El Nino
