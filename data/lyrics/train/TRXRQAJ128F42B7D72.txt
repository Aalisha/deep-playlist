I've had enough of this red light.
i've been waiting here for so long, so long.
driving on like reruns,
and feeling nothing new.
time has stopped resting
some for this town.
it's comforting to know nothing new.
If i could only make a sound.
Holding the stars
like paintings we are.
pull one down for me.
colors alive
like radiance
swimming back to your sea.
swimming back to your sea.
