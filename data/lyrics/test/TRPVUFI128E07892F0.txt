i am the purity
like the aetheric specters
who ye become in dreams
deprived of reveries

i am the dweller
within the light of darkness
and i have been moving with the one
through dimensions unknown
and terrible...

thus
i am not allowed to tell thee of thy true i
however we traverse vast deep space
and journey the variety of times

the one and i
have visited worlds
moving around the red arcturus
and we dwelled
in the insectial bodies of philosophers
...
