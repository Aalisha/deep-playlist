Oh, oh, it's the weekend! It's the weekend!
It's the weekend! And them freaks are comin'!
Oh yes them freaks are comin'!

This is my song, this is my life, baby it's on
Somebody told me, the weekend's just for me
(It's the weekend! It's)
All through the week, I've been at work doing my job
Then somebody told me, the weekend's just for me

And oh
(The weekend's coming! And them freaks are coming!)
And oh
(Them freaks are coming!)
Here come them beats, nigga!

Boom! And the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom! And the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom! And the beat go boom, boom!
And the beat go boom! And the beat go boom, boom!

I know what we can do on the weekend
Baby, we can party all night, yeah, baby
I know what we can do on the weekend
(It's the weekend!)

I just got paid, it's Friday night, and I feel alive
And somebody told me, this club was built for me
(It's the weekend! It's)
