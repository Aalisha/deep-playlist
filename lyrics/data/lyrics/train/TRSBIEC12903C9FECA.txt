The fires are burning deep down in hell
The warlords are ready to rise
Forces of evil angels of sin bloodlust
And hate in their eyes
Nations lie wait in the fear of their death
Standing one foot in the grave
Satan pronounces let death be to all
That none of the living are saved

Hellbound the horsemen
Ride let there be death to all
Ride through the burning skies
See that no one survives
Send their souls to hell
Let there be death!

Nuclear warfare raging on earth
...
