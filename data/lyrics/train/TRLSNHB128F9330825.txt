You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say
You think I'm stupid but the truth is that it's Cupid
Baby, loving you has made me this way

So before you point your finger
Get your hand off of my trigger, oh yeah
You need to know the situation's getting old
And now the more you talk, the less I can take, oh

I'm looking for attention not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer, why you still standing here?
Hey hey hey hey, just walk away
