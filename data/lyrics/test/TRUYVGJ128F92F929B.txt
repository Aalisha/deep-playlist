Outside theres a box car waiting
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathing
Outside we wait til face turns blue

I know the nervous walking
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the box car waiting
Take me away to nowhere plains

There is a wait so long
(so long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man 
Here comes your man
...
