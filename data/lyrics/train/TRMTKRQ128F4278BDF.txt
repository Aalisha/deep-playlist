(Chorus: Tajai)
Touched insane deranged and such
But my mind still thinks in the clutch
You run up you get, touched
Molested marauded messed with
I'm charged with electric current
And burn'em so don't, touch
Gimme room to bloom or boom impending doom
Thoughts consume man I got that
Touched panache pizzaz
A feel for the real
Skill and lots of that
So I just build now

(Opio)
While you throwin' punchlines
I'm bustin' hot ones with rhymes (blow!)
Acupuncture smackin' damn nerds like heroine
Swimmin' with sharks I'm off the (Fairline?) Islands
They sense blood in they gills but a nigga will survive man
Automatic darts hypnotic talk
Alive and aware come prepared to collide you'se a dead man walkin'
And I'm the executioner connivin' like Lex Luthor
What they shootin' for?

(Tajai)
Man, I make these corny rappers respire
Break'em for their dapper atire
Then throw that ass in the fire
And ain't no use in askin' me why
FUCK YOU! that's my reply
Step back from the mike
Or I'm snatchin' your lives, right

(A-Plus)
Niggas be actin' like
They be rappin' tight, but they lost
Like in the black of night
Soon to be my sacrifice
Better be wary of the legendary
Cuz your spot at the cemetery isn't temporary
Have you shook up like kids who mention Carrie
Or Bloody Mary if you rappin' near me
Positively somethin' gon' happen really
I ain't got no back up in me
I stay managed
Wether you chill or pack a semi
You can't manage

(Phesto Dee)
We gargantuan killa tarantulas
Touch the inchangeable, Viagra flow, raw
...
