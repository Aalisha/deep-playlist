Bring out the sad songs so everyone knows she has gone,
Not great at so longs, not when we both know what went wrong,
I've been used, i've been used, i've been used and so have you

So take photographs down, my room still smells of you,
Cause I hate the past and the way you bend the truth like you do,
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye but,
Can I come too?

Good (?) out for so long, don't get me started, don't get me wrong,
Bursting (?) and breathless, that's where my heart is, it's moving along,
I've been used, i've been used, i've been used, i still like you
...
