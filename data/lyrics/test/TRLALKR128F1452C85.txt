It's so electric here tonight
And so I'm heading out for the city life
I feel connected and it feels so right
Hear the sounds all around
All around

Got no time to hesitate
If you're with me don't be late
'cause I wanna dance

Oh no no
Don't step on my groove
'cause I just wanna move
I don't care what you do
But don't step on my groove

I'm captivated everytime
Looking pretty and I'm running wild
There's nothing like it
...
