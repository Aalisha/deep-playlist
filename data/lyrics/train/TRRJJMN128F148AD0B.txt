Cupid draw back your bow
And you let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me
Nobody but me

Cupid please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart, its for me

Now I don't need to bother you, but I'm in distress
There's dangerous of losing all of my happiness
But just between the two of us our love is concealed
So help me if you will

So, Cupid draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart, it's for me
...
