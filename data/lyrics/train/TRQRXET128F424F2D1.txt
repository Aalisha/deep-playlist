scratch scratch, should be there
I dig the vision of rotting corpses
and I'm pouting in the corner

five more minutes, and we'll all be dead
five more minutes, and we'll all be dead

skeleton closets
close up tight
filthy mirrors don't clear our life
in her frightening presence

nailed to her heart-felt decision
...
