Want it or not
We are coming to your town
to spread the word of
gloomy bloody grim

Take no prisoners
no life spared
you won't be saved from
our holocaust

Blinded by fear
this is the day
Ears bleed blood

Gloomy Bloody Grim

Take no prisoners
no life spared
you won't be saved from
our holocaust

Bang your head
against the wall
Feel the power of Satan tonight
See the enemies falling down
one by one
...
