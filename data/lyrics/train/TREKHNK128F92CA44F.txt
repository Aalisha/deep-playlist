i saw a dried up withered old rich man turning on a garden hose,
i see a young man picking up a gun i guess that's where the money goes yeah,
am i just as good as a bad man sleeping when the rest are dying
or am i just as bad as a good man saying there's no use of trying
Oooo tell me do you still believe
Oooo everything that you read
will we learn to get together and see who we really are
ain't nothing gonna change
ain't nothing gonna change if nobody's gonna wake up and start acting whose incharge
ain't nothing gonna change
ain't nothing gonna change
ain't nothing gonna change
nanananana yeah
rap
ain't shit changing but life is all babies get higher in the background singing singing naanaanaanaa singing nananana
