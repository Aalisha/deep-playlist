(John Stewart)

Every prayer that I'm not praying and every promise I'm betraying
Every price that I am paying, is like a ghost inside of me
Every road I could be taking, every dream I am forsaking
Every heart that's out there breaking, is like a ghost inside of me

Look around, around, look around
Every time I turn around
I'm not who I ought to be
Down, down, it gets me down
