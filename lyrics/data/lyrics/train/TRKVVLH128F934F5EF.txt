Youth went by on our backs, morals intact, we were never ganna crack
Spread-eagled, but never once looking back
When we were young we were chasing the sun
Always busy in our quest for fun, but now the race is run
The sun has gone black
And we're chasing the moon like moths to a flame
Now that your goal's obscured, where d'you aim?
Running without vision in all the wrong directions
Hitting wall after wall, then turn and run
