I'm focus now
I'm focus now
You use to touch me, love me
Hug me, kiss me, hold me everyday
I never thought that I'd be finding out
That you gave your love away
Now, how do you expect for me to stay
Wake up everyday with this on the brain?
So I'm a say thanks and I'm a be on my way
'Cause I
Now, I got my head right
Time to finally say goodbye
To all the lies, and the lonely nights, so focus
That I made up my mind
You were just a waste of time, but now I'm fine
'Cause I'm focused, you're out of my life
I'm focus now
I'm focus now
I never thought that you would
Treat me like I'm just another girl
