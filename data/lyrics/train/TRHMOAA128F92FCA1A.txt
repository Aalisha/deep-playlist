Mmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Oh, oh, oh, oho
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket to the blues

Choo, choo, train a-trackin' down the track
Gotta travel on, ain't never comin' back
Ooh, ooh, got a one way ticket to the blues

Bye, bye, love, my baby's leavin' me
Now lonely teardrops are all that I can see
Ooh, hoo, got a one way ticket to the blues

Gonna take a trip to lonesome town
Gonna stay at Heartbreak Hotel
A fool such as I
(A fool such as I)

There never was
(Cry)
I cry a tear so well

One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket to the blues

Choo, choo, train a-trackin' down the track
Gotta travel on, ain't never comin' back
Ooh, ooh, got a one way ticket to the blues

Gotta go on
Yeah
