Sweet temptation, that's what you are to me.
That's what you'll always be, it seems.
Ah, sweet temptation, you smile and pass me by.
But still you occupy my dreams.

Baby, I've got a lot of hidden charms.
You'd find if you'd just hold me in your arms.
But you're just sweet temptation, a diamond in the rough.
You make it awful tough on me.

Ah, you do, honey.
