Smile in your face, yeah back stabbers

They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers
(Back stabbers)

The buda got my brain seein' my own my blood stains
Dental records checkin' my remains, it's hard to explain
First I see 'em then I don't, they disappear
First she tried to slit my throat, now she ain't there

I'm seein' bitches in the mirrors behind me
But when I turn around, they hard to find
A little bit of weed and a little bit of greed
Make a bitch wanna choke me till I bleed

Now watch a bitch breathe from dum-dums
That some young bum had to bust just for wreck
Earn some self-respect, now should I tote a fo' pound
'Cause a clown wants my autograph
Broken off that hash I think he wants my cash

The lexus and rings, give a sex simple and plain
But these bitches is mad an' they niggas is bad
So they scheme on a cream, you know
Fuck the hoes, bitches is detrimental, the guns is essential

They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers
(Back stabbers)

They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers
(Back stabbers)

I'm havin' re-occurin' dreams bitches they want my cream
They wanna be lieutenant so it seems, I can't sleep
I see an image that keeps movin' round and round my bed
The shadow stops, points a glock to my fuckin' head
