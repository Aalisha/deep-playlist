Once upon a time
No more words to say
Find me in the circle
Find me in the end

I am the soul collector
Dressed in ebony
There are no rules
But only one

There's someone young sister,
Caught at the border
Let's get in contact
He's either yours or mine

I have thought
That this will never end
And things go on
But nothing will last
Only the fool in me believes
There is sense in it
In distant shores of green
It's over now

Far out in space
I ride on
...
