(Everlast)
Glory fades and glory days ain't always what they seem
Give all I got and make my salaat and dream my broken dreams
I crawl inside, ball up and hide, tuck my pain away
And hope to God I fall into a sleep where I can stay

We all got bills to settle, we all got a price to pay
And if I make it through the night I can fight another day
They say it's better to burn out than it is to fade away
I just hope to God I can fall into a sleep where I can stay

(Slaine)
It was a couple of years ago that I started becoming numb
No one could understand where all my words were coming from
Having visions of a nine-to-five, a wife, a blunt, a son
Of a life of hustle getting by with some of the running gun
Is it best to be a crumb? My ex says he's a bum
Lashing out in violence whenever my destiny it hung
In the balance, rum, I'm drinking gallons, some think that my flows
Are more poetic than the poems of Edgar Allen Poe
But I know that I'm at a challenge though
I can hold an old Calico to my dome and let my talents go
