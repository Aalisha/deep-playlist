This world's a tortured place to be
So many things to torment me
And as I stumble down this road it takes a toll
These days and nights I turn to You
No human hand can pull me through
No cosmic force or magic brew will ever do

But I can see it coming
You're not so far away
'Cause I can feel Your power
Surging through the whole of me

(chorus 1)
God is there and He is watching
He tells me all is well (it's supernatural)
God is there, there's no denying
He's supernatural (it's supernatural)
Supernatural

Beyond this physical terrain
There's an invisible domain
