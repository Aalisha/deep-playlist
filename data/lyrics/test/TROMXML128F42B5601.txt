Something has happened to me
I'm lost and unrequited
The things that I believe in
Have all been taken away

Your love for me has drifted
It's hard for you to admit it
You say that it's just a phase
And you think that I should stay

You're telling me of things we'll see tomorrow
But will you hear me cry
When I cry today
...
