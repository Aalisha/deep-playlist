My obsessions get the best of me
And lately, I've felt incomplete
Whenever I try to pull through
I slip further away from You

I'm sick of all this tension
My sanity can't be found
And I don't wanna go on livin' like
You're not around

It's time
I have to draw the line
It's gone way too far now
I won't wait another day

I need You
To fill the empty space
And take me from this place
I can't stay

Can't stay, can't stay
Can't stay, can't stay
Can't stay, can't stay
Can't stay, can't stay
...
