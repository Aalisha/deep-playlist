(Henri Belolo/Jacques Morali/V. Willis)

You got a bad reputation
Oooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, bad reputation
Oooh ooh

You got a bad reputation
Oooh ooh
Ooh, ooh, bad reputation

You got a bad reputation
Oooh ooh
Oooh ooh

You got a bad reputation
all around the town, mmm
You got a bad reputation
all around the town
And I cry (and I cry)
And I cry (and I cry)
And I cry (and I cry)
Lord, tell me why
You got a bad reputation for doing me wrong

You got a bad reputation (Bad reputation)
Gonna put you down, well, yeah
