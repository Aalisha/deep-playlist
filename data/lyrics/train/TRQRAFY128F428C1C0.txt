Different kind of people
From all the world around
Your my kind of people
Of love is what we found

Is everybody hearing me
This is how it's got to be
This is how we make the mark in history
I think it's time to realize
We're looking for the same in life
We want to, we need to be free

You can say what you want
Do what you want
Be what you want to be
But look again
We're two of a kind
You can dance how you want
Say what you want
Love who you want to love
But look again
We're two of a kind

Sexy young free people
Dance the cares away
The future is tomorrow
So lets party for today

Is everybody hearing me
This is how it's got to be
We want to, we need to be free
