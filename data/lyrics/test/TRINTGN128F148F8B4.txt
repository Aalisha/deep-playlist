I'm a blood
I'm a baller
You can call me nigga
Ain't no trackin' green like squad nigga
It's no joke
She frostin' like flakes
And when I go out
It's like easy babe
Good
And she says it
And she sounds like a daisy
You shout like a Shorty with a table
Mr L.A she fallin' like a Laker
I don't have to tell it
No speaking to the neighbor
I can't see them in one acre
Ever since I met shawty I feel like Hercules
And I'm smokin' bales of weed 'cause it grow on trees
Six golds in my mouth like a set of D's
With my West Boast blood bangin' burgundy
Rich bags under my eyes, nigga Birkin these
She says I want Victoria â€˜s Secrets
And I fuck her long, watch her decrease
Even though I'm a bless
I see see
She gets mad when I ride
I get B B
