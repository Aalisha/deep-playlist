(verse1)
It's time to drop the gas from the chamber
Niggas on awol rearrange your
Face with the quickness
And it's the garden block sickness that got a nigga in this shit
So you better watch your back
'cause c bo got the strap
Pulling the ski mask down
About to jack
'cause marks come up short
You better back back like an eight legged crawdad from the 44
Your'e scared to walk your alleys now
'cause now days niggas from my hood
Will snatch your ass out the fucking crowd
...
