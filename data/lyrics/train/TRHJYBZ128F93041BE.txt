If I could do it all again, I'd look more in the mirror.
Insted of finding someone else to blame.
If I could do it all again, I'd do a lot more prayin'.
Less cussin' bout the things that I can't change.
I'd laugh a little louder.Sing more in the shower.
Care a little less if I'm in tune.
Consentrate on who I am, not who I might have been.
If I could do it all again.
