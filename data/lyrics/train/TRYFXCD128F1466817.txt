Well it's me Hi-C and I'm about to wreck shop
I do damage when I rhyme so yo gimme nuff props
I go to work, I'm goin' beserk to dope beats
With strictly fly gear 'cos my style's unique
I'm trespassin'. All the girls heads that I'm gassin'
Fill her up son you'll get tipped for a job well done
I'm havin' fun, smooth sounds caress your eardrum
Flow 'cos I know mad styles and then some
Went to military school just like that movie Tap
So tip toe tap to my rap
Okay I know I'm bugged on the mic but I do what I like
Aye aye, I go pop just for you
I stay true to my people, where you at, where you at?
Let me hear ya say ho!
Yo that was crazy fat, bap-de-do-bap
