Picking up her clothes from the bedroom floor
She dressed in the dime light shinning from the hall
Quietly she slipped into a moon lit night
Leaving all her troubles behind

He over looked the little things that means so much
There was no sincerity left in his touch
Anyway she tried to please he put her down
He cannot criticize her if she ain't around
