I can't stand to watch the six o'clock news
It's enough to give an average, sensitive person the blues.
Can't get it up
I don't know about commercial appeal
But what you put in your head
Just can't help affect how you feel
So lets keep it up
Prophets of doom try to capture you
They get around like the asian flu,
But they can't get me
Because I go for the up

I'm on the up side
