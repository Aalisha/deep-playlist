There's been an accident (calm down)
There's been an accident
Breathe in and out, calm down (In and out, calm down)
In and out, calm down (In and out, calm down)

We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't

Breathe in and out, calm down
...
