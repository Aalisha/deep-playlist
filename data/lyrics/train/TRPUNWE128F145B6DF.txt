Take or leave us
Only please believe us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable.

It's our occupation
We're a dancing nation

We keep the pressure on every nigh
Explanations are complications

We don't need to know the where or why.

Taking chances
Bold advances

Don't care if you think we're out of line.
Conversation is interrogation
