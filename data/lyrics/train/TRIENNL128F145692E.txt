Ask me a question I'll tell you all I know
You ask for my advice
And then you take a different road
You traveled oh so far
Left everyone who cared far behind
Left us all behind

How could I have ever saved you
The only thing I'd ever done was cared
How could I have ever blamed you
You never promised that you would always be there
