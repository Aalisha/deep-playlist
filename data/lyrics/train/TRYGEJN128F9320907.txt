I watch you die inside so silently. You hide behind your walls, and don’t speak.
So come alive. This time, I’ll take the weight. Open your eyes before it’s too late.

So let it out. Just get it out. What’s in your head? Are the words just dead?
So let it out. Just get it out. It’s not the end.

Don’t paint it blue-hoo-hoo-hoo. When the wall’s closing on you,
Don’t paint it blue-hoo-hoo-hoo. Just let it out.

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
