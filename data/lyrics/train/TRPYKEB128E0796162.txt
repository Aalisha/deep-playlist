Can you hear it in your streets?
talk so cheap like tumbledown
empty words and dirty deeds
words so deep we all could drown

promise of a world so fine
a picture-postcard pepperdine
and all you have to do is sign
upon that dotted line

take the word of one who knows
hear it comes, there it goes
get yourself out while you can
to save you from the running man

I'll decide what I believe
no-one's gonna change me now
I say how I live this life
...
