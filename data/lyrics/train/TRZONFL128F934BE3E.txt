But puncture the skin or fracture the bone
The present pain insists we are mortal
Brother
A hammer to the knees disarms even the unassailable
As you live with every stir and exhalation
You are subject to death

Justify this perfection
Disconnection from humanity
A sentient form of heart and bone
Of warmth and thought
And you still break the body
Judgment has failed in the dominant
Warm flesh beaten cold
A bloodless husk lies one shade from physical death
...
