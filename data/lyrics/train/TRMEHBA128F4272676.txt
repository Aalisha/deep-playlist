Darkchild two thousand
Uh, come on
I like that, uh
Mya, you ready?
Put your gloves on
It's on, let's go

We fight all day
Make up all night
Our love's up and down
It makes the mood just right
For us to do what I love to
So if I pick a fight
You know what I'm up to
Don't shake your head
Baby instead
Give into me this fight
You won't forget
I promise you when we're through
You won't hesitate to say I'm sorry hoo

I just want to make up
'Cause I want you so much
That's why we have to stay
Gettin' into it, somedays
Never endin' it
Don't get mad at me
Sometimes I get the strangest needs
That's why I turn to you
So you can handle it baby
You're the man for it

We gotta make up tonight
That's why I wanna fight with you
Break the rules
So we can get it right
And I'll show you how I do
I wanna fuss and fight
