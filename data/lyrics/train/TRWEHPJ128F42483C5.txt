Come on!

And I can see her now
Dancing around, her drink in hand
All her baggage you tow
I just want to forget and let go of all the joy
All of the pain
I took your guilt and placed it into me
And now I kiss it goodbye
Our last dance ended fatally

Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Baby you just died
(You just died)
Who's sleeping on my side of the bed tonight?
Have you ever cried so hard?
Have you ever cried so hard?

And there she goes again
Another masquerade in false circumstance
She'll fuck you just for the taste
