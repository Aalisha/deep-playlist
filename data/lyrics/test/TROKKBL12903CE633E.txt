Hear that whistle, it's ten o'clock
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Come on baby, it's time to rock
(Don't let go, don't let go)
I'm so happy I got you here
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Oooooh-weeee, this feelin's killin' me
Aaaaaah-shucks, well
I wouldn't stop it for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight and don't let go
Thunder, lightnin', wind and rain
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Love is hummin' inside my brain
(Don't let go, don't let go)
I'm so eager I'm nearly dyin
