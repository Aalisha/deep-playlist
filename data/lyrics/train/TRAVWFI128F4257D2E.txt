Explosions in my thoughts keep going on and on
It's keeping me awake till the crack of dawn
I'm so paranoid
I hope nobody is ever gonna see me like this
I'm twisting and turning my eyes feel like they're burning
I don't know what I'll do please stop before I lose my mind

I am falling through the holes of my mind
