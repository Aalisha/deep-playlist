(*talking*)
Yeah ha-ha, the way we shine
The way we grind, Play-N-Skillz
Big Tuck big bucks, we don't give a fuck
Yeah we shining we grinding, hey let's go

(Big Tuck)
The big boss man, with a boss plan
I got a loft man, you can run laps and
Without touching some'ing, it ain't much of nothing
But a lil' luxury, five place surround bumping
Get your paper right, you a stunner right
My house where the sight, living room Harley bike
We'll out-stunt that, Houston I'll stunt back
600 fuck that, McClaren nigga black on black
Plus a Maybach, dub-deuce black flat
I'll mase cats, box Chevy stretch that
I'm on another level, you better come too
Bring your funds too, new stones aqua blue
