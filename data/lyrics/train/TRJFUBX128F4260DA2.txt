Time Again - Outcast

What would you say, what would you say?
Would you raise your hand in protest?
What would you do, what would you do?
Would you speak your mind and attest
Or would you fall through the cracks, lie flat on your back
Or be true to yourself and live life as an outcast?
I know! I know! I know I live life as an outcast
I know! I know! I know I live life as an outcast

It's a journey that I started long ago
It's a journey and where will I go?
With a path where I am all alone
And I am moving in no direction home
