Ohhhhh,
I was in love with you
I always needed you around
But you know
Just how the story goes
Just one of your
magical powers
Never let go
So tell me
When did life turn around
When did the moon fall down
When did the spell
start to fade
No use in running like a fool
I'm gonna use you like a tool
...
