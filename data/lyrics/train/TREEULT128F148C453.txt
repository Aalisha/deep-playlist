Do you know what it is like to run?
Do you know what it is like to live in fear?
Do you know what it is like to run?
Do you know what it is like to live in fear?

'Cause she knows what it's like to run
She knows what it's like to live in fear
Because she knows what it's like to run

Rape ritual
How can I stand in silence while you are raping my sister?
Ritual
I said I'll throw you in the wind because I ain't with that

Say what have we done to mother, sister, daughter, lover?
Beat them down to submission, into that corner of constant fear
Humanity reduced to a sexual commodity, objectification
Pretty faces, molded imagery

Damn they drop the dirty mack demands
She's more than booty to me, bypass her sexuality
Tradition, your sexism is what you want me to learn, surrender
Gender hatred, fade it to kill it, compassion returns

One out of three and they say my sisters are free
