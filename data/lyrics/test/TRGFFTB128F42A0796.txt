On the day you were born
The sun filled my eyes
I fell within the wars that rise

What were you here for? 
What will you find? 
Could I save your life, like you saved mine? 

[chorus]
Wait until the morning comes around
Wait for something beautiful
Wait to see if worry turns around
Wait, please wait

I tried to keep you from
Everything that was
So difficult for me
