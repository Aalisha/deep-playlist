Everybody's goin' out and havin' fun
I'm just a fool for staying home and havin' none
I can't get over how she set me free
Oh, lonesome me

A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round
I know that I should have some fun and paint the town
A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see
Oh, lonesome me

I'll bet she's not like me, she's out and fancy free
