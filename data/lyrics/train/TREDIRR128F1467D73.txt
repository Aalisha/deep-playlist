Baby, baby, baby hurt me bad
Baby, baby
Baby, baby made me cry
Baby, I wanna die

Somebody tell me where she's hiding out
I gotta find that cheatin' gal
Can't go, can't go, can't go sleep at night
Can't sleep, can't sleep, it's not right
Sunlight, sunlight in my eyes
Sunlight makes me rise

I can't sleep until my baby says it's over
I gotta hear it face to face
