Insightful yet uninspired,
There's magic in the air but it's stall where we are,
You won't get anything out of me.
'Cause, I'll never talk so who are you you've forgotten about
The oath you took, when all alone.

You sat through these sleepless wasted nights,
To find another chance to fight, keep trying you'll lose control.

I felt pain, I lost my patience.
I heard a voice say overrated
And by myself I figured out the truth.
I won't stop trying till you lose control
I'd walk straight with a blank expression
If I thought it could get your attention
I know all I need to bury you.
I won't stop trying till you lose control
