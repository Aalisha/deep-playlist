Take me out alive
Take me out it's all so stale
Give me another life
Excuse me if I tried and failed

And I don't mind if I fall
It's not that far at all

I got a new thing, it's so inspired
It's not the real thing but it's for me
Because the real thing, I don't desire
So it's the new thing I choose for me
Denial comfort me
