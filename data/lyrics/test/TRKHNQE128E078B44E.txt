Look into yourself and see
Do you know who you are? (who you are)
When you're feeling sad and blue
You should know that you are
The sun and the moon to me
I care for you can't you see
You don't need to go so far
And you know who you are (who you are)

Hey people don't look so down
Let me play in your game (in your game)
If you wanna scream and shout
You should not be ashamed
Do what you want to do
Don't let the world get on you
Listen what I have to say
Then you will be okay
Come together!
Now!

Come together...

Never too late to try
Don't give up on yourself
What you are searching for
Will be find, you will see
Just take it easily
Let yourself be free
Listen what I have to say
Then you will be okay
...
