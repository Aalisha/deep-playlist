(Austin Roberts / Bill LaBounty / Beckie Foster)

There's a star up above the horizon
And it's shining for you and me
Something tells me this was meant to be,
Do you feel like a dance in the moonlight,
Is your heart beating crazy like mine?
You've got something burning bright
Don't keep it locked inside.

Let it shine, show me your light
Let it shine, keep it shining into the night
Let it shine, don't hide it, it's something to see,
Let it shine, let your love, let it shine on me.
