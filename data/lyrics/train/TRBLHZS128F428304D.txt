Angel wore a green bar for a living
Sleeping in the sand every-night
Cindy's holding protests
But it ain'tno use to blame
Both sides feel the pain tonight
Hold yourself real tight
Deny...
Votes down, now fight!

The ground bleeds fire, hope they're watching my back
Eyes burning and my muscles eat glass
Kiss my frag, hope it sets me free
As I pray to the sky

Breakdown the door with a one legged huh!
Graduate, now you've worn your gun in
Now you're one...
Best be prayin' to the sky
