all the games you play,
i wont take the blame,
i gave you trust,
you spit it out and call my name,

i'm taking back whats left from all these
selfish things you say,
and i won't waste another day,
with all the games you play,
all the games you play,
an i'm so scared of all the ways,
you take my confidence away,
with all the games you play,
all the selfish games you play,

i'm alone again,
...
