Dust Dust Dust Dust

Got so close to love
I can almost taste the kill
been so close to love
but I cannot make a deal

Got so close to love
I can almost taste the kill
been so close to love
but I just can't close the deal

I was snow white till I started to drift
Baby I didn't care, till I saw you there
And your manner made my animal kick
But I just didn't dare, call me crazy yeah

Everything I ever had to lose
Is standing in the way of me and you
Panic built these walls in front of me
And nothing but my heart can set me free

Man get up
We're gonna start this fire
Tangled up
Because I know I should
Can't get up
Watch the flames go higher
Tangled up
We're gonna need more wood

Man get up
We're gonna start this fire
Tangled up
Because I know I should
Can't get up
...
