Crawling the walls through every crack and crevice teems
Blackness washing over the windowpanes, painting the buildings in between
Creeping down the alley ways, consuming every street
Soundless swarm of nothingness sure to doom us all

Pulling screaming earthlings into its toothless jaws
Endlessly beginning; spreading with no sign of stop
Horror of horrors truly maddening in size
Running just prolongs the end; inevitably it strides

Where has it come from? How can it be stopped?
