when the world is ready to fall on your little shoulders,
and when you're feeling lonely and small,
you need somebody there to hold you.
you can call out my name... when you're only lonely,
now, don't you ever be ashamed, you're only lonely,

when you need somebody around on the nights that try you,
(remember) i was there when you were a queen,
and i'll be the last one there beside you.
