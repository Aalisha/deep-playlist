I hope you never change
I hope you never go
I hope you'll always keep
Our little secrets though
But how'd we get here
At this height
And what's this talk of
Dead weight

I know we always drink
But we don't always fight
The landing lights are on
But we're just out of sight
Cos this thing's mobile
There's still wheels
And I'm not done yet
So hang on

You came along to change the grade
To raise the bar I'd made of late
...
