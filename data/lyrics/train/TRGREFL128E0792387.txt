Born is a human with a kung-fu spine
Equipped with a detector of "What's on your mind"
You jive, you shuck, you bob, you weave
And when you're down you've got something up your sleeve

And you've got it good as bad as it gets
You make your own incisions that come with regrets
You're in it to win it and make every minute count
You put it all together and dish it out

Hey, I know where you're from
It makes it that much nicer to meet you
Hey, I know what you've done
It makes it that much better to defeat you

All that knowledge, all those skills
All the gas it takes to get up top of the hill
And while the others try to take your spot
You wanna make them stop but you gotta make them stop
...
