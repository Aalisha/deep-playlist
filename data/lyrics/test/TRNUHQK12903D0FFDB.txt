Everything I love has been taken
I wonder what reason I have to live
Desperately I have searched for a meaning
Is it now time for me to let go of the world

The future that I began to believe in
Seemed so certain, I thought it was mine
That was where and how I would be living
A complete human being with a soul
That was only a dream in a nightmare
And the nightmare is where I now live
Empty life, empty hours without meaning
Hours of madness that make me let go of the world
