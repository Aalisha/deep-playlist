It’s been a year since last weekend 
when you swung by with an old friend
Carried out our future box by box
Stack of mail a tube of toothpaste
An empty zeppelin three cd case
Still a few things here that you forgot
They’re just a bad excuse
Just something I can use
To call you

Come on over
Drink my wine
Waste my candles
Waste my time
Tell me lies I won’t believe
Just don’t wake me when you leave
...
