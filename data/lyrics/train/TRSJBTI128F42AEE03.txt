[Akon]
Convict, convict, convict
[Youngbloodz]
Young-Young-Young-Youngbloodz
Young-Young-Young-Youngbloodz
That-Th-that-That-Th-that
That-Th-that-That-Th-that
Crunk-Crunk-Crunk-Crunk
[Sean Paul (Akon)]
I tote that thing, nah mean
Hat lean, clothes smell like green
And some white tees and white rees
About bread real G's get cheese
Back to the streets, back with (Akon)
Back for the A, reppin' for the slums
Put ya hood up show a nigga where ya from
And if they hate that then get the job done
[Hook: Akon]
Hey, I'm sure you know my steez
Rollin' presidential through ya hood like G's
Gotcha higher than Chris Tucker
