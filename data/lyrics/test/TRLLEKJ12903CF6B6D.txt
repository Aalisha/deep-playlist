What is it this time?
That's got you dragging your feet on the ground.
And who is it this time?
Which son of a bitch is trying to bring you down?
Are you gonna just sit right down and whine.
Are you waiting for someone to come and hlep.
Superman won't come and save you in the nick of time.
So you better start to think about saving yourself.
