Party, party, we gonna party
Party, party, we gonna party
Party, party, we gonna party
Party, party, we gonna party

Party, party, we gonna party
Party, party, we gonna party
Party, party, we gonna party
Party, party, we gonna party

I want people make you stomp your feet
Can't help dancing to this grooving beat
Party people having fun you'll meet
Get it down to our disco sound

People, people, don't you stand around
Clap your hands, let us party down
