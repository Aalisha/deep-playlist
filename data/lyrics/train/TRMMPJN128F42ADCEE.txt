Give me just a second so I can catch my breath
As I fall into the arms of love...
My heart is overwhelmed,
And I can barely speak,
As I'm face to face with my humanity...

See I've spent my share of time
Pretending that I knew all of the answers!
Answers without truth
Just the blind leading the blind away from you...

But I, I think you're still beautiful!
Enough to reach the unreachable...
