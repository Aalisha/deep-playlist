one questions what can't be done
you tear me down with the same thing
there's nothing thee and it's begun
what can you do when it all drains

down there, you go always
see if i care faded
down, don't you know where i'll be
cuz i'm here, on my own

waiting, when i'm waiting
(downtown now)
i've been here before, and i don't care where i'm going
so i'll say...

when you walk don't leave a note
just put your hands on the back door
when you talk it's just a joke
...
