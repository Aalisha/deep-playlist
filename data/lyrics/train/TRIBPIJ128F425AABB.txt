We're content to pitch our tent
When the glory's evident
Seldom do we know
The glory came and went

Moving can seem dangerous
In this stranger's pilgrimage
Knowing that you can't stand still
You cross the bridge

There's a higher place to go
Beyond belief, beyond belief
Where we reach the next plateau
Beyond belief, beyond belief
And from faith to faith we grow
Towards the center of the flow
Where He beckons us to go
...
