I count the falling tears
They fall before my eyes
Seems like a thousand years
Since we broke the ties
I call you on the phone
But never get a rise
So sit there all alone
It's time you realize
I'm not your fool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's foooool
I'm no fooool
Nobody's fool
Nobody's fool
Never again no no
You take your road I'll take mine
The paths have both been beaten
