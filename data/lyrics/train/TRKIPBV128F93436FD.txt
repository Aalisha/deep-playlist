it doesn't make you a slut cuz baby you can fuck whomever you want it just makes it more complicated but thats a lot of sex thats sixty-four dicks before you ever put your hand on mine i wish you would've lied cuz now i have to face the fact that i was number sixty-five i know it isn't fair for me to judge your past you've got way more bags than one boy could unpack what were you hoping to find lying on your back instant self esteem achieved through penetration i wish you would have lied cuz now
