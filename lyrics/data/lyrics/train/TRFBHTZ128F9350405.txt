Look at the way you live
Your back's against the wall
Just like a fugitive

That's running from the law
See your reflection
See the window to the soul
It brings the darkest fears
A loss of all control
I believe that it's a murder of the mind
You can't come back once you've crossed that line
What kind of life is this when all you know is pain
No one left to leave you, no one knows your name
