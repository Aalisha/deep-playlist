Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain is fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin', "It's all right"

Rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs flashin'
...
