I'm tired of being lonely, yeah
And I'm sick of my crew
'Cuz this ship is takin' on water, yes
And my socks are turning blue

Well, I've chased the farmers daughters

And I drink my share of brew, yeah
Well, I pull myself together again
And I put my ring on you, well

And if it was up to me
Well, I'll turn this thing around
I'll pull out all the stop, stop, stop, stops
