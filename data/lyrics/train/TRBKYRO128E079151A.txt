Eden's Crush
Miscellaneous
If You Don't Love Me
I don't understand
Why you have to talk behind my back
Why you tell your friends I'm no good for you
Why you tellin them you got someone new
Do you think I'm weak
Cause you see these tears roll down my cheek
Don't you know it hurts me deep inside
When I hear your friends telling all these lies
I can play the games that you're playing with me
You don't want to try me cause baby you'll see
I can find somebody who's gonna love me
Who's gonna want me baby
