Oh yeah, all right

Are you first teaching that to me
Then I hope that you can see
Time is not a shadow

If you could stand the test of time
Then I hope that you can find
The truth that you've been searching for

Make everything just right
Make everything just right
Make everything just right
Make everything just right

There will always be a fountain
As big as a mountain
Where the flow of love will glow

Just to catch you on this pleasure
...
