I could never be the one for you
You're so filled with hate
I could never treat ones like you do
It's time to change my fate
And every time i open up to you
All you do is you shut me out
And every time i've tried to work with you
All you do is you bring me down

[CHORUS:]
So how does it feel
To care for no one
How does it feel
