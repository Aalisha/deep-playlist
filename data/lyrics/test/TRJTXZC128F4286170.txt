Clouds part
Just to give us a little sun

There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love

There's a limit to your care
So carelessly there
Is it truth or dare?
There's a limit to your care

I love, I love, I love
This dream of going upstream
