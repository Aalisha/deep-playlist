All I need is you
All I need is you, baby
All I need is you
All I want is you

Stay with me through the night
Let me hold you close till morning light
Lay your head on my heart
Make love to me while it's still dark

Oh, no one but you
Could make me feel the way you do
You're all that I been praying for
'Cause the way you're loving me
I couldn't ask for anymore

All I need is you
See you're everything that I never had
And baby, all I need is you
See you're everything that I need so bad
