There ain't no way, to explain or say
How painful the hangover was today
In front of the toilet, hands and knees
Tryin' to breathe in-between the dry-heaves
My baby made me some coffee
Afraid that if I drink some
It's probably comin' right back out me
Couple of Advil, relax and chill
At a stand still with how bad I feel
I think I need to smell fresh air
So I stepped out the back door and fell down the stairs
The sunlight hit me dead in the eye like
It's mad that I gave half the day to last night
My bad sight made me trip on my ass right
Into that patch of grass like "That's life"
All of the sudden, I realize somethin'
The weather is amazin', even the birds are bumpin'
Stood up and took a look and a breath
And there's that bike that I forgot that I possessed
Never really seen exercise as friendly
But I think something's tellin' me to ride that 10 speed
The brakes are broken, that's alright
The tires got air and the chain seems tight, huh

Hopped on, and felt the summertime

It reminds me of one of them Musab lines
