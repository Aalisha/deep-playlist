We're breaking things we can't repair
But none of us will take the blame
No, nothing can be done this time
All the memories that we've made
I threw them all away
There's no need to talk it over

Don't let me get you down
Let's just move on
I am setting you free

'Cause I don't wanna hurt no more
No, I don't wanna make you
Go through one more rainy day
No, I don't wanna hurt no more

Strange enough, I always knew
I'm taking off today
...
