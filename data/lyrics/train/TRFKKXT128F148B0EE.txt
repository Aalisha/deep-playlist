I tried to come down from you
I tried with your voice in my head
Knocking me back
Every inch I moved
I'm a sucker for a good lie
The way you say you understand
and how you always talk of catching me
but never open up your hand

Tell me does the world revolve the same
Tell me do the people all take care of you
Did you doubt the curve of the earth
And every word.
Every word
I'll bet you heard
