Harley

Hark to Roualt's white insanity
Clowns in drag concealing vanity
This is hardly Paradise
We're still in search of petty scorn.

Images so dead, in mourning
Clap and cheer the man performing
This is hardly Paradise
We're still in search of petty scorn.

Couch my disease in chintz-covered kisses
Glazed calico cloth, my costume this is
Come to Pablo Fanque is in Indigo
We'll show you pastel shades of rhyme.
