*Glass smashing*
*Dog's barking*

There's an intruder, in my house
He cut my phone-line, can't dial out
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

A couple o' cocktails, will send me to jail
There's a couple of cops, hot on my trail
But this time when I get pulled over, there's a Doberman Pincher
And a Pit Bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit, foolin' with me

Quit foolin' with me, bitch you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat, why it always gotta be
An issue when you're me and which you're gonna see
In the long run, I'mma be the wrong one

You wanna harass, with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass
Where was you at, last night when them assholes
Ran up on my grass, rapper slash actor
Kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass

They took away my right to bare arms
What I'm 'posed to fight wit' bare palms
Yeah right, they comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns, we as Americans

We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, surviving by any means
