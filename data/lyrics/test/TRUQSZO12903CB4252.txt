Girl, you are to me
all that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life
to you always

A love like yours is rare
it must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way
for always

And we both know
that our love will grow
And forever it will be
you and me

Ooh, your life is sun
chasing all the rain away
When you come around
you bring brighter days
...
