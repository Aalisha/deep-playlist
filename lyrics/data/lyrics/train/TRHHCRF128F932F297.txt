Turn the corner, too familiar
Turn around into your past
Ohh

You hide and seek the same addiction,
Hope you find the better one of the last
Ohh

You’re sleepwalking through your big bed of lies
Wish on up your new star every night - Oh yeah
I see you’re at it again, sittin’ on your hands
Waitin’ around for the wind to change direction - Oh yeah
There you go again
Stuck in your head, havin’ a ball in you’re fully optimistic way
