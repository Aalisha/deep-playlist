...Dancing on the borderline...
...4-3-2-1...

Hello, although I'm a static Zero.
I'm fighting all your wars,
While you dwell in your hypocrisy
You think the world is fine,
When all the evil's overlined
Before you wake up this morning...

Well, hello there, you're the local superhero?
Your stronghold's but a paper bag,
We suffer for your promised land
Excuse is really thin,
Hide your revealed Achilles' heel...
Before a new brave morning...
