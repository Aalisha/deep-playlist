Take your little lips and kiss me take your little arms and squeeze me
Let's live a little before we say goodbye
I'll draw my money out of the bank I'll buy you roses and pretty things
Let's live a little before we say goodbye
You'll wear a yellow ribbon in your wavy hair
I'll wear the suit you like and a big bowtie
