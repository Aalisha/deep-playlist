Numbing the pain
Pathetic creations of unresolve
Pain controls from within
The dark knows me well
Draining my essence as I sit in silence
Walking empty through the rest of my days

Barren plains filling the void
Winds that chill, frozen in all movement
Repeating followed patterns
Days last for nothing, cold, so cold
