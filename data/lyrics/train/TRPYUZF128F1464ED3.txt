Lover out my way
I'll stand up to anything
Move on out this heartbeat
The sun is over

A new day, a new way
I'm coming out this time
A new name, let's play the game
And march on down the line

I've got lots to share
About the way I feel inside
Round and round this place
Like a shotgun fire

A new day, a new way
...
