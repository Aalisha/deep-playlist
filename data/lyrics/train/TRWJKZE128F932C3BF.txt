I've got nothing left, got nothin'
nothin' left to lose
I've got nothing left, I've got nothin'
nothin' left to lose
I just gave it away for nothin', not that it meant anything to you
I've got nothing left, I've got nothin'
nothin' left to lose
I always thought I was a trivia question unfit to be asked
I've given away my fork and spoon but kept my knife for inspiration
lay down in a chrome box with me that's too expensive to die in
