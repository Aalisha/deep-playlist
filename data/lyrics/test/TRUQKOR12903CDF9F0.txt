In this room full of people
I am still ten thousand miles away
In the eye of my broken mind
I woke that night and cried out
I saw you running through the flames
I knew that you were gone forever

I've lain down my weapons
I'll take part in this no more
I turn my back to all of this
Though they stabbed me with the scorn
The choice was never mine to make
Why did it have to end up here

It is well that war is so terrible
...
