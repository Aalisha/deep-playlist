And this rush in holly world we're living
How do you is bad girl to giving so easily
I'm not playing right again choose listen to me
Uh... uh.
Word only wanna own to know me
And if you only own meet you then show me
Let's slow and down
I'm not playing sad games
With your heart or mine
But this time

Let's make love in slow motion
'Cause I'm loving you
To take a long you are
We'll make love in slow motion
Lady, to the day and to the night
Love in slow motion

Uh...
