Superthick chunks of a broken life and reality
at the dinner table come to me
i said goodbye my friend my exit's here,
the road's so long, a million miles or so,
too much for me i got to go,
my navigator's here.
They say it's nice this time of year,
they say it's nice this time of year,
they say it's nice this time of year on jupiter,
except for the meteors (if you dont mind the meteors)
And nebraska's so flat that i don't care,
i'll never use this map, have i made it clear
i don't know jack but i'll stay sincere,
...
