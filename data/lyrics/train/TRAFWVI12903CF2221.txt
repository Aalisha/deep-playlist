Can you feel it? It's in the air tonight
Can you touch it? Makes you feel alright
Feel the power, let me se your hands
Please come closer even closer
Now let's break down the fence

Let's go crazy we won't stop until we make you go wild
Don't be lazy altogether now stand up and shout

Let's make rock
What are you waiting for
Lets make rock
I gonna give you more
