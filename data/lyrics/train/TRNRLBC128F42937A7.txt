Is that you?
Looks like you've changed your ways again
But is that you now?
It's funny how I can't remember

Yeah, well I knew you better than that
At least I thought I knew you then
But what I know now
It's not always a happy ending

Yeah, but hey... here comes that rainy day again
But hey... look at me, I don't feel like cryin', no-woah
And hey... here comes that rainy day again
...
