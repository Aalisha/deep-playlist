It's another back-door sneakin' in
Where you been midnight?
Quiet as a mack truck, lots-a luck
Thinkin' up an alibi

But every light in the house is on
Everything is gone

She left me no chance at redemption
No further exemption
Just a big red goodbye and lipstick on the wall
Goodbye says it all

No long explanation, no reconciliation
No let's talk it over number, I can call
Goodbye says it all
...
