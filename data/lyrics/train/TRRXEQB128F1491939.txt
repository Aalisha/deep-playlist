When the snake of love
Starts pulling you under
And it wont let go
'Til it starts to thunder
And there's not a cloud in the sky
Gonna make him shake
I guess old habits are hard to break

Cause even the good ones
Just seem to go bad
Might be the sweetest love
That you ever had
You just cant let em go
For goodness sake
I guess old habits are hard to break

The trouble with sainthood, darlin'
