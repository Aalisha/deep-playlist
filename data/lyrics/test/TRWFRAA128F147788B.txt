Rain keeps on falling
Sun refuse to shine
Baby quit your stalling
And say that you are mine

'Cos I've got so many troubles
Oh, I feel like I could cry
Going down in the subway
Jump on the train-tracks and die

Down in the subway
I hide these tears of mine
Down in the subway
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry 'til the end of the line
...
