Rip the flesh with our gnashing teeth,
The inside of the dying beast,
From the book of Enoch,
To the bible codes,
We spend the final days still looking for that gold,
And when we find it, how will we know?
Will it cleanse the rot from our souls?
Will it help to saves us from the fires below?

Throw the stones and smash the citadel,
Search the ruins of the fort that fell,

From the book of Enoch,
To the bible codes,
We spend the final days still looking for that gold,
...
