Lets start the first verse with who do you thinkyou are?
Lights of admiration... I drag my heels off to bed.
These words roll of my tongue so easy,

We built the roads for you to walk on,
and we knew you would hate this.
Design these walls with a thousand words.
I heard a voice speak against the heavy.
