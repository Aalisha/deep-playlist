"Oh yeah it is!"
"Colour is not important. "
Lick a shot!
"Oh!"
Comin' at ya
"Fire!"

Zippedy do da, zippedy hey
Cried oh my, wanna get that punk with my AK
And get on the way
On a mission, puffin' on a fat ass jay
Prude! You can't hang
Flash back on the skills when I used to bang
On the corner
I'll warn ya
Gonna roll on ya
Fool
Hit ya with a golden rule
Don't turn your back on the street
When I hit that corner, feel the concrete
If ya push that by like nothin'
Watch me turn to a psycho all of a sudden
Blastin' at these fools with a passion
Look at the Glock when it's time for some action

Let the gatt hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hummm

Let the gatt hummm
...
