I know, I know how it can be sometimes
When you feel like, y'knahmsayin like
Y'know when you feel like there's nobody you can turn to or when it's
Shit start getting real out here
I know how it feels man, we can identify with that shit for real
Let y'all know it's gonna be ok y'knahmean?
It's gonna be aight for real...
Aiyyo, as time passes I'm just keeping the faith
Composing my thoughts and rearranging my place
People ask, I just tell 'em I'm straight
My girl was throwing up this morning
I'm praying it was something she ate
Feeling pains in my torso now
I scream fuck the world but mother-nature's taking autho' now
Tryna regulate her stress and pain also now
