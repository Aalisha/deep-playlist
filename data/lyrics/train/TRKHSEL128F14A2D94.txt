Memories and silence fills each room
Overwhelming heavy as the tidal waves consume
Buried underneath the dust & gloom

Pictures of a happy bride and groom
Ferry rides around the harbor on our honeymoon
Wedding gifts of pots and pans
Sleeping while were holding hands
It's grace he lays upon us as we spoon
