featuring Marisol Angelique

Everytime I see you I just can't help it
The tensions so thick it gets steamy
I know that you want to you will not regret it
But hurry I will not wait endlessly
Come closer darling a little bit more
The timing is just right I want you tonight so

[Chorus:]
Kiss me
Don't you wanna make me feel good
I know it's really what you want
