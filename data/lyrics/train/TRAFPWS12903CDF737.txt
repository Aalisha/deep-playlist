You've been sittin' here 
For quite some time
Puttin' down a lot of scotch
One eye is winkin' at me
And another's lookin' at your watch
Well I don't wanna hear about 
No headache, baby
As strong as you've been comin' on
If you don't want me, just say
Honey, I'll be gone

Well, baby... well, maybe
I shouldn't call you baby no more
You say business like this
You don't wanna sell me no bacon
Don't you haul it out the door
Cause I want you, I need you
...
