Oh No, No Yeah
Well, Well, Well, Well
Mmmmmm

You are my personal Jesus
Without you where would I be?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
If I must talk to the father
Then I must go through thee
Ohhh

I don't know why you love me
Uh huh
In spite of what I do
Hey, hey
You're always thinking of me
Uh huh
I'll always think of you
Uh
So glad I know you (Know You)
And I know of you
â€˜Cuz he's a friend of mine
I talk to you all the time
So glad I know you
No one above you
He always been by my side
And you're my personal, personal Jesus

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
