Waterloo Waterloo
Where will you meet your Waterloo?
Every puppy has his day
Everybody has to pay
Everybody has to meet his Waterloo

Now old Adam
Was the first in history
With an apple
He was tempted and deceived
Just for spite
The devil made him take a bite
And that's where old Adam
Met his Waterloo

Waterloo Waterloo
