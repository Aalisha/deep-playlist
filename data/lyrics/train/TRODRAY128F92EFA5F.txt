Well I don't live like a king
And I don't drive a big car
The gypsy woman was right
When she said I would go far

Just wait on time baby
I'll be there one day
Yeah, and until I get there baby
All I can do is hope and pray

Well you say you'll stick with me baby
Stick with me through thick and thin
I know someday baby
My bad luck has got to end
