Quicksand is a coat of arms,
Lose sleep, it's a liquid fiction.
Last rights every Friday night,
Am I way cool with the lights on?

High tide tied around the neck,
The same song everybody's bleeding.
What makes me so different?
The insides work the same.

You ever fear the dark?
Impressions of your future:
The slightest gravestone whisper,
The stillness of your heart.
I feel it growing dark.
A fever inching deeper,
A fever inching to the core.

I'll kick tomorrow,
Fight back at the pouring rain.
I'll send the weekends down the drain, down the drain.
