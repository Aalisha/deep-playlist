Yo. three-hundred and sixty-five days a year
We preoccupy self to find life's true meaning
We indulge irrelevant contradiction
Contradiction which steps up growth
Live life each day like it could be your last
(Verse One)
Yo. I'm from a place where some mothers sell they babies for crack
Where young cats buy gats, shoot and never look back
Where the whites live with the whites, and the blacks live with the blacks
But somehow we unite, through the culture of rap
I'm from Brooklyn, word to the Dodgers, Russian massages
Where thugs bust guns, and sons are raised without they fathers
We do away with has-beens, rock the latest fashion
The rule's never rat - what you want to know, or who's askin
Just some habits of highly effective MC's
Y'all is pussy rap, my speech made you weak in the knees
But talk's cheap, I'm straight from the streets
I'm action-oriented when I'm screamin KILL CORRUPT POLICE
