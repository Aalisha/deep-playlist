Got a certain little girl that's on my mind
Great gosh o' mine, she looks so fine
She's the best girl that I've ever had
And sometimes she shows me she feels so bad

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
She broke my heart but I love her just the same now

Hush, hush
I thought I heard her calling my name now
Hush, hush
I need her love and I'm not ashamed now

(Good love)
Early in the morning
(Good love)
Late in the midnight

(Good love)
I want it and I need, y'all
(Good love)
Got to gotta have it

She's got a loving like quicksand
