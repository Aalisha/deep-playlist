Shoot the kids at school,
All in a bloody pool,
I'll show the teachers too,
'Cuz they can't tell me what to do,

Getting B's and C's
Saying "thanks and please"
You broke the golden rule,
Your staying after school,

Life is real estate,
To the ones I hate,
Cops say you must refrain,
From squattin', drinkin', and hoppin' trains
