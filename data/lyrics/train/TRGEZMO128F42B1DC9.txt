jack be nimble, jump and spin
jack's a little hard to handle but he plays to win
now the sheep's in the meadow, and the kids are sleepin'
little bo peep, she don't know the company you're keepin'

hey tonya
the hour is overdue
for the hunter's moon in you
to come out and shine

hey tonya
i would not take you to task
for the wolf behind the mask
she's a friend of mine

and anytime
they surround you with their silver-bullet tongues
...
