Castaways on anguish island
Haunted by a thousand ghosts
Tortured to complete denial
Threatened by the truth
Propagate in bitter anger
Multiply in clone like twins

Serve, obey, believe

Kneel down
Bow before his feet
The master of deceit
Bloodstained, raging liar
Rule with death and fire
Decadent Messiah
