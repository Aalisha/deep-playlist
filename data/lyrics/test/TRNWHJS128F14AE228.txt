This time it's all here
You felt so long ago
And what can you do about it?
Stop your crying
And what will he aks you?
Now that it's over with
But behind that face there's only hope, in you
In you

Do you have to feel this way?
Cause you never stay the same
Do you notice how you change when you believe?

Your just like I said before
