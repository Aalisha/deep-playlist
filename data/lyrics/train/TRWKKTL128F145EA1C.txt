What the hell am I doing down in Kansas City
Know damn well it ain't where I belong, no no
Think I'll quit my job come five o'clock
Find my lonely way back home

Well, my baby said just what are you trying to prove here
Really want to leave me here all alone
Said I'm tired of staring at this ocean full of Yankees
I'd rather be in Texas on my own, oh yeah

Chorus:
Now we were southbound 35
We were headed down the road
Hit the border by the morning
To let Texas fill my soul
To let Texas fill my soul
...
