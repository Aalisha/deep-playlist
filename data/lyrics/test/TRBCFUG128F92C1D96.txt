You're so sexy
Heaven help me please
I need to get my mind right
And it's so hard because
You're so incredible
Those lips of yours so luscious
I just wanna bite
And I could do that all night

(Sexy gloss, Matte or Frost)
Don't matter cause it's coming off
You're so sexy, I can't help myself
(Ruby Red, Pink Champagne)
Don't matter cause it ends the same
Never lasting when I get to you

Crazy crazy wonderful
Can you really feel it?
Uh oh oh
I wanna be your cherry kiss
You can put your lips like this
Crazy crazy wonderful
Can you really feel it?
Uh oh oh
I wanna kiss you all the time
