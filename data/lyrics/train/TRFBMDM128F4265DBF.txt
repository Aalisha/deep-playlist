Security, yeah yeah
I want some security
I want security... yeah
Without it I'm at a great loss
Yes I am, now
Security, yeah, yeah
And I want it any cost, yes I do now

Oh...
Don't want no money now
Don't want no pay
But with security, yeah, yeah
I'll have all these things
Yes, I will now

Security, yeah
...
