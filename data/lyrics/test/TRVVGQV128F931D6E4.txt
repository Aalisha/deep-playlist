I'm the last
I'm dying
I've left no one behind
Lived with open eyes

But now I'm old and blind
Can't see the desolation
But my old bones can see
Sit on a wasted planet

It's my last memory
I'm the last man on earth
I'm dying
I'm the last man on earth
I'm dying

I've wiped them all away
Scoured them from this world
No one left to play
No one left to plague

In flames of immolation
The last of them is gone
...
