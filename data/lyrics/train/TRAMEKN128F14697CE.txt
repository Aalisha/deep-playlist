In the healthy, wealthy state of mental hygiene
We will teach you how to think a clean way
There'll be no more dirty looks and no more dirty books
Now for your own good, we will take the choice away

There is a limit in the state of mental hygiene
Oh, to the difference of opinion we can allow, oh yeah
Now we must close an open mind if it's open to a different kind
Well, how can you hurt us

If we clean up in the monkey house tonight
Oh yeah, you're gonna be alright
