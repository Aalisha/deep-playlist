I never thought, I never dreamed
That things would get the better of me
But then a shadow crept just behind me

Oh I guess you can't run
Forever on your own
No, no

Tell me, tell me
Will you walk with me
Just for a little while
Until the feeling's gone

Tell me, tell me
Will you walk with me
Just for a little while
...
