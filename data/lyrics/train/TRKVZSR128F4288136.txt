Can you try to hide
What's in your heart
What's on your mind
Can you carry on
Like nothing's wrong
Go on and on

Are you sure about that

You've been pushed
You've been shoved
You've been left and unloved
Oh why do you still stay
So many tears that you cry every night
But ya know your life doesn't have to be this way

You got hurts deep inside
It's only right that someone should pay
Can't forget all the scars
He left on your heart
All the promises he made

You've gotta let it out girl
You've gotta let it go
You've got give it up
If you really wanna know
The truth about life girl
The secret of love
Is living inside you
It's dying to break through
the walls around your heart

Can you try to hide
What's in your heart
What's on your mind
...
