Just because a teardrop
Falls down from your face
Doesn't mean that love is gone
It's in another place

Just because the moonlight
Falls down from the sky
Doesn't mean that love is gone
I see it in your eyes

I see it in your eyes
I can see it in your eyes
I see it in your eyes
I can see it in your eyes

Just because the clouds come
Don't let them make you sad
They only last a little while
You'll find it's not too bad

Keep the sun within you
Let it shine on through
...
