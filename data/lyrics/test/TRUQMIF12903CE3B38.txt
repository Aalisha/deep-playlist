[Alvin playing harmonica]

[Dave, speaking]
Alvin, put that harmonica down.

[Alvin, speaking]
Why? 

[Dave, speaking]
Because we're gonna sing, that's why! 

[Alvin, speaking]
Not again! 

[Dave, speaking]
Never mind. Now look fellas, this is a pretty song so let's try not to goof it up.
Are you ready, Simon? 

[Simon, speaking]
Sure, let's go! 

[Dave, speaking]
All set, Theodore? 

[Theodore, speaking]
Hot dog, you bet! 

[Dave, speaking]
Are you ready, Alvin? 

[Alvin plays his harmonica]

[Dave, speaking]
Ready, Alvin?
