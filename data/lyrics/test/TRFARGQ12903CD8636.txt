You win the prize for being the first one
I wash the blisters off my hands
Because and in spite of this breed
Nothing remains excluded
No difficult choices made
The silence, the silence will reach you

Tempted by your core
Cease to be, cease to live
Tempted by your core
Devoted to peel - denying to feel

Exit granted, feel the tension
Now step out of this dimension
Inwards growing intention

A state of mind one could envy
Lick up the pressure that I have she'd

Hate defends
Hate repels
