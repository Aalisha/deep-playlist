Life is a game where nothing is real
only you, only me
Right from the start we chase an ideal
fooling you, fooling me

Are you hearing what I hear
Are you feeling what I feel

You'r still no. 1 but they're coming up to get you
Young eyes burning bright they can see a better way
You won't sleep tonight but that's the price you pay
