This 'ol wheel keeps on rollin' down the road
This 'ol wheel keeps on rollin' down the road

Oh gravel and dust fly up off of truck tires
down a dirt road
In Nashville, In the summertime, In 1996
I was listenin' to my dad and Johnny Cash
Doin' chain gang and talkin' trash with Savannah and smokin' cigarettes
But it wasn't that long till I tasted the salt of the sea
Cause she was still in love with the guy she left for me so
She stood there cryin' as I packed my pack
And I knew that I was lyin' when I said that I'd be back

This 'ol wheel keeps on rollin' down the road
...
