Keep off the track
And keep your feet
Down and you're only saving me
It's not easy staring at me
Look at the way I'm feeling weak

I'll wait for another double take
From you
'Cos I don't know what to do
I'll wait for another double take
From you
'Cos I don't know what to do
I'll wait

Keep off the track
