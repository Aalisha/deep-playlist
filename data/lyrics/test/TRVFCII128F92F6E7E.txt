Is it real?
We're always the same
We're almost undone now
Well I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

Waiting to call
Of what would you say?
And can you come over?
Well I was caught in the rain
Wasting my time on the ground

It was you
Who could get me high
With whatever you say
You're telling me something real

What we do
It doesn't matter now
Whatever it takes
...
