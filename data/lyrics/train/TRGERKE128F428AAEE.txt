I don't don't don't believe i fell alseep talk's a waste of time.
the roller coaster that i rode with her on valentine's
and all i see, i don't don't don't believe.
and what you see is what you get with me.
wasting all your time

going all the way
looking so helpless
everyday
daddy's little defect
all the same
keep your secrets away from me
if you wanna be mine

so don't don't don't make a sound.
your father's around.
to play with your head.
gift wrap guilt trip kisses.
left you naked in your bed.
and all i see i don't don't don't believe.
and what you see is what you get with me.
im wasting all your time...
wasting all your time
