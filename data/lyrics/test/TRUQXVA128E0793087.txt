I don't know why
I always act as a fool,
everytime
I get close to you
My head start(s) to aching
My knees start to shaking
If this is love,
I'd rather have the blue(s)

Now, everytime
I hear you call my name
I jump so high,
you can call me Superman
You could sign my name
if they see you coming
at my bank
