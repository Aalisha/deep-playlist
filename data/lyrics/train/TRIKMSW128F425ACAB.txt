Sitting in a water crying
Living in a world of crime
Talking ´bout the world I see
You gotta breathe
And all I have felt

Out of me
It´s all corrupted
It´s kind of rock and then rolling
As the government´s growing
I´m wondering what is next

Sitting in a water crying
Living in a world of crime
Talking ´bout the world I see
You gotta breathe
And all I have felt
...
