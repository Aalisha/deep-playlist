This is dedicated to all the good men

I want me a man, you know the kind of man
That don't mind cooking me dinner
I want me a man, you know the kind of man
That all night in bed he's a winner

I want me a man, you know the kind of man
That gotta body like a gladiator
'Cause I want me a man, a real kind of man
And he ain't gotta have a lot of paper

Just be good to me
Tell me I'm the one you need, boy
Just be good to me
'Cause I don't wanna search no more

I'm ready to give a man all this good love
I'm ready to blow your mind 'til you can't get enough
Just be good to me
I don't think I'm asking too much
Just be good
