Who are we to be emotional?
Who are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?
Who are we to turn each others heads?
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds?
Oh, I don't like the way I never listen to myself

I feel like I'm on fire, I'm too shy to cry for help
Oh, I don't think you know me much at all
This love is be and end all
This love will be your downfall
This love is be and end all
