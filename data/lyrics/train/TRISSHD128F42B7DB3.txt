How can you just sit and be cool
The music's growin' and it's makin' me move
Come on and get up (Well, hey, hey)
Come on and get up

How can you just stay in your seat
The music's callin', so get up on your feet
Come on get up (Oh, whoa, well)
Come on and get up

Chase me
Chase me, honey, alright
You can chase me
Chase me through the night

Come on and chase me
Chase me, honey, alright
You can chase me
Chase me through the night

Can't funk it tomorrow
So funk it tonight
If you gonna do it, yeah
