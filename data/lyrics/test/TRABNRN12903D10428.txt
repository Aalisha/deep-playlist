Take time to give thanks, make time to be giving
I'm gonna stop and think twice about the way that I'm living
did I say a kind word, am I proud of my actions
you know a job well done gives me satisfaction

Can I earn your trust, your love and affection
just one step at a time in the right direction
I'm gonna aim for the sky, keep my feet on the ground
raise my voice to the heavens, make a joyful sound

Na na na na na na na na
Make a joyful sound

Can I sing for my supper and play for my rent?
