It's love making 101
What you're talkin' about is shit, girl
But I'm gon' show you how it's done

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Girl, you take everything like
You gon' work that thing and put it on me
And I'm tryna figure out how you gon' act like that
When you don't know me

Girl, you betta ease up
Before I have come through and make you a believer
Class is in session girl
You be the student, I'm the teacher

I've been all around
Never met one like you and fussy, too
Tonight it's goin' down
Just tell me those three words and I'll do whatever I got
