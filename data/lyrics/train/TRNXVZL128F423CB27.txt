Heads high, kill dem wit it now
Just mek a bway know you nah blow
Heads high, kill dem wit now
No bway ain't got no secret fi yow

Heads high, kill dem wit it know
Just mek a bway know you nah blow
Heads high, kill dem wit it now
Tell dem say Vegas say so

Mi wan you skin, you teeth an mek mi see it
If you sure from you born say you never do it
You a nuh freak, one man you keep
An him never yet complain say you deep

You mek you vow, you nuh answer to yow
An a one man a sample you chow chow
Lift up you brow an mek a guy know
Say him fi move him blow, wow and sing again
