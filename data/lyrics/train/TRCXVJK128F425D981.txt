Do you believe in the
Restoration of a broken life
Hiding behind a face, yeah
You never know what you might find

There in the darkness beneath the surface
Of time and space
Could be a treasure that you'd only see
Through the eyes of grace

Looking for a diamond in the black coal
It feels good when you strike gold
Diamond in the black coal
If you never look then you're never gonna know
