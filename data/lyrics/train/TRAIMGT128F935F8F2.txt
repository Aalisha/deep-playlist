Little girl, where did you come from?
A-don't you know
That we could have a lot of fun?
You just moved into my neighborhood
But you oughta be in-a Hollywood

An I want this understood
You're lookin' go-oo-ood
You're lookin' good

You're not very tall
But you're stepping high
Eyeballs flashin'
As you walk by

The cats on the block
Wanna know your name
...
