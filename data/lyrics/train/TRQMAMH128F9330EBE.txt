Don't get stuck in the halo (don't, don't, Tinchy Stryder)
Cause you don't wanna let go (don't, don't)
Don't get stuck in the halo (don't, don't, Skyliner)
Cause you don't wanna let go (don't, don't)

Yo, as soon as I step in, scopin'
Early, soon as I get in, 
And I came move words in danger, 
For the guys here, to he's on the next ting
I can see you're the best in here, 
And I've got room keys in my pocket ready, 
Lift or stairs, just meet me there, 
Said you can't breathe so I gave you air, 

I approach the girls with ease, 
Somebody told 'em I've got keys, 
The room number's 303, 
So you play your role, I'll do me, 
If you roll up, I will set you free, 
If you need help, I can help you leave, 
Come chill man, it's all on me, 

Don't get stuck in the halo (don't don't)
Cause you don't wanna let go (don't, don't)
Don't get stuck in the halo (don't, don't)
Cause you don't wanna let go (don't, don't)

It's like they're waiting over there, 
When it's poppin' over here, 
Why you waitin' over there? (No, oh)
I see you standin' over there, 
When it's poppin' over here, 
You start acting like you care, (Woah)
