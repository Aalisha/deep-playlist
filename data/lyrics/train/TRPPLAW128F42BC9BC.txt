Do It
Yeah
Lets Go
Whoo
This is feelin real good
Well you know it feels good to feel good

You look familair girl
I should remember girl
If i ever ran into you
Oooh
Refresh my memory
Ya smile is killing me
Where did we go and what we do?
Ooh
Wait its coming back
You was at that club
You spilled your drink
On
Me
Damn
I wanted you
You disappeared
But now your back
Lets take it from here

Do it
Do it
I gotta do it
We gotta do it this time around
Lets do it tonight
Do it
Do it
I gotta do it
We gotta do it this time around
Lets do it tonight

Girl this is kinda cool
Me bumpin into you
You here alone or with you man?
I dropped up all before
