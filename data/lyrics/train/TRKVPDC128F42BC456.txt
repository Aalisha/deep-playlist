Well I met in a small town bar not far from home
She was having second thoughts about a man who was always gone
Said the only way to get to him was a telephone
So she held on to me when she couldn't hld her own

Chorus:
She said I can be had but I can't be bought
and I can be bad lord if I don't get caught
but I'd rather be loved than left alone
than be here in the middle some where between right and wrong
