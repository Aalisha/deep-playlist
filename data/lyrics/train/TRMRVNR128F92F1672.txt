Everybody loves the star
When he’s on the top
But no one ever comes around
When he starts to drop

But you were someone special
You stuck through thick and thin
But I was much too busy trying to shine
To let your love shine in

Let you slip away
I must have been insane
Stop in the name of love
Don’t make me live my life in vain

Give me one more chance
That’s all I ask of you
Just one more chance
I’ll make it up to you

Just one more chance
That’s all I ask of you
I’ll build a world for two
I’ll make it up to you

Now since I’m all alone
