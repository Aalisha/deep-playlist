Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa 
Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa

I keep singin' them sad sad song y'all,
Sad song is of all I know.
I keep singin' them sad sad song y'all,
Sad song is all I know.

It has a sweet melody, tonight,
anybody can sing it, any all time

It got to your heart, put you in a groove,
and when you sing this song, it will make your whole body move

It goes

Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa
Your turn
