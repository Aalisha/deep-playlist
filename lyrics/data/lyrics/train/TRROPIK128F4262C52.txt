C'mon

C'mon

Aiyyo, you betta flee Hobbes or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rapper's hearts pumpin' like Reebok's
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be large if the crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go poom poom and yo' guns go pow pow

I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shottie smokin'
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie, I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopee
I run with sturdy clicks, I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty six
Step to this you're good as gone, word is bond
I leave mics torn when I put it on

So put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon, put it on and on and on
C'mon put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon, put it on, represent, put it on, c'mon

Nobody can take nuttin' from Big L but a loss chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast the shottie
