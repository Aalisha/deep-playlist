Camon' yeah, uh
Uhh, yeah
We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night, havin' a blast
Cause baby, I need you here

Girl, I'm on a mission to cure my condition
'Cause without your kissin' my heart's just a prison
I'm hoping and wishin' that, girl, I'm forgiven
Say yeah, yeah

'Cause every time you leave me I'm sad
The moment you're returning I'm glad
So let's not go forgetting what we have
'Cause it's bad, so damn bad yeah

We're lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a blast
Oh baby, I want you right here next to me
Lovin' each day as if it's our last
Dancing all night and havin' a laugh
