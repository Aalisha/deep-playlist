I laid the blanket there on the shoreline
And saw the water shine with the moon
What kind of fool would fail to notice
The best thing shining was you

Oh I laughed kinda nervous, I felt you move closer
And felt the world unwind
Once was a stranger, not quite a lover
But steadily crossing the line

Carry me far away
Don't hold back I won't break
Leave the ghosts behind
All I know wrong or right
Just the thought of this night
Will get me every time
Every time
