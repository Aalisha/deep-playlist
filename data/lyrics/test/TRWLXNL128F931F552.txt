i hear the waves crash far below,
the rocks are leaping for the sky,
they're starving for the air,
for a bone to break, a dream to smash apart,
but i don't care.

it looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
this cliff has been well worn by ignorance.
it looks deep enough from here, I'm diving
they float face down they all look so content.
