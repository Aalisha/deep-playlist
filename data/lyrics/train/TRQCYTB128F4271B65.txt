One in a million, Mama
That's good enough for me
And you can't make me stay here anyway
Now that I'm 18

With everything she had in a duffel bag
She set out to show the world
She was more then just a homecoming queen
And daddy's little girl

In a cloud of dust on a Greyhound bus
She crossed the Cook County line
Slept all the way to Nashville
Big dreams running through her mind

She said, "Sure as I'm breathing
I'm gonna be a big star someday"
'Cause she was jumping right into the deep end
On a leap of sweet blind faith

It's about hoping, it's about dreaming
It's about never not believing
It's about taking a walk out on the wire
And never looking down

It's about living instead of dying
It's about spreading your wings and flying
...
