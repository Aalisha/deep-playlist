beyond
your sun
beyond
mundane fate
bind the mass repression
broken teeth on
burnt possessions
you fall apart
soul repression without chains
you falter

beyond
your sun
beyond
mundane fate
neck-chains bind
the masses muffled cries wail
from ashes consulting peace
the unrepentant without chains
the feral

above lucium
above lucium
above lucium
lay sonnelion
in your mind
taste pity
from the harlot's tongue
red tunnel
comfort of my lips
hate finds
heart in submission
your crooked ways
your reputation
drowned in a mixed emotion
might be
something wrong - with - you
