Don't get so distressed
If the good life won't arrive
You've been reading S.O.S.
When it's just your clock reading 5: 05
And why are you so possessed
By the thought that she got free
And why are you figuring who's the best
When just your luck ran out
and she chose me

We do not lie side by side
and mock the thought of you
And I don't take her hand and ask
Is this what he used to do?
'Cos I just want to free her from
Your jails of jealous dreams
'Cos at least a house when it's empty
Stays clean
...
