Downtown's been caught by the hysteria
People scream and shout
A generation's on the move
When disco spreads like a bacteria
These lonely days are out
Welcome the passion of the groove

The golden years
The silver tears
You wore a tie like Richard Gere
I wanna get down
You spin me around
I stand on the borderline
Crying at the discoteque
Crying at the discoteque

I saw you crying
I saw you crying at the discoteque
I saw you crying
