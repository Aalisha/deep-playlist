Magic maker, wish me one wish
Hold me to your light and maybe
Oh what if I say
Why don't we play
I'll wear your star

I shiver, you shake it
To me I, I can't help it
Don't know, am I dreaming
Or have you, you haven't
Stop for awhile
Why don't we play
I'll wear your star

Oh, love make me
Oh, love tasted beautiful
Oh, love make me
...
