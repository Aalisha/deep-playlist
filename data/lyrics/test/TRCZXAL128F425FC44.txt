On our way to light
We are losing our own sheen
There's no chance to fight
Once it's gone you cannot gain it back

Can no longer see
Through the eyes of the carefree
None of it left in me
Even the remnants perished a while ago

Enigma of life hems ruin within
I've seen it rife with all this nice sin
But still feel like...

On wings of time we have been flying
For too long it seems to me I have crossed the final fence
...
