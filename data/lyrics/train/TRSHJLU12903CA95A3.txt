I open my eyes the world seems a different place
The colors are brighter and the air is sweet to taste.
See it's like I woke up from a nightmare that tied me down
I was smothered and trapped inside a sleep way underground

Pre 1
It's time I learned to fall
To say the word goodbye.
To feel the sunlight on my face
Maybe that means...

I'm ready to fly
I wanna breathe in and breathe out and be who I am
Let go of fear wanna feel alive.
I'm ready to fly
The more that you hold me back you set me free
You help my heart decide...
Maybe I'm, maybe I'm ready to fly.
