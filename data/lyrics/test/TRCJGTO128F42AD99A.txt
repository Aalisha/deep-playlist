(Reverend)
Spin for feature or I hold for fruit
I need two more nudges and I'll drop the loot
Sure I'll jack it almost anytime
Here's a voice creeping from behind

No, no mate you wanna' hold the pears
Cos I've been watching you from over by the stairs
Turbocash is cool you wanna' let em spin
But if the hoppers full you're guaranteed a win

(Reverend)
No, no mate why don't you understand
I've got a scheme a plan I've got it all in hand
