Where you going to, I don't mind.
I've killed my world and I've killed my time.
So, where do I go, what do I see,
I see many people coming after me.

So, where you going to, I don't mind,
If I live too long, I'm afraid I'll die.
So, I will follow you wherever you go,
If your open hands' still open to me.

Strangers on this road we are all,
We are not two, we are one.
