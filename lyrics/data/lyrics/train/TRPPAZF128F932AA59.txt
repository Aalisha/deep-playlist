Oh deary me
My little brother's in his bedroom smoking weed
I tell him he should get up 'cos it's nearly half past three
He can't be bothered 'cos he's high on THC

I ask him very nicely if he'd like a cup of tea
I can't even see him 'cos his room is so smoky
Don't understand how one can watch so much TV
My baby brother Alfie how I wish that you could see

I only say it 'cos I care
So please can you stop pulling my hair?
Now, now there's no need to swear
Please don't despair my dear mon fr√®re
