Take me back, i'll make you happy
Take me back, i'll treat you like
A precious thing
Oh come on you know a good deal
When you hear one
And they don't come much better than this

Take me back, i'll make you whole
Take me back, i'll complete your soul
So i fucked up well then sue me
Anything but this freeze me out business

And there's a song i've been
Writing in my head
Can't seem to get past the opening line
