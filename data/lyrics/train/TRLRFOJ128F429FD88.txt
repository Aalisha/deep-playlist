Midnight in the city and everyone's asleep

See the shadow walking in the dark.
Here she comes
she's all in black

Long hair flowing down her back

Gotta get her out of my mind.

Honey
I wanna kiss you
honey
give me your head.
Honey
I wanna kiss you
baby

Let me waste away upon your tender lips.

Oh
she loves blood and honey
