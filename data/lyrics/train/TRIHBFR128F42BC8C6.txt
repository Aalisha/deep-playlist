I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love

You give me light
So tonight, take me there
I feel your sun start to glow
And I know it, let me show you

That I want your love, I need your touch
For the rest of our time together, baby
Come fly with me eternally
You and me, we were meant to be

Yeah, hey, alright
(Right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah, hey, alright
(Right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah, hey

We got to come together, baby
It's alright now
