Goddamn humans and their stupid ideas
Moronic morality for the weak and full of hope
We're supposed to think we're created to serve - when domination is in our nature?
What kind of god is this?

A design full of faults or lab rats in "god's" maze?
This is the joke we're supposed to believe: Adam and
Eve.
Deceived.

A complex, but fallible "design"
Waste of energy
Non-beneficial waste of intelligence
Waste of time.
