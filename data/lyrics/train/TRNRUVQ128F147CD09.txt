I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from 9 to 5, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone and

I always feel like somebody's watching me
A I have no privacy oh o oh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
tell me is it just a dream

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid

When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
