Spent the night counting down all the cracks in the wall
I'll start having to cope with the fact that
I see everything that used to hold my feet on the ground
Falling apart around me

Everybody knows the world will spin without you
And talk about you when you're away
Everybody knows the world will spin without you
Your best years seem further away, further away

Maybe this year I'll get myself off of the floor
And try to pretend
That things are getting better, that I'm changing
But I still feel the same

My friends and I still get off on making no sense at all
...
