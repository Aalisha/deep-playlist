Oh, I've been working a week, I'm tired
Yeah, I've been working a week and I'm
Just living for the weekend

Hey hey
Got some money I just got paid
Got some money and I can't wait
At six o'clock I'm out of here

Out there tonight
Is the night of my last got my name on
Run down my street adidas on my feet
I'm on fire

Working all the time
Work is such a bind
Got some money to spend
Living for the weekend
When it gets too much
I live for the rush
