I've been thinking about you, my love
And all the crazy things that you put me through
Now I'm coming around, throwing it back to you
Were you thinking of me when you kissed him?
Could you taste me when you licked his skin?
All the while I showered you with trust and promises
What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge
To get back all that I lost then
I gave you all I had to give, but I could never reach you

Oh, Adrienne, I thought I knew you
Once again, you used me, used me
Adrienne, I should have left you
