I wish that I could say I am a perfect man
I wish sometimes that I would not be who I am
One day I decided I would think on this
Not knowing if faith and pain could co-exist

Could I ever on my own conceive
Of someone I did not know, but I need?
I must be made to be at peace and communion
'Cause there must be some place
Somehow from where I have fallen

I find through every ounce of pain I feel
That my mind cannot deny that God is real
