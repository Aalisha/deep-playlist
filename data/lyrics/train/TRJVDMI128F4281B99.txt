You say hop, and I hop
You say stop, and I stop
You say jump, and I jump
Anything you say, I'm like a hunk of clay

I'm just like putty, putty in your hands, uh huh, uh huh

With a wave of your hand (putty, putty)
I'm your slave to command (putty, putty)
And I'll go on display
Anything you say, I'm like a hunk of clay

I'm just like putty, putty in your hands, uh huh, uh huh
