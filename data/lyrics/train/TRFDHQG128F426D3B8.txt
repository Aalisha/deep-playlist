Lights out, put my seat back as far as it will go
Casting shadows like statues I'm right outside your window
There's no such thing as second chance
There's no such thing, don't bother to explain

Your so beautiful, did you hear a word I said?
Your so beautiful, I guess this is what I get

We trust and believe so easily
And words they speak we seek security in one another
But there's no way to cover this

And these tragic nights and afternoons wreak disaster
And I can still feel you as if you were in the room
Where does our story end? where does it start?
I buried you along with my heart
