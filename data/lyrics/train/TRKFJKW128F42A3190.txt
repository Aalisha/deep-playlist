What a girl wants, what a girl needs Yeah, c'mon
I wanna thank you for givin' me time to breathe
Like a rock you waited so patiently
While I got it together
While I figured it out (yeah, yeah)
I only looked but I never touched

'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holdin' hands, makin' plans
And it's lucky for me, you understand
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thankin' you for knowin' exactly
What a girl wants, what a girl needs

Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thankin' you for givin' it to me
What I want is whatcha got
And whatcha got is what I want

There was a time I was blind, I was so confused (yeah, yeah)
