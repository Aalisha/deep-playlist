Runnin' for your life, by the knife
Runnin' from your wife ... yipes
You should've stuck with home
Your mind to blow your dome
It was you that chose your due
You built a maze you can't get through
I tried to help you all I can
Now I can't do nuttin' for you man

I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You got all these people on your back now
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
Flavor flav got problems of his own
I can't do nuttin' for you man

Go lean on shells answer man
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
...
