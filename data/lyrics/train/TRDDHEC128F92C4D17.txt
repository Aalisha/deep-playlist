You're a women without a clue
you're a friend of no ones too
Keeping track of all your lies
must be hard for someone new

So better not try to get inside my head
you'll find a nightmare waiting

You make it worse
Leave it to the ones who know me
Playing that game will only hurt you
You make it worse and never better

Manipulating woman
you're making friends and using them all up
Manipulating woman, you must be used to the pain

I'm a girl who sees a fraud
