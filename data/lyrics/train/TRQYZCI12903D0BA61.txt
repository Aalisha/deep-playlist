Let me tell you a story that you'll never forget
bout' making something outta nothing
try to show some respect
I made it to the top of the Empire State
and put the bald to the win town for those who relate
New kid on the blosck I'm Not "so to speak"
but I'll punch you in your mouth, your head, and your beak
You can tell your friends, your moms, and your pops
how I came from the bottom and made it to the top
...
