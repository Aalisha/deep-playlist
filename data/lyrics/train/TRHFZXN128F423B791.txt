Judge me not. J-U-D-G-E-M-E not.
Judge me not. J-U-D-G-E-M-E not.

verse 1
Somebody once told me that I wasn't of God and my works were in vain. They said that I was singing a lie, and I should be ashamed. But I thank God in Jesus' name that it's not up to you. You don't have a heaven or hell to put me in to.
