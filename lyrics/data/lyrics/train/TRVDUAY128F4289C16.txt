you say you're sorry
you still care
she came by my place again
to cry about you man
you should love her
twice as much
i try to remember you're a friend
but its gettin a little rough

(Chorus)
she's just tired
of bein cinderella
she cant live that way no more
needs a little affection
a little understanding
better be careful
cause the next time she comes through my door
she wont be cinderella no more

A tear drop trembles
...
