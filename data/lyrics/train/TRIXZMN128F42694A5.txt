Suck on myself,
Into believing that I'm doing the right thing
I think of your face,
And I pretend that I'm not alone

I'm lining up,
All the love, and the trust and the good things
But there's a hole in my heart,
Where I once kept a piece of home

What if one of yours turned a color
You didn't mean for it to be
And what if one of yours became another
Would you hear it say

Let me go
This isn't what I wanted
I can't be here anymore
Let me go
This isn't what I needed
I can't exist here anymore
