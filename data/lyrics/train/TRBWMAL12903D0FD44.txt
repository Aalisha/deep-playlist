Baby, I Love you

I wanna take you 
Arround the world
With me, wherever i go
I'll give you diamonds and pearls
but I don't want you love me
For vanity
Love me, for me

I want to introduce myself to your parents too
you can meet my friends and i meet your friends too

Girl, I wanna go Away
(I wanna go anywhere with you)
With you
(Anywhere, Anywhere)
