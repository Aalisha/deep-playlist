To, one, two, three, four

What may seem like love may soon fall apart
You don't practice what you preach
You don't finish what you start
Your lies have got me tryin' to mend a broken heart
Please don't speak to me again

You keep tellin' me you're sorry
Well, I just don't give a damn
You keep tellin' me you're sorry
Well, I'm never gonna listen to a single word you're sayin'
