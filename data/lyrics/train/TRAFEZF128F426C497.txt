Well you can dig me up a grave
And try and stick me in the ground
Well you can tie me to the bed
And try and beat me half to death
But you can never keep me down
Well you can stick me in a hole

And you can pray all day for rain
You can shoot me in the leg
Just to try to make me beg
And you can leave me there for days
And I'll stay alive

Just to Follow You Home
And I will survive
âÂâ ¬Â˜Cause you're my Mississippi Princess

You're my California Queen
Like the Duchess of Detroit

And every city in between

You can slap me in the face
You can scream profanity
