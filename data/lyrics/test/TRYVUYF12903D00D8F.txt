Hey! You're awake!
And it keeps you where you're born to be,
You're afraid... he's afraid!
And it keeps your wants a-wanting...
Oh, let go!
You're the only thing that keeps you well controlled,
Self-control!
It will make sure we are one, you wanna see us!

Oh!
You're addicted!
Which makes it seem so hard to be your friend
You're addicted to your pain.
