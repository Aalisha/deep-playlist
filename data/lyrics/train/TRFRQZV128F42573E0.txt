[Prelude:]
Pounding hearts calling, like a storm from the north.
I will obey to my sworn oath.
Like warriors are waiting for the Battle, 
True Heroes play Heavy Metal!

[Strophe 1:]
Coming out of darkness, powerfull like a fortress.
Glorious and raw.
Wearing spikes and leather, standing proud together.
Fight against the law.
Pounding like the Thunder, never we surrender.
Look inside our eyes.
Strong unification in the Heavy Metal nation,
for my Brothers I would die!
