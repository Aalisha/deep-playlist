What is this game we play with broken hearts and tears?
Been played by young and old for oh so many years,
Can you tell me honestly you've never been a pawn?
Someone steals your love away, you turn around... they're gone.

[PRE-CHORUS]
It is the game of temptation, it is the play of the heart,
Cry out in desperation, Iron Tears take you apart.

[CHORUS]
Love to you is lies to me - Iron Tears
Love is cruel and lies cut deep - Iron Tears
