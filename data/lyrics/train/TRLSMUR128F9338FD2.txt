the though of farewell
leaves me aching
last chance to play your heart out
the cards been dealt
and with everything inside of me
I'm convinced this may break me
I'm not looking I'm not turning back
cause There's nothing left to see
I'm not turning back
I'll close my eyes and clench my fists
bit the bullet as they say
I'm not looking I'm not turning back
...
