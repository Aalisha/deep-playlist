Funny how it's hard to find the words sometimes you know
Wishin we could read minds
Don't wanna let our feelings show
So even if you say you don't understand
I'm willing to give as much time as I can
Every time our eyes meet

Every time our eyes meet
Be talkin talkin talkin talkin to me (talkin to me)
Talkin talkin talkin talkin to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak (oh)
Cause every time
Be talkin talkin talkin to me
Be talkin talkin talkin to me (Talkin to me)

Your always actin so composed and cool
Never got to many words for me (Too many words)
You always turn your head and make sure I see (Just to make sure)
Baby ain't nothin' wrong with the love
That you and I dream of
So sweet
