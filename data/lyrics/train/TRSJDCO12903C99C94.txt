The footprints over the snow
The fabric over the lonely
C-Covering only
The fables and hands
The rest is out in the cold
Holding the last of the season
F-F-F-Freezin'
Ye-ah

My-my-my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my love like a voice

We're walkin' into the fields
...
