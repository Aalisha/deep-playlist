Take out the papers and the trash or you don't get no spending cash
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor you ain't gonna rock'n roll no more
(Yakety yak don't talk back)
Just finish cleaing up your room let's see that dust fly with that broom
Get all that garbage out of sight or you don't go out Friday night
...
