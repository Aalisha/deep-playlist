1-2-3. . .
don't give me that old one-two
1-2-3-4
don't give me that old one-two
1-2-3-4
don't give me that old one-two
I've heard it before
Don't give me that old one-two

Stop making your bad man blue
Told you before
Stop making your sad man blue
Don't give me that old one-two
1-2-3-4
don't give me that old one-two
