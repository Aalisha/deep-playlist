The break of day has come, I see the cracks have just begun
To line the walls, line the walls
I want to see the little girls and boys destroy their toys

British boys minds in a whirl
Tell you things that'll make your curls
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out

I'm twenty years or more, just tell me what we're living for
