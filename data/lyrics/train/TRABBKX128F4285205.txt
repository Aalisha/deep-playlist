Ehsaan hai mujhpe tumara, chuute na yeh saat hamara
[I owe you big time, may we never loose each other]

Now let's start, at the beginning,
Before I bumped into to you
I used to party alot, I used to drink too much
I did some drugs too

I was f**ked up
I was down, feeling lost
And couldn't get through the day
Without puffin on a J
Well anyway.
Since I met you I've changed

Yeah...

Oh Wild Wild Wild Rose...
You planted love inside of me
And grew up from where nothing could grow
Wild wild wild Rose
Now your love is the only seed that i need
To get me back, naturally

Dil yeh pagal, Dil yeh awara
[My heart is crazy, with no place to dwell]
Chuute nah yeh saat tumara
[May we never lose eachother]
Jaane jaana tuhi, tu hai meri kushi
...
