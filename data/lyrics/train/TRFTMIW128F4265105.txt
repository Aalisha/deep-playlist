One man can't sleep in his penthouse bed, Wall Street worries fill his head
While another man dreams in his cardboard shed on Broadway
Early morning traffic jam, wakeup call for both of them
Will work to eat, ask easy street for small change

And which one needs it more
The rich man or the poor
A change of heart and attitude
Unselfishness meets gratitude

It's enough to put tears in God's eyes, enough to make angels cry
When the power of love lifts someone above
The emptiness of their unbearable life
It's enough to put tears in God's eyes
...
