Now that we are, out of juvie
Things will change ma, oh youll see
Robin Eyes (Rob & I,) got a flat now, room for both of us
There's a knock knock

We cooked the talapia mama, just like you showed us

And mama, we learned some lessons

Little cuckoo bird to keep us guessing

Pair of brothers, hear our heartbeat
Love 'em long time, 'bout two week
Flip some coins, first nine on their tail
One gave headand hung round little longer

So soon the snow'll melt, you'll find
