Walk in the flame again
I'll be there to hold your hand
Keeping you safe until' the end
And when the flood begins
I'll be there with you to stand
Walking in faith until' the end

I see you through the flood
See you through the fire
See you through the storms-a-ragin'
I see you through the flood
See you through the fire
See you through the storms-a-ragin'

Walkin' the darkest rain
I cover you by my name
A shelter inside your world of pain
...
