Standing in a crowded room and I can't see your face
Put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
In my mind, I'm running round a cold and empty space
Just put your arms around me, tell me everything's OK
Break my bones but you won't see me fall, oh
The rising tide will rise against them all, oh
Darling, hold my hand
Oh, won't you hold my hand?

'Cause I don't wanna walk on my own anymore
Won't you understand? 'Cause I don't wanna walk alone

I'm ready for this, there's no denying
I'm ready for this, you stop me falling
I'm ready for this, I need you all in
I'm ready for this, so darling, hold my hand
