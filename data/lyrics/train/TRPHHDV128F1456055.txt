I seen you walking down the street with another man
Girl you're really shocking
I seen you walking down the street with another hand
Held in your stockings

Boys will be boys and girls will be trouble
And I'm a man of bad habits
I seen you walking down the street with another man
Girl I had to have it

Bad habits
Bad habits
Bad habits

You and I we should meet
...
