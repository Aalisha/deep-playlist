We're all immigrants and hypocrites
Delusionals and sycophants
We pretend to play a special part
And born in pain we fall apart
It's the same game with the same players
Where dying dreams are strung on prayers
A never ending battle just to be

It's all put off till another day
We all get old and waste away
The lust for dollars make no sense
We squat the world or pay the rents
And when it's all been said and done
Our joyless lives devoid of fun
I know it's all been said before
Our nation's rotten to the core

Fuck all flags and fuck your face
You're the garbage of the human race
Change the color, change the name
These greedy fucks are all the same
