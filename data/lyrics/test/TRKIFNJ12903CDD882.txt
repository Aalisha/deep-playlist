Chop off the hand that feeds me
Feed me the hand of your leader, insane
Down from your pedestal, bleeding
Bled by the beasts

Lay there crawling
Your legs they cannot move
Stabbed through the knees, down to the floor
And saw off the head for this war to end war

Placed here
This bloody instrument
These remnants of gore
