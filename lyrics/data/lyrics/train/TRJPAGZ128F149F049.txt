I'll wait for the answers someone else has given you.
I'll wait for days.
I failed my heart for way too long.
I've fallen apart, but that's over now.
Those who disrespected me tread upon broken glass and they will not last.
I gave everything I had just to be here.
Their words don't mean shit and life's not fair.
