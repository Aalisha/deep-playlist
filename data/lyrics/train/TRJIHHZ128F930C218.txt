[Termanology:]
I see myself as the holy resurrection of Pun
If I ain't that then you name one
Rapper that's lyrical slash Latin political passed rappin
With visuals past Malcolm and fittin to go past platinum
It's hard but I speak the truth inspired to teach the youth
The fire that heat the booth the high hat the beat the loop
The system it traps us in they tacklin rappers in
These shackles that pack us in the back of the clack is in
I'm packin the Mac again like Capital Punishment
Huggin the gun and then runnin and duckin from the government
They dyin to cuff me up lock me down touch me up
Cock the pound bust me up stop my sound hush me up
But I shall never hold my tongue
Before that I roll my blunt and load my gun
Give a kiss to my daughter tell my mother I love her
And blow the brains out a couple dirty cops undercover
Crooked detectives is foul how they book and arrest us
For cookin and stretchin we just tryna feed our kids
The streets crazy wild plus it gettin crazy foul
Listen when I say it now (watch it how it go down)
And that's the reason little kids get hit by strays
Cause muthafuckas can't act they age
