“Come on boys, let's hit the road!”
We left L.A. on Sunday, in Lubbock by Tuesday
That's where we played our second show
Where nobody knew us, so nobody noticed the songs that the band didn't know
We were eatin' up the white lines, makin' good time
Diggin' the songs on the radio
And that party kept a movin' aand you know what we were doin'
We were smokin' up that California gold

Now everyone was glad, “The Weight” played by The Band
You know I never had that song ever let me down
And I didn't notice I was speedin' but in the rear-view mirror blinkin'
Were them state trooper's lights all spinnin' ‘round
We rolled down the windows, so we didn't think that he would notice
Something smellin' funny in that smoke cloud
And he asked, “What you boys a-hidin'?” and we were all silent
