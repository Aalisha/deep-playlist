You made me happy, you made me sing
But now without you, I've lost everything
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life (all my life) all my life (all my life)
Wi-ithout yo-ou-ou (wi-ithout you)

No one to talk to when I'm alone
No one to call me, call me her own
And I know, know it's true that I-I must go throu-ou-gh
All my life (all my life) all my life (all my life)
Wi-ithout yo-ou-ou (wi-ithout you)
