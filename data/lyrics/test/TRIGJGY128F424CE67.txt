[Bullet Eater/Warslut]

From the dawn of tim
Man has always sought to allay his fears,
From the demons without and the demons that surely lurk within

"Don't look for a rhyme or a reason to the story
Now is not the time, the season, no glory
Don't look for a moral or right to this tale
Don't look for a saviour for your weak and your frail"
