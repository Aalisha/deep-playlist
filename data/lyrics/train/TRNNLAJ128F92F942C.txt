I live to disrput,
I live to destroy
Now I target the boiling point so few employ
Silence is deadly so pin back your ears
Cause the axis has shifted
It has been so for years

Initiate, the kill chain
Deviate, my life's terrain
Terminate. by kill chain
The sould is the ground that the angels bleed for

If we are inciting war again, we've got to stay strong
If we are deciding war again, we cannot be long
We are here, and it's no mistake
...
