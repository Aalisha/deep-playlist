Watching Your Walls, Your Cracks And Your Flaws
They Are All Beauty Marks As Far As I See
One Drainpipe Is Loose, Like A Tile On Your Roof
But Your Heart Is As Great As Camelot's

Standing Here Tall, In All Your Grace
You Emanate Hope To Me

You Make Me Want To Live
You Give Me Strength To Want To Give
