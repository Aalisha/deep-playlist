Our eyes meet all the time.
Your eyes permanent on mine.
Oh, tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.

You've been looking at me for days.

Oh, tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.
Tell me what, tell me what you want.

I need a kind, and honest man. (honest man)
