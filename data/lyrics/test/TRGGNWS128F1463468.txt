[Intro]
Calm down... calm down...
Baby just calm down...
(Calm down... )
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
Baby just calm down...
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(She would pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
Calm down...

[Budden Verse 1]
Look, I was such a lost soul, just wanted to be down with something
Look at your son now mommy I amounted to something
You couldn't figure out, what I had messed with the streets for
Cause you saw my genius without a SAT score
I took drugs and laced it with things
But you a addict yourself,
For you I was people, places and things (how the fuck you thought)
Angeldust use to have me in the hallways twurked
I tried to hide it, but Visine didn't always work
I needed someone to blame in my mind
I thought if you and dad never used dope I would a came out fine
And so I hit you hard when you threw in advice
Like what I want to talk to you about you ruined my life
You the reason why I ended up a con and I knew it
The reason I filled my body with that bombin' fluid, mommy
You the reason that my life's gone illegal
The reason I'm kinda different, don't think like normal people, not calm

[Chorus]
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(Use to pray that I would) Baby just calm down...
You gotta hold your head up cause we gone make it
She use to tell me to... calm down...
Moms use to tell me to... calm down...
(You got to understand what I was going through)
Baby just calm down...
Everything's gonna be alright
