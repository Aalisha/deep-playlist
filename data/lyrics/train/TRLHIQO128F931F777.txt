Heart of a Woman

This song is dedicated to all of the ladies
From all of the men, ya know what I mean?
Simply because yall go through so much
And we want you to know that we recognise that

There are?
So many answers to the question what yall do for us
And so many reasons for the word why we love on yall
For instance how you just take us and lift us up
Give us chance after chance and we still find a way to F things up
And sometimes yall go and blame yourself for the things we do
Cuz you love us so much our lies become the truth
Yall try so, so hard to make things work
Findin? a way to smile just to keep from showin? your hurtin?
It's (your mind versus) it's (your heart versus)
It's (your soul versus) your (your body)
Versus (our bullshit) and (our egos) and (our pride)
That's why?
(That's why I love the word woman)
(Oh I love? I love?
Yall are so tough, yall put up with so much
(That's why I love the word woman)
(Oh I love? I love?
And yall so full of trust, and besides yall know us
(That's why (yes sir) I love the word woman)
Time and time again yall let us back in
Man I love yall so much I gotta spell it out
(W-O-M-A-N)

That's what it's all about yeah?
Sometimes I think that we're the reason
