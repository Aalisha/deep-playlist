Here we are, a careful distance
Here's my heart, what's left of it
In this town, I used to listen
Once, Once, Yeah

I had hope, blind faith
Had as much as you can take

I'm only gonna let you kill me once
I'm only gonna let you kill me then some
I'm only gonna let you kill me
Once, Once, Once, yeah

Once, Once, Once, yeah

Once, Once, Once, yeah

Once, Once...
