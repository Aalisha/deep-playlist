She has a gilt complex,
Break her neck,
And now she's run, run, running right over the edge.
Had a gilt complex,
Poison pen,
She's signing her name and she's forgetting her friends.
Had a gilt complex,
Break her neck,
And now she worry, worry, worries for the good of her wealth.
This gilt complex,
Useless effect,
Now she suffer, suffer, suffers, destroying her health.

He has a gilt complex,
Break his neck,
And now he's run, run, running right over the edge.
Had a gilt complex,
Poison pen,
Signing his name, forgetting his friends.
