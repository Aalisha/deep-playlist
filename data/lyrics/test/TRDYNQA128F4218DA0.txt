Spent more than my share on temptation,
trying to cool my swollen tongue.
I gorge myself on all that free goodwill,
and left the others none.

What I wear like church clothes,
you wear just like jewellery.
All the simple things you revel in,
they just suffocate me.
I don't know anymore,
wish someone would tell me who to be.
Cause I am ready, I am ready to try anything.

I'm dazzled by glamour and camera angles.
