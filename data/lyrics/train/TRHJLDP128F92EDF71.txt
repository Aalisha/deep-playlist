Slam!

Can't touch this
We rule it with a clenched fist
On top fuel with a death grip
Judged by a weak little man
With a pen in his hand
That just doesn't fucking get it

Old, couldn't stop us if you wanted to
School, breaking knuckles with a ruler
Done, no more
Emergence, to dominate you

Run, hide
Your time is coming
Hunt, find
Walking a fine line
Run, hide
My time is coming
Hunt, find
It's just a matter of time

Talk your shit
