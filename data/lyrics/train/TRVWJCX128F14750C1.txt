I know that you can hear the rhythm of the rain
Although we're miles apart I know you feel my pain
I try to be so strong, I try to carry on
But since you left the sun don't seem to shine
My tears are falling on the words you wrote to me
I wish that somehow they could take me where I wanna be
It seems so long ago, you held me when I cried
For now I just pretend you're by my side, oh-oh yeah
Everything that I touch turns to blue
When I'm living in a world without you
I'm going crazy baby, I am missing you
Can't imagine all I go through
When I'm living in a world without you
I'm not alone I know that you can feel it too
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
