(Walt Aldridge/Brad Crisler/Drew Womack)

Everyone says it's no big deal
Nothin' a little more time won't heal
Sooner or later the way I fell will change
But they never hurt the way I do
'Cause they never had to get over you
So they never shared my point of view of the pain

I've either gotta leave the past behind
Or find myself a way to lose my mind
I'm ready for a change of any kind
