It's fine, I'm not broken 'cause you're going, it's goodbye
It's our final dance, we're calling it a night
It's last call which means I'm calling for the last time
We're moving on with our lives, I won't be lonely tonight

And I know we're closer to us being over
And there's no coming back to you, it's my last dance with you
When the party's over there's an after party
And there will be an after you, there is an after you

To the after party, oh
Keep it moving to the after party, oh
Keep it moving to the after party, oh
Keep it moving to the after party, oh
Keep it moving to the after party
