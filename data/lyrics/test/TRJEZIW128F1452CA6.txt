Floetic, Floacism, Fo? ology
It? s Floetry with Whyteleaf, we? re moving closer

Just a little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit
Can I get a little bit closer?
I? d want to get, closer, to get oh yeah

Just a little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit
Can I get a little bit closer?
I? d want to get, closer, to get oh yeah

So near yet you? re so far away
I can? t tell you enough how much boy
I want to love you baby
I want to know you baby

You hear, hear me talking to you baby.
Don? t wanna, fight the feeling that I? m feeling.
Give me, a chance to get
Just a little bit closer, oh yeah

Amazing, I rise the occasion is life
And I? m debating if I wanna be your girl or your wife
I? m understanding how your landings got me feeling a vibe
You? re in my lungs, I? m feeling strung, so now I? m chasing a high

You? re in my system, I? m in your wisdom
I am your partner, you are the father
You? re the beginning and I? m the after
I hear the universe, pulling us closer, just a little bit
