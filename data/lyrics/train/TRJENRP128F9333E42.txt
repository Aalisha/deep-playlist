Shake down the walls

Ah, yeah!
Whoo!

Five o'clock fever
Ready for the bang
Tired of taking orders
And working like a slave
Feeling like a bad boy
Waiting for the bell
Need to lick the honey
From your wishing well

'Cos it's the right time to rock
And we ain't gonna stop, no, no
Your skin on mine
Hot love, baby, it's time

We gonna shake down the walls
Getting down and dirty on the other side
Shake down the walls
Gonna burn up heaven and get wild tonight
