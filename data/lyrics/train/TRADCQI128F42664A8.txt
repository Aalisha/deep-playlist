In the old shoplifting days
Mikey used to do expensive linen and towels
There'd be three of them
One for the sting
One standing at the blind spot
They would agree on a location upfront
The third would be checkin' for cameras
In case they missed one on the stake-out
The next day Mikey would take the goods back
He'd pretend he'd thrown the receipt away in the bag
Saying they'd been a present for his mum
And she didn't like the colour
He'd end up with a credit note
And then choose a CD player or a watch
