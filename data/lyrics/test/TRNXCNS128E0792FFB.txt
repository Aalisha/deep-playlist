Come on, baby, skim the top with me
I'll tell you stories 'bout victory
I used to be a dreamer just like you
And then my pocket told me what to do

All things are looking good from where I sit
Or in the United States of who gives a shit?
Sucking love from wherever I can
Cashing Satan's checks with my dick in my hand

Talkin' 'bout a free ride
I'm talkin' 'bout a landslide
You wanted only third eye, baby
I'm talkin' 'bout a landslide

Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout a free ride
I'm waitin' for a landslide
You wanted only third eye, baby
...
