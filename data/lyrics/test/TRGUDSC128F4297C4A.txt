Sing along, listen to the music
Day or night you just have to choose it
You, you just have to turn it on

In the groove with my favorite DJ
We can dance to the hits that he plays
You, you just have to turn him on

refrain:
Radio, everybody listens to the radio
There you go, everybody's singing to the songs they know
Radio, everybody listens to the radio
