On the streets
And everywhere
You? re turnin? heads
You? ve got the laissez faire

You just smile, yeah
And walk on through, oh, oh
You? ve got that personality, babe
And it sure looks good on you, yeah

Not the ordinary
Anything you wear looks good on you especially
Nothin? I can tell you
You haven? t already heard a half a million times
But still I? d like to say

You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well
(Ho)
You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well
