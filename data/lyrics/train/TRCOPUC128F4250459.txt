Yelled:
Get out of it

I saw two shadow men on the Vallance road
They said they'd pay me for your address
Oh, I was so bold
I said, you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show?

Well, they didn't like that much, I can tell you

And they chased me up three flights of stairs
Caught me in the lift, I sighed and said hello
But you're impossible
