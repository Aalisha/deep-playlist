Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
Cos I just want to fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breath
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I said, maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
