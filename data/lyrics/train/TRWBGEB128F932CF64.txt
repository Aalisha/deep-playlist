And J Ville got it (soul!)
And O Zone got it (soul!)
And Miami got it (soul!)
(Supa dynamite soul)
And Atlanta got it (soul!)
And Chi-Town got it (soul!)
And Seattle got it
(Supa dynamite soul)
You know Philly got it (soul!)
And Ohio got it (soul!)
And Texas got it
(Supa dynamite soul)
You know Cali got it (soul!)
And New York got it (soul!)
And V.A. got it
(Supa)

Who rock the spot dawg? You know we puttin' clowns to shame
This is how we do, you know we lightin' up the stage
I'm Archie Bell I'm here to make you tighten up your aim
Shoot your gift cause Asamov is known for shuttin' down the game
Ain't comin' close so there's no need for you to step to this
Stylin' out two the third power plus we fresh with this
This what happen when we link with a Perceptionist boy
What you think? We some certified specialist
So come and bring it we gon' lay it on the line
Try to take us man? You must be out your rabid ass mind
Yeah, you diss that shit that makes you hate what I do
But get hype whenever you hearin' my 8 times 2
Come on now, there ain't no way you can relate to my crew
So homie watch out, you gon' get muscled or boxed out
Or, you can tussle on the ground and knocked out
And I stand on top of you talkin' shit so what's up now?

And you know what I'm sayin'
And Jersey got it (soul!)
And Rhode Island got it (soul!)
And Alabama got it
(Supa dynamite soul)
Yeah, and Portland got it (soul!)
And Las Vegas got it (soul!)
And Tallahassee got it (soul!)
