And she can call names
Well, I've got news for her and her friends
Fake girls
Ugly hearts
Everybody hates them
And she knows it true

Because you had me.
Then she talks out her ass for the attention she gets

And she knows

She just didn't know, what she was missing out on.

Came along and you tell me with this change that I have undergone.
