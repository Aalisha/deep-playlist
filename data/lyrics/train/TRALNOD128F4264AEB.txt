Two weeks ago last Sunday, I was on my way from church
I met a guy named Youngblood, who was totally berserk
He told me he was looking for a place to lay his head
I read him Romans 8: 14 and this is what he said

"Girl, some of my homeboys told me 'bout a freaky party
Down on 63rd and Babylon
Come on girl, let's go, I got plenty of blow
And it's more fun doing wrong "

"The ladies call me lover 'cause I got the gift of gab
And a few other specialties
I'd really like to make you, if you'd only let me date you
You'd belong only to me"

He said, "I know that there's a freak deep down inside of you
Dying to get out and ooo"
He asked me to help, Youngblood get to the freaky party
Freaky party, party, freaky party

I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party
I'm not gonna help Youngblood get to the freaky party
 (I'm not gonna help)
I don't want to help Youngblood get to the freaky party

I can't begin to tell you of the sadness in my mind
