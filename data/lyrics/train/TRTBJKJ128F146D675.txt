I'm not from around here
I'll hold on to you but
I cant hold on to this day its all gone
waiting always untouched open
it cam down to save us and end us all
cause im under the outside
and over all
cause im a thousand miles away
and im out of oxygen
and im falling faster than id like to be
and im closer to the sky
than ill ever be to you again
find the exit signs and disappear
...
