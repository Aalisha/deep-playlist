Blue days, aching to my bones
I love you, baby don't you know
Heartache like this I've never known
I need you like I've never needed before

How long to wait 'til I'm 'round that crooked bend?
Don't want to hate what I can't have in the end
Too many roads that dead end straight ahead
And now I know that it's over, it's over
