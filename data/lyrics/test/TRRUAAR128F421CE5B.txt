Sorry I lost it
Something came over me
Is there a lesson
Somewhere in this
Awful tragedy
You didn't deserve that
Nobody does
Maybe we will make it
Maybe not
Only time can tell you
What you really got

Time is only thing
That can undo
Those things I said
I'm gonna have to wait
'Till you forgave me
In your head
Summer will come
But winters
What i dread

Your disapiontment
Isn't easy to bare
My mind
