Hey guys I'd rather stay at home
Leave you these barren streets to roam
Got better things to think about
My head is all you now
I can't go on this is too real
Can't show you any mass appeal
A thousand tries and no replies how hard is it to
feel?
The afterglow is now fading
The interest is now sinking
