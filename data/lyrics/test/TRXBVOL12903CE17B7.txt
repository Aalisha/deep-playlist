Yeah
I been tryna get away
But its just something about you that's pullin' me back in
Ya know?

Girl, you're what I need
And I can't even front I'm wildin' out
Plannin' on you can calm me down
You make it alright when you're around
Girl, you're what I need

I know you think I'm just saying
All these things 'cause you're here now
And I know what you're thinkin'
If this is true
Then why didn't I do
All these things when I had you

It's because I knew
You had quite enough
But I feel brand new
And I'm fessin' up

Girl, you're what I need
And I can't even front I'm wildin' out
Plannin' on you can calm me down
You make it alright when you're around
