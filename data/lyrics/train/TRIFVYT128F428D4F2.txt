I picked last night in Tucson I sang 'em a country song
Missed my plane this morning Lord cause we parted all night long
I'm out here now usin' my thumb tryin' to make it to El Paso
Cause tonight I play at the cabarete they done told it on the radio
To a country singer it's a lonesome road with time hangin' heavy on my hands
If I take a little pleasure and a little bit of love baby that don't makes me all bad
