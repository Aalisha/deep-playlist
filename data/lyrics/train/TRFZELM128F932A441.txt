In this camp there's one who delights me
Brings me afternoon tea then she leaves me
When they're climbing over the sea
She helps to keep our strength complete
But I'd rather stay
'Cause the north is too far away

I wanted to marry Babette
And the weapons on my shoulders
I'd throw into seaweed banks
And the willows and the lime-trees
Were gathered there for us
Above the unconquered seas
Unconquered seas

There's the horn call
Put your boots and courage on and run
...
