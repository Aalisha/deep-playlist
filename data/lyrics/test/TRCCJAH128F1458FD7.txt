Hard that I'm gonna hear about you
Oh, about you baby I do (ooh)
Hard that I'm gonna be without you
Oh, without you baby I do
I stand to lose if I love you
You stand to gain
We stand for all who believe in vain (vain, vain)

Let's fall in love 'n' be glad to get it over
Oh, I'm over baby for you (ooh)
Call him and tell him that it's over
Oh, it's over baby it's through
I got the time that you left me
You got the keys to his car
We got the nerve to have got this far (far, far)

I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby it's true
I'm gonna be the lover to fall for you
I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby it's true
I'm gonna be the lover to fall for you
I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby it's true
