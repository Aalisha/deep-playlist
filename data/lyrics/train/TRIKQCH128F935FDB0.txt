Twist, twist, senora
Hey now, hey now
Twist all around
What you say now
Twist, twist, senora
Come on, come on
Shake it all night
One more time now
Jump, jump, senora
Let me hear you now
Jump all around
Come on, come on
Twist, twist, senora
Well, all right
Twist it all around
Well, there's a real swinging
Dance called the twist now
Come on and get with it
Young and old dance together
Come on and dance
Bring your partner
Twist, twist, senora
Come on, come on
Twist all around
