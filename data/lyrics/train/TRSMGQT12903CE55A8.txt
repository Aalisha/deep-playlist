If you need me, I wantcha to call me
Said if you need me, all ya gotta do is call me
Don't wait too lo-o-ong if things go wrong
I-I-I'll be home, whoa-oh-oh, home
If you want me, send for me
I said if you want me, want, all ya gotta do is send for me
Don't wait too lo-o-ong, just-a pick up your phone
And I-I-I'll (hurry home where I belong)
