There's nothing left to do, move on
There's a killer on the loose, get gone
And if you stop to say I'm on
You know we'll never make it back, move on.

You said
Let the ride, it went through your head
And we said
That we tried, but could not pretend.

There's nothing left to do, move out
And tell me if you don't agree, just count
All the time you've been left in doubt
Yeah, there's a killer on the loose, just shout.
