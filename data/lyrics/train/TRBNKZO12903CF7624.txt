I know the song has been written already
It's not gonna stop me from writing again
Not gonna lie I don't really wanna live
I'd rather be honest than impressive

Nothing has changed and it's 12 years later
I'm more of a child than I was back then
Positive thinking won't keep ships from sinking
I will jump unblinking of the plank say when

This road is long but my patience is not
And if I must face the gun-squad again then let me get shot
I will put on my dancing shoes
While the gun-men are holding their breath
...
