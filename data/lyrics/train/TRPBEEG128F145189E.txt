This girl I know needs some shelter
She don't believe anyone can help her
She's doing so much harm
Doing so much damage

But you don't want to get involved
You tell her she can manage
And you can't change the way she feels
But you could put your arms around her

I know you want to live yourself
But could you forgive yourself
If you left her just the way you found her

I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow, protection
I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow, protection

You're a boy and I'm a girl
But you know you can lean on me
And I don't have no fear
...
