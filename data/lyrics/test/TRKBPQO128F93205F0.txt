When you say love you're telling everyone your moment's come
And you've found what you've been looking for
When you say love you've said the only word that tells the world
You never will be lonely anymore
You've got a pretty rainbow of your own and at last you've found your pot of gold
You're completely satisfied feeling of contentment fills your soul
