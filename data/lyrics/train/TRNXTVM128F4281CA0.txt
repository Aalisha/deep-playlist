Leave me alone
I'm in control
I'm in control
And girls lie too much
And boys act too tough
Enough is enough
Well, on the minds of other men
I know she was

I said just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, just take it or leave it
And take it or leave it
Oh, take it
