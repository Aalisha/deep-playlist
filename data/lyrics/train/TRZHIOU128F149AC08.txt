Chorus.
From here to Salvador the ladies dance
To fill us reckless sons with the passions of the heart

I've been around this town for so long
She's been dancing since the first day
I've been all around but I love coming back to see Lucy
She swings me over to pull me out twirls around
And I fall about in giggles and laughter
Oh I'm plastered and can't deal help it
I'm sorry love

Bridge.
