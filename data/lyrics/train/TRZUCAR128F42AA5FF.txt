Look to the clock on the wall
Hands hardly moving at all
I can't stand the state that I'm in
Sometimes it feels like the walls closing in

Oh Lord what can I say?
I am so sad since You went away
Time, time ticking on me
Alone is the last place I wanted to be
Alone what can I say?

Try to bury my troubles away
Drowns my sorrows the same way
...
