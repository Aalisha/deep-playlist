Oooo since you've been gone, boy
I tell you, I've been so alone, boy
You've got me afraid, afraid to close my eyes
Each time I do it's you I visualize
Baby baby I can see you walkin' away
Ooo just like you did that day
The same hurt that I felt when we parted
Baby baby once again has started
So don't you know that I gotta find a way
To get you back, boy; I'm so lonely

Nights I can't sleep, boy
I tell you, without you I'm weak, boy
Don't you know, not one single day goes by
That I wake up without tear-filled eyes
Don't you know I very seldom leave my lonely room
