I can see you, baby, from a thousand miles away,
And I know you love me, no matter what you say.
I can tell you, baby, where you belong,
By my side at the end of the day, when the work is done.

I can tell when you been sleepin' all day in bed,
And I know what drives you, out of your head.
I can feel your heart beatin' through a cement wall,
And I know you'll come runnin' whenever I call.
