Being alive
Or lie dead rotting
Nobody really gives a shit
One Throw the dice
And shut the fuck up
Either way you're meeting the book
Man
Yeah, you're next in line
And you're heading for the house of pain
Army Destined by lies and greed
In the ghetto all over again
And
We're all branded by iron
The final countdown has begun
The Yeah, we're all branded by iron
Make a difference and kill yourself
Undead
The road to hell and freedom

Being rich
