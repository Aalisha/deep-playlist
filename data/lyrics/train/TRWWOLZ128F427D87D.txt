And I was hopin
That you had an atlas in your head
So fed up of
The same old man
Theres broken bedrooms and there are broken hands
You were so fed up of the same old broken man

An do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna make love to me
I know you wanna
I know you wanna
I know you wanna make love to me
