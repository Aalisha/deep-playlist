i guess it's time to make it easier on ourselves
is it time to let our feeling have their ways?
i know this time i won't do anything at all
this time i'll let the fire burn out of control

i get a feeling i can make it on my own
like it's meant to be my kingdom and my throne
but i can only make it last a little more
if i'd only let that fire burn out of control
...
