As I lie perfectly still
She sighs, another evening is killed
All this I see brothers, now at night
The horrors return bright lights
And what I should've learned by now
I should see, sisters

We have not lied, we have not loved
All my brothers all my sisters
All my brothers, all my brothers
All my sisters, all my brothers

The heart it quickens its stride
I try to believe she has lied
...
