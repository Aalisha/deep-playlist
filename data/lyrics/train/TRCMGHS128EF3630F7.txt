Now I've had the time of my life
No I never felt like this before
Yes, I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I owe it all to you...

I've been waiting for so long,
Now I've finally found someone
To stand by me...
We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical
Fantasy...

Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it
Secretely...
So we take each other's hand
'Cause we seem to understand
The urgency just remember...
