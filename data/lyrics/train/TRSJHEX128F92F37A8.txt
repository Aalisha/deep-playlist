Check, check
Can you feel it?

These are the days of revenge so sweet
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
There is a fear in the air that I have prayed for, for my whole life
Can you feel it? And do you fear it?
And Malcolm was right
The hate that we've sown has come home in the night
So wake up (Can you feel it?)
It's time to die (Can you feel it?)
'Cause we've reached the end of the lies

Just take a look at the papers, your leaders
They're killers, they're liars
See what they do in your name to make the bodies pile higher
The murders, the terror, they've done it forever
As we sit back and smile at the script that they sell us

So now they come for me
So now they come for you
We didn't hear and now there's nothing we can do

Holy Mother of Columbine
Say a prayer for me and the USA
Blessed martyrs of Palestine
Come and strike us down
