Little boy, it's gon' take more than game
To get me to change my name
And you better not be lame, be lame, lame, lame

And little boy it takes more than a car
To get me to go that far
I ain't cheap little buddy I'ma star, nigga I'ma star

Gotta know whatcha lookin' at
If you want me to holla back
Gotta know when to stop talkin'
If you really wanna play in my lane

You gets nothin' unless that nigga's on point
In the bed better know what you doin'
Let the washer and the dryer keep the coins

I need dollas and that's trill unless that nigga pay bills
