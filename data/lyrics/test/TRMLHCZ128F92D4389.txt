It took a nigga thirteen muthafuckin' years just to make a rap song.
But I'm on my winnings, in fact now niggas is jealous,
Y'all niggas don't faze me,
Hoes gone... hate me,
Bust up and then I may get they lips bloody,
Your back nutty,
Aw, y'all niggas ain't ready for me,
But if you want me, who clamps?
I'm shell-bound, watch me throw down on my first go-round,
Here's our shit, properly did it and now you're evicted,
Now admit it, fuck that yin-yang, you talkin' behind my back Mr. Hood Critics,
You're all on my dick hun,
