There’s nothing quite like you
There’s nothing here on the earth
You’ve nothing left to prove
None can compare to Your worth
Okay, all right, there’s more that I am living for
When I’m Yours

CHORUS
Oh oh oh oh, I wanna to lose it all for You
Oh, oh, oh, if it’s the last thing that I do
Oh, oh, oh, the only thing that really matters now
