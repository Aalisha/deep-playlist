I get the same old dream, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes and in my head
Thoughts fly back to the break-up

These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in

Since you've been gone, since you've been gone
I'm outta my head, can't take it
Could I be wrong? But since you've been gone
You've cast the spell, so break it
Oh, oh, oh, since you've been gone
...
