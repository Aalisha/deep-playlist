What I would do if my blood's so blue?
What I would do if my skin's so green?
Why no? Yes, quite neat
I say, let me leave this place

It's a mistake, kick a white sign break up
It's a little cake, pick a black mail, burn it
What a red scale, I can buy with some threat
My room is full of cobwebs
What I would see it my eyes're so grey?
What I would say if my mouth's so lean?
It's fun to see the process
Feel so straight

I say
Dear painter, he's so lame
Don't leave your hand prints
Dear painter, he's so tame
Don't get so freaked out!
Dear painter, he's so brave
Don't fight with my dog
Poor painter
The dog stole your brush
