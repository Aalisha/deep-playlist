Look at the pale
Face in the sky
It seems so
Ravaged inside
The sense of rage
Is burning my eyes
Burning in my eyes,
Burning to deny
I'm apart of
A fallen machine
Which reflects
My life of misery
Please guide
My way through
Fallen galaxies

Grand failure anthem
You'll never see what
You've become
We want to get some
Well-earned respect
Before we choke

Well, there isn't anything
That will kill our lust
Our lust for power
They say "May you get
An hour in heaven
Before the devil
Knows your dead!"

Grand failure anthem
You'll never see what
You've become
We want to get some
Well-earned respect
