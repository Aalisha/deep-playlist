It was back I remember in '33 when the great Jimmie Rodgers inspired me
To start movin' on start rollin' on
Said they can't do you wrong if you don't stay too long so keep a movin' on

You know the famous Jimmie well he's dead and gone
And my friend Hank Williams he sung his song
But they both moved on yes they're done long gone
But this old country train is still throwin' it's flames still a movin' on

[ piano ]
Ah doggies keep that ole piano movin' on

From the country fairs to the honky tonks
I played my ole guitar and I sung my songs
