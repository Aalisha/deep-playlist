I can dream about heaven constantly
Both day and night
I can let my mind drift away to a better place
A better time
Though there's nothing wrong with thinking about
Forever by and by
All the while millions are still searching for a light

Maybe it is time we take a look
At here and now
Maybe we can change the destiny
Of a world that's crying out
For the truth we take for granted
...
