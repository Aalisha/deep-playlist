Is it naive to make plans that seem so far away?
There's a reason I feel this way
You're sleeping alone
I'm awake
When you dream of me tonight, am I close to where you are?
(To where you are?)
Lay me down

And tell me everything will be alright
(Things will be alright)
Things will be alright
(Things will be alright)
Lay me down
And tell me everything will be alright
(Things will be alright)
Things will be alright
(Could)
This could mean everything or nothing at all
(All)
You take what is real
I'll give you my all

Is it naive to make plans that seem

So (so), so (so), so (so), far?
I think "let's not wait, let's love right now

Let's love right now"
