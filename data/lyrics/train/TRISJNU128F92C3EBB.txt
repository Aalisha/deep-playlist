Ha
I used to know this city like a needle knows its thread
We used to dance together like a pillow and a bed
I could see what was on the outside
But I can’t feel any death
And when I woke up (?) just like I’d never been

I thought this place would stay the same, forever
Twisted on the sidewalk by myself
Feels like I’m moving backwards on a foggy road
Wishing that I could ask somebody for help
But I’m moving backwards on a foggy road
