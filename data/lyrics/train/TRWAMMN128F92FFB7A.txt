Know what she's done to me, and I have been around
She sure can bring you pleasure, and she can bring you down
I should not tell you, if you want to learn
To take a tip from me now, don't turn your back on her

When she's promising you pleasure all night long
She may turn around and cut you to the bone

Chorus:
In a private room, she'll dance for you
In a private room, with just her high heel shoes
In a private room, she'll take your heart
And with you under her control, she will leave you all alone, all alone
...
