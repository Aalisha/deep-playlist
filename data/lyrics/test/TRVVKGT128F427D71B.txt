Pretty baby grew into a lady
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
Pretty baby

In the light of the dawn
A pretty babe was born
Her mother, she had sworn
To take good care of her

Every night Mom would pray
Her life would not be torn
Her clothes would not be worn
Until they dropped off of her

My child, you dear
Don't have no fear, I'll shed the tears
Keep your head clear, my pretty baby

Pretty baby grew into a lady
The people don't know
What your mama know, they don't
...
