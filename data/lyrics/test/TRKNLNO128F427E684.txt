Take no denial
No for an answer
Make a wish and make it total
Take a risk and make it fatal

I love to be here
Because it means so much to me
I love the action
Of a forced conspiracy

The word was strong
But you answered wrong
Mad dialects, mad dialects
Broken glass of a language
Mad dialects, mad dialects

Look for deception
No common truths
Link it up to every phone call
Say you lied, then hang it up

Well, it looks so doubtful
...
