Take a picture of tonight and keep it by your heart
Love has left us memories, there's no better way to part
I will find another love, someone new to drag me down
How you tried to level me but you never stood your ground

Fortunately I got wise this time, fortunately I got me on my mind

Oh, I just wanna be loved, don't wanna fight you, baby
But I'm much too proud to say it loud
I just wanna be loved, don't wanna beg you, baby
But I'm much too proud to say it loud

Take a piece of dignity and use it in your life
