I had so much to say
but no words to speak
The feelings were strong
but I was only weak

So there we were again
tragic and absurd
choking on every line
And every final word

A few pages from an old diary
a dusty shelf, an unread history
All these words and memories
are all of you that's really left for me

And a fading memory
can't cloud the pain
When the voice is gone
The words still remain

And the years that fall away
can't stop the rains
When illusion's gone
the truth still remains

A few lines from life's long soliloquy
a dying voice in one part harmony
...
