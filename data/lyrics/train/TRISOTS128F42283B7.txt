[King Kobra / H. Banger / Proffer]

Let's go!

[Chorus:]
We're gonna get your attention
Before the night is through
And when we get your attention
The we're gonna voodoo you
You know we're gonna voodoo you

Electric night
Standing room only
You'd sell your soul for a backstage pass
There's a buzz in the crowd
The amp lights are glowin'
...
