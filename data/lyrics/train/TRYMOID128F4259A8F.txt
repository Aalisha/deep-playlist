Well I believe there's someone
watching over you
They're watching every single
thing you say
And when you die they'll sit
you down
and take you through
You'll realise one day

Ahh that the grass is always greener
on the other side
The neighbour's got a new car
that you want to drive
And the time is running out
You wanna stay alive...
We all live under the same sky
We all will live we all will die
There is no wrong there is no right
The circle only has one side
side

side

We all try hard to live our lives
...
