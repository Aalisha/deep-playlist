what a wonderful day
everything is ok
not a problem in mind
leaving worries behind
except for that little doubt you have
concerning your dress tonight
so you take a bottle of french wine
and then you say you don't live twice
you cast the dice

masterpiece you should have seen it
that rainbow in the moonglow
masterpiece you got to live it
that new dawn tomorrow
