(Juelz)
Yeah nigga, I heard my man Luca was out
I guess he's...

(Chorus)
BACK A-GAIN,
Back with my 45, gotta new quarter drive
Tryin' to stay alllliiiiiivvveee
BACK A-GAIN
Same gansta team, new gangsta lean
Chasin' the f**kin' cream
BACK A-GAIN
Fitted to the back, Throwy well intact
Ladies holla back
BACK A-GAIN
This time we here to stay
Ain't got no time to play
Stay out my f**kin' way

(Verse)
Now I'm "Back A-gain", just like flash was
Bad like Shaft was, react like Cassius...
Clay did in the ring with his back up...
Against the ropes, jab, jab, back up
It's all for what, it's all for us, all for bucks
You chumps remind me of Mister Softee chucks
Icey niggaz, banana boat milkshake ice cream niggaz
I don't like these niggaz, nope
I pop shots, hot glocks, shoot through vans too
Oh-Bob-bobalo-bamboo, move
And I'm fo' really with the milly-o
Leave many wholes like the cereal Cheerios
You into funny money, I'm rakin' in silly do'
The type that don't really fold, just sittin' there and gettin' old
I got the game ina loop kid, kinda like Snoop did
It's more than me, it's more than the music
I'm...

(Chorus)
BACK A-GAIN,
...
