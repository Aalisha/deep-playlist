It's a blessin' that I'm even alive
It's a reason that I'm breathin', I believe there's a God
Hey, look what He done for me
Loo-loo-look, loo-loo-look, look what He done for me

Hey, some people choose not to believe
But I pray e'ry day when I drop to my knees
I say, look what You done for me
Loo-loo-look, loo-loo-look, look what You done for me

Hey, I wake up e'ry day and say thank You
When I'm floatin' off course then the Lord is my anchor
I know you feelin' me ain'tcha?
When I kill time with my son that's keepin' it gangster

I'm done beefin' 'cause I'm eatin'
I feel bein' a father to my son that's keepin' it real
And I'm the one providin' at home
So I can't leave my seed to survive on his own, no

No, it's not optional man
That's why I maneuver through the obstacles man
And I watch for the snakes that's in the grass
So I can stay alive and be a daddy to Cas

It's a blessin' that I'm even alive
