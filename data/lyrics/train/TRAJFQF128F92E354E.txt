First time I saw you standing on the corner
Thought maybe I'd died and went to Heaven
But I got to thinking and baby, I knew better
'Cause I know that angels don't, angels don't wear high-healed shoes
I don't need an angel
That don't fly around the blue
I'd be more than grateful
With a woman that was just like you

Sweet baby don't you change baby don't you change
Baby don't you change, baby don't you change a thing
No baby don't you change a thing
You don't need no angel wings
