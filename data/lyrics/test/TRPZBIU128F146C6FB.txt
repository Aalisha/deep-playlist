Dear Sir,
We know what your about,
You cannot say,
We didn't see it,
'Cos we can see, that your slacking,
Well its another habit that your cracking,

Whats the movement if you don't move?
What have you got left to prove?

Im not sure, how to stick to the floor,
I smashed on to your ceiling,
Let me sleep awhile, cos I cannot stand,
Break my fingers, hold my hand
