The paper called it suicide
A bullet from a forty-five
Nobody cared and nobody cried
Don't that make you feel sad?

Peter Brent combed his hair and sent
For the police
Policeman came took Peter's name
God may he rest in peace

No one saw the note beside the body
Nobody knew the problem but my God
Suicide
Yeah Mama
