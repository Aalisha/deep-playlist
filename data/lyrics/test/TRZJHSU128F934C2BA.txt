Streams of light in the dark
A light - darker than darkness itself
Petrified with nameless fear
Burning in every nerve
Could this - be an illusion
Is this right?

Sick in mind - Sick in heart
Become the undead
Sick in mind - Sick in heart
Born from guilt

To swallow the shame
Am I - feeding the fire
Burning all in it's way
No place to hide
Left out - Defenceless and senseless
...
