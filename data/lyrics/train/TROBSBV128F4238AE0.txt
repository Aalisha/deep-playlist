You think you've got it all worked out,
But you don't know nothing, nothing, nothing!
You think that you can rub me out,
But I'm made of something, something, something!

I can teach you a thing or two.
Yeah, yeah!
I can teach you a thing or two.
Yeah, yeah!
I can teach you a thing or two.
Yeah, yeah!
I can teach you a thing or two.

Raw, dirty, hot track,
Push it in and pull it back.
