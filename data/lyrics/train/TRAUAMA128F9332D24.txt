I want you so bad
The thought is driving me mad
Like a cat on the prowl
You come when you want and not when I call

So sly, so pretty
I wanna steal all the keys to your city
Tight skirt, skinny leg
You make a bad dog sit up and beg

You're everything I want
Everything I need
Come in out of the cold, pretty woman
Spend the night with me

Oh, you're so fine
Oh, I want to make your mine all mine
Till the end of time
Baby, you're so fine
