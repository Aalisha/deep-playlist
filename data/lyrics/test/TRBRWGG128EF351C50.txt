So go on
And I will refrain
And I'll keep on running this never ending race
And maybe next time will be the right time
And maybe next time will be your time

So save your scissors
For someone else's skin
My surface is so tough
I don't think the blade will dig in
Save your strength
Save your wasted time
There's no way that I want you to be left behind
