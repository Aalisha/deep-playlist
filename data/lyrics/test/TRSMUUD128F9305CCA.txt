Verse 1 
Out of luck with love, but still I played the game
Crossed the heart and hoped to God that it would change
So many times, afraid to give my heart away
That was before you came
Showed me another way

Bridge 1 
Close my eyes
And tell myself that it's all right (its ok girl, it's ok girl)
Do you feel the way I feel?
Cause if I let you in
Baby you can get the best of me

CHORUS 
The way that you love me, love me, love me
Sgot me thinkin I'm ready, ready, ready
When I couldnt see
You know you made me believe that
