I've been soother and I've been wife
Tried to solve your life
Stuck with you through your rainy days
Thought that it was just a phase

When the sun came out I tried
To get away and fly
But the needs we had did not subside
What a way for our love to die

I've been hiding behind my gifts
I give until it starts to rip
The skin is torn where I begin
