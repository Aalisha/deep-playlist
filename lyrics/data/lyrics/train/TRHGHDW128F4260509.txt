They call me the Hunter
And Lord, that's my name
A pretty woman (girl) like you
Child are my only game

I bought me a love gun
Just the other day
And I aim
To aim it your way

Ain't no use to hide
No there ain't no use to run
Cause I got you in the sights of my...

My love gun! My love gun! My love gun!
God-dammed!
