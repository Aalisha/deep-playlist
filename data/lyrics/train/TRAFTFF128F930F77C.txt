This moment is the rest of your life
This moment is the rest of your life
This moment is the rest of your life
I'm comin' atcha with a kitchen knife

You are the only one
Blow the fucking world to kingdom come
You are the only one
You make me wanna blow the world to kingdom come

Run, run, go and lock your door
I'll huff and puff and blow it to the floor
Your mind games have invited me here
Now you're all balled up and cringing in fear
At last, you'll see my diabolical grin
And now it's time for the fun to begin

This moment is the rest of your life
I'm comin' atcha with a kitchen knife

You are the only one
Blow the fucking world to kingdom come
You are the only one
