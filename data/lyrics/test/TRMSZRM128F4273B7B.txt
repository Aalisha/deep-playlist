Every once in a while, gotta use my superpowers,
Even though saving the world outta style,
It ain't my fault all this bad stuff is happening
but now its time i put my foot on down

aaaawwww baby,
my love don't seem the same

no no

They save love's all you need to heal the world,
plus a trillion billion dollars have you heard
There's president bush, santa claus and green goblin
saddam hussein, spiderman, and bin laden
brittany spears, jesus, and the whole cast of friends
met for brunch last week to solve the world's problems
well they called on me

aaaaww baby
my love don't seem the same

Well if they called on my name don't you know i'd do it
shine my signal over Gotham, I'll be true
It is my distinct pleasure to come down from my grass
...
