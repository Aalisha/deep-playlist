Yeah
I like that
You know what I mean
You're looking kinda fly tonight girl
What's up

Check it
Baby when the lights go out
I'll show you what it's all about
Coming at you girl
You know you I like this girl
Here we go
Check it

I ain't sorry for the way I feel
I know you think I'm being insincere
From the way I'm treating you
I never wanted to be so unkind
The only one thing on my mind
Is just kicking it with you girl

Baby it's not the way I feel
You know you must believe me
Baby it's not part of the deal
Oh, no, no
Baby when the lights go out

Every single word cannot express
The love and tenderness
I'll show you what it's all about
...
