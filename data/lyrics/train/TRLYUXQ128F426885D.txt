Out here alone, I will wear a thousand faces
I'm still waiting, the master of disguise
Can't you hear me calling in my deepest desperation

I talked to the angles, cause I'd broken every rule
And if you hurt me, there's a way back to you
I found a reason out in this mystery

A touch of heaven
I opened up my soul
Don't leave me waiting
Until my heart is gone

It takes two times
There's no holding back now
Until I found you again
Tears of rage
...
