Yeahoh

I've looked straight into your eyes
And turned my head for the last time
Because I was scared to leave these walls in ruin
Like the fate of those who trust in themselves
We are alone and afraid

I know YOU are the one we've left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
YOU're the one we've left behind
YOU're the one we've left

I will no longer turn my head
I will never forget YOU
YOU are the one we've left behind
YOU are the forsaken
