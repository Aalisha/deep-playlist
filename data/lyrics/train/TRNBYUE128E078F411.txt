When everything is going wrong
Things are just a little strange
It's been so long now
You've forgotten how to smile

And overhead the skies are clear
But it still seems to rain on you
And your only friends all have
Better things to do

When you're down and lost
And you need a helping hand
When you're down and lost
Along the way

Oh, just tell yourself
I'll, I'll be ok

Now things are only getting worse
And you need someone to take the blame
When your lover's gone
...
