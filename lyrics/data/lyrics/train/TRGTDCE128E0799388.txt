She met him Saturday
He stole her heart away
Twenty four, Sunday
They didn't chat at all

Romantic Monday
Tuesday, a better day
But Wednesday to Saturday
Don't know why he didn't call

Ohh, I wonder where you've gone
Ohh, did I do something wrong?

You said, "It's all about me"
You tell me what's the truth
I'm happy to be free
But I'm happier to be with you

He says, "It's all about me"
'Cause I'm trying to be cool
I'm happy to be free
But I'm happier just to be with you

Phone rang on Sunday
He's talking differently
I guess you put it down
