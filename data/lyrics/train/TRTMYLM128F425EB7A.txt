Losses, losers and more... Gain of life's pleasures
Cohorts listen behind the doors,
To a life, sheltered in... Less than zero in me
All my walls falling down... Pains aloft, misery

I'm sure that the lessons were learned
I'm sure that the punishments went well deserved
By the pawn in the plan... Taste of shit, bitterness
Walk from me, everything, systematically

Come on! You're the one,
You're the one to dredge up shit inside of me,
In my pointless life of nothing...
(Tell me!) what I'm supposed to be
(Tell me!) who I'm supposed to be
(Tell me!) what it takes to ascend
(Tell me!) what it takes to live

Patience, pleasures and rewards come in due time
Stare at the sun... I'm bored in a life, meaningless
Soaking up all of me, like The Cross you worship
...
