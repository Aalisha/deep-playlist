My generation's for sale, beats a steady job
How much have you got?
My generation don't trust no one
It's hard to blame, not even ourselves

The thing that's real for us is fortune and fame
All the rest seems like work
It's just like diamonds in shit

I'm high class, I'm a whore, actually both
Basically I'm a pro
We've all got our own style of baggage
Why hump it yourself?

You've made me an offer that I can refuse
Course either way I get screwed
Counter proposal, I go home and jerk off

It's truly a lie
I counterfeit myself
It's truly a lie
