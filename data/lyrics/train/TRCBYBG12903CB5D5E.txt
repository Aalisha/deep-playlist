Well, you know where you are and you know where you've been
But, oh, my brother, you're lost like me
And I'd offer a hand
But you know that you can't cut any corners when you're going in circles
When you're going...

So you look to the sky and start trusting your feet
To find the right path, and now you're not like me
I was never the type to put my trust into my luck
It's gone, if it was there to begin with

Either way, there's a hole we're digging right beneath our feet
