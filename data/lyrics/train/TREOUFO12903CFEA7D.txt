standing with bare backs against structures built strongly of good faith
add lies
subtract some care
obligation becomes optional and they collapse
Its all that we thought and theres nothing here
stand up and listen to the sounds
the bullets scream the children drop in silence face-first to the ground
theres no one to care
no one to see an end
jet planes explode midair and our dreams fill the cabin
