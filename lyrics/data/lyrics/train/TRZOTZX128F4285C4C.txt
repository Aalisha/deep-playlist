Down Hearted man where do you come from
You're troubled by the world and your situation
How can you justify what's so clear in your eyes
The operator is gone

Through all your contemplation you still don't understand
That the plight of your life was built by your own hands
How can you navigate the maze in your medicated haze
While the operator is gone

[Chorus:]
You've got the cure for your disease growing in your backyard, whoa
You've got the answers that you need right up in your backyard, whoa
