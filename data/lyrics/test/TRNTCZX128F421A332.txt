We're the working poor
We're the labor forced
Routine banality
We stand in the sun just to eat

Antiqued trappings
Filthy proximity
Languid surveillance
You were birthed into luck we were born into chance

We offer our bosoms while you beat your breast
Feed your children while you dance on our backs
We're the matrons of the canals
...
