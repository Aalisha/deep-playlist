And they met when they were young
with one thing in common
two big city kids lost in a stupid world
of egotistic boys and the lieing little girls

And he knows there was something there
cause he saw it in her stare
all he does is look back, something to hold onto
second guessing life cause he doesnt know the truth

(Chorus)
