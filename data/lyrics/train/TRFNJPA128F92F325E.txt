I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you

You're gonna remember me
I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me

Yeah, I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
I saw you with your new girl just yesterday

And I feel that I must confess
Even though it kills me to have to say
I'll admit that I was impressed

Physically just short of perfection
Gotta commend you on your selection
Though I know I shouldn't be concerned
In the back of my mind I can't help but question
Does she rub your feet
When you've had a long day
And scratch your scalp
When you take out your braids?
Does she know you like to play PS2
Till six in the morning like I do
I can't explain this feeling (yeah)
I think about it everyday
And even though we've moved on (uh huh)
It gets so hard to walk away

I'm gonna remember you
You're gonna remember me
Walk away
(Forever you will live in my memory)
Walk away

Walk away
I can't forget how we used to be
Our life from day to day
Hopin' maybe you'll come back
And though I tell myself not to be afraid
To move on but it seems I can't
Though a new man has given me attention
It ain't the same as your affection
But I know I should be content
In the back of my mind
