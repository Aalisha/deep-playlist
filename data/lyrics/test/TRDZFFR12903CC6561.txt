If you're feeling down or weak
You can always count on me
I will always pick you up
Nothing's ever gonna change
Nothing's gettin' in my way
I will always hold you up

Anything
Come what may
Don't look back forget yesterday
Forget yesterday

It's not where you come from
It's where you belong
Nothin' I would trade
I wouldn't have it any other way
You're surrounded
By love and you're wanted
So never feel alone
You are home with me
