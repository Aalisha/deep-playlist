I look at you, you bite your tongue
You don't know why or where I'm coming from
But in my head I'm close to you
We're in the rain still searching for the sun

You think that I wanna run and hide
I'll keep it all locked up inside, I just want you to find me

I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
We're never alone we're all the same as each other
You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered
