Young Hearts call for rebellion
Time for revenge is near
We overcome our fears
We're screaming to show our emotions
Cry out our anger and pain
The world has gone insane

It's time, to raise our banners high
We're challenging our fate
And our star will rise

United alliance, once and for all
Raise your hands and hail - Freedom Call
Raise your voice, break the silence
A hymn for us all, we are Freedom Call
