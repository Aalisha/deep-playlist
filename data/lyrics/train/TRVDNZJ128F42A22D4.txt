Pardon me for saying I was afraid
She'd never give me the time of day
If love is a slow dance
I just hope for one chance

I hope time could stop

What should I do?

Don't let this end now
Slow this dance down
I could stay here all night
Forever
(Forever)

This is not my strongest point, that she knows
