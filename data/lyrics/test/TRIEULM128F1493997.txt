Awake when the city sleeps
This hotel is dangerous
Pity poor Tom's doing favours for sailors
These walls are paper thin
Next door there's a bakery
I can go “n” get coffee
But it wouldn' hurt me
If I only today, I eman only today
Went first for a bloody Mary

Electroshocks in the sun
You can fry an eg on the pavement
It might just be too hot for me
Never been to Paris
But what a great name to put on a girl
