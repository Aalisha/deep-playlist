Baby it's, gonna take a little bit longer
For me to ever get you off of my mind
Baby it's, gonna take a little bit longer
'Cause I've been lovin' you a long long time

People try to tell me, that it won't be long
Till I won't even miss you anymore
But I can tell there must be something mighty wrong
...
