He said get out of here nobody wants you here
You smashed his head and the man died
And there's a murmur loud from the appearing crowd
Searching for motives and reasons why

Now take a look at yourself and you'll see
What you are in the eyes of the world
You didn't want it but now he is dead
And you're on the run from the law

Murderer in every town
Murderer to the whole world
Murderer you're on the run
Murderer you'll have to killâ€¦ again

And like an animal which escaped from the cage
They're hunting you over their holy land
Traps waiting everywhere you fall in deep despair
Darkness and night your only friends
