She fucks up a million times or more
She's at the same spot but now she's 44
She thinks she's 25 and just been dealt a bad hand
The house will soon collect 'cause things ain't how she planned

And when she rolled the dice
She lost every time
And now she pays the price, aww

The big "what if?" is what she would've been
With just a little bit of some good old perseverance
She gave up just like a spoiled princess in make up
She's got a ridiculous sense of entitlement
