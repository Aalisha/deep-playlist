Oh...1, 2, 3...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...oh, yeah...

You can close your eyes and pretend that everything's fine
But sooner or later you'll open your eyes
And reality will strike you blind
They're stealing all our money
And destroying all our dreams
We're working hard to make them rich
With their get rich corporate schemes, go!

We won't submit!
They're full of shit!
I'd rather die!
Than live a lie!

You bust your ass every week
You think that you are free
I want to take a fuckin' gun
And shoot them in the head
'Cause I won't rest until the day
That I look out and see
The lawyers and the politicians
All lying around dead

Punks unite, show some might
Don't go down without a fight
Don't back down, stand your ground
Let's go out and burn this town
We'll skank all night at the sight
Of the city burning bright
All around you'll hear the sound
Of the town burning down

(Open up your eyes)
You work for the system, you're a tool
...
