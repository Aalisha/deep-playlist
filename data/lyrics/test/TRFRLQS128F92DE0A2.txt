OOOHH

This old heart of mine, been broke thousand times,
Each time you break away, I think you're gonna stay
Only nights that come, memories that go bringing you back again, hurting me more and more.

Maybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel in inside,
'cause each day that passes by,

you got me never knowing if I'm coming or going but I...

I love you, this old heart of mine darling is weak for you
