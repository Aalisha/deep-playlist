not an ounce of sadness or truth in what you feel
sacrifice your sorrow for a shot at any deal
careful not to actually bleed from your heart
not that you can drain much from an empty fake

is it just me or does everything reek with the stench of mediocrity
is it just me or does everything seem to suck no matter how hard i
TRY. TO. FORGIVE
IT JUST CAN'T SEEM. TO. BELY
THE FACT THAT YOU. ARE. A
FUCKING WASTE OF LIFE!

recycling the talent of a god compared to you
new york city digs it so it must be something true
truth be known it's how we've felt the rape of our spirit
you have taken all the fire from the fight you lousy whore
