There's a tone in the sound of your voice
My heart is listening to
And a message inside of your mind, I can relate to
The feeling inside of your soul, I am feeling
Maybe soulmates exist after all

There's an energy inside your smile that shines upon me
And the positive sides of your dreams, I am dreaming
Simple understanding is what I need, hey, hee hey
