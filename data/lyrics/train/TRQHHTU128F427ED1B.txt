Well, look at the kid from school
He's teaching mamas and papas how to be a little cool
He's changing fashion, the way he dress
The tracksuits are old, and the hoodie's way too moody
For a kid with the will to funk
He dances in secret, he's a part-time punk

Now she's getting off the plane
She wants to write a thesis on the population underprivileged
The kids fighting up the lane
Shoplifting, just drifting
Like The Switchblade and the Cross
But if there's trouble she's got the moves
She's taking an elementary class in kung fu

I left my washing in the launderette
You can put some money on it, you can place a little bet
That when I see my washing
The black will be gray and the white will be gray
But the blues are still blue
...
