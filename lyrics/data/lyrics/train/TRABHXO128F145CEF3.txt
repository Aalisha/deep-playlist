Verse 1

The scent of flowers in the air
Your perfume is subtle and everywhere
Breath so sweet and warm against my skin
I breathe in deep and take you in

Your beauty takes my breath away
And in your embrace is where I want to stay
I've got to do all that I can to get close to you
Whoayeah

Chorus
