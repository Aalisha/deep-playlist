Ride
They came at dawn
into the morning light
black shadows ridin' on the mist
prepared for battle
swords were shinin' bright
filled with anger and harm
came to kill not to charm

The sound of metal
screamin' in the air
the time has come where justice rules
the endless victims
looking up in fear
now who were the fools
