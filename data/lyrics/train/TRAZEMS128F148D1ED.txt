I wish you never even loved me
It makes it so hard to live without love
Now I know, you're often thing of me
Sometimes I feel you so close by that
It takes all my might to keep from
Trying to track you down

I can surly keep you out of sight
Forget about the way you look
Your smile, the way you speak
But I've heard in the dead of night
Outside my window silence breaking
With the solid destination of your lonesome speed

I know the sound of your wheels
