You can pick me up
You can pull me down
You can treat me like a circus clown
Anything that you, you feel you wanna do

You got my only number, it's up to you
If you don't want to call, what am I to do?
You got my only number, it's up to you
If you don't wanna call

Dial 999 this is an emergency
999 this is an emergency
999 this is an emergency
Come closer to my love, close to my love, ooo

(999 is not in service)
Why don't you pick up the telephone?
Why don't, why don't cha pick up the telephone?

You can claim that you're mad, be her biggest fan
