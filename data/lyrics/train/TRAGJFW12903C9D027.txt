Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
Stop and let me ride
Rock me lord, rock me lord
Calm and easy
Well I've got a home on the other side

Well, well, well, well, well, well

Ezekiel went down in the middle of a field
He saw an angel workin' on a chariot wheel
Wasn't so particular 'bout the chariot wheel
Just wanted to see how a chariot feel

Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
