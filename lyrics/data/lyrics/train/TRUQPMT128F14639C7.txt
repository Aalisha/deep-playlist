Well good morning captain
Good morning to you sir hey hey yeah
Do you need another mule skinner
Down on your new mud run hey hey yeah

Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he

Well I'm a lady mule skinner
From down old Tennessee way, hey, hey
I come from Tennessee
And I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept your pay hey hey
I won't take your pay
