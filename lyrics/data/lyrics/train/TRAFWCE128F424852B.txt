A lifetime of degradation
Preparation for the ultimate sin
Immature organs to disgrace
Creators of birth, smeared with blood

Becoming one of thousands
Not to feel the pain
Mutation into multiple minds
Total unfeelingness dispersed to them

Tortured existence...

Tortured existence...
...They Will take blood-secrets
...
