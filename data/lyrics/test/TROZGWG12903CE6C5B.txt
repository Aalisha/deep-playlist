She was waiting at the station
He was getting off the train
He didn't have a ticket so he had to bum through the barriers again

Well, the ticket inspector saw him rushing through
He said "girl, you don't know how much I missed you but we better run
'Cos I haven't got the funds to pay this fine"
She said, "fine"

So they ran out of the station and jumped on to a bus with two of yesterday's travel cards and two bottles of Bud
Then he said, "you look well nice"

Well, she was wearing a skirt and he thought she looked nice and yeah she didn't really care about anything else
'cos she only wanted him to think that she looked nice and he did

But he was looking at her all funny in the eye
She said, "c'mon boy, tell me what your thinking now, don't be shy"
He said, "alright, I'll try"

All the stars in the sky and the leaves in the trees
All broken bits that make you trip up and grassy bits in between
