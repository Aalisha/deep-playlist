I remember you giving me your number when I met you
I remember you asking me if I could walk you home
I remember you said to me you want to be my girlfriend
It's funny how these things don't last for long
Not funny how I don't know the way to carry on

Tell me how am I suppose to get you off my mind
When you know I really couldn't if I tried
But I guess in the mean while
I'm taking you off speed dial
Tell me how am I suppose to get you off my mind

And every time I hear the song that used to play when you called
I used to wanna sing along, but now I wanna die
