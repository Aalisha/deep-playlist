How many times
Do I have to say
To get away--get gone

Flip your shit past another lass's
Humble dwelling

You got your game, made your shot
And you got away with a lot, but I'm not
Turned on

So put away that meat you're selling
Cuz I do know what's good for me
And I've done what I could for you
But you're not benefiting
And yet I'm sitting
Singing again
Sing, sing again

How can I deal with this
If he won't get with this
Am I gonna heal from this
He won't admit to it
Nothing to figure out,
I gotta get him out
It's time the truth goes out
That he don't give a shit about me
