Let the rhythm hit 'em

I'm the arsenal, I got artillery, lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm, then I'm 'a give 'em piano
Bring a bullet-proof vest, nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain, now, what the trigger say

Tempos triflin', felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies, might go right through
Simultaneously like an Uzi, nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady say don't lose me

So re load quickly and you better hit me
While I'm lettin' this Fifi get wit me, you steppin' with 007
Better make it snappy, no time to do your hair, baby
Brothers are bustin' at me, beats and bullets pass me

None on target, they want the R hit, but watch the god get
Quicker, the tongue is the trigger, 'cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em, let 'em feel the blast
Penetrate at a crazy rate, this ain't no 38

Hit 'em at point blank range and watch 'em radiate
Runnin' out of ammunition, I'm done wit' em
You ask me how I did 'em, I let the rhythm hit 'em

I push a power that's punishable, better be a prisoner
The hit man is the, brother wit' charisma
Showing you that I have, powerful paragraphs
Followers will become leaders, but without a path

Ya mentally paralyzed, crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred, then it occurred that you heard I
Reduced the friction with crucifixion, let loose the mix then
Boost the piston, Eric hit 'em with' some of that

Cut like a lumberjack and me gettin' hit back
It won't be none of that, I'm untouchable
You see me in 3-D, when I let the rhythm hit another M.C.
Lyrics made of lead, enters your head
