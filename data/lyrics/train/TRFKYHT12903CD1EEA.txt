Well i let down virginia
When i told her i was bound for leaving
I told her that the city air
Just weren't worth my breathing
Then i packed my bags and left her
On her own;
Moving sad and slowly
Down the san antone
And i'm never gonna set foot in her house againâ€¦

I never said i'd leave her
But i never said that i would stay
And i don't mean to deceive her
But she knows it has to be this way
So walk outside and take a ride
...
