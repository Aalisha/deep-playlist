After all I've done for you, the things you say, the things you do the way you
treat me. I don't deserve this. I brought you from nothing and turn you into
something and this the thanks I get, damn.

Tell me why you say things you don't really mean
Tell me why you always wanna fight with me
When I gave you everything
Tell me why you wanna be so mean
Tell me why you wanna say theses things
Baby girl I don't understand why
Why should I even try

All the things that I did for you how could you (why) just go and change up
your ways girl what did I do (why) for you just be so cold to me mean to me
(why) why you trying to say things that hurt feelings (why, why) when you know
I'm giving you all of me (why, why) when you know I'm giving you everything
(why, why) why you keep coming at me so wrong baby all I want to know is

Tell me why you say things you don't really mean
Tell me why you always wanna fight with me
