I would lose all my blues
If you promise that your love was true now
And I don't know why I keep lovin' you the way I do now
Cause you leave me alone to cry on my own
I swear you got a heart that's made of stone
Made of stone
And I don't know why I keep lovin' you the way I do
But I do now
I cry, you know why I would die if you left me again
The tears and the years would have all surely been in vain, now
But you keep on leavin' me alone
