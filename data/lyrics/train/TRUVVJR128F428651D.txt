Stamping out the acient cultures to spread a new disease
sailing on a dollar sign across the seven seas
the banner is white, blue; red
the locust's flight to swarm the dead
a buzzing plague to cage the lost
the spreading web breeds holocost
the third world's in your sweaty hands
you bleed 'em dry; rape their lands
you loan 'em cash to kill their soils
white bureaucrats divide the spoils

Swirling red; blue lights flash upon the housing walls
my back against the lockless doors of countless bathroom stalls
sifting through a puzzled life until the pieces click
wading through america-the hate, the lies, the sick

(I'm) spittin'at the flag you wave
(I'm) pityin'the life the life you gave
the propaganda zombifies
to stuff your head with hateful lies
; violence really keeps the peace
all across the middle east
with diligence we scorch the soil
and siphon out their prcious oil
...
