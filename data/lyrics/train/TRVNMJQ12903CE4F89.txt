Song came and went like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I'd laugh and he'd smile and it would last for a while
You don't know what you got 'til you lose it all again

Listen to the mandolin rain, listen to the music on a lake
Listen to my heart break, everytime that he goes away
Listen to the banjo wind, a sad song drifting low
Listen to my tears roll down my face as he turns to go
