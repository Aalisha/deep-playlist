I look at this mountain
So many heartaches wide
And I can't help but wonder
Where's the other side

I've got to be honest
I've got my doubts
These tears are asking me
What's this got to do with love?

Baby, I'll tell you something
To help us through this long, dark night

When this trouble passes over
You and I will walk away
Knowing that our love survived
Another test of faith

You and I can walk on water
The river rises, we rise above
...
