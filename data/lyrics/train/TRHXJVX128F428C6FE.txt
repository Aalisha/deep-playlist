Up in the country...
Back in the sticks...
Down in the woods... in the woods... in the woods... (Hey)
That's what little country boys do... (Hey)

Ain't got good sense
His drawers is a mess (Cabbage greens)
I don't want to act right
Or God'll kill me
Got keloid skin
Makes us all feel him (Get some leg)
Stylin', profilin'
That's why we like to hang with him

Poppy ain't got no home training ()
Mama gives such a low rating ()
Triflin' energy draining got no home training ()

Making feet for socks (Cabbage greens)
Got big hindparts
He's drinking out the whole jug
Or God me kill me
Don't want to act right
Acting all ign'ant (Till I get right)
That's why, why we like to hang with him
