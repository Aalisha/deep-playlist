I lose myself, I forget myself
Sometimes I fault myself
Yes, I might fight myself
But then I make amends

I freeze myself, rain on myself
Ok, so I stone myself
And I might even find myself
But then again, what happens if I do?

So unzip my pride
Baby, open me up wide now
So I can show this to you

I wanna shine for you
Babe I wanna sparkle too
I tell you're just like a diamond cursed
Well you know it don't get no worse
Well you know that I'll save your time
Your trouble now is mine
