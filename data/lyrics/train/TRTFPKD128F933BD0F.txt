Too many women
In this big black room
Too many people
With the same perfume
Too many women
But not enough of you

Too many prisoners
In this sinking ship
Too many ribbons
At your fingertips
Too many reasons
For me to be blue
But not enough of you
Not enough of you

Chorus:
But I will wait for you
To figure it out
Soon you'll be chasing me
Through the out door
Onto the street
...
