A poor man on the corner
I could give to You by buying him lunch
But I rarely think about it
'Cause I got a little but it's not that much
And I pray Lord won't You help me
Give me a little bit more for myself
And You say Child won't you let me
Take all that you got and give you a little real wealth

CHORUS
And I don't know what You want, what You see in my life
And I don't know what You mean, how You could be glorified
I'm not too sure about this idea of sacrifice
