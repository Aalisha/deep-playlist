Follow the underdog
Hold on its collar tag
This city loves a scrap
One day it's gonna bite

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from having
A good day on a bad day
There's good days and bad days

Making a night of it
Breaking the barriers
Drowning your sorrows
Upset the regulars

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from getting away with
Good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days

Oh, hey, hey
Hey, hey
...
