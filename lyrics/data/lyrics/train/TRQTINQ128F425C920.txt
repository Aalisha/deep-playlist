You walk into the room and the temperature falls
The mood disappears
Chased away by the gathering storm that is here
I look up painted sky full of memories
And this house has no roof to shelter me

It's an automatic rainy day when I see you
It's the perfect consolation prize, a little piece of blue
It's an automatic rainy day
It's an automatic rainy day
