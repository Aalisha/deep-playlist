I saw this guy go down
Wasn't time for fear
Before his body hit the ground.

Our vulnerability is all our insensitivity

Car that hit him pull to a stop.
Driver hid the bottles
He anticipated cops.

Our vulnerability is all our insensitivity

Crowd assembled to take a look at death.
Shattered skull fragile body
...
