Hold up, let me take my pants off baby
Hold up, let you make love to me baby
Hold up, let me take my pants off baby
Hold up, let you be real to me baby

Messing around again, acting like way back when
We were just beside ourselves with love
Touching your lovely skin, remembering feelings within
To rush the moment could be so hasty when you taste me

Hold up, let me take my pants off baby
Hold up, let you make love to me baby
Hold up, let me take my pants off baby
