2, 3,
Forever and a day on my way on my way
I thought about this for a while here’s what I have to say:
I punched a girl in the face pretty fun when I was 5
I got my head kicked by a horse but I am still alive

Sounds like the last thing to be
Is me

My self-confidence grew and I tried to be cool
Jumped from a 10 foot platform but I missed the pool
Then it finally happened what overnight made me a pro
Age 13, front row – maiden show!

Sounds like the last thing to be
Sounds really lame but not to me

It’s pretty, pretty, pretty amazing
How the condition became so severe
It’s pretty, pretty, awkwardly crazy
How little expertism lives in here
Write a word, sing a note
In the next episode
Pay the rent, what the fuzz?
Ride around in a bus
It’s pretty, pretty, pretty amazing to see
...
