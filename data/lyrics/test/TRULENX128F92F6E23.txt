Yeah...

I know what darkness means
(And the void you learned from me)
The isolation stings
(so it thick it wants to bleed)
The echoes in my brain
(all the things you said to me)
You took my everything
(now I'm coming for you)

Chorus:
I won't back down
I will not bow
(I've come to bring you hell)
I can't forget
...
