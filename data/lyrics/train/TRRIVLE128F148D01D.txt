Everybody wants to do their own things
But inflation is rising
Everybody wants a little happiness
But we all got to pay a price

Cash in the hand is all they want
Cash in the hand is all they need
That's how it is today
Cash in the hand is all I want
Cash in the hand is all I need
It helps me through the day

I just can't get enough, when will I get enough
It makes me feel so rough, oh it makes me feel so rough
When I can't get enough, when will I get enough
