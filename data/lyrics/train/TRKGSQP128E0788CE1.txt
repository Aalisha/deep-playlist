{One two three four}

Well you're walkin' and a talkin'
And a movin' and a groovin'
And a hippin' and a hoppin'
And a pickin' and a boppin'
Those bods are being bad
You better take a stand
You gonna wake up that thing in your hand
You're looking all around
There is trouble to be found
Make sure when you find it you get to say it loud
Gotta code three need back up
Bring me my bright red fluro jacket

He's fat and he don't run too fast
Well you're walkin' and a talkin'
But he's faster than me
Show my walkie talkie man
Last night at the show we saw him
We'r walkin' and talkin'
Going out of his tree go go go go

Well you're walkin' and a talkin'
