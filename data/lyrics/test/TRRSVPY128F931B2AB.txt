Goin' to a go-go
Goin' to a go-go
Na na na na, yeah

Well, there's a brand new place I've found
Where people go from miles around
They come from everywhere
And if you drop in there
You might see anyone in town

Goin' to a go-go
(Everybody's)
Goin' to a go-go
(Come on now)
Don't you want to go
(Yeah)

One more time, yeah
I'm goin' to a go-go
Ooh, ooh, whee
Goin' to a go-go
Baby, come on now
...
