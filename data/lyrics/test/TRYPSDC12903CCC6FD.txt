Go away from my window, leave at your own chosen speed.
Im not the one you want babe, im not the one you need
You say your lookin for someone who's never weak but always strong.
To protect you and defend you whether you are right or wrong. Someone to open each

and every door.
But it aint me babe, no no no
It aint me babe

It aint me your lookin' for, babe.
