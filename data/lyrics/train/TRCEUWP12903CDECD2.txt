I left Garden City Kansas with a ticket and a yen to see New York
I typed eigty words a minute so your corporation let me go to work
I fetch paper clips and coffee even help you dodge your domineering wife
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life

In this building there's a crowd of guys with old familiar thoughts upon their minds
That's a lot of hands a reaching out you grab the things that I consider mine
And the president persues me even though he's old and hair a turnin' white
Mr Walker it's all over I don't like the New York secretary's life
