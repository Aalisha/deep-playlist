Oh how your mind's not on it
Pass me a book and i'll read you a sonnet, girl
Walls go up and guards come down
He's bangin' on the door thinkin' "where the fuck is she now?"
So open your mouth and stick to your guns
You've gotta realise that she's indifferent
Woah oh ah oh what's your name?
Just won't learn, here we go again
