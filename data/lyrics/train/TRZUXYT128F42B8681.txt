On a bed of rusted nails I lay
Just waiting for the sun to fade

Well I tried to escape this
But I'm lost inside, I'm lost forever
Well I tried to escape this
But I've lost my mind, so God please save me

Will I fly away?
Into the night?
Will I fly away?
Am I dreaming again?

I sit and suffer
I've been waiting forever
And I think it's over now
I sit and suffer
...
