I'd like a flat white, a day of pale skies
And a real kiss

Inside an old house, by the seaside
You can take off my blouse

but take it from me;
I'm disorderly and you'd be off better
writing someone else your love letter
cause I'm always on the road

And of course I wanna know you better
But you know the way it goes

Well a telegram's no substitute
when it comes to living proof

oh go on
and write somebody else,
oh somebody else,
oh anybody...

Your love letter.
