Everyday is just settling in the dust
Unless you come right to me
When the day is gone, and the night has come
With you here beside me

And then you drown me in desire like an ever burning fire
Sometimes you might think
That I'm playing games with you
â€˜Cause I don't blink
Like a game of cards

I'm the queen of hearts

And I just can't back out
But if you know the truth
My soul has fallen for you
This is it, I'm only gonna tell you once so save me
...
