I want you (I want you)
The right way (the right way)
I want you (Yes I do)
But I want you to want me too (want me too)
Want you to want me, baby (and I wanna it 2 be the right way)
Just like I want you

I give you all the love I want in return sweet darlin'
But half a love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, oh baby
