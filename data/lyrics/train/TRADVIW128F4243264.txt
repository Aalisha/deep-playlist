Sad as it seems
Nothing lasts forever
Still the trails of souls survive
Silence the screams
Something has to save us
From the pain of suicide

We see the warning sign
Seems we always wait for someone to die
For no reason

Fighters
You always said the face of death
Would soon arrive
Runners
Until the end
Pray for new life to begin

Lakes of frozen tears
Lifeless souls lie empty
...
