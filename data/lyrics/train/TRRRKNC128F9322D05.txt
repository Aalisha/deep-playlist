Ya don't stop, you keep on
Ya don't stop, you keep on
Ya don't stop, you keep on

Hey, it's the junkyard nigga, kid, you know what I'm about
Puffin' on a fat one, guzzlin' a Guinness Stout
Bonin' bitches on a regular, word up, my game is lethal
That's my word, I'm tellin' ya

Livin' foul like a motherfucka, that's the way it's been
Ever since I was a shorty, sucker
So don't even try to flex, I'll put a round in your chest
And leave you in a fuckin' mess

Niggas know my style they be playin', if I have to catch a body
I will, know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas from Corona don't be havin' it, you put your face in my grill
I'll be stabbin' it

You fuck around and catch a bad one, I'll kill you like a 6pack
And put you in a bag, son
And I still ain't frontin', fully loaded keg shells
Ready to go huntin'

Ya don't stop, you keep on
Ya don't stop, you keep on
Many MC's that defeated me, please wave your arm
Ya don't stop, you keep on
...
