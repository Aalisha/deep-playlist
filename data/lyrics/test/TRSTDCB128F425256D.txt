Colder than ice
The world falls apart
Cold like a stone
The spell on the souls
Colder than ice
Your hand on my hearth
A world made of stone
Let tenderness freeze

Save the fairyland we live in
Where all failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a griffin
I fall down
Straight down
Save the fairyland we live in
Where my failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a griffin
I'm falling straight down
