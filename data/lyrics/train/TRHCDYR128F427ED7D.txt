Only two more days until your birthday
Yesterday was mine
You'll be turning five
I know what it's like
growing up without your father in your life

So I pretend I'm doing all I can
and hope someday you'll find it in your heart
to understand why I'm not around
and forgive me for not being in your life

I remember waiting for you to come
...
