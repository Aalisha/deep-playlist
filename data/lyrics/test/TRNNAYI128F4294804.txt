The king of pirates, the queen of soul
They dance together on rock 'n' roll
Oh, once a lifetime and twice a day
[Incomprehensible] playing in west L.A.

Flames, hold the candle
It's too hard to handle
Wake up, don't dream babe
Wake up, wake up

Tonight call me Dr. Love
Love me in a new dimension
Love me babe

Tonight we are strong enough
Baby, it's a sweet sensation
Come and love me now

Call me now
Baby now
Call me now
