On this coldest of January nights,
we'll drive out past the runway,
And watch the planes go flying by
The runway lights are the deepest blue
Like the colors of your eyes,
So close them tight and kiss me one last time

If you could go anywhere right now, where would you go,
And would you miss me when you get there
There's no place that I would rather be

Please don't let me, go falling from the sky,
This fasten seatbelt sign just needs to go out
...
