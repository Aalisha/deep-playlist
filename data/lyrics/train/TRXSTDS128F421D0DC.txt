I never thought you'd do like this
You were my sex and I'm your miss
We've reached the bottom line

I held your head and you did mine
You gave me folds and I turned blind
Gave in from time to time

If you grab my hands like this
It's like the first time that we kiss
If you grab my hands like this
Your unleashed wrath will be unmade
...
