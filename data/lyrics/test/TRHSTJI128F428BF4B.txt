So many headlines, so many lies
What in the world does it take to survive?
So many headaces, negative views
I'll tell you what the people could fucking use...
SELF WORTH - Brace yourself!
SELF WORTH - You hate yourself!
SELF WORTH - And the hand that you were dealt!
SELF WORTH - Because I'm value driven!
