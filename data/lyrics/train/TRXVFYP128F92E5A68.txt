These feet have walked so many miles
And on so many continents,
Still this heart is beating wild
As yet of no great consequence
But o
When the rhythm is right
I catch a wind and fly

Far beyond these Paris nights
Into another consciousness
The fortune teller isn't right
It's scary but it's glorious
...
