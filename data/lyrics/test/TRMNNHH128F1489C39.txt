I came into town with a knapsack on my shoulder
And a pocket full of stories that I just had to tell
You know I've knocked around a bit
And I've had my share of small town glories
It's time to hit the city and that crazy carousel

I been feeling sorry for myself
But you know I was only lonely
Like everybody else

Until you brought your Sunday morning sunshine
Here into my Monday morning rain
You taught me happiness just one time
It keeps on coming back again
