I'll take this chance and won't look back
I could never feel that way again
You crush the lights I've known so long
and all I thought was real

Confusion clouds my mind
Stop looking at me that way right now
Your god told you that it's ok
I guess you'll see what's real

So, tell me now
Why should I take this from you
How could I waste my time
Why should I take this from you
...
