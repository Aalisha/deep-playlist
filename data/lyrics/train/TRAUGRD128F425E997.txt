I walked around,
And trough the empty halls,
I could hear the sound,
Echoing a call,
Of a love so strong,
That gently slipped away,
Now there's no one left to hold today,
You know what they say

When your heart is bleeding it'll heel in time,
But what if I myself am guilty of the crime,
â€˜Cause I see

I didn't realize I had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame
...
