I gotta get my self together
'Cause I got some place to go
And I'm prayin when I get there
I'll see everyone I know

I wanna go to Heaven
I wanna go to Heaven
Said, "I wanna go to Heaven"
I wanna go to heaven, do you wanna go?

Any way I can explain it
That in life we go through changes
But we know it deserves a purpose
Yes sometimes it just seems worthless

But this race that I'm running
Whether I run it fast or slow
Long as I just keep on running
I'm gonna make it there some day I know
...
