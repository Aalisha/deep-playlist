(R. Halford / R. Z. / J. Baxter)

When I look around me
And see what's going on
I think about the time we had
And where we all came from

[Bridge:]
Here comes the dream that's been waiting
The triumph we seek is so close it's so near
I love the chance we've been taking
The moment for us is right here
