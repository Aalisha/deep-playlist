Let fall your soft and swaying skirt
Let fall your shoes, let fall your shirt
I'm not the ladykilling sort
Enough to hurt a girl in port

Marie's gone blonde and lost a stone
She lay on her lawn, spun and alone
And, when the morning sun it rose
Upon Marie in her lacy clothes

It lit her up, and she walked around
The winding streets of Camden Town
She doesn't know who she wants to be
And if I knew, I'd tell Marie

Let fall your soft and swaying skirt
Let fall your shoes, let fall your shirt
I'm not the ladykilling sort
...
