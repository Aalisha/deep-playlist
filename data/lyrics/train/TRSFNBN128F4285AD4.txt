I ain't even gonna ask you
I can read you like a book
Girl, if I ever saw one that's an
I can't believe I did that look
you look like something
That the cat drug in
So I won't kick you while you're down
Just let me tell you, friend to friend
About a block I've been around

Did you really think last night
Would last forever
Did you really think that guy
Hung the moon
Right now, you hate yourself
Cuz you knew better
But there's no use crying
Over spilled perfume
