Forever chaos rule
All lives, all suns, all worlds
All depths, all skies will fall

Fools you think you're safe
In your world of light
But you are like dust
In a hurricane
Your world was raised by them
Made by dreams of the gods
And your empty lives
Is only a fools work

The work of the week are what you are made of
Soon they will wake up the bringers of chaos
No God or man can withstand their will
Soon they will wake up your world will be dead
