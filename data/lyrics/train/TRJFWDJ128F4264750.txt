Can you take me as I am?
Oh and the sting of my sweat against your mouth
You judge me till there's nothing left
You and your opinions wear me out

You don't know me, I'm immune, I am free
Not a slave to your beliefs
I'm immune, out of reach
You're alone, stuck with your disease

You hate the things that I say
And who I seem to be
But you don't look so normal to me

Serve your daily rituals
Then make up the rules to suit yourself
I'll never be what you are
...
