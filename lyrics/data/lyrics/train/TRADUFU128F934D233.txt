Religion, obedience, the meaning of their life
Many die before them, a sacrifice to lies
Enforcing a new faith, spilling tons of blood
Of all those who denied serving their false God

An atheist, a sinner, I refuse to obey
I follow my own path, I will never pray
Divinity and Trinity, what a bunch of crap
They won't stand a chance, I elude their trap
