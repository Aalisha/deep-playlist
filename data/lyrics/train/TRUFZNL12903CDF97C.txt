Scattered your beliefs
As you're going straight to hell
Practiced what you preach
And the stories that you tell
Protest for your death
Well, it's quickly on the rise
Choose your faith wisely
For your culture is set to die
Protest and devotion
Are the signals of your death
Feel the pain that he sustained
For this is your last breath
Your body is the target
And the fire is your gun
A fire baptism and nothing's left undone

Visions of command
Destruction is at hand
The fire set to burn
Won't you take a bite
Out of self immolation
...
