18 years since I saw you the first time and I'm still here right next to you
We've had our ups and our fair share of downs that we've both been through
You know I've done wrong but I've tried to be strong and give in to you
If that's what it takes to make everything work out then that's what I'll do
To get through to you

The best and the worst, the last and the first
The love of my life is a blessing and curse
