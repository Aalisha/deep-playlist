There's a bookstore in town where no one reads
And those who remember will disappear
I hate to see them getting old
But they're better dead than read

I've just discovered something new
America called and put cables on us
Now it's crazy like Disneyland
The return of the soft machine
The return of the soft machine

Take a look what's going on
The entertainment has begun
Driving in a golden car
Bigger than America

Everybody can be a fool
You can't see it but you know it's coming
The cars are flying and the people dying
Now we're back on the wild side again
