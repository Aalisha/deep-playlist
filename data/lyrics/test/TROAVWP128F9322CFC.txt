Running wild, the city sleeps
You're waking up and you're feeling strong
It won't take long and once you're gone
Where and why as you're moving on

When you lie, when you do
Who's gonna tell ya where's the truth?
Will you see it and will you try?
I wanna love you but I don't know why

The morning colors you blue
In the night you're the king of taboo
Though you never could explain
What's your game?

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'Cause you're stuck just a little, move along
...
