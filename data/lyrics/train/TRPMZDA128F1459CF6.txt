It just took a little while for me to get my head together
Growing up's the hardest thing I've ever done

And mothers never died in but she did
And I remember feeling guilty cause I couldn't wait to leave here
Though I loved 'em every way that I knew how
So I packed up all my yesterdays and headed for tomorrow
