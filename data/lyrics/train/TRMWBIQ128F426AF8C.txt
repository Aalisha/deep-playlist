This goes out to all my niggas
Spendin' they last on gas, grass and ass
And to all my ladies playin' in bars free drinks
And shit push it up, push it up

Keep on, ya don't stop, if ya don't stop maybe ya won't stop
If ya won't stop maybe ya can't stop
So keep on, keep on an on ya keep on
Ya don't stop, if ya don't stop maybe ya won't stop
If ya won't stop than ya can't stop, so keep on, keep on an on

Rebellious I, felonas city slicker
Real nigga hit ya district with the impact of a twista
Now clear the zone, rhyme down the phone lines and toss motor homes
My poems were found next to dinosaur bones

Perform by the elders before the kings thrown
This style has no origin or birth date
And scientists research can not calculate
The great mind skatin' through space and time

Vibratin' thru the bass lines that stun man kind
Reclined in the leather seat the cassette blasts
Vocals that smash out the bullet proof glass
Rippin' through your 15's like Wolverine

Sick with the lyric there be no vacine
You attach with the tractor beam, rap fiend
And all heads who feel it lick off a magazine
...
