I'm worried 'bout you baby
Down in your rabbit hole
The evening of our great escape
Is starting to unfold
Out of bed sleepy head
It's different than you know
Everybody pays as they go

You've got to pull yourself together
Your chin up off your throat
Whistle for the dogs
And get your sled into the snow
Nothing's ever buried
Under skull and bones
...
