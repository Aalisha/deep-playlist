You don't see the blood
You don't see the pain
You don't see the bolt
Going through their brain
You don't smell the death
You don't hear their cries
You don't see the fear
Flashing in their eyes
You feed upon the meat of the weak
The weak must die to satisfy
The needs of the strong
Their purpose in life
Can't be to make you fat
We've got to stop thinking like that!
You don't see the blood
You don't see the pain
You don't see the bolt
Going through their brain
You don't smell the death
You don't hear their cries
You don't see the fear
...
