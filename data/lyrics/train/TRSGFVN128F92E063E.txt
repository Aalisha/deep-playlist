Have you seen them?
The words cut open
Your poor intestines
Can't deny
Inky periods drip from your mailbox
Blood flies dip and glide reach down inside

There's something living in these lies
And when your newest kisser was peakin'
You dress yourself out tonight
Getting tangled up in arms and legs
It's comfortable
