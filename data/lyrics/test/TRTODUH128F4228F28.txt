Who's gonna love you
Who's gonna take my place
And stand by your side
Kiss you and hold you
Console you when you cry

I'll always love you, I know
Baby, don't go

Come closer, cara cara mia
Cara cara mia, love is all we need
I swear I'll never gonna leave you
Cara cara mia, you're the one for me
When someone loves like I do
Dreams can come true
So tell me, tell me now
Oh, cara cara mia, cara cara mia how
Can you leave me now
