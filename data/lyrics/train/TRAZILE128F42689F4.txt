You must think by now that I'm obsessed with you.
Friends they say that you don't think the way I do.
I was so mistreated by the way you moved.
I'd ask you just what you thought too,
but if I stand that close to you... Oh.
I don't want to be the girl that's driving you home.
Just to see you in and turn and go back alone.
