Hi-i-i-i-i-igh
Hi-i-i-i-i-igh

Hi-i-i-i-i-igh
Hi-i-i-i-i-igh

High, high as the sky
Low, low as it goes
Purple dragons fly into your eyes
Milkshake shimmy, cry and cry and cry

You're gonna don gon do it
You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna don gon do it
You're gonna make me fly
You're gonna gon don do it
You're gonna make me cry
You're gonna gon don do it
You're gonna make me fly
