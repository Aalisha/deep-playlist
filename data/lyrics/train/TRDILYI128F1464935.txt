Avoiding this is like avoiding a plague
We can't understand the advances we made
We've tried to resist but it's so hard to say no
We're pretending to see what the future will hold
We appear to be in control of our fate
Just like soldiers believe they're in control of a war
But its moving so fast we cannot see what we've done
we're losing our eyes just to say that we've won

My mind's made up, my heart is broke
My fortune's is made me and I feel so choked
I can't understand how we could ever believe
