You're pushin' too hard, uh-pushin' on me
You're pushin' too hard, uh-what you want me to be
You're pushin' too hard about the things you say
You're pushin' too hard every night and day
You're pushin' too hard
Pushin' too hard on me (too hard)

Well all I want is to just be free
Live my life the way I wanna be
All I want is to just have fun
Live my life like it's just begun
