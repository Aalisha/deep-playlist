The first time that I met you I knew
One day I would know you even better
When people tried to tell me "Do not fall for him"
I told myself "Don't let them get to you"

You are the only one I love
You are the only one I love
You are the only one I love to love

You are the only one I love
You are the only one I love
You are the only one
