I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what life is
I wanna know everything

I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what love is
Is it something I do to myself?

All is fair in love and war
Or so they say and so the saying goes
But I've seen more broken hearts
Than you can count the bullets in a war

Oh, what do I know?
There's gotta be so much I don't know

I wanna do great things
I don't wanna compromise
I wanna know what life is
...
