When they finally come to destroy the earth
They'll have to go through you first
I bet they won't be expecting that
When they finally come to destroy the earth
They'll have to deal with you first
And now my money says they won't know about the
Thousand fahrenheit hot metal lights behind your eyes

Invincible (oh-oh-oh)
You're Invincible
Oh-oh
Invincible (oh-oh-oh)
You're Invincible
That crushing, crashing, atom-smashing, white-hot thing it's...
Invincible
...
