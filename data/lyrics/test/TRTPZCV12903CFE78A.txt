So I say goodbye to a town that has ears and eyes
I can hear you whispering as I walk by
Familiar faces smiling back at me and I knew
This would make them change

The only thing that's going to bother me
Is that you'll all call yourselves my friends

Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?

The writings on the wall, you've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name
Just know that I'll come running, for one more night to spare with you
...
