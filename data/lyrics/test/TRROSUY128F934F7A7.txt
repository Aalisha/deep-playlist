"I'm not in your town to stay,"
said a lady old and gray
to the warden of the penitentiary
"I'm not in your town to stay
And I'll soon be on my way
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail
Oh warden,
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail"

"I tried to raise my baby right
I have prayed both day and night
That he wouldn't follow the footsteps of his dad
I have searched both far and wide
And I feared that he had died
But at last I've found my baby here in jail
Oh warden,
At last I've found my baby here in jail"
