My face turned pale before the cold eyes of death
My body was frozen by the stare from the dark
I don't want to think of anything, but there's storm of thoughts in my head
I wasn't prepared for this, 'cause I'm not ready to die
Nothing could have prepared me for this
"Only way out is through window of dreams" (backwards)

Nothing but blood so red and deceased
Nothing but pain, I fall on my knees
Tormenting demons, I suffer and bleed
Only way out is through window of dreams

The rain whips the lonely and crushed soul
The dark clouds are closing fast, the wind is blowing the colours of life away
The growing shadow will darken my dreams, and with the fire inside me it feeds
I'll be screaming in the stars when it's over
Storms are raging on the path to home, once so silent and calm
