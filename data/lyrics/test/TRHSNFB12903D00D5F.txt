There is a storm that's been
following me throughout my life
It holds my tears -
keeps me from crying
And there's a light piercing through
the dark clouds as I walk on by
Keeping my distance -
stay in the shadows

My inner voices
calls me a fiend of sex and drink
I just don't care, don't want to go anywhere
I'm content

Right here at home I travel places
Where no man has gone before
I love the world within myself
Let me go on a journey inside

Sometimes I feel a strange longing within
that breaks me down
something is calling me out
But there is the light
piercing through
the dark clouds as I try to hide
sun is the devil...

My inner voices calls me a coward
what a laugh
They feel no pain,
they want to go everywhere,
take control
