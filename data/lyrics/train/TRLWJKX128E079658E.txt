Scattered seeds and breaking storms
Won't make a decent lie for you
Naked and with every breath you climb the stairs
Step by step and I don't need this
I don't need to be saved
Five steps away from this cliff top
And birds sing their praises
To this weary world that haunts my weary soul

There are monsters here
And as you scream it makes no sense,
It makes no sense,
It makes no sense at all (x2)

In every despair I'll find you standing there,
