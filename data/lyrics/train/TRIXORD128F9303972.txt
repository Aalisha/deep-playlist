When the morning comes and the day begins
I will go out in perfect peace
And as the sun goes down and darkness comes around
Unafraid I'll go to sleep

Over the fathers and the mothers
And the daughters and the sons we pray

Lord bless us and keep us
Make Your face to shine upon us
Raise Your countenance on us
And give us peace, oh God

Just bless us and keep us
Make Your face to shine upon us
