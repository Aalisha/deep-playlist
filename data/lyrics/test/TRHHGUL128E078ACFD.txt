Your slouch in smoky corners of this town
… Follow you around
You drop jokes like they're dragging you down

You cling onto a vintage way of life
Don't accept that it should be left behind
Pitiful puns like a constant rewind

…
Just pointing out what isn't there

Ah one step forward, two steps back
Punch lines like a heart attack
Your tolerance will never crack
So its one step forward, two steps back
...
