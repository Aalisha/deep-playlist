[Incomprehensible]

Pull these scars off my eyes
Lost from the world
A child searching for her dad

You left me there alone
With him to rape my world
And I lived through the years, a girl
Pleading why

In my dreams last night I saw your face
You held me and washed away my tears
Then I woke to realize you're gone
I'm drowning in solitude again
