Searching everywhere
But always in the wrong places
For something
Anything to make me whole
These open wounds don't seem to heal

Something is missing
Probably just the love for myself
I'm trying to compensate it with yours
So i'm just fucking you over
There's no way to win this heart of mine

Cold heart forged in hell
...
