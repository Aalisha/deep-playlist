It's called love
And every cruelty will cloud it
And his lie, his lie
True love could never allow it
'Cos it's a lie that we have ceased to believe
We've said goodbye but it won't take its leave

Why should it take the tears of a woman
To see how men are

P. E. R. S. P. E. C. T. I. V. E.
It's no mystery
What you don't know always gets you
It will hurt you and desert you
...
