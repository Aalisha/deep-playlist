Sittin' all alone
It's a quarter to three
& I can't sleep tonight, sleep tonight
Oh no baby
On & on faint lovin' memories
& I'm just breakin' down, breakin' down
Cuz you're not around

Seems like only yesterday
Since my baby went away
We could've lasted a lifetime
So tell me who's to blame

Did you really have to lie to me
Did I really make you unhappy
So unbelievable baby
How could you walk away from me
Did you see the tears that I cried
Did you really mean to say goodbye
I have a pain that burns so deep
...
