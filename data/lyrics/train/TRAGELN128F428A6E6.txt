She lives in a house
That's way back off the road
There's a man with a lantern
And he carries her soul
A coal stove and a bed
A skillet and a hound
She drove a camel through
A needle
In this sinking board walk town
She's my Black Market Baby
She's my Black Market Baby
She's a diamond that 
Wants to stay coal
Wants to stay coal
I swang out wide with her
On hells iron gate
Anything that you wanted
...
