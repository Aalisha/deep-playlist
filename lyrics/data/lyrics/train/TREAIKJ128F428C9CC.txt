Gone - she's gone
How do you feel about it?
That's what I thought
You're real torn up about it
And I wish you the best
Though I could do without it
And I will because you've worn me down
Oh, I will because you've worn me down

Worn me down like a road
I did anything you told
Worn me down to my knees
I did anything to please.
But you can't stop thinking about her
No, you can't stop thinking about her
