I want someone to love me
For who I am
I want someone to need me
Is that so bad?

I want to break all the madness
But it's all I have

I want someone to love me
For who I am
Nothing makes sense
Nothing makes sense anymore

Nothing is right
Nothing is right when you're gone
Losing my breath
Losing my right to be born

I'm frightened to death
...
