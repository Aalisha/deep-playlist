The wrong time, the wrong place
Our smiling face of distrust
Buried the seed deep in all our heads
Prepared ourselves for the fall

The greed killing

Instinct to mistrust
Instinct, the lust
Their butchery of feelings
Geared for a greed killing

Greed killing

Not now, then when?
Not now, then when?
