You've never been in a fight but you will be tonight
If you're hip to the groove you will see
You know the end is nigh, you've got to hang 'em high
Get a mallet and take to the street
There's civil unrest, development's arrest
Now the law's no use, there's chaos loose, let's stretch it to the test
Lights out in the city, my shiv has no pity for you

Tear - Tear the government down
