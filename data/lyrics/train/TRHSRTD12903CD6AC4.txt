Eyes permeate my skin, an alcoholic din,
Fills the room we're in.
Girl, I think it's time we leave,
Like a thief on Christmas Eve,
Take and you shall receive.

No need to ask, you already know the way I feel inside.

Once we're out amongst the shadows,
See how much our love glows,
Reflected in shop windows,
I love you as my blood flows,
As the rain ruins my best clothes,
You're a secret only I know.
