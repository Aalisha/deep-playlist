Boys, boys, boys
Boys, boys, boys
Boys, boys, boys
Boys, boys, boys

Sunshine's down so come to town
Set your body free
Hold me tight - love me tonight
Tell me you believe

Everybody summertime love
You'll remember me
Everybody summertime love
Be my lover - be my baby

Boys, boys, boys
I'm looking for a good time
Boys, boys, boys
Get ready for my love

Boys, boys, boys
I'm looking for a good time
Boys, boys, boys
I'm ready for your love

Stay around, the sun goes down
Babe I'm feeling right
Take a chance with love romance
Have some fun tonight
