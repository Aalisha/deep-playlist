Don't save the world it's too late
They said we will go through the time
Running up to the sky higher to changing the way
Reaching the power to liber, liberty

Are you crawling here below?
Violence and bloodshed in the cold
Going down to the ground
And close to the edge
Just calling (calling)
Calling me away

Nothing spill out in my pride.
The prophecy will never dies
Screaming warning after warning
Cries and burns in the air
Just calling (calling)
Calling me again, yeah
