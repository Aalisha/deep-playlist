Hey doll, I've been doing some thinking.
I lost all, of my senses and feelings.
I'm sorry, if I led you on last night,
But tonight...

I realize, I was just caught in the moment
When your eyes, met mine-
My world came crashing down.

You and I, we do the worst things;
Do or die, we both break hearts.
You and I, we both found a girl, someone you love,
So I better let her go.

(Oh! x8)

We used, to play with girls' emotions.
But she got, she got the best of us both and a
Trainwreck, accidental collision;
We're burning up.
