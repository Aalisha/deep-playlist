Well I love the way she dances around
In her underwear
She probably woke the neighbors up by now
Ah but she don't care

Oh what a pretty face
Spillin' her wine all over the place
Shaking everything she's got around
Her towel comin' off and her hair comin' down

She's got that look in her eye
She's drivin' me crazy, drivin' me crazy
And I can't believe she's
Beautifully, playfully, hopelessly, faithfully mine
...
