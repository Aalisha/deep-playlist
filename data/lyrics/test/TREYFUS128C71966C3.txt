You keep running away
Though I beg you not to leave
But still you won't stay
Darlin' you keep running away
Tear my heart apart every step of the way

You're here today and gone tomorrow
Leavin' this heart of mine in sorrow
Now you come around every now and then
Long enough to hurt me, and then you're gone again

Darlin' you, you keep running away
Oh, I begged you not to leave, you never stay
Now you, you keep running away
...
