On the streets where you live
girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint,
a touch of sable in their eyes

(All your life) all your life all you've asked
is when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you were living in another world
tryin' to get your message through.
No one heard a single word you said.
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head.
Ooh, she's a little runaway.

Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things he couldn't say.
Ooh, she's a little runaway.
Take a line every night
