Crush me softly
Or cradle me hard
And the more I wanted
Was the scariest part
A measure of control
Well not this time
And I wanted to learn so
I claim the lesson as mine

The politics of lasting just a little bit longer
Is the art of living every day
That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger
Until it finally kills you all the way
