I hear them breathing
They know what I have done, all that I've been through
I tell them secrets
And who's to say it isn't so?

Move, don't move
stay a little while on my linoleum
Breathe, don't breathe
Walk a thousand miles on my linoleum

This is frustrating
I'm sensing some of my hostilities
Distress and conflict
I've really just about lost all control
