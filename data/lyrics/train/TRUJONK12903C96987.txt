I know I may be young
But
I've got feelings too
And I need to do
What I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into in this world

Always saying little girl don't step into the club

Well I'm just tryin' to find out why
'Cause dancing's what I love
(now watch me)
Get it get it get it get it whoa
Get it get it (do you like it?) get it get it whoa
Get it get it get it get it whoa
(panting) This feels good
I know I may come off quiet
May come off shy
But I feel like talking feel like dancing when I see this guy
What's practical is logical
What the hell who cares
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there
I'm a slave 4 U
I cannot hold it
I cannot control it
I'm a slave 4 U
I won't deny it
I'm not trying to hide it
