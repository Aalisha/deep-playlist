Were you a witness?
Were you a witness?
And on that holy day
And on that bloody day
Were you a witness?
Were you a witness?

And on that holy day
And on that bloody day
And on his dying bed he told me
"Tell all my friends I was fighting, too,
But to all the cowards and voyeurs:

There are no more tickets to the funeral
There are no more tickets to the funeral.

Were you a witness?
Were you a witness?
And on that holy day
And on that bloody day

There are no more tickets to the funeral
There are no more tickets to the funeral
The funeral crowded!

Were you a witness?
Were you a witness?

Were you there when they crucified my Lord
Were vou there when they nailed him to the cross
Sometimes it causes me to tremble, tremble, ttremble
Were you there when they crucified my Lord

"Were you a witness? Were you a witness?

"Were you there when they dragged him to the grave"
Were you there when they dragged him to the grave
Sometimes it causes me to wonder, wonder, wonder"
