Head flexed lung cold and hard as stone
Clothed in the anger suit don't need you all alone
Diving in and drinking freely
Bitter taste remembered easily
What thirst is satisfied
I feel myself slowly die

I search for the pain you'd have me feel
Lay myself open, what else would you steal
Tender look and tear after tear
Tear after tear after tear after tear

I see the lies that lie
Lie in your eyes
Lies so sincere
So so sincere
