Once upon a time
Is how it always goes
But I'll make it brief
What was started out
With such excitement
Now I gladly end with relief
In what now has become a familiar motif

That nothing is good enough
For people like you
Who have to have someone take the fall
And something to sabotage
Determined to lose it all

Critics at their worst
Could never criticize
The way that you do
