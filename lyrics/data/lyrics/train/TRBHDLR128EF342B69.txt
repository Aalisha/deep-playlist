Your class, your caste, your country, sect, your name or your tribe
There's people always dying trying to keep them alive
There are bodies decomposing in containers tonight
In an abandoned building where

The squatters made a mural of a Mexican girl
With 15 cans of spray paint in a chemical swirl
She's standing in the ashes at the end of the world
Four winds blowing through her hair

But when great Satan's gone,
The Whore of Babylon
She just can't sustain
The pressure where it's placed
She caves
