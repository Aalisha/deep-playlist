Well you and I
Travel to the beat of a different drum
Can't you tell by the way I run
Every time you make eyes at me

Yes, you cry and moan
And say it'll work out
But honey child I've got my doubts
You can't see the forest for the trees

Now don't get me wrong
It's not that I knock it
It's just that I am not in the market
For a girl
Who wants to love only me
And I'm not saying that you ain't pretty
