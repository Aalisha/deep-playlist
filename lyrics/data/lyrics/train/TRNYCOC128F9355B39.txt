Up for too long
At war with the sun
A crown of stars that we all wish upon
And you whisper tome
Are we out of time?

And if it's so
Then don't let go
And show me where
Your tear drops run
All ragged bloom we're all let loose on
Hands disappear
Pull you close
Shoot out the lights for all your pleasures

Young hearts
Know nothing but say it all
Celebrate no control
But is it enough to realise your love
...
