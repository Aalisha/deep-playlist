I hear the drums echoing tonight
she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comming in twelve-thirty flight
her moonlit wing reflect the stars that guide me towards
salvation

I stopped an old man along the way
hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
he turned to me as if to say: "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for
you!"

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred man or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
