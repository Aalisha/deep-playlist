So this is it
The feeling that ive missed
A subtle kind of pain
That keeps me from sleep
Try to explain
How your touch drives me insane
And i can't spend a night
Without wishing i was with you

Wanna tell you a secret
And leave it on your lips
Wanna sing it through your body
Wanna tell it through this kiss
If i told you my secret
Would you swear to keep it
Would you swear to keep it
