Touching You, Touching you, Touching you
Open Your Door

Touching You Everywhere
Where I've NeverSaid Before
And I Can'T Believe That
I Believe I've Finally Opened Your Door

Whispered Words To silent Ears
They've All Been Said Before
Or Will You Run And Hide So Safe Inside
open The Door

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Then Again
Nothing Kills Me, Nothing Heals Me
