On a good night I could hop in my truck
Round up my friends and with any kind of luck
We could end up howling at a harvest moon.

On a good night I could put on my hat
Head down to the honky tonk and dance
But on a real good night I meet a women like you.

Chorus:
Brown hair blue eyes once in a life time
Countrified kind of girl
Heart-breaking chance-taking wild little love making
Shaking up my world
Hey, on a good night I can picture the day
All my dreams come true
But on a real good night I meet a women like you.
