In every man and woman
There is a little boy and a girl
Who've learned them from all the things
They've heard while growing up in this world

Some are raised on love and praise
The others guild and fear
The seeds of love breed confidence
The other only tears

Hear me calling you
Hear me calling you
Hear me calling out to you, yeah

Mother, father, sister, brother
Careful how you treat each other
Children just repeat what they've been shown
Remember we will reap what we have sown
Love begins at home

In every new born baby
There's a special little spark
But if it isn't nurtured
They're left crying in the dark

So they grow to be afraid
And feel they can't go on
...
