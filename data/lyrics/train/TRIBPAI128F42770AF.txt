In days of old, when ships were bold
Just like the men who sailed them
And if they showed us dis-respect
We'd tie them up and flail them

Often men of low degree
And often men of steel
They make you walk the plank alone
Or haul you 'round the keel

Hoist the Jolly Roger!
Hoist the Jolly Roger!
Hoist the Jolly Roger!
It's your money that we want
...
