Nobody else could make me happy
No one could hurt me like you do
You were the only one That mattered

Then you were gone... Love had moved on
Left me alone thinking of...

You... There was never any other
You... and I were created to be true

Isn't it Love that keeps us breathing
Isn't it love we're sent here for
...
