How sad is that
The miles are flying past and youre so sure of what Im showing that
Youre blowing hot
And then youre turning cold and I dont know know
Whether to come or go
What Game Is This that youre playing
I never know what youre saying
Put me through all the doubt
Hoping we can work it out
What Game Is This that Im learning
I never knew such a burning
When you go from my house
Creeping quiet as a mouse
What Game Is This
What Game Is This
