Man, be careful with a fool. you know, someday he may get smart
Man, be careful with a fool. you know, someday he may get smart
He will treat you so cool and chilly, till he hurt you to your heart

Yeah, you know

Hate to remember, oh, what a fool I used to be, ha, ha!
Man, I hate to remember how foolish I used to be
The way I used to love you, baby, how bad it's gonna be
