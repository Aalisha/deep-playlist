I admit I miss seeing your face, babe
And being alone is starting to take its toll
I'm cold and it's getting old

I admit I should've made some changes
We were so smothered in love
We didn't have a chance to come up for air

What a waste, where did the time go?
Where did our minds go? I don't know
What's this place? Where did our home go?
We won't know, I don't know

Too much of anything is too much
And too much of love can be too much
We had too much time, too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised

Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much
M-m-much, too much
