I've waited for you and I've always been true
But this waiting no longer I can stand
I know you've had time, dear to make up your mind
I've waited as long as I can

I'm waiting to hear you say you love me
And long for the day you take my hand
I asked again last night, for your love so divine
I've waited as long as I can

Done all I can do, said all I can say
...
