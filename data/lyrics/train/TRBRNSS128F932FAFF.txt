The police in New York City
They chased a boy right through the park
In a case of mistaken identity
They put a bullet through his heart

Heartbreakers with your forty-four
I wanna tear your world apart

I wanna tear your world a part

A ten year old girl on a street corner
Sticking needles in her arm
She died in the dirt of an alleyway
Her mother said, "She had no chance, no chance"

Heartbreaker, a heartbreaker
She stuck the pins right in her heart
Heartbreaker, a pain maker
