You wanna take control of me i won't let you do it
you say you know whats best for me i'm gonna make you prove it
Your always complaining at me
get off my back
why won't you just let me be
get off my back
Tell me this and tell me that ii've heard it all before
you still bitch my back is turned i'm wlking out the door
Your always complaining at me
get off my back
why won't you just let me be
