I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go, go, go

I got a man with two left feet
And when he dances down to the beat
I really think that he should know
That his rhythms go, go, go

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Does he wash up? Never wash up
Does he clean up? No, he never cleans up
Does he brush up? Never brushed up
He does nothing, the boy does nothing

Hey boy, how you been?
I got a thousand lines, where do I begin?
And I, I been here, been there traveling
I saw you at the corner, my vibe kicked in

And two fields, I clock you
Wearing tight jeans and real nice suit
He was smiling like you was just seventeen
I asked him for a dance, he said yes please
