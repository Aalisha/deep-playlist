Moving up, East Oakland, yeah, that's right
Moving up, East Oakland, yeah, that's right
Moving up, East Oakland, yeah, that's right
Moving up, East Oakland, yeah, that's right

Oakland, California, West Coast life
You either play the game or you smoke the pipe
I became a rapper at the age fourteen
No gold ropes, no diamond rings

But look at me now, ten years later
Ask any MC if I rap greater
See I'm known in Fresno, even the big O
From San Diego to Sacramento

They'll tell you yes, wherever you go
And I bet my life won't one say no
Ain't nothing like a Too $hort fan
I ain't tripping, you can play it again

Don't fight the feeling, life is me
I rock shows in Nashville, Tennessee
It wasn't "Hee Haw," so don't laugh
At the good ol' boys getting autographs

In Cincinnati, I know you heard
I got fined for the cuss words
It's true, baby, so so unique
Might slap your man or just thump your freak

I come to your town, I'm not under
I want your name and your telephone number
You think I'm faking, but I'll call
We only got one night to do it all

I know baby it's such a pity
Tomorrow night, we hit another city
Cold macking in the game is all we do
Me and the boys called "The Dangerous Crew"

I used to be local till I signed with Jive
Too $hort then went nationwide
I went to Georgia with the Too $hort sound
I went down like Bobby Brown

I said a rap and they took me to jail
Pulled out my bank and made bail
