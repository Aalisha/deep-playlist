Being irrefutable
A notion that the role of a conquering despot cannot be obscured by a
morbid fascination with war
Confessions gained under the pillory
And the sequence of events leading up to the end of everything
collectively abandon what was seen and believed
Cultivate deliberate illusions
Keep them all in line
The slate of history is wiped clean of its blemishes
Scars so deep they must be burned to remove
With no more past, there's no mistakes to repeat
Only the purity of fresh disaster
...
