(singing) players

(T3)
It's the seven eighty-eight
DDT a, just like Jake The Snake
Actually, we don't participate
But if you do then I'ma see you at your Wake, (players)
Don't let the drama fluctuate, I don't wanna, I gotta, because it's snakes
Now where would we be at, if we let you do that
We'd probrably, be laying on our backs, (players)
Talkin this and that you on my, your plan yeah, it was wack
I never would play myself out like that
But, um, I guess that's where you at, (players)

(Jay Dee)
(then I'ma play a game for ya)
What I'ma do is like uh
Cut out ya whole crew, cause ya crew likes to bite us
