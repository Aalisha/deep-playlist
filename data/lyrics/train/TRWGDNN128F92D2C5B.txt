I ride the fastest horse and ships
I sip the sweetest warmest lips
I deck myself with the prettiest clothes
But my true love is frozen cold

Those soldiers bold have tried of me
Sailormen that sailed the sea
Pioneers have broke my soils,
But my true love is frozen cold

If you would open and raise my soul
If you would pass my gates and doors
If you'd unlock my frozen loves,
Just drink my sweet and my bitter bowl

Summer's lovers I have tried,
...
