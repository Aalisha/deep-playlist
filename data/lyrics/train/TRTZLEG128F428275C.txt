Why can't we just skip to the good part
Why do we play these silly games
To get to the heart of the matter that's in our hearts
We go round and round again and again

By the time you come around
I'll be tired of being kept down

I don't trust you but I love you
I don't trust you but I love you
And I'm in the game anyway
