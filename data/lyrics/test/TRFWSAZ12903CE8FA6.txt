Can't hide the darkness within
Darkness and the light entwined
No chance for mercy and salvation
Endless struggle for dominance

Oil and water
Fuel for the slaughter
Breeds remorse and breeds regret
The false prophets scream their disease

Burn the bridges to feed the wolves
Cannot find solace in this state
Duel nature of the possession
Reaching for heaven finding hell
...
