And then I make wish
I make it on eagle's wings
And when I say a prayer
I pray for peace, pray for peace

Nothing happens if you don't try
When nothing happens, that's the reason why

Hey, when I woke up today
I thought I could change the world
Hey, when I woke up today (up today)

And when I look into the faces of children
I see perfect love
