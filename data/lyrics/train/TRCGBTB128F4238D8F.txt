I am the thing that makes you sick
I am the blame that gets placed quick
Detect the crack within your lie
I'll be the wrath of your disdain
I'll be the fear in you engrained
Become the facts that you deny

I can feel this pain is real
I hate deep down inside
And like broken glass you'll shatter
With bloody fists I'll batter
...
