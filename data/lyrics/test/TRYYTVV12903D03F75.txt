Turning tricks on Sunset
Twenty bucks a pop
Some out of town ol' businessman or an undercover cop
I'm living with the virus flowing way down in my veins
Oh oh, I wish it would rain

I know you've heard my story
Or seen me on the street
Just another cracker gigolo
Dressed up like trick or treat

Now you may want to judge me
Or treat me with disdain
