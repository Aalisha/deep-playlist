If there's anythin' that you need,
Hon, that you've never, ever, ever had.
I know you've never had it.
Oh, honey, don't you just sit there cryin',
Don't just sit there feelin' bad.
No, no, no.

You'd better get up,
Now do you understand,
And raise you hand!
I said raise your hand, hey.

You know I'm standin' about, yes I am.
Want to give you all my love.
Oh, honey, won't you come on and open up,
I said, open up your heart.
Please, let me try.

You'd better to be good.
Don't ya understandÂ ?
Raise your hand.
I said, raise your hand,
Right here, right now, c'mon!
Whoaaaaah, oh yeah!

If there's anything you need,
Honey, that you ever, ever, ever try,
I want you to give it up
