Oooh la la ooh la la la
ooh la la ooh la la la
ooh la la ooh la la la

My baby
she gives me lovin' like a good girl shou'd
she always treats me like a sweet thing wou'd
she's got groovy lips that's what she has
my honey she's always happy being by my side
I'm contemplating having her my bride
she's got great big tits that's what she has
yes when it comes down to lovin' anything goes
and ev'ryone knows it I swear now
for she has a thing about shedding her clothes
it makes her sing out in a strange style she sing:

Ooh la la I really love ya baby
ooh la la say you'll be mine
I love ya I really love ya honey
