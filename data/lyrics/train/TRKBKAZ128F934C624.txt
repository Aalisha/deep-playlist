Kill
Craving your skin, removing traces of flesh
Ripping through your guts, the knife comes back again
Shattered faces longing for the end
Don't waste your last breath
The torturing begins.

Hell awaits you, the darkness greets you
The dimmest light you ever've seen, they're opening their gates
...
