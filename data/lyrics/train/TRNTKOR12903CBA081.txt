I'm tired,
I'm waiting,
The neons pulsating.
Can anybody hear me,
? cause this life is draining?

It's living
And breathing.
Cold concrete,

Built on both sweat and bone
This place is defeating.

They? ve cars that cost over 5 thousands pounds.
So many faces in the ground
Tall towers break the sky.
The concrete roads between your towns.
