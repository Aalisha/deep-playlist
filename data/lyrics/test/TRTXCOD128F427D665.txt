So what you see
Is only half the story
There's another side of me
I'm the girl you know
But I'm someone else too
If you only knew

It's a crazy life
But I'm alright
I got everything I've always wanted
Living the dream

So yeah, everything I've always wanted
Isn't always what it seems
I'm a lucky girl
Whose dreams came true

But underneath it all
I'm just like you
(yeah, yeah)
Don't wanna be treated differently
I wanna keep it all inside
...
