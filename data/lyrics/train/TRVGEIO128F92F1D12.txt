Turn it up
New S-V

Chorus: (All)
Raise it up (*6X*)
Raise it up (*8X*)

(Jay-Dee)
I ain't about shit
Nope, what me dog
I don't floss nope
I ain't that nigga Jay dee uh uh
You ain't never seen me balling out at the bar right?
I don't rock my ice and bounce foreign cars
And my Rover ain't the hottest Rover you ever seen
That ain't a TV screen
It ain't sitting on eighteens dog
I aint gaining no green and my chain don't swing uh
I ain't doin my thing
I ain't doin a thing
I ain't got none of that dough with none of them cars
I ain't fucked none of them hoes in none of them bars
I don't smoke weed
I ain't use to mess with this three's
I ain't from the D
No I wasn't blessed with the beats
I don't be at the spot swinging my chain like this
Swinging my thing til these motherfuckers bang my shit
I don't sip 'Mo
I ain't never popped Cris'
This Rollie just don't look right sitting on my wrist huh?
Uh Uh wasn't me
Dip the Sean John
Sip the cham' Don
Shit you want some
I don't hold heat
