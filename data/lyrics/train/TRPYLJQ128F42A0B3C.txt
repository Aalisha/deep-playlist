Just a minute of your time
Yes, I've been known to delude myself
So let me put those rose
Coloured glasses to the test

Now is this real enough for you
'Cause blondes here don't jump out of cakes
If that never impressed you much
Come board this lunatic express

Just why do they say
"Have a nice day" anyway?
We both know they wouldn't mind
If I just curled up and died
Oh let's not give that one a try

Chin up, put on a pair of these roseys, raise those blinds
Chin up, a happy mask was never your best disguise
Chin up, put on a pair of these roseys, in no time
You will feel almost fine, almost rosey

Now some girls here will huddle with
No not footballers that are rich
But will confide in small white sticks
He bats as the Virginian Slim
