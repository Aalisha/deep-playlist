Interrupt me at any time but it's too late to apologize.
It took years to build this but only seconds to destroy.
My mind was in it.
My heart was in it.
Then you went and did this.
But you said you didn't.
I can't help but feel it was all my fault.
But we both know that's not true.
If you can't take me at my worst then you don't deserve my best.
They say some things are better left undone.
I'd have to agree.
So turn and run like you've never seen my face before.
You'll never see it again.
They say some things are better left undone.
I'd have to agree.
