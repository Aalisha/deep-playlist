(Female voice sings throughout song)
I love it (Ha, I know ya do)
I love it (I know ya do)
I love it

(Psycho Les)
You need to save all your bullshit threats and drama
For the news guy
Niggas need to act their age
And not their shoe size

(JuJu)
Spittin' it raw
Spittin' til you slip on the floor
I make you girl not want you no more
You want war?

(Psycho Les)
Step to your label make 'em dish out all the cash in the place before
I hafta punch somebody's ass in the face

(JuJu)
Yo, yo, the ugliest thug never runnin' out of money in clubs
Got the crib with the African rugs

(Psycho Les)
Baggin' hoes by the carload
They call me Mr. Charmo
Break into their crib and disconnect the Star Alarm-o

(JuJu)
Yo, big fish eat little fish, you little bitch
You ticklish, I push niggas up like licorice

(Psycho Les)
You wanna be a big baller, but you travelin'
Talk about battlin', nigga stop babblin'

(JuJu)
Yo, when the first body touches the ground
Alot of blood gushes around, my silencer crushes the sound
Jigged out patch your glazy suits, pimpin' hoes in daisy dukes
...
