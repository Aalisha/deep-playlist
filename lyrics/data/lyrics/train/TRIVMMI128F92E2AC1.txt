Cherry oh, Cherry oh, baby.
Don't you know I'm in love with you
If you don't believe it's true
What else is there for me to do?
So long I've been waiting
For you to come right in.
And now that we are together
Please make come my joys come over.

Oh oh ee oh oh ee oh
Oh oh ee oh ee oh ee oh.
Yeah... yeah...
Yeah... yeah...
Cherry, oh, Cherry, oh, baby
...
