(Alexander Jr)
You ask me to give up the hand of the girl I love
You tell me I'm not the man she's worthy of
But who are you to tell her who to love
That's up to her, yes and the Lord above
You better move on

Well I know you can buy her fancy clothes and a diamond rings
I believe she'd be happy with me without those things
Still you beg me to set her free
