I am dreaming, I'm believing
You can save my soul
I can still see you here with me
Nothing matters more

Dreaming I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming of you
The good times, the bad times
The bright and the blue
We had it all
But we lost it somehow
I want to come back now

Dreaming I'm dreaming
Forever of you
Lost here without you
Don't know what to do
My heart is broken
My head 'gainst the wall
There's no one to catch my fall

We are flying, I'm denying
Can't believe you're gone
I can't grasp it, memories flashes
What did I do wrong
