One time for my warriors, my last smugglers and all my buffalo soldiers
One time for my warriors, my heat carriers and all my buffalo, yo
One time for my warriors, my last smugglers and all my buffalo soldiers
One time for my warriors, my heat carriers and all my buffalo, hey

Say fool you must be crazy
What is it you tryin to do u cannot faze me
I've been smokin on a pound and feelin hazy
For five-o i wont stop they gotta chase me
Now make it mo' better for the cream
My music brings the cheddar, see what i mean
The seats in the ride is leather, the rims are clean
I change like the weather, now i'm the king, yeah yeah

One time for my warriors, my last smugglers and all my buffalo soldiers
One time for my warriors, my heat carriers and all my buffalo, yo
One time for my warriors, my last smugglers and all my buffalo soldiers
One time for my warriors, my heat carriers and all my buffalo, hey

Now if you wanna find me, i'll be in Jamaica smoked out
In a black navigator, evading all the playa haters - high
Here comes the rover with the troops
Decked out in army fatigues,
and stompin 'um with my black tin boots, say what
Now while you remixing punch lines, i create
How you wanna battle me, hah
