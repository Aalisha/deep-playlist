So many nites
I felt your beating heart
As we were deep in the dark
I'd watch you sleepin' tight
Protect you from the light
As if you were a child
& put a kiss on your lips

Don't you go breakin' my heart
Stay for awhile
I'll make it alright (make it alright)
'cause if you go breakin' my heart (go breakin')
I won't survive (can't survive)
So stay for tonite
...
