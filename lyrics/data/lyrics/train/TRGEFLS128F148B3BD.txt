So you think that it's over, say your love has finally reached the end

Any time you call, night or day, I'll be right there for you
If you need a friend
It's gonna take a little time, I know, time is sure to mend your broken heart
But don't you even worry, pretty darlin, 'cos I know you'll find love again
Love is all around you, love is knockin' outside your door
Waitin' for you is this love made just for two
Keep an open heart and you'll find love again, I know
Love is all around you, yeah yeah, love is knockin' outside your door
Waitin' for you is this love made just for two
