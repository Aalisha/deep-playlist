While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But if I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy

If I invite a boy some night
To dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes my heart belongs to daddy
Yes I simply couldn't be bad
...
