Contamination - spreads throughout the world
Contagious evil - now that chaos takes its hold

Sadistic torture - warps your earthly form
Your blood now curdles - now to be reborn

You scream in pain - yet no one hears a sound
Plead for redemption - by chaos you are bound
By chaos you are bound

Pale, rotting flesh
