Guess what
I'm back
Aye, Santana, dip-set bitch
You know, you know

We say G'd up, we make these bucks
We make things jump, no thanks to you
We blaze weed up, we invade these clubs
We make things jump, no thanks to you
(You)

From the beat to the boogie, to the street to the hoodie
This is gangsta shit, gangsta shit
Baby to get down to the beat and just boogie to the beat
Shake ya tushy if you like gangsta shit

Gangsta niggas, gangsta bitches
 (Come, come)
Get on up, get gangsta with us
Or should I say, get gangsta with me
I gangsta boogie through this gangsta city
(Watch me)

Get dough, hit hoes, quick froze, big 4
Get low 'fore I bang at you
(Watch me)
Pitch flow, big blow, big bank
Big rolls you know, no thanks to you
(You)

And shorty you can catch me stunt
(Stunt)
Off the weed yup, screamin', "Hi, my name is"
 (Yup)
These nuts, G's up, hoe's down
 (Nuts)
