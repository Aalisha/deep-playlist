My sweet girl with you eyes so bright
Don't leave me in the dark tonight
The sun's turned down, the moon is low
And I know secrets you don't know

Do you hear the wind whispering
"You're the one I love"
The summer breeze tells the trees
I'm the one, because
You're my sweet girl

Hold me now in this sweet life
I will take you for my wife
