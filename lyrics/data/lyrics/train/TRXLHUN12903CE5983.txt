There's no use in crying
All my tears won't drown my pain
Streaming from your sorrow
I can't grieve you again

I watched you let yourself die
And now it's too late to save you this time

You bury me alive
And everybody's gotta breath somehow
Don't leave me die
Too consumed by your own emptiness and lies

All I did was love you
Now I hate the nightmare you've become
I can't let you fool me
...
