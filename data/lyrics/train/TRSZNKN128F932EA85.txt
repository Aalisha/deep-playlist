You better stop playin' games
I told you once before
It'll hurt you more this time
If you walk out that door
You'd better think it over
(Baby)
Remember what I told you
(Baby)
'Cause never again
(Never again, never again)
Will I love you this way
(Never again, never again)
I've learned a little more
Each time I took you back
You made a fool of me
I'll tell you where it's at
You'd better think it over
(Baby)
