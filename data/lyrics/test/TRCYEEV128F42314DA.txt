I just can't take much more of this oppression
I'm going out of my head and it's getting that impression
I'm gonna go out for a walk
I'm gonna sit down and have talk
They're asking me how
And they're asking me why
Have you ever seen grown men cry?

Police police police oppression
Police police police oppression

Really find it hard even walking round the streets
Hey I know you son I'll knock you off your feet
