So we argue about the stupid things
Decide to take a week off from the binge
But just become more sick
And more deranged
It gets round can't take anymore
And did anything really change?
Do we have to be so tired

Do you want to know the real reasons why?
We can't look each other in the eye, oh no
We will cry in the same films but
We cry for different reasons
The ending was good
That is understood
The ending is near
Now what do you hear

The slow build
The sound the machines make
