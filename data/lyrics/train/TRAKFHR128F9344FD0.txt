from the bullies have no heart
the only thing it tears apart
to live inside a battle zone
a simple man can't find a home
home is where the hate begins
it doesn't count unless it wins
corporate pigs keep getting fat
and number one is where it's at

to sit on roof on number two
stare into your tv set
the cogs of industry grind on
something something something bet
the cop collar make up tha blue
soon as they set their sites on you
without the fear in which we drown
injustice might not keep us down

Do the neighbors keep you up at night?
