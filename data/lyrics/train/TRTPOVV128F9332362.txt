Wind is cold alright back in Dallas
When neon light from the building
Lets you know you're home

You'd go way back when
If you wanted to be my friend
Do you call me
I'll understand it's true

I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling
No I don't feel like I'm falling down
Just say hello to the ground

Bah bah bah bah bah bah

Wait there, I'll be right back
Down in Times Square
