Forever and always... (always)

That time is here again
Prepare to be apart
And it drives you crazy!

Each time I go away
The distance gets longer
But it makes us stronger!

Should it all come crashing down around me
Would you be there, should I stumble or fall
And pick up the pieces?

Whoa-oh-oh!
Forget about the shit that we've been through!
