Everyday
Yah
Oh Oh, Everyday
This is the real right here
Things aint always what they seem
Check it

People look at us
And say man they got it made
They signed a record deal
And now them boys is paid
But they don't know what comes along with it
With all the fame and the fortune there's still bull
Cause even though we struggled hard
And gave up everything just to make it this far
Some people love us, and
Other people hate us
But we gonna take the haters
Make them our motivators
Cause they don't
Know what we've been through
And none of them could ever
Walk a mile in our shoes
And I got to keep it real
Every record deal aint a good record deal
But I'm a grown man so I didn't cry about it
Kept my head up, stayed strong
Until I got up out that contract
And I reminisce on what my lawyer use to say
But I wanted it so bad
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Everyday
Yah

(Chorus)
Everyday
The pressures of this game got us goin insane
If it aint one damn thing it's another thing
Everyday
The pressures of this game got us goin insane
If it aint one damn thing it's another thing

People wanna know
What's goin on with one twelve
If they leave, if they leave
...
