This one is dedicated to dem heart-broken lovers...

Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China in a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no one to hold you, What does that mean?
And you said...

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, oh no, I've got to keep on movin'

Reaching out to all dem...
To dem lovers
Who cannot find demselves, you know

You're on the road and now you pray it last
The road behind was rocky,
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're running so fast?
And you said...
