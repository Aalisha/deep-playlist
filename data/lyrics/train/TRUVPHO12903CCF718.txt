Raindrops thumping on my white-walled Chrysler
I'm keeping rhythm with the window wipers
Farmland's drinking every drop that falls
Lightning dancing to the fiddler's call
Black baby squeeze a hot dog bun
Grandpa's got wrinkles from too much sun
Harry Belafonte and the Dixie Dregs
Everybody's drinking from the same cold kegs

The cowboy slaps the dust away
For the sweet senorita with the cross next to the heart
Purple mountains majesty she says hey Gringo what about me

You don't know me but I know you
