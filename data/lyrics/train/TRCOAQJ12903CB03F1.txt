Rolled for a chance.
Taking back.
Earned my wings.
Solid ground.
Never fall.
Fueled by strength.
Scale the walls.
Fearless fire.
Focused mind.
Clear a way.
Synchronize your soul and mind.
Rising high.
Feel the life.
Grabbing on.
Vision clears.
A great escape.
Claims our senses.
Stride or fall.
Cleanse to grow.
Fight for all.
