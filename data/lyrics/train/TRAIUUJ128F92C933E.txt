I'm on the whiskey flying, and I'll run by night
I'm on the whiskey running, and I'll run by night
I'm on the winter cycle, shut my eyes to the bite
I'm on the winter cycle, shake my fist at the bite
I'm on the whiskey flying, and I'll run by night
I'm on the phone to summer, so I'll see you on the flight
My friends are at a party, playing games with the light
I hate to say I'm wrong, I just know I'm right
...
