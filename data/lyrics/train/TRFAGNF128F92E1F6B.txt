Tell me, baby, is it cool to touch?
Tell a man that you can trust
I'm just a fool in lust coming to get you on the bus

It's so ironic, exotic on the verge of erotic
I'm hitting switches on misses like I've been fixed with hydraulics
Man, up and down like a roller coaster

Can I come inside you?
I ain't stopping till the show is over
Cause I'm a ridder, in and out just like a robbery
I'll propably be a freak and let you get on top of me

Get her rocking these nights full of Alize
A living legend, you ain't heard about the players living Cali days?
Delores Tucker, you have faith in me?
Instead of trying to help a brother, want to take his G's?

Mistaken me not for Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I got to hit you with the hot tracks
Want some on lease? I'm making millions, try to top that

They want to censor me, they'd rather see me in my cell
It's living hell, only a few of us will live to tell
Haha
Now everybody talking about us, I ain't giving up
...
