I'm gonna press rewind on my walkman and have some fun
retro times are all the rage and 80ies are number one
back to the future is the slogan for everyone who wants to be hip
The Police, A-ha and Genesis, they're all coming back
and Madonna has never been off the track
you may wonder what this means for your party's tape deck but
listen to this

you wanna push the party to the limit (oh yes)
the 80ies did it
party starts right in a minute
so put some 80ies in it
push the party to the limit (oh yes)
the 80ies did it
party starts right in a minute
so put some 80ies 80ies in it

this decade's alive, the sound is so right
to push the party to its limit tonight
this decade's alive, the sound is so right
so put some 80ies 80ies in it

push it, push it, push it (put some 80ies in it)
