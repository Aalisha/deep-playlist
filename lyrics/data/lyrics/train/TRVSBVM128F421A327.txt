Pull over, here's where we'll dump it
No more of your glowing sentiments
We don't want what you've got to offer
We'll trade you in for your thinner brother

Make a bed beside quills and coal
Tuck you in with salted scrolls
What we don't know could fill up books
The overflows gone overlooked

I sure as hell don't see a haystack
Traumaed farmers or a sewing circle
Erotic TV's drown in plasmic lakes
Someone must've robbed a blood bank
