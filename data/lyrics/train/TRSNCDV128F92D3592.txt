Oh you wont find me in the arms of strangers
Laughing and drinking like a big parader
I don't posses the mind to over matters
Of the money kind
Mine just scatters
And you wont find me
Not you wont find me

Pick me up from my over coat
I've been wearing that over coat for seven years
Long, long years
If something don't pick me I'll disappear
And you won't find me
No you won't find me

And you wont find me
...
