i see faces and traces of home back in new york city
so you think i'm a tough kid is that what you heard?
well, i like to see some action, and it gets into my blood
well, they let me out of pontiac when i was just seventeen
i had to get it out of me if you know what i mean, what i mean.

they say i must be crazy, cause i don't care who i hit, who i hit.
cause i know it's me that's hitting out and i'm not full of shit.
down by my bottle, filled up high with gasoline
you can tell by the night fires where a rail has been, has been

as I cuddled the porcupine he said i had none to blame but me
held my heart, deep in hell, time to shave, shave it off, it off
no time for romantic escape and your fluffy heart is ready for rape
