You've got a face for a smile, oh you know
A shame you waste it
When you're breaking me slowly but I've
Got a world of chances, for you
I've got a world of chances, for you
I've got a world of chances
Chances that you're burning through

I've got a paper and pen
I go to write a goodbye
And that's when I know I've
Got a world of chances, for you
...
