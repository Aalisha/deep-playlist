I've been feeling lonesome
I'm down, don't know what to do
I let you lie to me
Plant seeds inside
To see them grow
Only to leave them to die

I learned my lesson
I won't be forgetting
I won't give my heart out
Without suspecting
Why cry
Why cry
Why cry
For you

I've been lost and finding out
That I've been such a fool
...
