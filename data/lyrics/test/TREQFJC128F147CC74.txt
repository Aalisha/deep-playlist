Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life
I feel within

When I'm branded this mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blame

I am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn within

Forgive me father
For I have sinned
