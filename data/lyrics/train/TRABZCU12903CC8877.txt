[Verse 1: ~Mikey~]
I'm In The Best Shape Of Life
Me Rapping With These Kids Is Like Racing A Bike
Against A Man With One Kick On Until The Lights Flick On
They Kick Us Out The Party Then Give Me My Car Keys
We Come In Peace
We Don't Mean To Cause You No Harm Cause
But I Can Go Off Like An Alarm Does
If It Comes To That, Trust I Wouldn't Do That
Cause I'm The New Cat Digging In Cans In The Alleyway
Fuck Simon You Should Do What Mikey Say
And Mikey Says About Now You Should Be Bopping Yo Head
About Damn Time To, Took Fools All God Damn Day To Figure Out The I'll Shit That We Be Into
Take Step Inside My Mental, People I Be Thinking Bout
People Can Deceive You If You Leave Em With Ya Bank Account
Wide Open, Keep ya Eyes Open, and Ya Wallet In Ya Front Pocket
Let's Smoke The Blunt Still An Option
But In My Suede Moccasins, They Mocking Em
They Rocking Imitations So They Can Duplicate The Shit That I Be Laced In
The Dali Lama Like Two Types Can Never Bond
But Like Vintage North Faces On The Faces Of Ya Favorites
[Chorus:]
Put Ya Hands Up In The Air If Ya
Hold Em Up, Hold Em Up
Like Ya Never Cared Nigga
