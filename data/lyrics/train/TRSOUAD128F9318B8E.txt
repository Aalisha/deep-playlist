That's the power of light 

Light [light] energy of light [light, light] 
Shining through the night [night, night] 
Full of energy [light] 
The light that shines on me 

Light [light] precious gift for all [light, light] 
It will keep me warm [light, light] 
Conquer all my fears [light, light] 
Color of my tears
