Baby girl, I'm a blur
I spoiled, stunted, sickened her.
God and Death are none of my concern
I'm no philosopher.
Deep in your heart, stitched the key
And only one can set me free from the beast
where I dwell and let the saints all burn in hell.

So take what you want from me, heyyyy
And take all I've got from me, heyyyy
You're with me all the time
The drugs can have my mind, love
You own the rest you'll find
And you're with me all the time

On the roof, burning black, the city smoked from the attack
But on the roof, we love the beast to death
