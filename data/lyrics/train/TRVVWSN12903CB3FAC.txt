My baby gives me the love I've looked for all my life
He's the only guy that I would take for my man
Our relationship is good yeah it's one of it's kind
But I've gotta leave my troubles behind

I'm acting supersticious when he's been away
A jealous little woman with nothing to blame
Screaming and threating that I would leave him
Well it's my troubles I should leave behind

My baby loves me when I'm down and out
