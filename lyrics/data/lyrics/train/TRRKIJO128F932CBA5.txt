Hey boy, take me off the radar
People said we never go far
Look at you so take me away from him
Turbo boost me into the stratus field
Looking fine, got you in my sight
I surrender wont put up the fire
You're my darling I adore you
I'll stand by you always stay true

(Chorus)
Space captain, would you take me on a rocket ride?
Don't say no cause i wont be denied
