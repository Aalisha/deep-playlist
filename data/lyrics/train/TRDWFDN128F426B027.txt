Came in last night about a half past ten
That woman of mine she wouldn't let me in
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move it on over (move it on over)
Move over little dog cause a big dog's movin in

She changed the lock on my front door
now my key, it don't fit no more
So get it on over (move it on over)
Scoot it on over (move it on over)
Move over skinny dog cause a fat dog's moving in

This dog house here is mighty small
But it's sure better than no house at all
...
