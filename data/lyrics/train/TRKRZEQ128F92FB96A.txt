Listen to a story 'bout a gal I know
She's my music makin' mama I'm her hillbilly beau
She's sweeter than the music when she tickles the strings
Sweeter than the flowers down in New Orleans
She's my music makin' mama from Memphis Tennessee

She'll play a little rhythm do the boogie up right
The Tennessee polka maybe blues in the night
Everybody travels from near and far
To hear her when she picks it on that old guitar
She's my music makin' mama from Memphis Tennessee

Break (guitar)
