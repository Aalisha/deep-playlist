(Jack Clement)

well everyday and every way
I know that love is a here to stay
cause I like it, mmmm I like it
I'm in a stew over what to do
but I like makin love to you
yeah I like love and I like lovin you.

They say that love will make you blind
that may be true yeah but I don't mind
cause I like it ooooh I like it
I'm kinda mixed up it's awful tough
