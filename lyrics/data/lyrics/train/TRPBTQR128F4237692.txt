You only stay with me in the morning
You only hold me when I sleep
I was meant to tread the water
But now I' ve gotten in too deep

For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away

You Give Me Something
That makes me scared, alright
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try.
Please give me something
Because someday I might know my heart.

You only waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me
I can say I' ve bought you flowers
