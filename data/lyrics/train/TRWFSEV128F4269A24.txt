Dream, dream away
Dance on the thread of reality
A web of possibilities
Caught in the light of dawn

Soothing memories
The heart is the fountain
The mind shifts shape
And leaves the body trembling
Drifting through the shadows
Dissolving into shades
Of a blackened dark existence
An unknown, untold past...

Hand in the water
The water of the wishing well
Wrinkles turn to waves
Like a butterfly and a hurricane

Weaver of dreams
...
