If this is it, then whats the point of living without any hope
we know that there is more than what we see a reason for being here
will we give in and let it suffocate us
will we breathe
we know we're worth more than they tell us
so we search to find the truth
could it be that the answer's right in front of our eyes

if all we are is a mistake
then what's the point is all of this
we won't believe the lies they are telling
we won't believe the lies
