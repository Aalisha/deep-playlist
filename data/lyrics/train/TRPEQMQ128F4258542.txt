I'm going out of my mind 
Don't know who I am 
I don't understand meat 
And I wanna take to my wings, open wide 
And fly right back to me 
And return, with a poison worm in my beak 
And I'm going out of my skin 
My patience is thin, I'm lucky my hair ain't 
And I'm, I'm losin' it fast, 
my composure won't last 
I just acn't hold it in!
