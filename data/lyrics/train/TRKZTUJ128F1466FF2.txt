Tilting at windmills on a downtown street
O the big grey landscape has lost its sheep
She wears a tight smile as she's walking the beat
Looking for a little fame
This ain't no oliver twist - no mister brownlow here
She gathers enough spare change to get
Something to eat
She takes emeralds and ecstasy on a journey that's
Miles and miles away from danger

She just wants to be happy now

CHORUS
She's living on the street
