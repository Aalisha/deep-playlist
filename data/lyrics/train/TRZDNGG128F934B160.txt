From a catacomb to a hot air balloon
Chase the dragon across the sand dunes
Have i been noticing bruises on your skin
Have you been walking into furniture again

(Chorus)
Lets take it outside
The kids are sleeping
I'll pay you to, do me some damage
Lets take it outside
The kids are sleeping
I'll pay you to, do me repairs
