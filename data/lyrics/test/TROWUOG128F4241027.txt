It's people scattered on the floor
Cool war kids are running out of time
It's such a shame to see
It's such a shame to feel this way

The sun comes streaming throught the clouds
Dust and dirt are settled all around
I hear the same old words
I see the same old warning scars

We're out of luck this time
We've fallen apart
We're out of luck this time
...
