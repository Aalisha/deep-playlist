How can I have you
And never really have you
At least not like I want to
Your heart should not be shared
Or should not be compared
To any other love that's there
That's just not fair

I... I'm down to lose you
For a chance to gain you
Even if all I gain
Is the respect that you see in me
I'm willing to set you free
Al I offer you is honesty
I mean that honestly
[Chorus:]
You know that I need you
But girl not this way
I want so much more than
What you give today
To show you I want you
...
