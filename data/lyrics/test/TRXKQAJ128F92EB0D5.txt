Layin' low, rest and pause
Sleeping long, slow motion
Gonna do, shoulda, coulda
Woulda done, excuses

What are you afraid of?
Don't you know what you're made of?
One of God's greatest creations
Take this invitation now

Get up, 'cause you can't stop
Get up, got a lot to do
24 hours, almost gone

Get up, don't sit back
Get up, if you wanna get there
Clocks don't stop and time won't wait

He said, she said
They said, what do you say?
It's your dreams, your choice
