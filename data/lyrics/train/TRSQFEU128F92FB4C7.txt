Why, I've found perfection now it slips through my grasp
Child, you touch me now as life flows through my hands
gray skies have been broken (I'll never see the warmth of your eyes)
Cold eyes softly spoken (Your face forever etched in my mind)
Love, I'll get through this if you stand at my side
Alone, this fear across me it shall never subside
gray skies have been broken (I'll never see the warmth of your eyes)
Cold eyes softly spoken (Your face forever etched in my mind)

You speak to me in rhythm and it waves across the water
You speak to me in ways that I don't understand
deep inside I hear every word every way
And after all is lost there is nothing left inside of me

I long for your touch
How I need to breathe your breath again
