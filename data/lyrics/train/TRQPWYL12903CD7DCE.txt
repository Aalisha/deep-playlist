I'm kickin' my heel together free again i feel like me again
I know without a doubt i'm in love love love
And i don't have to make believe or feed a guilty conscience
Love set me free and it do feel good

I just went through this painful thing of questions without answers
Kept comin' back with nothin' for the longest time
My heart kept racing with my conscience and claiming all my daydreames
Wait out in front of my mind
