Unconditional annihilation, no death denied
Dragged down in our perpetual downfall
Do not seek shelter in these lies
Swallow down your impotence father
Your glory cannot save me now
Unbound by manmade laws and traditions
Deceptive hope of infertility remains

For we too, will shed innocent blood

Bridges burnt and the memory
Long gone, all left behind
Thriving on the hatred that is
Buried deep within me
...
