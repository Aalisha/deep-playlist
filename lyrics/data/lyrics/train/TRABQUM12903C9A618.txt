Good morning, sunshine
Bring on your pain
Oh sweet Jesus I swear I'll ...I'll never taste it again

Not tonight...
Not tonight...

Oh no OK so let's go
I can live my life in slow mo
I think I was your boyfriend once though
(But I was fuzzy then)
Yeah, fuzzy, oh!

Twinkling starlight
Yeah it's time to write
Why - here - it's now or never
Cuz its my time to shine

Not tonight...
Not tonight...

...
