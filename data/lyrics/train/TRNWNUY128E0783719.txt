Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo

Lay back baby an' we'll do this right
There's blankets in back we can use
I'll start the car, but we'll stay in park
The cold can kill us, before fumes

Now's the right time, for a good song
Got something to say, what I can't
Do you feel bad, like I feel bad?
Pour us a road, we'll both drink and drive

Kiss me with your cherry lipstick
Never wash you off my face
Hit me, I can take your cheap shots
Leave you with the love we made

Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo, ooo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo

Come alive on the drivers side
So close, I taste your breath
Your lips go dry, but they're sweet inside
Wine must go right to your head
(Aaa)

It'd be easy, if you get mad
But three fingers point back to you
