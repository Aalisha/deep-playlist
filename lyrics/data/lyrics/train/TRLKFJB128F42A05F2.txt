I go out ‘cause I live in an empty house
And it rains and it rains and it never stops
I’m a case in this place now mixed up with you
I had a perfect fit until you called me up
Then it didn’t even rain the sun came up
Now there’s nothing I can do but fish around for you
I wanna hear you talk to me every night
If anything goes wrong you can make it right
I never get the chance just to let you know,
Let you know, GO
The lemon that you aid doesn't have a pulse
Something that i'll never get if you never tell
...
