Everybody in the funhouse
Says they want out
But we're taking our time
'Cos we're in love with time

Whole generations, thinkin' of themselves
As infidels and pop stars
While the bomb loses patience
We line up and just lean against the bar

Stone cold sober
Looking for bottles of love
Stone cold sober
Looking for bottles of love

Caught in the headlights
Wide-eyed and ready to receive
We are the dead life
Locked in dogfights, lost in disbelief
...
