We're cool, We're different,
And we hate things, Yea we hate things,
We hate people,

Take a stand and we will cut you down,
Be yourself and we'll call you a liar,
Be somebody else and we'll set you on fire,
Keep yourself to yourself and we don't care if you're dying,
Don't tell me to look at myself,
I know that I don't exist,
I am perfect I don't exist,
In this stupid human world,

We're cool, We're different,
...
