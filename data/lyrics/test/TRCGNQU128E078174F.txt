A summer's day so long ago
A thousand boats dancing on the bay
I came to you inside a dream
We both held hands and fell into the water

You never claimed to know me well
The dark eyed son, the privileged man
You found me bitter, you thought me cold
Well now I'm gonna make you understand

My mother died, my father cried
You left me lonely by the waterside
Waterside, so deep and wide
If I follow, maybe I will find her

Beyond the salt and spray
...
