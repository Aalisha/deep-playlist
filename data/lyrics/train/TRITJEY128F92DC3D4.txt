I'm a paper airplane
Got my wings stretched out
And I'm drifting in the soul lane
Wherever the wind blows is where I go

And nothing really shakes me
Cruise control and I see where it takes me
Every mile feels like the one before

I'm biding my time
Just floating through sky
It's time for another fly by

This is the chance that you've been waiting for
Go on and take it
This is the moment that you can't ignore
Yeah, yeah, yeah
