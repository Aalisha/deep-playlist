You've got to know by now
That stepping in and out won't bring you down
Until you make it definite (until you make it definite)
6: 15 sacrifice your rest

Oh, not another mind made up
For doing nothing more than all you see
They've got no more room to breathe
Until we just get them to...

Say we'll make them say
That we've been down and out all day.
If your education brings you home,

So give it up if you're not still trying to
