Your love's a heartache
That's torn me apart
You've watched my heart break
Right from start

You took everything you wanted
And now that you are gone

Here comes the rain
Falling down on me
I'm showered in pain
Nothing remains
Of what used to be

Here comes the night
Dark as my soul
There's no end in sight
No shining light
No love to hold
Here comes the rain
...
