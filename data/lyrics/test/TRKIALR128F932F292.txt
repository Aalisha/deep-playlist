You want me to be the God up in your sky
You want me to be that apple of your eye
So sweet to think you could make you mine
Well... it's not so easy

You want me to feel revival in your touch
You want me to feel everything you're dreaming of
But darling, I'm tired, I'm all used up
It's not so easy (2x)

My love, this is more than I can give
This is more than I can take
