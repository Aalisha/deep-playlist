Street hustler comes up to me one day
And I'm walkin' down the street
Mindin' my own business
Now he looks me up and he looks me down and says

"Hey man, what be this" and "What be that"
And "Why you gotta look like that?"
Well I just looked at him, I kinda laughed, I said,
"Hey man, I am cool, I am the breeze."

Haven't you heard, there's a new revolution
Gotta spread the word, too much confusion

[(All hell's breakin' loose)] Hey hey have you read the news?
[(All hell's breakin' loose)] Overloadin' 'n' blowin' my fuse
[(All hell's breakin' loose)] Day and night, baby, night and day
[(All hell's breakin' loose)] In the streets there's a brand new way, yeah

You know we ain't always winners
But this is the life we choose
...
