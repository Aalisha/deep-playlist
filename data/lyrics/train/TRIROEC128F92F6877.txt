I held the keys to that Chevrolet 
and you held the keys to my heart
I'd throw a fit, hit the dash,
get out and kick the tire
when that old piece of junk wouldn't start
It'd be smoking good I'm slam down the hood
Just to see you laughing at me
On the other side of a dirty windshield,
lookin' as pretty as could be

(chorus)
We sure saw a lot of miles,
never even crossed that county line
I would've bet the farm, given my right arm
so you'd always be mine
Did we crash and burn or make a wrong turn
or run out of gasoline?
I lost you around 3rd gear and 17
