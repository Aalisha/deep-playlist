Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, singing low
Bye-bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me, sugar's sweet and so is you
Bye-bye, blackbird

No one here can love and understand me
Oh, what hard-luck stories they all hand me
Open my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye-bye

Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, singing low
Bye-bye blackbird
