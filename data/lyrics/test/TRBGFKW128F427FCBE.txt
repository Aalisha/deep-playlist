(Valure)
It's Friday night,
Hittin' the club with my girls tonight (what)
I'm hanging out with my girls tonight (who?)
Tamika, Ranisha, Shaniqua, Alicia, Myesha, Aylisha, Janelle,
Shanelle, Danielle, Michelle, Rochelle, Anelle
Leave your troubles at the door
Ya'll know what you came here for

(Eddie B.)
Tell your friends to come along (okay)
My crew, your crew, we can get it on
And wear that little thing I like
You know. A thong.
I wanna see you bounce and shake it all night long
Baby, leave your digits on the dresser
I'll call you (sure you will, yeah, whateva)
Okay, I'll have it your way
It's all right with me, so what's it gonna be?

(Chorus, Valure)
Ladies, open up a bottle of cris, and make your man lose it
You ain't gotta hurt nobody
Shake it on the floor
Let him know that you want some more
Fellas, if your game is tight
You'll be leavin' with a lady tonight
Take her home and lay down the pipe and make this night last forever
Do what ya gotta do to the music
Take yourself and losse your mind to the music
Let these brothers know you know how to move it
Don't procrastinate,
Just get right to it
Cuz if you know what it is then the game's on
Sky's the limit, baby girl, you got on and on
Too hot in here,
...
