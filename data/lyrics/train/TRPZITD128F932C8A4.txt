I used to think you understood
Taught me right and learnt me good
Made things simple for my brain
Told the truth and made it plain

But the implications I mistook
Until I found out whose side you took
And now with paper in my hand I'm beginning to understand

So this is freedom - {They must be joking}
They must be joking - {If they think its true}
So this is freedom - (I doubt their truth}
So this is freedom - {For me and you}
