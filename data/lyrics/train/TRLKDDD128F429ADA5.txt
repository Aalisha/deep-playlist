today an old man walked up to me and said
i have trouble walkin,
thats okay ive got a cane, so what
today an old man walked up to me and said
i have trouble seeing,
thats okay, i cant complain
im still alive, im still alive,
yeah im stile aliveee
im still alive.
today an old man walked up to me and said
i have trouble walkin thats okay ive got a cane, so what
today an old man walked up to me and said
i have trouble seeing,
thats okay, i cant complain
