Well you started by yourself,
and then you lived with someone else-
but you can't go back the way it was before.

And I can see it in the eyes
I just know when things aren't right,
and now nothing seems to matter anymore.

It doesn't matter anymore.
It doesn't matter anymore.
It doesn't matter anymore.
It doesn't matter anymore.

Well, how does it feel when you're out on your own back now?
how does it feel when I 'm on my own terms now?
I'm going all the way yeaha.
