Couldn't stop moving when it first took hold.
It was a warm spring night at the old town hall.
There was a group called 'The Jokers' they were layin' it down.
Don't ya know I'm never gonna lose that funky sound.

Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Lordy mama, light my fuse (Light my fuse)
Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo (Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo)
Drop on out and spread the news.

Skeeters start a buzzin' 'bout this time a year.
I'm goin' 'round back, said she'd meet me there.
We were rollin' in the grass that grows behind the barn.
