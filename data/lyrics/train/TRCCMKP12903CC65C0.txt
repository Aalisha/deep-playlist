You're going to burn for this
I know

Rewind until you are
The one you were before
I'll take care
Of what she thought it was she saw

I will find a way to hurt you
On a pretext I will leave
I've no choice but to surprise you
You stole the air I breathe

Breakups are infectious
Misfortune comes in pairs
When your dreams rained down in pieces
Who failed to care?
