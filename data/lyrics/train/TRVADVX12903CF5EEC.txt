Frantic personality
Twisted dance of despair
No grasp on reality
Of the voices beware
Grotesque mental images
Burning in the mind
Breaking down, shattered pieces
Chains of madness bind

Hellish voices multiply
Distort and report to the mind

Schizophrenia
Splitting of the mind

Psychotic delusional
Beliefs are not your own
Violent harsh illusions
