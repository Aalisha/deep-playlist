Some of us don't know why
We were born into this world
Sometimes can't sleep at night
Worrying 'bout the world fearing it as it turns

Use your hands, you know that they are worthy
Use your hands, you know you love to get them dirty

You've been lying on a bed
Seeing no way
Crying all the time
Nearly dead
Secrets are lies
Lying in vain
Sleeper awake
Sleeper awake
