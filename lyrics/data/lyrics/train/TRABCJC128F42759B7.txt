It's time to leave this place where I'm gonna head
It's time to live the most, doubt I hate I'm dead
And then each spread and kills himself a gift
But he loves the shame
It's killing me to see you die inside
It's killing time to care if I'm the one
And then the spanner finds you can't unwind
Better fuse this pain

Will you tell me then
...
