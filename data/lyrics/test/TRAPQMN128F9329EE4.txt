How can you see into my eyes like open doors
leading you down into my core
where I? ve become so numb
without a soul
my spirit sleeping somewhere cold
until you find it there and lead it back home

Wake me up inside
Wake me up inside
call my name and save me from the dark
bid my blood to run
before I come undone
save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
