I hear the clock, I hear the rain
I'm all alone
Why am I here and you are there?
I miss you so

I wish that you were here with me
I need to breathe the air you breathe

Chorus
Cos your blood is my blood
I feel it in my heart that we'll be together
And your god is my god
Your love has made me a believer

All through the night I stay awake
And think of you
...
