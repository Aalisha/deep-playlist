In the desert of my shame
I have found myself to blame
Now I thirst for innocence
And Your blood is there to quench

Pour Your life into my soul
Let the cleansing waters flow
Make me white as snow

Hear me as I pray
Wash my sins away
Draw me in Your grace
Baptize me
As my lips confess
Fill this emptiness
With Your holiness
Baptize me

Touch my eyes and give me sight
Father bathe me in Your light
At Your feet I'll always be
Until the day Your face I'll see

Let Your words consume my heart
Lead me to the deepest part
And the healing starts
...
