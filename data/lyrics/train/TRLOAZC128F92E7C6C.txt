I try to organize
What's going on in my head
But after awhile it seems like I'm
Back where I started again
We got stuck in this web
And we made it ourselves
And we've rolled around in this sticky web
Because we don't care
And we can't break free
I'm not saying I know the answers
Besides it's not up to me
But I could point out a thousand examples
To show their backwards mentality
They give us simple answers
So they can stay where they are
And they're appealing to the masses
