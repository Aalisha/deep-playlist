I'm travellin' throu-ough this game called life
It's a tough game to play-ay
Sometimes we play too rou-ou-ough
Now that I go-ot the final okay
You're tryin' so har-ard to take it all away

I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break
I've got my education, I've got determination
I've got imagination, come on give me a break

Well I started out my life, tried to find a better way
To live in this wor-orld from day-ay to day
Now people don't you know-ow-ow, don't you know-ow
Folks always sai-aid, you've got to reap just what you sew
