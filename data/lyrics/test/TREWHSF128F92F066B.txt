Like the precision of a stutter.
And the comfort of being drowned.
Do we need more ammunition.
Than just one look around.
No comfort in isolation.
Just reminders of what’s wrong.
And still we sit here hoping.
For something to come along.
I want you to know that we’re gonna bleed.
Into the dustbins of history.
And I can’t see why you wanna be.
