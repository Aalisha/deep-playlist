Is this the viewf rom a fallen angels eyes?
It's time to dry the tears...
Like something new,
far better than the lies
of honor, pride and fears...
I will return, much stronger than before!
This is my chance to grow beyond the past...
I know I burn, I burn for you much more...
I paid the price, and know now: It will last!
Sacrificed all that I had inside,
shattered all my senseless fade of pride.
Through the fires of the night...
from the ashes out of sight...
...
