Run along, run a long way to find a one
Find a one who could turn you on
Underneath a cloudless sun

I certainly hope that you are happy
With your new change of company
Surrounded by your enemies

Can't you see if I could be anything
I want to be I would be you see
Can't you see if I could be anything

And if you say everything will want to go your way
I will turn you away as easily as I turned you into me
