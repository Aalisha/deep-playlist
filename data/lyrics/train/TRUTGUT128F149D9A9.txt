Fifteen minutes later
You don't seem so famous
The arms that raised you overhead
Take you to your grave instead

With your wedding ring and your trampoline
Tried to touch the sky
But you couldn't get that high
With your silly songs
Everybody sings along
But don't know what the fuck you're sayin'

Five miles into stardom
You begin to see

Voices chant praising you
Where are you without your tune

With your broken glass
Another passing fad
Wanted to see how far
