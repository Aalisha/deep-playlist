I was a traveler travelin' alone
Crossin' that desert they call the 'Unknown''
Lost in a valley of shadows and sinking sand

Hopeless was circling over my head
Patiently waiting for my last step
I was a desperate woman in no man's land

Like an angel of mercy, emotional savior
You took me in your arms and out of danger

You rescued me in the nick of time
I was right on the edge of goin' out of my mind
I was runnin' on empty down to a crawl
Facing a future with no one at all and just before I found out
How life without love could be, you rescued me
