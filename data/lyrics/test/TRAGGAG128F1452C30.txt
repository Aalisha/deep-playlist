To all of those who had their doubts
Now those doubts... I forgive 'em
To everyone who's led one life
Then love life... its humble rhythm
To all of those who harbour dreams
All you get... is what you're given
Meanwhile the maximum... maximum goes down
Right from the start
I knew you'd break my heart
Jealous lover... jealous lover
Rope tied and bound
I been lost and found
Jealous lover... jealous lover
Jealous of my loving
...
