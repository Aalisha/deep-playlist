This coffin isn't big enough for me,
Silk, satin and lace surrounding three,
I hate being dressed up they've got me looking f**ked up,
I want out and no ones stopping me.

My finger nails have grown strong enough
inch long, sharp, ripping through this stuff
Wood shavings falling in my face,
who could stand the smell of this place,
how much more can I bear,
I've broken through the last layer.
