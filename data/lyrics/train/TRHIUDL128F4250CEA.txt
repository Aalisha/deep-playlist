Gaze around, fearful sepulchral shadows
Standing into the earthy depths
Mixture of things without size and color
Images passed along in the most marvelous dark
Copies of the same sand thrust, to be the only creep
Vast wilderness of undiscovered creatures
Present the underworld twice in my eyes

Dimension out of man's site
Out of light, out of shadows
Reality is down beyond seasons and process
...
