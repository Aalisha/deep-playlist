I've thrown away...
I've thrown away again
The pills that make me
I've thrown away...
I've thrown away again
The chance, the want to change
I've thrown away...
I've thrown away again
Standing all alone
I've thrown away...
I've thrown away again...

Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
Pulling back the skin
It happens, we're getting older
Eyes wired shut
Running through my brain
It's all the same
But in the end, it keeps me coming
