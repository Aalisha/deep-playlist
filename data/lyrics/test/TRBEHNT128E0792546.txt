i feel like a ghost in my own life
the rumor promised to do me right, now
who's life is that on my tv, yeah
well thats the way it's supposed to be
i'm down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
i'm down in the jungle you're the fucking queen
i'm telling you baby you're the only fun
they gone and left the planet to the chosen ones
look to the bottom there ain't no soul
and i'm in love with a big black hole
but i can dig it cause i'm a hound
we got the garbage as our playing ground
well maybe in the future i can be your man
well maybe if i fuck you i can hold your hand
