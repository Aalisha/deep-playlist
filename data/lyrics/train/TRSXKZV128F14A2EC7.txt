Movin' to the backbeat
Walkin' down Main Street
Checkin' out the new scene
Watchin' all the girls go by
High heels, short dress
Baby, make your heart a mess
Ââ Nough to make you confess
Now, dreamin' ain't no capital crime
Hot little mama, little blue eyed baby
Swept my feet right off the ground
Well I can't help it, now I just keep fallin'
...
