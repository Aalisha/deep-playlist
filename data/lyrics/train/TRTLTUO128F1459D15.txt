Big hair, pink lips, eyes all painted up
Spray net and George Strait riding in her pickup truck
Midnight, highway, headed for the club Siam
Heartbeat hot spot, looking for a cowboy man

Western girls, got me jumpin' up for joy
Western girls, makes me glad I'm a good ole boy
Western girls, the best I've ever seen
