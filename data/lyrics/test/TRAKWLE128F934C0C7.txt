Shut up!
Don't you try to turn your back on me
Just try to deal with me
Stand up!
Towards mankind's insurrection
Cancelling my perceptions

I remember this destination
I remember it's not the right path
Can you feel it?
Will you stand this?

I'll make swallow your pride
And make you burn from the inside
Then,
Then I'll watch the scene
‘Cause you don't know me
‘Cause you don't know me

Will you stand
...
