(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I've no excuse
I just want you to use me
(Use me)
Take me and abuse me
I got no taboos
I'll make a trade with you
(With you)
I'll do anything you want me to

Money talks
(You know)
Money talks
Dirty cash
I want you
Dirty cash
I need you, oh
Money talks
(You know)
Money talks
Dirty cash
I want you
(Dirty cash)
Dirty cash
I need you, oh

Dirty cash
Dirty cash
Dirty cash
Dirty cash

I wasn't right
And now I'm so behind
I want to get rich quick
I want success
And all that goes with it
And I'm gonna use myself

Money talks
(You know)
Money talks
Dirty cash
I want you
Dirty cash
I need you, oh
Money talks
