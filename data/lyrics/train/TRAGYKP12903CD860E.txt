(G. Feldhausen)

Little girl don't be shy
I'm gonna take you for a ride
I'll take you to the other side
To make you feel alright
Little angel take it slow
Take my hand and don't say no
Come along to play my game
You don't have to feel no shame

Let's do it on the road
My gun's reload
I'm a lover like a gun
Don't you wanna have fun

I'm a man and it's true
That I was made for loving you
...
