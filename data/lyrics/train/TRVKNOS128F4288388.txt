So you say we should just be friends Adam 
But I know when I get the bends 
That I'll hate you so 

So you say we should drift apart Adam 
But I know that'll break my heart 
And I'll hate you so 
'Cause I loved you so 

So you say I can be afraid 
But I know I would have strayed 
I sit and miss you so 
A batch of alcohol ceases to control 

Don't say you'll think about me 
Or say that you can live without me 
Didn't we make it nearly 
...
