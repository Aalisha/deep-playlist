What about the way you love me? Is it enough, cause ain’t no trust?
What about the things you did to me? Snoopin’ around, checkin’ if I’m steppin’ out?
It’s the deeds not the words.baby can’t you see, I’m the real thing.
Now you’re sayin’ how you need me, & that you’re gonna change,
But baby it’s too lil’ too late.

HOOK

I just cannot go on……
Just don’t understand what you want….
So I’m walkin’ out, the door…the door.
