I Wanna Learn A Love Song
I come fresh from the street,
fast on my feet, kind a lean and lazy;
not much meat on my bones, and a whole lot alone,
and more than a little bit crazy.
The old six string was all I had

and for each full hour lessson I gave
I got a crisp ten dollar bill.

in my faded tight-legged jeans
with a backlog full of hobo stories
and dilapidated dreams.
