[Intro - DJ Evil Dee - talking] (*echo*)
Uhh, word up, you know what I'm sayin?
Evil Dee in your area
This how it goes down
Right about now you know what I'm sayin, we chillin in Bushwick
We about to take it down to Boston, you know what I'm sayin?
Hey yo, check this out, you know what I'm sayin?
My man's about to say somethin
Aiyyo Ak, check it out
Yeah, (heat it up y'all)
Check, (heat it up y'all, heat it up y'all)
(Heat it up y'all, heat it up y'all)
Bust it (heat it up y'all)
They say it's no such thing as a sure thing
That death is the only guarantee that life brings
Who ever made that up never heard this fact (no)
Akrobatik brings it everytime and that's that
I've seen so many niggas steady fuck up they chances
No timin to they music only focused on they stances
But what's on my canvas, enhances dances and advances
