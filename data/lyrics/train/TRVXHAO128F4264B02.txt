Oey, oey

Woh, alright

She drives me crazy, ha
She drives me wild
But when she tries to
Satisfy me when I'm drivin'
We need to stop somewhere for a while

Ow, I'm gettin' ready
I feel the need for speed
Can't slow down
Till she gives me what I need

I know just the place that we can go
(We can go)
Hop in the back, we can be all alone
(All alone)
Lock the doors and hold on tight
(Hold on tight)
We're gonna have a good time tonight
...
