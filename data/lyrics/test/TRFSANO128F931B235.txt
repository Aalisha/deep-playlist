(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo)

So, you're breakin' my heart
Takin' my sunshine from me
Knowing that I'm to blame
Darling, there's nothing that I can say

Darling, I've got to try
'Cause in my heart I know that I

I'll always love you
I'll always love you, baby
Darling, return my love
No matter where you go

(I'll always love you, baby)
(I'll always love you, baby)
