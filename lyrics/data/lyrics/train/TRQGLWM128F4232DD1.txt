Living everyday 
Trapped behind the walls
And it's something you defend 

Pain is in your eyes
You're holding back the tears
So why is it that you pretend?

And all this time you've hidden the abuse
But now you have a way out
It's your life, just choose

So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears
And trough them all away 
...
