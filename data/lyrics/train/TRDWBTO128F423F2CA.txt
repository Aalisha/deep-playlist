Broken promises,
We lost the joy that we once knew.
Where do we go from here,
From something old to something new?
Past dreams done gone from me,
I'm losing daylight, losing view.

Do You feel my need?
I'm lost within this forest,
Barricaded by the trees.
Will You hear my cry for help,
Would You forgive me?
