Yeah Ah Ah Ah
Brick N Lace Inna Di Place
Yuh Love Is Wicked, Wicked, Wicked
Oh Come On
Runnin' Around I Can't Get Through My Day (You Feel Me)

Thoughts Of You Jus Keep Consuming Me
(Inna Mi Head Inna Mi Head) (Okay)
Cause I Thought I Could Do It But Now I See
That You're Not Mine And I Was Wrong To Think You'd Change Yeah
I Wish You Could Stay With Me Another Day

I Wish I Could Change Your Mind And Make You Stay (Stay)

(Cos I) I'd Give Anything To Hear You Say (Sayayayay)
"I've Been Loving You Eternally"
(You Know Wah)
(Your Love Is Wicked)
Tears On My Pillow Cause Your Love Is Wicked
Cry Me A River Cause Your Love Is Wicked
(Your Love Is Wicked)
Friends Come Around Say Your Love Is Wicked
But The Kisses Wah You Get, Dont You Know It's Wicked?
(Your Love Is Wicked)
Wait For Your Call Cause Your Love Is Wicked
Cyaan Sleep At All Cause Your Love Is Wicked
(Your Love Is Wicked)
