Vodka! Vodka! Vodka! Vodka! Hey!

Vodka, you're feeling stronger
Vodka, no more feeling bad
Vodka, your eyes are shining
Vodka, you are the real man

Vodka, wipes away your tears
Vodka, removes your fears
Vodka, everyone is gorgeous
Vodka, yeah vodka

Drinking is good for you
soon you are unconstrained
Drinking is good for you
Here comes the womanizer
Drinking is good for you
Not anymore lonesome
Drinking is good for you
And you will feel awesome
And you will feel awesome

Hey!

Out of respect for nature
Our vodka and drinkers.
Promising, that the vodka
