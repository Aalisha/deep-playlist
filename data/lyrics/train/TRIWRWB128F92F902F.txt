I worked the land to raise a family
Til I was weary to the bone
But hard labor never bothered me
Lord it's all I've ever known
Too many seasons are calamity
And too much interest on the loan
I'm half the size that I used to be
And half of that is stone
The crops ain't worth the seeding
10 will only get you 5
the last stock ima feedin'
I can hardly keep 'em alive
I gotta do what I can to survive
I know the law wont be forgiving
But that'll be the choice I make
I used to farm for a living
