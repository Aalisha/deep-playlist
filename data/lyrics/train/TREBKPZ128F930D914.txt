Don't need you, I don't live in this town
Don't trust you, don't trust anyone around
Can't stand you, ain't gonna stick around
I wasn't born for lovin'
(I was born to raise hell)
I wasn't born for lovin'
(I was born to raise hell)
I hate you and I hate this town
I mean you and this pitiful town
I hate you, you just make me laugh
I wasn't born for lovin'
(I was born to raise hell)
I wasn't born for lovin'
(I was born to raise hell)
I hate you, you like me?
(No)
You like our music, now don't ya?
(No)
