[Intro:]
Life you know
Is not easy road
But you cyaan mek obstacles stop you
DASEEECA

[Chorus:]
Some people stop by obstacles my journeys continue
Di devil is always gonna be around hauntin you
Every single day he will be tauntin you
Babylon always lookin something to plant on you
Some people stop by obstacles my journeys continue
Di devil is always gonna be around hauntin you
Every single day he will be tauntin
Babylon always lookin something to plant on you

[Verse 1:]
Mi whole up mi head mi swollow mi pride and decide seh mi na go fail.
Even if it's fi ride a bicycle and go deliver mail
Praise mi god mi find a job nah fi rob fi go a jail
Waan fi mek mi over evil righetousness have to prevail
Good things comin small puzzle some people wantin it barrage
Cannot hide from jah so forget ya comoflage
According to your word dats how you get your reward
So if you got to be a rebel be a rebel with a cause yeeah
