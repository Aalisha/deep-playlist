There was blood on my hands and hair on my cheeks,
i hadn't got a shave in 25 weeks.
i cracked the window open, i had a handgun in the backseat,
you were going 65 on a waterfront street.
and i knew that i could trust you to give me a ride
like the ocean trusts the moon to give it a tide.
and you said "i saw someone being killed once when i was 14"
and i said "you don't know where i been."
you were staying up heading south, we were looking for food.
there was a song stuck in your head and it wasn't very good.
the chorus was lame it went like "lovers are waterproof."
i was tearing at the palm trees through sunroof.
and though the gas was expensive here in california
you had been driving me on in to the morning on yuh.
and you said "leave your past behind you and it will all 'come clean"
