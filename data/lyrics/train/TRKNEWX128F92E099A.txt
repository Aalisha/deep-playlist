That Old Pair Of Jeans
You Always See My Wearing When It's Grey
You Know What I Mean
I'm Riding A Lazy Mood

Cause You've Been Waiting Got Me Ready To Go
And I've Been Sraying Off The Way That I Know, Keep Me
Wise Enough, Nothing To Owe
Guess I Need Ya And I Want It To Show

Lying Here In My Sanctuary
Days Go Past Its Autumn Already
And I Wish It Would Thunder
Lying Here In My Sanctuary
