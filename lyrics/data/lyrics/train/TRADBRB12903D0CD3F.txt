Tiger style
Tiger style
Yo, huh, huh
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
There's no place to hide once I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam! Aw, man! I slam
Jam, now scream like Tarzan

I be tossin', enforcin', my style is awesome
I'm causin' more family feud's than Richard Dawson
And the survey said, ya dead
Fatal flying guillotine chops off your fuckin' head
RZA who was that? Aiyyo, the Wu is back
Makin' niggaz go bo bo!, Like on super cat
Me fear no-one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to the eardrum

I puts the needle to the groove, I gets rude
And I'm forced to fuck it up my style carries like a pickup truck
Across the clear blue yonder
Seek the China sea, I slam tracks like quarterbacks sacks from L.T.
Now why try and test, the rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
'Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too, with my crew while we head state to state

And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
Straight from the motherfucking slums that's busted
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthing ta fuck wit
