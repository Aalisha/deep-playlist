At the start, He was there, He was there
In the end, He? ll be there, He? ll be there
And after all our hands have wrought, He forgives

Oh, the glory of it all is He came here
For the rescue of us all that we may live
For the glory of it all, for the glory of it all

All is lost, find Him there, find Him there
After night dawn is there, dawn is there
And after all falls apart, He repairs, He repairs

Oh, the glory of it all is He came here
