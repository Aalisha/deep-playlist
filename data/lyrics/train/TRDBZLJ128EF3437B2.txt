Don't try to tell me that my intentions are untrue
My eyes like butterflies you caught 'em and they're open wide
Clouded and hazy future clear whenever I'm with you
Just think of all the things we could do to pass the time
It's a walk in the park, it goes

Na na na, na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na, na na na, na na na na na na

Cuz everybody's got a little pieces of someone they hide
It's okay, it's the way we distract until the day that we die
And though our future's gone uncertain, it's gonna be alright
...
