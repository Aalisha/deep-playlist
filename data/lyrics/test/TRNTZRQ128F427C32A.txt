You'd think by now I'd have figured it out
At least just a little bit but I get turned around
Headed the wrong way, down a one way
And I always thought I'd see you again some day
Is your life as hard for you as mine is for me?
For your sake I hope you're laughing in the sun
But I don't think I'm the only one waiting for the good to shine
And it feels like I'm down to life number nine
Life number nine
