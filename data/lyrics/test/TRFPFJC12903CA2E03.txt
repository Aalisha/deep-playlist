Try and do the things you want,
But you never do them for me,
Try and say the things you want,
But you never say them to me,
And move on, and move on, and move on, and move on,
To someone else,
But its always the same problem,

Its the way my heart beats,
Ever so softly,
Its the way my heart beats,
Ever so softly,
