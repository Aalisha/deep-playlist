Alice Cooper
You have been accused of mass mental cruelty
How do you plead?
Guilty!

Don't wanna be clean
Don't wanna be nice
The whip's gonna crack
My leather is black and so are my eyes
I'm gonna be rough
I'm gonna be mean
I'm here to the end, my sick little friend
I'm back in your dreams
You can take my head and cut it off
But you ain't gonna change my mind

If you don't like it you can lock me up
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh,
...
