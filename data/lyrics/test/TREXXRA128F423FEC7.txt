(feat. Lounge Mode)

(Intro: Lounge Mode (Cappadonna))
Yo yo yo yo yo (Guess who's back?)

(Chorus: Lounge Mode)
Aiyo I thought I told y'all before that Cap is Back
And the bitches in the club said Cap is Back
I got them thugs over there that said Cap is Back
And them Bloods over there who said Cap is Back

(Cappadonna)
I don't have to tell y'all niggaz how it is in Da Struggle
Police chasin' me down, niggaz start to bubble
Cracks and Blood niggaz in the huddle
It's rainin' cats and dogs, and kids in the puddles
We still in the game like Poppy, Chad and P-Double
Hard-headed niggaz causin' the trouble
Stank-ho niggaz wanna see niggaz behind the bubble
So they could start fuckin' ya man
Space Invadin' ass niggaz takin' up land
Tryin' to understand my ill pain
No matter what you do I'ma still gain in Da Struggle
(Fuck you, double, niggaz shoot dope in the game
This shit is serious)

(Chorus)

(Cappadonna)
