My god, is big
so strong, so mighty.
my god's, plan for me
goes beyond my wildest dreams.
My god, is good
he's so good to me.
Yea, so good to me...
My god, is big
so strong, so mighty.
my god's, is good
he's so good to me.
He's my god, and
he is my refuge.
he's the rock on which i stand.
he's my fortress,
god, he is my life.
