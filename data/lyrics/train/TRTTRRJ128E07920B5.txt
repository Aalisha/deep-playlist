Loving you is not just luck or illusion
It's in the make-up of our DNA
It's not by chance we make the perfect solution
Don't fight it baby, you know that it's just destiny's way

Baby lovin' you
Comes easily to me
It's what I'm living for
It's all in the chemistry
Baby, lovin' you
Is how it's meant to be
It's something that is all so natural to me

Natural

Baby, baby

We got the answers but there's no explanation
We got each other baby come what may
It's in the science, it's genetically proven
'Cos when you touch me the reaction, it just blows me away
