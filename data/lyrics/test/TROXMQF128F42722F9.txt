God only knows what's going on inside of me
This world revolves around everything that's not meant to be
These prison walls are closing in fast
It's do or die, get me out of this past

There You stand with Your arms wide open
You're calling me to You
I know that heaven's just one step away
As I reach for You You hold me and say "I love you"

I may not always get what I want but I know
That You'll give me everything that I need
...
