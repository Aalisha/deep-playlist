She was a street walker. Her life was all gone, 
Couldn't understand how it all went wrong, 
Now she's on the corner twenty dollars at a time 
With her broken spirit and her shattered spine, 
Getting beaten and raped and left for dead, 
How she got here will it never be said, 
With blood from her nose, pipe burns on her lips, 
Bruises on her eyes and bruises on her hips, 
...
