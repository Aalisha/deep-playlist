Carrion child,
Prey for me, play your
Wild card, see the house come down around your
Head, home to me, so much dreaming
Some say I'm growing cold and
Taking over
Nothing, cuts, two ways...
Possession: taking over
Stand these pictures on your shelf
And wear your heart upon my sleeve,
Wear a dress that you can see through,
See yourself inside;
I'll be your imagination,
Tear apart what you believe,
...
