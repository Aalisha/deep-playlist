Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star
Like a star, a star, a star, a star

She's my everything, like a morning girl
She's my angel, up above my world
She's the only one, who understands me
That's why I called her, my new fan league

She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me wanna be a better man ohh why,
She's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon
