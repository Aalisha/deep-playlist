Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another, and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day, I stay locked up in my room

I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
(Such a lovely day)
Everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I got to cry, 'cause crying
Eases the pain, oh yeah

People, this hurt I feel inside
...
