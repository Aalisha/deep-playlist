Well I got caught
Messing with things I shouldn't have
Well how was I supposed to know
You wouldn't be late

As far as I
Am concerned I pulled my heart
Back when you see nothing about how I fell

When I was down you were the one I wanted
When I was down you were the one I needed

I shoulda been lenient
