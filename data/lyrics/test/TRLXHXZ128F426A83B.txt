When I was younger, I thought I could stand on my own.
It wasn't easy, I stood like a man made of stone.
But there was something about you (I want you to know),
It brought a change over me (it's starting to show).
I've got this feeling inside,
Got to have you, have you,
Ain't no good to hide.

(Chorus)
It isn't easy to show
What I'm feeling inside, girl.
It isn't easy, I know
When you believe in a man like me.
