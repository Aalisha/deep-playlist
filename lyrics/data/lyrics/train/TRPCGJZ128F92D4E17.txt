It's been years in the making
In my skin, I'm shaking from the cold
I am tired from the taking
And my heart won't stop breaking
And I know, I know
Moving forward
Can't be this hard

I'm just tryin' to find out
Who I am, on my own
I had you right beside me
Now your gone and I know.
That when the room clears, I'm still here.
Who am I when I'm alone?

They say time is a healer
It's more like a concealer for a scar
