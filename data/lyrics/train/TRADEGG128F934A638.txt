Me and my friends drove down to the riverside
With a half case of beer and a couple bottles of wine
And the rain started to fall
We tipped our bottles and the river overflowed

Floodwater, carry me away
Take my mind to another place
Drown my sorrow, kill my fear
Floodwater, take me far away from here
