(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)

I gotta lotta old friends that are gettin' back in touch
And it's a pretty good feelin, yeah it feels pretty good
I get a lotta double-takes when I'm comin' around the corners
And it's mostly pretty nice, yeah it's mostly pretty alright

'Cause most kids give me credit for being down with it
When it was back in the day, back when things were way different
When the Youth of Today and the early 7 Seconds
Taught me some of life's most valuable lessons

There's gonna come a time when the scene'll seem less sunny
It'll probably get druggy and the kids'll seem too skinny
There's gonna come a time when she's gonna have to go
With whoever's gonna get her the highest
