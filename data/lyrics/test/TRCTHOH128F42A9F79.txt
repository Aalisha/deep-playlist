Well, who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot?
Who's gonna glove your hand?
Who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips?
And who's gonna be your man?

Is that you Reuben?
Reuben, where have you been so long?
Is that you Reuben?
Reuben, where have you been so long?

Well, papa's gonna shoe my pretty little foot
Mama's gonna glove my hand
Sister's gonna kiss my red ruby lips
And I don't need no man

Well, I don't need no man
