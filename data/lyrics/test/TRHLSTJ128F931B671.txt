There will come a time when everything will have to end
When all the wrong you've done will be your only friend
and as the clock runs down you start to lose control
No one can save you now because you sold your soul

God wants to know - what you thin think you're doing
God wants to know - what is it you've done
God wants to know - did you hear the warning
I want to know - will I be the one?
