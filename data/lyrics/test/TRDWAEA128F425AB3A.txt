If I could change the way I live my life today
I wouldn't change a single thing
'Cos if I change my world into another place
I wouldn't see your smiling face

I'll always be there and I'll always care

Honey don't you worry, there's nothing to worry for
'Cos if I didn't love you, I wouldn't be here now
And if I didn't want you, I would have turned around by now

You've got to believe me babe, believe that I love you so
'Cos if I didn't love you, I would have turned around
And if I didn't want you, then I would want you out

This love, this love has filled me up
Oh my love I'll never give you up
