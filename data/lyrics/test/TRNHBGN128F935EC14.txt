I Can't Stop Loving You by* Ray Charles

(I can´t stop loving you)
I´ve made up my mind
To live in memory of the lonesome times
(I can´t stop wanting you)
It´s useless to say
So I´ll just live my life in dreams of yesterday
(Dreams of yesterday)

Those happy hours that we once knew
Tho´ long ago, they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart
But time has stood still since we´ve been apart

(I can´t stop loving you)
