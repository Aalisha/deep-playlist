Painted as monsters
Borracho, cansado
Do you know what the people say?

Plucked from the garden
Of wretched beliefs
I offer a rose
And smile with harmless teeth

Then slick back my hair
You know the devil's in there
Alone in the garden

Like lumbering giants
In a shameful parade
We came to ruin all
And make a rotten trade

I'll make you roll over
So roll over

Scattered on the shore
Surely washed away
Feeling somewhat deserving
...
