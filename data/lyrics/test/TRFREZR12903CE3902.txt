I'm so afraid to have you feel like this
But you're so afraid of second chances
Despite the walls growing in between us
I'm moving on...

I'm so afraid of feeling like this
You're so afraid of going past us
You just betrayed the one to never turn their back
I'm moving on...

You built this up the best you could
But there things misunderstood
Like how to love, and how to care
And always trying to be there
When life hard and I fell down
You left me crawling on the ground
...
