Babe you try to sail the world on your own
yeah, you try but you sink like a stone
you feel a little lost but hey
babe there's so many things left to see
a little harbour just for you and me
we can make it if we only believe
we tear it up ... we move along
it's a different beat a different song
this is not the end of the world
it's the beginning of a brand new day
you know time waits for no one
this is not the end of the world
it's the start of a getaway
you know time waits for no one
...
