'Who likes Wednesdays, anyway,'
She says, 'there's not enough ends in the week
Wouldn't you say,
If I had my way,'
She says, 'it would be Friday
And we'd stay and dance till after
The band packed their stuff away'

Claudia, wish I danced like you
Danced like I had nothing to worry 'bout
Except Rock & Roll

Look ain't she cool
Aren't I a right fool
I spill my guts like she cares what
I'm going through
I'm sure she don't like me
...
