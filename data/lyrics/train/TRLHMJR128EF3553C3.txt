I wish I had one good reason why
I should stay
How'd I get myself
Into this place?

I wish had qualities like
Sympathy
Fidelity
Sobriety
Sincerity
Humility
Instead I got lunacy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I wish I could fit myself in my pocket
And tie myself to a rocket
And send myself to outer space
I wish I had a different face
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I wish I had one good reason why
I should stay
How'd I get myself
Into this place?

I wish my life was a little less seedy
