Oh, my heart skips a beat,
When we walk down the street
I feel a tremblin' in my knees
And just to know your mine,
Until the end of time
Makes my heart skip a beat.

Well, I did a double take the day I met you
My heart turned a flip as I stood next to you
And I knew right there I never could forget you
For you are my every dream come true.
