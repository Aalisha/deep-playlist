The rebel inside, a mind of my own
I haven't felt right since the moment that I gave up
I challenged my limits, I'm feeling I'm becoming limitless
I take it all in and inhale

I'm wide awake
Open my eyes and the sky's so blue
All of a sudden I know that I treasure my life
I find myself wide awake like you
...
