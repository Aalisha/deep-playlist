Do you know the way to San Jose?
I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose?
I'm going back
To find some peace of mind
In San Jose

L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week maybe two,
They'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years
How quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas
...
