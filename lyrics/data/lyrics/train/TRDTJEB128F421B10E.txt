V1
Do I doubt or do I trust
Will I burn out or will I rust
Should I run or should I rest
Hard to tell which is best

Chorus
All I want to do
Is the next right thing
The next right thing
All I need from you
Love and understanding
Love and understanding

V2
I got to move no time to lose
Gonna hurt somebody no matter what I do
Do I please them do I please you?
Can't please 'em all but I'm always tryin' to
Am I lucky or am I good
