Sick of drinking poison
Sick of worrying 
Sick of telling lies
You're just sick of listening

What a faster child 
I have made myself
What a stab
What a missing truth
I hope I can get hope to you

What's the use in going in alone
What's the use in going this alone

It's you and me let's get outta this place [x2]

I'm sick of this monster monster
Gotta get here 
gotta get here
I'm sick of this monster monster
Gotta get here
gotta get here
We've got to get out get out
