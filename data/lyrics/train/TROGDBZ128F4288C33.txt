H C P what I'm reppin mane
If you ain't bout that better get the stepping mane
H C P what I'm reppin mane
If you ain't bout that betta get the stepping mane
H C P what I'm reppin mane
If you ain't bout that betta get the stepping mane
H C P what I'm reppin mane
If you ain't bout that betta get the stepping mane

(Verse 1)
Now I'm a tell you off top shit gone get a little drastic
Frayser come around its a wrap like plastic
Never punked out or pushed around like a basket
Keep yo lips zipped or you'll be next wit yo ass kick
Make it stick and move in and out like mash it
Handle that get the check, hit the bank, cash it
Niggas talking shit don't you get you ass blasted
Fuckin wit the bay could be deadly like acid
Laws come around them I'm poof like magic
Gone in 60 seconds now I'm breathing like a addict
Keep a tone close just in case I got some static
Nigga in the north ended up kinda tragic
Ridin home drunk in the car bout to crash it
Them folks took my license now I'm parked like Jurassic
