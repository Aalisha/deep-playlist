A yeah

Anybody ready to move

Some one said to me I can't take this economy
I've got a family and everybody's counting on me
Well looking at you there's something I don't see
I know you've issues but you don't seem to worry

Well this peace that no one understands but me
And I'm living today because I found a way to be good with what happens to me

[Chorus]
I got to find a reason to dance
I'm talking joy, joy, joy
