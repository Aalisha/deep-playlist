[Verse 1]
Yo, when the East is in da house
GOD DAMN! we slam Mic
40 Days - 40 Nights fights Erupt from the Energy
Givin' off me, Crowd movin' Wattage
It's Electric, shockin' the body
Rise Nazareth, party wit the God body
Here's a Hotty, see the chief is like a Dr.
And I'm gon' Prescribe
Just a thought for you to snort
If you like it then light it up
Smoke it, tot it, shotgun blast it
Pass it to your homey let 'em sample the example
How to MC
