Drivel head wears her glad rags
She's got her keys money and fags
I know that her mind is made up
To get rocked

Drivel head needs a new man
As only a drivel head can
He's a hormonal nightmare
So beware

Another victim of line up in line
Line up in line is all I remember
Oh how their favors change
...
