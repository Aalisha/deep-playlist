People A Dead That's What I Said The Crime Must Be Led The Hungry Must Be
Fed Hey Yo Galore I'm Looking Through All This Fear Over The Years Hey Yo
Nobody Cares Take A Look In My House Would You Live In There Huh Hey Yo
Galore Look At My Shoes Can You See My Toes Well That's How The Struggle
Goes Nobody Knows.

Chorus

Look into my eyes, tell me what you see?
Can you feel my pain? am I your enemy?
Give us a better way, things are really bad,
The only friend I know is this gun I have.
Listen to my voice, this is not a threat
Now you see the nine are you worried yet?
You've been talking 'bout' you want the war to cease
But when you show us hope, we will show you peace.
