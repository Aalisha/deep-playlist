I'm getting tired of all your broken promises
I'm getting tired of all your figured exuses

I'm sick to the back teeth of all your boring anecdotes
You know I've heard them all a million times before

I don't think you realise what damage you have caused
We can't go on like this, we can't take anymore

How long have we got to wait
How long before you complete
How long before you finished what you started
Tell me how much more time is this all going to take?
You have to listen and get on with this belated show

Termination, it's the only way
Termination, it's the only answer
