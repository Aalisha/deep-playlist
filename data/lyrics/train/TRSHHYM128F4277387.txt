She wears a halo of ashes
Spectre of the wind
Waits on me so patiently
I no longer can pretend
Sky lies a thousand miles below
Stars shine and the moon is clear
Nothing and for no one
Won't see me if you're here

I've been a long, long time away
Got one foot in the grave
Glorified in the dying of the sun

My angel pulls me closer
...
