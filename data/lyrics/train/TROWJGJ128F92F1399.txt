Hold on and wait just a little while
Hold on and wait just a little while
He'll bring a song of strength
Hold on and wait just a little while, little while

What do you do when the life you've planned is scattered?
What do you say when the one you love is gone?
How do you live? Seems like no hope for tomorrow
Pain doesn't care where you live or who you are

Lord You see my life is broken
And I don't know what to do
While I'm in this change, help me remain
I will count on You, oh, oh

When I can't see, I know You'll guide
When I cry out, I know You feel
Now I'm praying, I know You hear
I'm praying for healing, I know You will

Who do you call when no one has the answer?
Where do you go when the place you've know is no more?
When will they stop? All the tears they just keep falling
