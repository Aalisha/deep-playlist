From day one
I've wanted you
And now I feel so all alone
In the sun
I'm haunted too
And now I feel so all alone

Maybe we never succeeded
Blame me because I didn't see
That everything I ever needed
Was right in front of me

Is it hard to forget, forget that we ever met?
With your head in the sand, remember

From day one
I have wanted you
