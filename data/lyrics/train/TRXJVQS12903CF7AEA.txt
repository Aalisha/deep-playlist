Woke up this morning all alone
I got a ringing in my head
I couldn't take it anymore today
She left me here for dead
Oh woah, yeah, yeah

And it should come as no surprise
I should've known it from the start
The lights are faded and I can't deny
This place ain't got no heart

Oh, you can't hear me tonight
You can't hear me tonight

You'll have to carry me back from Cali
