NO NO NO
Tesla Girls Tesla Girls
Testing out theories
Electric Chairs and dynamos
Dressed to kill They're killing me
But Heaven knows their recipe

NO NO NO

You wouldn't believe me if I said
The things I've seen went over my head
I've been patient Heaven knows
I've learnt the rules and how it goes
I can't sit still or settle down
And when I walk I don't touch the ground
See those girls they're Heaven blessed
I guess it's so they know best
