Once you were a straight shot, a shiny quarter in a new slot,
Night would keep the dreams that you got for afternoon.

Then telling the truth got so hard, we were dancing in the backyard,
Once I knew the end and the start, but now that’s through.

Now you’re broken and you don’t understand
What is broken falls into place once again.
Hand of kindness, come and gather me in like a rainstorm,
Again and again and again.

Well morning comes to clean up like nothing happened when your heart stopped,
Like all the lawyers calling all cops to wave days through.
