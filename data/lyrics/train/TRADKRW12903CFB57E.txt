There was a time, my love
My heart had grown cold
My arms were reaching out
For someone to hold
I was all mired in gloom
And I was alone
Then you took a hold of me
And made me your own

You pulled me up where I belong
Though at first it seemed so wrong
To be scaling love's great heights
Basking freely in its light

I'd forgotten the things I knew
Inside to be true
Trials were everywhere
And pleasures were few
I drifted alone
In the ocean of life
But then you pulled me, dear
