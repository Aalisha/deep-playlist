I been kicking myself ever since
I gave my love to you a hundred percent
And you gave nothin' in return
The only time you seemed concerned
Is when you wanted to lay up

You kept telling me that I was the one
And you kept sellin' me dream after dream
But after so many dreams deferred
I saw you for what you were
And that was someone who really didn't care

How can somethin' feel so right
Really be so wrong
Why were you strange with me
Along for the ride
I can't let you get back inside

I know you're wantin' to make it right
Blowin' up my pager and phone day and night
Like I should up and let you in
To my open arms again
I don't think so, not a chance
...
