Ive been down
Down so long
But those days are gone now
Ive got the will
Ive earned the right
To show you its my time tonight
Its my time
Its my time
My moment
Im not gonna let go of it
My time
Its my time
And ill stand proud
Theres nothing im afraid of
Ill show you what im made of
Show you all
Its my time now
