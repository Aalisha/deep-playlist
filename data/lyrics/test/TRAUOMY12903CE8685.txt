He said, "this ain't me, but I gotta eat
And feed my kid, y'know this place ain't cheap
Well you can saint or damn me but I don't care
Don't condemn me, don't commend me now..."
Another round, his guts spill out
Turns out his ships run aground and my head just swims around

"...so pour another, it's 3 AM, oh god this is insane
It's killing me, it's killing me
I know, I know I walked away but it's you I'll always blame
And it's killing me
If my liver swells up out on the floor
I'll nail it to your door..."
