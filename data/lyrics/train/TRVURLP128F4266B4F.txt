As far back as I recall
You played a major part
Inspired me to see my place in life
You gave me reason to create
Everyday is brand new
Theres something new introduced
You've touched me in those places
That no one but you can reach

Chorus
You take me to this high
I feel like I can fly
The melodies you send me (la da da da da da da da)
The music of my heart
The music of my mind
The music of my soul
The music in me
