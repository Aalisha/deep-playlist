If you plant corn
You gonna' reap corn
That' what a gwan
It a gwan
If you plant corn
You gonna' reap corn
That's what a gwan
It a gwan
Lift up your head selassie i
I and i ah chant out rasta fari
Lift up your head selassie i
I and i ah chant out rasta fari
Jah own the earth, the moon and sky
Tell them come look ina the lion's eye
Due reward
Babylon will get your due reward
Degrees of retribution under god
Due reward
Everyone will get their due reward
Deeds have consequences
Awhoa under god
If you will only learn of your self
You will find internal and eternal wealth
And start living
And start living
And start living
When together we synchronize
Our actual weight and size
Evil will be trembling
Evil will be trembling
Evil will be trembling
Revenge is not in our plan
We only plan to rebuild a broken man
And start living
And start living
And start living
Hold up your head selassie i
I and i a chant out rasta fari
Lift up your head selassie i
I and i ah chant out rasta fari
Tell them come look ina the lion's eye
Jah run the earth, the moon and sky
Due reward
Babylon will get your due reward
Deeds have consequences under god
