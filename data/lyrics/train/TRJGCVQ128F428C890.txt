But I don't think I can wait
I've been living for this day
I think that if I do or don't
It'll turn out the same way
But I can't seem to pull myself away
And I hope that's OK
Even just the very thought
Makes me want to stay

This is more than I can take
Fear my heart may burst or break
If there's a thing as too much joy,
I will be taken away
If I wrap you up inside of me,
Kiss your fingers greedily
I will lose track of the floor
I will lose track of my feet
