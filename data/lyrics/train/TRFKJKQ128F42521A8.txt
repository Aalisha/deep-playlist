simple souls overload as i explode data banks
cuz the earth & space gave birth to this paleface

supreme -- linguistic -- mental machine
my brain cells swell - the intellects extreme

fire fills my veins as i proclaim my resistance
to the mind-swapping parasites that feed off my existence

as i -- skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land

its authentic, apocalyptic destroyer
damaging challengers -- resurrection, disorder

a monument of crisis - i strikes this - your dead
line my nest with your soul -- cleansed in bloodshed

[chorus]

BATTLE READY!
poets gonna take control

BATTLE READY
souls violate parole

BATTLE READY
violently invade your home

-- breaking the bones
OF THOSE WHO POSE
