How did I get to this place
My indecision put me in this hole
Deep down walking with the dead
No resurrection it's too late

Release me give me wings again
Release me let me live again
Release me let me fly again
Releases me so I can rise again
I can rise again
Release me

Shadows wrapped around my soul
Taken all my feelings
Now they're left out in the cold
So high that mountain I must climb
...
