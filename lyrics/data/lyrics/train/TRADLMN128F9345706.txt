I'll call you sister Carrie but I'll never say it 
Mute it to a whisper 
And spin your solar sister 
And magnet will deliver 
An arrow from her quiver 

I'll call you sister Carrie but you'll never hear it 
Fifty minutes later 
As time pulls down her fader 
And nibbles off the fakers 
Who roll under the breakers 
...
