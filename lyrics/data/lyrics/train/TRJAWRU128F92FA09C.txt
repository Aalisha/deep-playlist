Never saw it as the start.
it's more a change of heart.
rapping on the windows,
whistling down the chimney pot.
blowing off the dust in the room where i forgot

stepping through the door like a troubadour whiling just an hour away.
looking at the trees on the roadside feeling it's a holiday.
You and i should ride the coast and wind up in our favourite coats just miles away.
