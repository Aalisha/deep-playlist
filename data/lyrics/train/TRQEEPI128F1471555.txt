[Originally by Dinah Washington]

If you wanna have fun come home with me
You can stay all night and play with my TV
TV is the thing this year, this year
TV is the thing this year
Radio was great, now it's out of date
TV is the thing this year
Last night I was watching old Tom Nix
My TV broke, I was in a fix
I Got on the phone, and called my man,
Said get here daddy as fast as you can
TV is the thing this year, oh
TV is the thing this year,
Radio was great, but now it's out of date
