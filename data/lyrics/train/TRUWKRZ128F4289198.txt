Kids go out to the corner show
I took the time to see them off
I went back in to watch you sleep
They told me much these seats are cheap

And the daylight goes away so soon
I've had my fill in the afternoon
So let's take a walk downtown

That's a problem of your own
You'll find a reason to stay at home
Tonight you're on your own

There is something you want to say
I'm not asking, just sleep your nights away
