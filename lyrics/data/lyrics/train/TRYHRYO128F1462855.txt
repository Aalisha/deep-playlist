lI was lost and alone
Trying to grow, making my way down that long winding road
Had no reason, no rhyme
Like a song out of time

And there you were, standing in front of my eyes
How could I be such a fool
To let go of love and break all the rules
Girl when you walked out that door

left a hole in my heart
And now I know for sure

You're the air that I breathe
Girl you're all that I need
And I wanna thank you, lady
You're the words that I read

You're the light that I see
