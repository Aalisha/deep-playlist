Pass me the bottle or pass me the gun
Right about now I'll take either one
A land of murders and maniacs, junkies and cracks
It's a bottle of scotch then I fade to black
So I'm looking for an answer to an unknown question
But all I hear is 'Let that be a lesson'
It's better than down the road
That's what I've been told

Lookin' back I know I should have listened
Lookin' back I know I should have listened
Every day that I'm still livin'
I look back and I know I should have listened, c'mon
