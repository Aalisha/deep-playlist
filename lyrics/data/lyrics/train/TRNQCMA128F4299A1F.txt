You can't alway pick the dog you find
maybe I wasn't what you had in mind.

I can love you, I can love you, I can Love you a lot, Yeah ha.
I can love you, I can love you, I can Love you a lot, Yeah ha.

I'm here and I wonder if I'm lost
cuz I can't seem to understand the way I feel.
I'm not here to be a creep.
I'm just feeling incomplete.
Take me home.
