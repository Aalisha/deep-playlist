...
Oh the wind whistles down
The cold dark street tonight
And the people they were dancing to the music vibe

And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs they get louder
Each one better than before
And you're singing the songs

Thinking this is the life

And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?

Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singing the songs

Thinking this is the life
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
