All at sea again
And now my hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain
To bathe me again
My ship's a sail
Can you hear its tender frame
Screaming from beneath the waves

All hands on deck at dawn
Sailing to sadder shores
Your port in my heavy storms
Harbours the blackest thoughts

I'm at sea again
And now your hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain
