no more bluffin this is somethin
i feel it in my belly button
glutten for yur blushin
and yur sweet little nothins
yur discussion and yur fussin
and yur face wen yur cussin
even wen yur wrong
and no-one can tell u nothin
im adjustin to the fact
i can put my trust in
mad sex but it's more thn just lustin
no rushin we're gushin
and wen we push each others buttons
love u so it's love time
even wen were fuckin
glutton for yur stuffin and i want another grubbin
im a feen for yur lovin yur huggin and back rubbin
but every so often i feel like im stuck in
wen we don't give each other space
and push each others buttons
one cant speak straight without the other one buttin
we talk alot of xxxx but it dont mean nothin
wud say that im duckin but u know that im bluffin
listen for a minute baby let me tell u somethin

chorus
lets take it slowly
