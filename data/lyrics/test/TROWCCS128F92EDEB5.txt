Once I needed your love
But that was just one thing left on my mind
Then I needed to feel you near me
You said:"Don't have the time."

The cowboys at the rodeo
The rhine-stones on that Romeo
Your theme tune on the radio
Souvenirs that only go to

Show me, show me
Show me that your mine
Show me, show me
Give me just one sign
Show me, show me
Second that emotion
Show me, show me love
