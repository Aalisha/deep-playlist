I remember our bodies lyin' tangled in the sheets
I remember when love used to be so swee-ee-eet
Now the only thing that's mixed up
Is the way I feel insi-i-ide

We're pushin'-pullin', we're twistin'-shoutin' (shou-outing)
I never thought I'd feel this dou-oubting, dou-oubting

Oh-oh baby, I'm so-o tangled
Twisted up like a lo-over, was never ever meant to be-ee-ee
Oh-oh baby I'm so-o tangled
These riptides of emotion are drownin' me
Ta-angled
