As the night moves in
Love takes on a new meaning
If you were here
You would know what I mean to say
The circumstance leaves me only waiting
For the chance
I only want to love you more ... more
Can't you understand it
Girl you know how much I care
It's not the way I planned it no
If you could only know my feelingsYou would know how much I do believe
If you were here tonight
By my side
If you were with me now
When the lights go out
I can not pretend
This bed's too big for me
To be in alone all alone
