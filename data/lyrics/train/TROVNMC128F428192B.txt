I woke up with the power out
Not really something to shout about
Ice has covered up my parents hands
Don't have any dreams don't have any plans

I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are swingin' from the power lines
Nobody's home, so nobody minds

I woke up on the darkest night
Neighbors all were shoutin' that they found the light
(We found the light)
Shadows jumpin' all over the walls
Some of them big, some of them small

I went out into the night
