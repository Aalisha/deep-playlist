I’m gonna run, I’m gonna run
I’m gonna run to the city of refuge
I’m gonna run, I’m gonna run
I’m gonna run to the city of refuge

Peter was preachin’ the gospel
He was standing with eleven men
I’m sure you’ll wind up in heaven
If you only wanna come in

I’m gonna run, I’m gonna run
I’m gonna run to the city of refuge
I’m gonna run, I’m gonna run
I’m gonna run to the city of refuge

Peter was preachin’ the gospel
He was standing with eleven men
I’m sure you’ll wind up in heaven
If you only wanna come in

I’m gonna run, I’m gonna run
