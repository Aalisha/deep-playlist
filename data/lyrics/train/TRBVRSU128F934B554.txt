All those words you hide inside
Won't last forever but they'll come true

I'm lost in the cold where rain turns to snow
I'm losing my mind there's no highs only lows
And you see my tears freeze on my skin
Confused by the dreams and illusions inside
The memories you fear are the shades of your pride
Whatever remains, it won't be the same

You're screaming out my name
When the snow melts around me
But I can't take back those words I said
Much to my regret
...
