Oh, there's nothin' like a woman
When you're all alone
No there's nothin' like a woman
To make a man come home
She's always there to understand
The little boy inside of the man
Oh, there's nothin' like a woman
Nothin' at all.

She knows when to hold you
And when to leave you alone
She's there to console you
When everything in the world's gone wrong
She lights a candle
