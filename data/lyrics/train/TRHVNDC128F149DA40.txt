Watching, waiting playing who's who
Don't play to win to be second to you
The door will open when I suffer enough
Who will hold this hand when the going gets rough?
Such good intentions always nipped in the bud
What do you expect? Well, you never could
If I stop laughing just to be at your door

Always opinions turning you round
Always opinions turning you down

I don't play chess but I could play with you
Not much impressed not who do you do
