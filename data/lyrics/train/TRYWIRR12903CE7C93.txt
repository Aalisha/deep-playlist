Tonight I'm like a paper doll
Dress me in what you wish I had on
And I will not say a thing
I will keep smiling
I'll just keep smiling

Here I am, wordless again
You dress me up different way
Flat and thin, speechless within
You dress me up different ways
I just can't be sure I'll ever change

And I do not like the clothes I wear
I'd sooner throw them into the air
...
