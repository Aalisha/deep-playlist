Before you...

[Verse 1:]
Before you, I was empty
Nothing left, was just a shell
Before you, loneliness was all I felt

Didnt want to fall in love no more,
Was so sad I, felt so many times I hit the floor, hurt so bad
I didnt want no one to bring me down, was sick and tired
Then you came to lift me off the ground, and you take me higher

[Chorus:]
We rise, we rise in love
You and I, keep rising
We rise, we rise in love
