If it's the rough stuff ya want
You can point yer finger at me
'Cause I can dish it out good
But I don't give it away for free
There's a price for my vice
And I want it in cash
In a plain brown bag
You can put it out by the trash

[Chorus]
There'll be a red light by the window
And a blue light by the car
...
