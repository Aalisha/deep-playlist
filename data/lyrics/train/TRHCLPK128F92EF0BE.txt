You break the glass, try to hide your face
Recorded lines that just will not erase
And buried in your loss of innocence
You wonder if you'll find it again?

Was I there for the worst of all your pain?
And was I there when your blue skies ran away?
Was I there when the rains were flooding you off of your feet?
Those were my tears falling down for you, falling down for you

I'm the one that you've been looking for
I'm the one that you've been waiting for
I've had my eyes on you
Ever since you were born

I will love you after the rain falls down
I will love you after the sun goes out
I'll have my eyes on you
After the world is no more
