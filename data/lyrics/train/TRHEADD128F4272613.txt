I dont care, what they see
Dont really bother me
I dont care, what they say
Theres got to be another way

I said dream on, dreamer
Dream all through the night
Dream on, dreamer
Baby thats alright

If you wanna dream, dream
Its okay, you can dream all through the day
I said dream, dream
Its alright, you can dream all through the night
