Darling I don? t care how you wear you hair
Corn rolls, bald head, and everywhere
Darlling I don? t care that you play your guitar out of tune
And I don? t care that when you get on stage all the people boo

But you don? t trust me and that makes me cry
The sooner the better you? ll realize
Look at me baby it? s not like I? m trying to hide
But you? re the only one that I want by my side and?

It? s love, oh yeah
For us, oh yeah
Just us, oh yeah
Baby trust me
(repeat)

Darling I get over it when you forget
My birthdays, our anniversaries
And things like that
