You give me joy that's unspeakable
And I like it, And I like it
Your love for me is irresistible
I can't fight it, I can't fight it

If life is water, I was dry as Tuscon dirt
If it's a gamble, I'd already lost my shirt
If it's a journey, I was dazed without a clue
I flipped a "U" back to the first love I ever knew

CHORUS
You give me joy that's unspeakable
