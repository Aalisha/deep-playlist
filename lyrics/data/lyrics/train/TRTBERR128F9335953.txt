We'll be walking in the sun
And share our joy with everyone

If they only knew
The joy I share with you

They'd be walking in the sun
(They'd be walking in the sun)
(They'd be walking in the sun)
They'd be walking in the sun
(They'd be walking in the sun)

You will lie and walk with me
And we will share our ecstasy
Round the world
They laugh and say
...
