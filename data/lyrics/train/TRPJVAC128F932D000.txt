Throw me 'round in circles
As I run into, I crash into
I only want to run
If I'm crashing into
You as I reach to the sky and on today
It's much too high
Though the seasons change souls rearrange
And I don't want to
Push you away

Wait for me, wait for me
'Cause I need you inside my soul
Wait for me, wait for me
'Cause I want you burning inside my veins
