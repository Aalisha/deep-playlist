Can you hear my silent whisper?
Can you hear my confession?
Can you feel this rising anger?
Can you see me I'm burning inside?
'Cause evil thoughts running through my soul
I'll never stop acting my role
I will unleash my endless pain
I will unleash my fire
Come closer and take my hand!
Come with me and you will understand
'Cause evil thoughts running through my soul
I'll never stop acting my role
There are sinners and saints
There will be always treasures and waste
There will be always two ways to go
