One deceiver
Among millions of others
One look
And you lover forever
One word
And you're the one to blame
Tell me
Who could live with this shame?

Something seems to be dead here
Undergo deconstruction
The symmetry of fear
Strange lack of seduction
My sister remember

Sister...
Sister...
Sister...

Sister September
