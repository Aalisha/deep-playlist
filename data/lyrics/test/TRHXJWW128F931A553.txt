And now it seems
As if we're used to the shegree
We made our beds
And now we hate where these beds be
Took nothing at all to part this red sea
I'm a shackled child
Singing the good song of freedom
They've got no pride
They interrupt our grieving
Tear drops dropping
For the pain of the world
My best friend dies
When she was just a young girl
Left me here, to fend for myself
Now the pain never leaves
We just learn to cope
So when the devil needs hanging
Will you tie up the rope and shout pull
Let's put an end to this bull
Zen thing
How many years
Before we practice what we preach
How many tears
Before we truly clinch the peak
Only to find that
There is no honey on the moon
Official goon
With the unofficial croon

(2x)
I'm all things to all men
