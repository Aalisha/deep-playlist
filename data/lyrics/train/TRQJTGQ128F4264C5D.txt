You say your mama called and you must go
She's down in the bed and needs you so
And you don't know if you'll be coming home tonight or not
Well honey ain't your mama sick a lot?

Lately your head hurts every night
Could it be you wear your clothes too tight?
But since you don't seem to hear a single thang I say or do
Then I guess there's nothing I can do for you

This ain't my first rodeo
