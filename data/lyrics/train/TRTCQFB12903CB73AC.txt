I don't want to let you go,
but it hurts my hands to hold the rope.
I won't be such an easy mark,
You're no better than they say!

And all the candles on the cake
All set fire to the gate.
Turn the cannons towards the boat
Men were drowning in the moat!
It was the end of all the rowers oars!

If you call then I'm coming to get you.
If you call then I'm coming, now.
If you call then I'm coming to get you.
But you want to sink, so I'm gonna let you.

All I want's some earth and seed
to only grow the things I need
But first I must find my way back
And you go lay down on the track!
