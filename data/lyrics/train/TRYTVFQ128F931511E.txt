I knew I shouldn't love her
We were only seventeen
But I've always been a sucker
for long blonde hair and eyes so green
But I had to leave her
leave her in my past
It wasn't my first broken heart
I know it's probably not my last

It's just another heartache
and I don't even wonder why
It's just another woman
who's tellin' me goodbye
It's just another sad song
That I'll sing again tonight
