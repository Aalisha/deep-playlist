Once more just before I'm leaving
Torn on the platform
Once more just before I'm leaving
Torn on the platform

'Cause I'll miss you and I love you
And I know this is over just for now
'Cause I miss you, ohh, how I miss you
You're not my girl you're my town

A weekend away, leave the city today
Don't want the big smoke to leave me behind
The train leaves at 2, platform 3 Waterloo
50p to the tramp makes me feel kind

I get a good seat, with a window, my feet
Are up on the one in front; everyone stares
Why do they care, like there's feelings in chairs
Trapped for 3 hours until I get there

'Cause my
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Are not
Dry, dry, dry
...
