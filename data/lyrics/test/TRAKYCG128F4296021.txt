I guess the barstaff see this every night
They're turning tables putting candles out, careless and tired
And all dramas are unstarted
Came for the money
Stayed for the community

And now the funds are tight and now we chose our sides. we make the same mistakes our friends might
We're floating streamers down down off balconies,
Scattered arcs across the city makes a new body cold.
