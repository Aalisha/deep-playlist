Although it hurts to go away it's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (i love you) you know
I'll be thinking of you in most everything I do
Now the time is moving on and I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile

I love you (i love you) all the while
With your cute little away will you promise that you'll save
Your kisses for me save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye don't cry honey don't cry

Going to walk out this door but I'll soon be back for more
...
