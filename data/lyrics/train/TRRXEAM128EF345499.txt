Take my problems take me anyplace
Take my my mind as well
I been trying long, got nothing left
It's down to you as you can tell
And it bothers me, all of the while
And I needed more than had time

This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do
This is all I came to do

I need much more than I had before
