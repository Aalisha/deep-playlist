Let's lock the door and throw away the key now
(Shom dooby-dum dooby-dum-dum)
I can't wait to kiss you (oh no)
One little minute more

We met at a party last week
And the moment your eyes looked into mine
Right then I just forgot how to speak
And the soda started tastin' like wine

How I wished everyone would go home
So I could say when I got you alone

Come on now
Let's lock the door and throw away the key now
...
