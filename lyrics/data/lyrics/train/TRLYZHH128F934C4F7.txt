We wait for the call
To break down the wall
To fight for the end of days

We conquer the land
The bible in hand
The glory of war and praise
Are you praying for the final grace?

With power and pride
And God on our side
We follow the holy way
Stand and scream for all the world today

Raise your fist, evangelist
Raise your fist, evangelist
Ave mater dolorosa
