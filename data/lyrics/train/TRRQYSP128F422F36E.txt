It's time to cover up and
Tell me about everything
You're missing, you're wishing
You're hoping

Tell me about everything

Well, I don't feel at all the way
I think I should but I could
Probably go like this forever

Anything but the sound
When the last two hearts in town
That were ever meant
For anything are taken away

I'm so sick of being sick of you
But I've been dying for
Something new like you
...
