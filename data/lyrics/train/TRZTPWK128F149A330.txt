Lonely girl lies awake at night
silence ringing in her ears
there's a boy who is on her mind
so much promise unfulfilled
she had waited so patiently
he had nothing more to say
not a sound as she slowly walked away

lonely boy watching from the bridge
his reflection in the lake
there's a girl who seems out of reach
and a choice he has to make
lonely boy what will you become
if you let her slip away
tomorrow's pain of regret may come too late
