Trembling to its fall
Putting and end to it all
By storm, by force
With might... without remorse
We are here to conquer this world

Like cancer... our hate consumes the light of elysium
Unstoppable force of demonic supremacy
All destroying... all devouring
Heaven now ravaged... scarred and empty

Strike the death knell of the pandemonium
Imbrue one's hands in the blood of christ
Washing away all filth of righteousness
The dimming of the light
Engulfing the trinity

He raped... the culture of mankind
He raped... the pride of the ancient ways
He raped... all thought of freewill
I who will watch you fall into obscurity

Washing away all filth of righteousness
The dimming of the light
...
