Twentyfive, twentyfive days
That's too much, that's too much
Twentyfive, twentyfive days
That's to much, that's to much
Twentyfive
Till I get to see you
Twentyfive
Till I get to know
If what we just started will have conquered backpacker girls with newly braided hair and Manu Chao records
It will soon be twentyfour
Oh, oh, you're so worth waiting for
Oh, oh

Twentyfour, twentyfour days
Still too much, much too much
Twentyfour, twentyfour days
