Don't you come up to me and say you like it
It's better if you say you hate it, that's the truth exactly
When we go out dancing I don't want to be bothered

But it feels so much better now that it's done
And tonight I have to leave it
Yes, tonight I have to leave it

So, so I heard you know how to write it
