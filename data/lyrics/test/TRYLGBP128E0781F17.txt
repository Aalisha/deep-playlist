Through the satellites, I fight with you,
That local brew is spillin',
I know just how you spend your time.
I want to get my hands on him,
Somebody's party in a London flat,
You're where it's at and I know,
You want to see me loose my mind,
I'm tired of chasing after you
The residue is jealous,
See me on the dark side of your mind,
I want to get my hands on him,
To a club that's pounding in the London rain,
The world could end and we won't hear it.
I know just what's on your mind,
I see the way your face has changed,
We're no good for each other,
...
