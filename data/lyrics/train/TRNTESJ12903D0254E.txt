i always put you on a pedestal
i wanna see you all the time
dead lights surround your little innocence
with boxes never fall behind

you wanna teach me your philosophy
but life is always on your mind
you cant wake up from last nights decadence
but you always had a good time

you wanna talk about our government
but i dont think i have the time
you did you your part on the environment
but it was only in sand that i saw you draw the line

you always like to live extravagant
