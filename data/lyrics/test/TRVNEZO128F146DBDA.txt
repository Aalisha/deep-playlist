I'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby
Say my babe, she's so fine
I'm talkin' 'bout my baby, not your baby
Say my babe, she's so fine
She's right there to love me
Well people come, rain or shine

Now I love her, don't you love her, cause I love her, you hear?
I love her, don't you love her, cause I love her, you hear?
