Histories are held within your heart so let it go
Open all the doors around your eyes and let us know
Certain keys were held within your hand so let it show

Bring us closer to the flame
Bring us closer to the fire
Where's the spark within your eye
Where is the spark

Thunder in your ears until you can't hear this at all
Rivers flow in tears until your destiny's dissolved
...
