My horse is kicking dust up off the trail,
I'm just getting back from a trip to HELL.
My six gun she's stapped by my side,
Thunder is the horse that I ride.
And it seems to me this is one hell of a way,
For a man like me to earn that pay.


Chorus:
Outlaws on the loose.
Running, running from the noose.

Blue steel flashing, hot lead flying,
I wonder what they feel like when they're dying.
