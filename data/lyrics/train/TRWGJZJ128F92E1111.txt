Me and Yates an army buddy o'mine

Yates said, "Darf isch zee be-gleit-en?", they said "Ya"
And 'Darf isch zee be-gleit-en means?', 'Can we sit with you all?'

Oh we must have drunk ten quarts of German beer
My conscience and my sinuses were clear
I asked that Fraulein if she was a spy
She said, "Nein but do bis ain bissel high"
A condition not uncommon to the American soldier

Well, later on I went to be excused
When I returned I was a bit confused
Yates and his Fraulein had hit the air
Another guy was sittin' in my chair
A young soldier whom we shall get to know better
