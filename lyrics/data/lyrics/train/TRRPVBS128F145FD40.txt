Any old revolution just won't do
Let's put an end to war and start a new
Any old revolution just won't do
Let's put an end to war and start a new

Penny lane, the pipers gone, I saw the photograph
Neither you nor I can tell what Heaven knows
I told my bestest friend name, Mickey, girl
We're really living in a sicky world

I wish I had the right solution
'Cause any old revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do

Have mercy beat, he sits with his wife at the Sushi bar
Sipping sake to their heart's content, oh no
Go tell his friend the Maharishi, sheesh
Somebody blew away the sixties peace

We need a moral contribution
'Cause any old revolution won't do
A revolution, a revolution won't do
