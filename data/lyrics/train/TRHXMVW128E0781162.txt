How the curse of comfort
Has plagued your artistic life?
I hope love, love, love
Just gets in the way

Just like that
Love could always get in the way

The suburbs dream tonight
Of finding their muse
Damn those rape victim writers
And their five star reviews

Just like that
Love could always get in the way
...
