What may I ask
Is never enough
It's never too sweet
And it's never too rough

What's there to do
While you're waiting your turn
Just pick on your scabs
And watch your cigarette burn
 (No)

No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no

It's just that I act
So stupid sometimes
I forget all the rules
Of waiting in line

Don't get me wrong
Because I'm happy to be
Anything but still

Oh my, what a wonderful day
...
