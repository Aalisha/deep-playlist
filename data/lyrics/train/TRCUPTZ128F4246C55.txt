Why?
Is everything starting to crumble?
And all of my wrong was forgiven.
I ask you why?
I ask you who?
Gave you the will to recover.
When all of our love has been missing.
I ask you why?
I ask you who?

Now turn to me and explicame ya.
Just speak to me te lo pido yo.
If you live for me pues protejeme ya.
Now tell me
Did you ever ask the sky?
Not to cry no more.
To fly no more.
Did you ever ask the stars?
Not to shine no more.
