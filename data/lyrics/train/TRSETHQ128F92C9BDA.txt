Oh, Jesus we live in such a special place
What do we do to deserve this fate
How long can it it last what must be done
To keep it like heaven for our little children

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Falling in love in times of war
I'm on fire

This is for Kennedy
This is for love
This is for Tienanmen square
This is for America

Falling in love in times of war
These are the days for remembering
Kennedy King Tienanmen square
These are names worth remembering
...
