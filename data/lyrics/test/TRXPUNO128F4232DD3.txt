I've seen your face, in the frame
The cobwebs on the ceiling
I count the days and wasted years 
That left me with this feeling

I'm growing cold and tired now
I need a new, depression
Reaching blind, at anything 
Save me from the destruction 

Hope and dreams were built upon
The ground that wasn't there 
Given all there was to give
It echoes though the hall

Awaken to find the view 
...
