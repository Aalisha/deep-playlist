Landslide. Feel the ground beneath your feet start shaking.
The earth is moving. Tonight it will be gone.
You're lost upon this land. And you know the beat doesn't feel alright.
Stars will collide and will explode over you.

You're alone, the winds start to blow, it's over you.
Wondering now what's there to say when you...

What's there to love yeah?
What's there to love when you ain't alright?
It must be lonely. Sliding down.
