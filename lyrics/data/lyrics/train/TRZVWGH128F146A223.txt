Is there anyone out there
Willing to try
Or are we satisfied
With just getting by
We've hurt Mother Nature
Can't you see her she's crying
We robbed and we raped her
And taken her child
And oh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Can we find a reason?
Just think about it
And oh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Can we find a reason?
To live another season
Yeah!
We're fighting more battles
Everyday we're alive
We should be rejoicing
But instead we cry
This world's so polluted
