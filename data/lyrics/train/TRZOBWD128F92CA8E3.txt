Standin' at the door
Of the Pink Flamingo
Crying in the rain
It was a kind of so so love
And I'm gonna make sure
It doesn't happen again

You and I had to be
The standing joke of the year
You were a run around
A lost and found
And not for me I feel

Take your hands
Off me, please
I don't belong to you, you see
And take a look in my face
For the last time
I never knew you
You never knew me
Say hello, goodbye

Say hello and wave goodbye

We tried to make it work
You in a cocktail skirt
And me in a suit
But it just wasn't me
You're used to wearing less
And now your life's a mess
So insecure you seem

Well I put up with all the scenes
...
