He's packed up his boots and his riggin
Seventeen and out on his own
He'll ride em all from Portland to Texas
And dreamin of one ride in Vegas
One ride in Vegas

Lonely nights, run down motel rooms
Achin bones from yesterday's ride
It's takin more then he thought he could give it
But he's holdin on for one ride in Vegas
...
