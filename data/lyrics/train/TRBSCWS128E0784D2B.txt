Skin on Skin
Nothing more or less than
Skin on skin
I want to lick the sweat off
Skin on skin
But don't talk to me about right or wrong

Skin on skin
I want to cut in deep in
Skin on skin
I need to sink my teeth in
Skin on skin
But don't talk to me about right or wrong

Skin on skin
I want to crush your mouth
And skin on skin
I want to bruise your lips
Tell me what do you know about right or wrong

Skin on skin
I want to scratch your flesh
And skin on skin
...
