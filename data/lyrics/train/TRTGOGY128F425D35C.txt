Welcome to the beat baby, step into my room
Tell me how you feel when sinking to the mood
If you want to be the reason I can be the answer
We can stand together, baby, walk the world together

Let the rhythym take you where you want to go
Listen to the melody let it take control
If you wanna be the reason, I can be the answer
We can stand together, baby, walk the world forever

I want to feel you
I want to taste the world we've found
I want to feel you
I want to breathe you in right now

Give yourself to me, baby, listen to a song
Let the music take us as we move along
If you wanna be the reason, I can be the answer
We can stand together, baby, walk the world together
