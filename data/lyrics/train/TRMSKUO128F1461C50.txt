The only thing you ever wanted to be was a movie star
The only role you ever wanted to play is the person you are, are, are
You made a cameo appearance in the backseat of my mother's car
But I didn't know that it was to be a very small part
And it hit me kind of hard

Baby, did I mean anything to you, did I just play the fool?
In my heart I guess I always knew you had more to prove
Did I mean anything to you, how much acting did you do, tell me?
In my heart I guess I always knew
I'd never be more than one among a few

Highlights, highlights, highlights
A scene from your life
Highlights, highlights, highlights
Just a good time

Old lovers turned critics curse at you on the silver screen
You tell 'em, "I don't give a damn what you say
Long as you're talkin' 'bout me"
All the pretty girls around you cloud your sexuality
