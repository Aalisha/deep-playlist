The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a heart to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, whips like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girls dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night

It don’t need money, don’t take fame
Don’t need no credit card to ride this train
It’s strong and it’s sudden and it’s cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That’s the power of love, that’s the power of love
...
