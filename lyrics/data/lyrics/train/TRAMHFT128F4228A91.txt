Roll into your town and I’m walking around
Got some extra time think I’ll throw some money down
And you follow me around
and you’re asking for the time
Your asking what I found
think I’m gonna rob you blind

maybe it’s the tattoo on my arm
that I drew while I was bored waiting tables in new york
a heart and two flowers intertwined with a vine
I can see your point, I can see your point

And up here I am who I am
And if you don’t like it then fuck you, man
I’m not a thief and a whore
Please don’t follow me around next time I’m shopping in your store

And up here I’m making you aware
That if you don’t like me well I don’t care
I’ll be exactly who I am and if you got a problem with it
Well that’s your problem, man
...
