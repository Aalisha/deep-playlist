Any minute the sparks will fly
At that point you will see fear in their eyes
It don't take much to send them crawling back
Just a harsh word then you attack

Gather up and
Take a sigh
See them dropping, Dropping like flies
Find revenge as Sweet as pie
See them dropping, Dropping like flies

Some call them noble but I say they're scum
Put them in control see what you become
No excuses for lack of brains
You had your chance now you can't complain
...
