Wintertime is our time. The low sun flickering through railings.
Piccadilly and coffee cups. Looking through the eyes of love.
Wintertime is our time. Moonlight on snow. It's where we were born, it's home.
It's where we were born, it's home.

And now that you're finally in my arms to stay, there is no ache.
No longing, no sense of loss, when the cold air whispers all about us.
Of you of me, of us.
