Oh yeah, here we go man

This little lady down in Texas, tight tank top and a tan
Rockin' three religion bridges, drinkin' beer in a can
She was too hot to two-step, I was too dumb just to leave her alone
But I made up my mind and I felt a fever comin' on
Kinda gettin' hotter

Yeah, my knuckles turned white, my neck turned red
My one good eye rode straight back in my head
Makes a Texas tornado seem like a cool breeze
I can feel it comin' over me mad cowboy disease, oh yeah
