When you're lost and all alone
I will be your sure way home
When you're left out in the cold
I will be your shelter from the storm
When you're clouded by your doubts
When you're surrounded and there's no other way out
I will be all that you need
And I'm here for the asking
Yea

Let me be your everything
Let me be your everything
Look at all that I will bring
In exchange for what you have
Let me be your everything

When you're wandering in the darkness
I will be the light that guides you
And when death is standing at your doorway
...
