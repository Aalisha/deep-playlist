You ought to know by now
Hey!
You ought to know by now

Someone you knew before
Was fool enough to take their
Chance with you, but I know

Well I could of told you so
In spite of all I've learned, I still
Found out that woman used me

Ooh it was a long time ago

I'm still in the shadow
Of your laughter
It's common place
In this kind of life
With all the good times
That I wasted
I'm sure to find
That it comes to light

The tears you cry alone
Are so private
I know they burn don't they
Yeah!

Ooh and the shadow of your love
So warm at night I still found out
That's not the answer
