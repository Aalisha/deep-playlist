Time's gonna make you a man someday
And you won't want to go out and play with your friends
You'll just sit at home and watch News At Ten
And the pubs'll be closed and you won't have been with your friends

And he picks up the paper and appears to be quite serious
And you smile at him and agree 'cus he's your old man
But still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
You make no sense to me
Still I can't hear you (still I can't hear you)
When the time comes I'll disagree with your policy... with your policy

When you get home from work about half past six
You've been working real hard and you feel real sick with the whole world
And your dinner's in the oven and it's all dried up
And your mom don't like it 'cus you messed her up for the evening
