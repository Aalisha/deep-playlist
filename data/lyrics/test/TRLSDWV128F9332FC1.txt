Are you still talking to
All of those dead film stars
Like you used to
And are you still thinking of
All of those pretty rhymes
And perfect crimes
Like you used to.

And if you're still alive
When you're twenty five
Shall I kill you like you asked me to?
If you're still alive
When you're twenty five
Shall I kill you I know you told me to
But I really don't want to

I remember every single thing you said to me
...
