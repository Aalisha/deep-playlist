This is not a test, not a test
There can't be any secrets
Do you think that I can see you
I know it's late I need you

To open my chest, my chest
Fix whatever you need to be fixed
So long as I can hold you
Breathe in rhythm with you
It's all that I've waited for

This is payback for all of the words
That never meant enough to keep me concerned
Every homesick letter that never had the strength to find your door
...
