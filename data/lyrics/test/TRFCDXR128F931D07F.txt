Waves roll out
Out to sea
Tasting the saltwater
Tears on her cheek

Morning breaks
She's not there
Who could ever find her?
Who would even care?

No one heard
No one came
No angel of mercy
Appears to know her name

Where is hope
When words fail
All the colours running
Inside when life turns pale

In the dock the boats are harboured
Where the water's cold and still
"Oh life," she cries, "I've lost the will"
