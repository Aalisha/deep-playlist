It was once a dark lonely summer's eve,
On the lonely streets of Sunset.
When the Lord called upon six crazy MC's.
J-Dog, Charlie Scene, Johnny 3 Tears,

Da Kurlzz, and Tha Produca!

Hey, uh!
Man, you forgot the homie Funny Man c'mon!

And I can show you how to hump,
Without making love.
The way you look at me,
I can tell that you're a freak.
And I'll be laying in the sun,
Bottle and a gun.
The way you look at me,
I can tell that you're a freak.

My clothes are always retro,
Sexual like I'm hetero.
And I'll play a bitch like Nintendo,
Take her for a ride in my Benzo.
Funny as fuck I should do stand-up,
Bust caps at the crowd like I don't give a fuck.

Got a gold-ass grill,
Hit me on the sidekick if you wanna chill.
Hop in the ride let's roll,
I'm a baritone with a voice that's so low.

It'll make your speakers explode,
And I'll drop your panties to the floor.
Let me bend you over let me lay you sideways,
Hop in the bed girl, it's Freaky Friday.
If you got beef then you better step up bitch,
...
