Hey Brittany!
Why are you messing with me?
Is your boy on your mind?
Is your boy in your car?
Or are you alone?
So why does everything I say just make you upset
I'm not here to bring you down
Lift you up, lift you up

So yeah yeah yeah
Go ahead and lower it down
Lower it down, just a little bit, just a little bit
(Lower it down)

So where do we go?
Where do we go
When you just have to fight to be alone
(You cannot know, you will not know)
So where do we go?
Where do we go
