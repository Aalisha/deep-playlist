Ain't got no love to sinnin
Ain't no love recieved
Fucc explainin
Nigga believe whatcha wanna believe
You've been decived I ain't dead yet
Ash to ash, dust to dust ain't been said yet
Fucc what you read nigga can't nobody touch me
You must be a playa hater trust me
They gon be yellin fucc me
Long as the world is spinnin
But I can't let it bother me
Quickly the most wanted
That's just how it got to be
Busta's be woofin but really don't what no funk
Self incriminatin
I'm eliminatin niggas is hatin niggas
Liquidatin niggas like car lots
I'm loccin up on them bustas
Like the fool in that movie warlocc
Motha fuccas don't bow down now
The king of Sac Rap Raided is bacc in town now

(chorus)

Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally unforgivin
All the times I committed sins
Misery never ends
Havin visions on the flames my soul gonna be burnin in
Turnin in my grave cuz I can't find piece
Everybody yellin X-Raided rest in grief
Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally (eternally)
Long as the world is spinnin
Whether I'm dead or livin
It's Sac Town X-Raided eternally unforgivin

Call me murderer
Don't nobody know if it's true
