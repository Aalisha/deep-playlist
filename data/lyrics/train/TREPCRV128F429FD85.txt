It was down in Chinatown that I met the opium Queen
babyface girl from Shanghai never smile and never cry.

She now rules the underworld down in Chinatown
she runs all the opium den down in Chinatown.

Bring her your gold bring her your worries
and when life gets a bit too dreary to stand

give a ring to the Queen of Chinatown.

Go down
go down
to the Queen of Chinatown
she'll pick you up when you're feeling down.
Go down
go down
to the Queen of Chinatown
and she'll soon blow your blues away.
