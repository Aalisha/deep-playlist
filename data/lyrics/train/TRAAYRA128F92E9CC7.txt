Ain't been in Little Rock but two weeks and here I am now
Packing up and disappearing into thin air
Guys in Little Rock are cute but I can't make my heart take root
Cause bad seed won't grow just anywhere
I need lots of sunshine I need lots of raindrops I need to breathe the open air
I hope to beg your pardon your town just ain't my garden
