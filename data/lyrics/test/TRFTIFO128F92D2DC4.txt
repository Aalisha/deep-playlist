You've done it all,
You've broken every code,
And pulled the rebel to the floor.
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say.
For only metal -- what a bore!

Blue eyes, blue eyes,
How come you tell so many lies?

Come up and see me, make me smile,
Or do what you want, running wild.

There's nothing left,
All gone and run away.
Maybe you'll tarry for awhile.
It's just a test, a game for us to play.
