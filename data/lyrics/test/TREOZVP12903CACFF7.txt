Satellites blasting through the universe
It's outta sight
It's all in my head
Saw your eyes sending me a message for the last time

Here alone
Holding on to something that I've never known
It's all in my head
I've crossed the line
Theres no going back and theres no future

Tell me this isnt happening
She said she said
Said she wants to marry me
It's all in my head
Thats just not reality
It's over its over
Cause she said its all in my head
It's all in my head
...
