Put your guns up and show love
To one of the greatest niggas in the game
Tupac Shakur
This my one time tribute

You can tell by the hate in my eyes
That I'ma ride 'till the day that I die
(When we ride on my enemies)
I bet you motherfuckers die when we ride, on my enemies

Got some static with some niggas
On the other side of town
And my big brother Kev'
Yo, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' TRU niggas
Cause we cool niggas, now we do niggas
And move niggas
Am I wrong? Fools makin' songs
Tryin' to sound like us
Must we go on on that herone
In the south I trust
'Till I'm out that bus
Then they die when the sun come
Tryin' to bite lightnin' of the sky
How many cry?
Heard the industry was tryin' to finish me
Look bitch, I got your drink
It ain't no motherfuckin' henisey
Then i wastched them playa haters die slow
Eliminate all you bitches on my motherfuckin' stage show
Glanced at my calacos
