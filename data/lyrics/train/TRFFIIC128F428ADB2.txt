Can we forget about the things I said
When I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said
Or what you threw at me

Please tell me, please tell me why?
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, gone

It's no surprise to me
...
