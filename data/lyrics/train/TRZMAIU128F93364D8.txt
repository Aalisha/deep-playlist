Well they tell me up up high up in the sky
waitin for me when i die
between the day your born and when you die
they never seem to hear it in your cry

so its sure that the sun will shine
im gonna get my share now whats mine
and the harder they come the harder they fall one and all
oo the harder they come the harder they fall one and all
