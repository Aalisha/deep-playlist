If she'd have known
She'd have shown me
I need to taste her pain
For encouragement
If she'd have known
She'd have shown me
I need to taste her pain
For accomplishment
See, I can only take it out on you
There's no-one else I can trust
See, I can only take it out on you
There's no-one else but us around
You hide these things so well
There's no finding
You hide these things so well
There's no finding, no finding
