Come on, come on, come on
Let's get to it

With you every night
I don't know a way to tell you
We could do this right
All we have to do is try
You and I could use this time
You and I could just get out
I want to, do you want to

There's a place that I know
And I wonder if you're ready to go
And you don't have to wait
If you're ready now to go there with me

Come on, come on, come on
Let's get to it
Come on, come on, come on
Let's get to it
