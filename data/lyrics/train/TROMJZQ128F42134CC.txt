Chorus:
We keep embellishing upon the new unchartered path
Expressing what we see and how we comprehend the math
So there's enough for everyone we gotta make it last
We gotta make it last

As I embark on life's journey from the point where im at
Piece to everyone I know and who I go way back with
Every pimp, every mack
Every gangstar, the Jack
Every hustler feeding babies
Anybody pro-black
Every sister raising kids without the help of a dad
Wanting for they're children all the things that they never had
All the brothers handling businesses, I know shit's hard
Wakin up at 5 a.m. holding down 3 jobs
All my Rasta bretheren getting insight from trees
To my brothers up in college getting PHD's
Or any other degree
Even if you just reading for mental health
Feed your conscious so that your mind is free
