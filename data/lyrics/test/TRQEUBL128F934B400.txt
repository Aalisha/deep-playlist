See through cling film wraps her up tigth
Motionless sections no longer able to fight
My doting wife I tried to please her
So I hacked her up and her in the freezer
I wouldn't let her leave me so she tried to strike out
I hit her with a hammer she was dead with one swift clout
I once used ice to gently tease her
Now it surrounds her in the freezer
Put next to lollies and packets of peas
No room in my fridge cos it's full of her (Barcardi) Breezers
I've had to keep her in the freezer

A freshly sharpened knife with a shiny blade
Holding the stump of her hand pretending to wave
Popped her eyes out and craved off her nose
Kept in a bag with her little fingers and toes
