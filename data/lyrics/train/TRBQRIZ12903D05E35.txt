You're a million miles away
I know it's hard but we gotta hold on
Take it slow and we'll find a way

I'm your broken heart
And your dreams at night
I know we come alive
Sweat on you it feels so right

Feel me coming
Promise me you won't

Fade away
'Cause you're still in my head
And I want it, you need it, too
Fade away
I'm hangin' on by your plan
And I want it, you need it, too
Me and you to blame
...
