(Eric Carmen)

Don't wanna hear no more about the P.L.O.
Or the A.F.L. and the C.I.O.
Not the F.B.I. or the A.S.P.C.A.
You know I've had my fill of capitol hill
And the OPEC prices and the oil spills
I've had enough bad news to last me a year today

And I feel I'm lost in the shuffle
And I'm not gonna take it
I feel lost in the shuffle
And I'm not gonna take it no more
Oh no
No, no, no
Lost in the shuffle
Lost in the shuffle
...
