Do do do, doobie bop bop, oh do bop she don don
Doobie bop bop, oh do bop she don don
Doobie bop bop, oh do bop she don don
Doobie bop bop, oh do bop she don don

I'm living right next door to an angel
And I just found out today
I'm living right next door to an angel
And she only lives a house away

She used to be such a skinny little girl
But all of a sudden she is out of this world
I'm livin' right next door to an angel
And I'm gonna make that angel mine
