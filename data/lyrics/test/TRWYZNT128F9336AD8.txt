Did my make-up and my hair the way you like (like), like (like)
Still you seem to find something 'bout me that isn't right (right), right (right)
You called me sexy, when we first began
I'm sorry this is the way I am
I'm crazy just for giving you a chance, chance
This will never happen again

Look what you did to me, cut me so very deep
I need a doctor 'cause this is starting to burn
Try to fix it now; the bridge is to the ground
This love is over, so baby, just let it burn

When we're at the club, gonna shake it the way that turns you on (on)
