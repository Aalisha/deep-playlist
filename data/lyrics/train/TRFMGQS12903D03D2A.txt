(Randy Holden)
Peace of mind
To find is not easy
When the one you love you don't trust
When I picture the image of someone else beside her
I see a reflection of violence
And emotion of life that is used
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooohhh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooohhh
I see a reflection of violence
And emotion of life that is used.
