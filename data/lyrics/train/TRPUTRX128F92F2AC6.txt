I can? t make you turn around
I can? t take back what I did
Wouldn? t blame you if you hated me

Before you slam that open door
Throw away four good years

But I'm asking you, begging you not to leave

What if I told you I'd change
Would you still walk away?
What if I told you I loved you
Would you say that it? s too late?

What if you could feel what I feel
When I watch you slowly drift away?
