Now I ain't marching anymore
Got my head up to the wall
'Cause I can't hear you whine
Fingers and my feet are selling cheap
Just to keep you mine
You're so big, one step ahead
Said less than zero
No one's hero better left for dead
No one to blame but me for this mess
I made is what you said
Shame on me, shame on me
I believed this was so easy
No one sees you're so pleased
To put the blame on me, it's all on me
I can't stay on the tracks
Discipline is what we lack
But you ain't stopping me again
Don't know if you understand
