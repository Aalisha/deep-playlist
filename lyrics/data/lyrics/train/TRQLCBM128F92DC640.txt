Naughty boys in nasty schools
Headmasters breaking all the rules
Having fun and playing fools
Smashing up the woodwork tools

All the teachers in the pub
Passing 'round the ready rub
Trying not to think of when
The lunch time bell will ring again

Oh, what fun we had
But did it really turn out bad
All I learnt at school
Was how to bend not break the rules

Oh, what fun we had
But at the time it seemed so bad
Trying different ways
To make a difference to the days

Headmaster's had enough today
All the kids have gone away
