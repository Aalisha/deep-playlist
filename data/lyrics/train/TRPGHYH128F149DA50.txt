Open your eyes. and look inside my twisted world
Hope you realize. that I could never go on without you
Open your eyes. and see my walls come crashing down
Cover my eyes for the last time.

Tell. me. everything I need to know!
Knowing. me. I will always lose control.

Take it all away from me! (Take it all away from me!)
Only do I live today to tell you.
Smash my face again. for nothing!
And you, you're gonna get what you deserve

Open your mind. and see that there's much more to me
Hope you realize. I know my hope for life's disappearing
Open your mind. and please dont leave me here all alone
Cover my eyes for the last time.
