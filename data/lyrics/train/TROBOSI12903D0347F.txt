As I look into your eyes
I see the doubts and realist
You saw me with a friend we share
You take it as a love affair
 
You got a hold on me, a guarantee
I don't wanna lose you
But the more I'm free
The less I'd be likely to deceive you
 
Jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
(Jealousy) Is this how it's gonna be?
Jealousy
 
You may play this lovers game
Pretending that you feel no pain
Thinking that you're hurting me
But you're the casualty
 
You mean so much to me
I'm begging you to throw away
 
Your jealousy
Why are you (Jealousy) jealous of me?
