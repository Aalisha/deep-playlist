Down here it's raining, with clouds on the way,
Up there the sunbeams are shining all day.
I gotta keep on climbing,
'til I reach the top,
ain't got time to stop.
So follow me,
oh, why don't you follow me?
Oh, then, when the sun comes shining through,
and I'll look down on you,
to take my hand.
The world will greet us there,
together we can share,
the promised land.
Somewhere a rainbow is waiting for me,
somewhere a ladder to help me to see.
I gotta keep on climbing,
'til I reach the top,
ain't got time to stop.
