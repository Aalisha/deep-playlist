So you found out today
You're life's not the same
Not quite as perfect
As it was yesterday
When you were just
Getting in the groove
Now you're faced with something new
And I know it hurts
And I know you feel torn
But you never gave up
This easily before
So why do you choose today
To give it all away

Well it's not so bad y'all
Together we all fall
Just as long as we get up
We'll stand tall
We shouldn't waste another day
Thinking 'bout the things
That we forgot to say
I'm hitting back y'all
I'm kicking these four walls
Just as hard as I can
...
