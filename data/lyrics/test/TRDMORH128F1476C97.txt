yeah, yeah...
So clear.
So Clear to me...
Took so long to find out, all the things that happened all around you.
Thought you could see, eventhough it was clear to me.
Tomorrow's a new day, free from all the things that you didn't say.
Better things comin, learn to let it go sometimes.
So Clear...
Hopeful you seem.
