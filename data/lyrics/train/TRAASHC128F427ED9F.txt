Another sleepless night exhausted my brain
You got me going insane, you got me going insane
From my bed I felt the whole world shake
Un unexpected thing, un unexpected thing

It's up to you
It's up to you
Break it down for me
It's up to you

Now I see that when the egg shell cracks
There's no going back, there's no going back
I was waiting for a round of applause
But its just one lost cause after another lost cause

It's up to you
It's up to you
Break it down for me
