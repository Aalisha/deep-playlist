On the horizon i stand,
watching the fallen men,
victims of hatred, greed and desire,
in retrospect i feel no anger,
only a urge for something higher,
so many have fallen due to my ambitions,
so many have fallen in the name of narcissism,
no men are free to disagree,
without facing their mortality,
Destroy all dreams,
illusions damned in fire,
a hellish need for power,
is my dark desire,
Fresh blood streams from those who are dying,
i put an end to their misery,
