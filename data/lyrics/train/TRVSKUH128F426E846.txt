It reads like a fairytale, and that's what it was
Young man in his prime, young girl from the cross
The most perfect of strangers, and then the night closed in
And the holy ground took care of everything

Now she was a fine one, and he was a handsome man
One look was enough, and away they ran
They spent many happy hours and then the night closed in
And the holy ground took care of everything

Oh what's the use in complaining?
...
