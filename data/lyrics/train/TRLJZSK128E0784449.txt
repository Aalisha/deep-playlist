Day by day and night by night
I feel you in my mind
It happens all the time
You know the day dreams stop
My heart beats on
I can't take it any more
It's you I live for
You are in my system
You are in my system
I just want you to know that,
You are in my system
You oooohhhh you're in my system, system
Don't you, Don't you, don't you know that, babe.
I will keep on pushing, pushing, pushing
Until I get through
My main objective baby is to get to you
To turn your mind around
