You never close your eyes any more when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
Mmm, you're tryin' hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin'
Ohh that lovin' feelin'
You've lost that lovin' feelin',
Now its gone, gone, gone whoaohoh

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
Baby you've started to criticize every every every little thing that I do
It makes me just feel like crying, baby Cos baby, something beautiful's
dyin'
