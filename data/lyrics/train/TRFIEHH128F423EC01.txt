Who would break a butterfly on a wheel?
Not me, my precious child
Sweet angel, wrap me in your velvet cloak, my dear
Love's a sweet warm goddess I invited here

So many times I call your name, ooh baby, baby, please
So many times I call your name, ooh yeah
Before the night is through
Grant me one last wish
Sweet soul asylum, yeah
An everlasting kiss

Who would crush this woman underfoot?
Ooh, not me, my chosen one
(My chosen one)
Sweet angel, wrap me in your velvet cloak, my dear
