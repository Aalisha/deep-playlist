It's been fifty years behind us
But the war is still raging on
There's a killer deep inside us
Who yearns to see the dawn
All our comrades who have perished
They have met their destiny
Now the bullets that we cherish
Right now is all we need

Chorus:
We must fight for our right
We must find what you call sanctuary
It is kill or be killed
