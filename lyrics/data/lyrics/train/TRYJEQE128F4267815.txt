Baby before you
Well I was bad news
In letting me love you
I think I can get through

Oh baby before you
I was so scared
I was a train wreck waiting to happen
On the way to nowhere

And now I think it's kind of funny that you say you love me
You tell me that I'm crazy then you smile

And now I think I'll get through
The end of the world
Now I think I'll get through
Being a girl
Now I think I'll get through
Anything
Now I think I'll get through
