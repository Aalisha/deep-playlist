Subtle shift in the way she smiles
Subtle look and the whole world cries
Well, I got two heads to live today
I got two hearts to give away

To the rescue, babe
They? re coming far from here
Down among the pines
There's nothing far from here
See you some time
Since day when the weather fine
Yeah, I? ll see you some time

Gentle heart never hurt a soul
You live in trust and you learn to love
In silent darkness I hold your hand
