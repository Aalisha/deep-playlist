Wildcat Kelly, lookin' mighty pale,
Was standing by the sheriff's side;
And when that sheriff said
"I'm sending you to jail,"
Wildcat raised his head and cried:
Chorus:
Oh, give me land, lots of land
Under starry skies above
Don't fence me in
Let me ride through the wild open
Country that I love
Don't fence me in.
