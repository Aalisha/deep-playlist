Get me outta here
‘Cuz my eyes are burning
From these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don’t really care
And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place
Right now

It’s so amazing how you have so many faces
And you are not that person I thought that
I had fell so deep in love with

You changed up your makeup your DNA
I can’t recognize you’re a stranger to me
I feel so betrayed what a waste of my heart

Get me outta here
‘Cuz my eyes are burning
From these silly tears
That you brought when you show me you don’t really care
And you never loved me, someone get me outta this place
Right now
