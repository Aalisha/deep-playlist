Nothing to show beyond the fear I had
Body so warm within his perfumed bed
Sleeping alone, the shadow of a man
He will entice you too, and if he can
Nothing to show for love has never been
Nothing to show for love has never been
Nothing to show for love has never been

Nothing is handed, power is changing fast
...
