In our days we will live
Like our ghosts will live
Pitching glass at the cornfield crows
And folding clothes

Like stubborn boys across the road
We'll keep everything
Grandma's gun and the black bear claw
That took her dog

And when sister Lowery says amen
We won't hear anything
The ten-car train will take that word
...
