You knew the sun rose this mo'nin
I was layin' down on my flo'
You knew the sun rose this mo'nin
I was layin' down on my flo'
Lord!
No woman to love me
Baby, even no place to go

Baby, out a hollow log
I been drinkin' water, baby, lie here
Honey, out a hollow log
I can't be your kid-man
I can't be your kid-man, then
