It's just another Saturday Hanging out at DBA
All I came for was whisky and a bunch of pints
I have a drink or two or three And I feel like I'm on TV
'Cause some girl across the bar is giving me the evil eye
I make a move to see what's up and bump right into some dump jock
The guy gets pissed and he throws his drink right in my face
Well now he started, but I'll finish
But first I'll have another Guinness
Fighting's such a boring thing I gave it up, I always win

Ask me how I sleep at night This is how I live my life
Drinking, smoking, screwing, right!
Don't tell me how to live my life!

Another guy, another day. Why won't this guy just go away
Talk my ear off and I don't want to smell your breath
