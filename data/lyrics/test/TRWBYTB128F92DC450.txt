(Juicy J)
Now I ain't the one with the magic wa wa wand
but I can break a bitch for the cheese and funds
I don't have to use a gun or even make the hoe cum
if a nigga go to jail then a bitch make bond
while you shakin dat ass in the shake ja ja joint
I be sittin in the back rollin big bu bu blunts
let me know when you off to collect my money
If a nigga cant get it then a nigga will haul
Cause playas like me don't see nuttin funny
bitch betta have my mutherfuckin money
black eyes and bruisin up a face I den done it
to let her know these bonified pimps who run it
She make a G a night but she told me 200
but thats what I get fuckin wit a snow bunny
I told her like this ask dat nigga you be callin
police found a body that very next morning

Chorus 1 (2x)
Gator Boots and the suits is the clothes
Like a pimp
Keep the money not folded in a roll
Like a pimp
When I see you bitch you betta have my dough
Like a pimp
Reach Back
Like a pimp
Slap Da Hoe
