Baby I gotta say what's on my mind
Girl I think that it's about time
I gotta let you know
That I want a lil more
Cuz this is me
It's burning inside

No more holding back
Baby you set my soul on fire
Gotta face the fact
That I ain't never this way before

We started off as friends and everything was cool... ooo
But things started getting a lil serious between me and you
Late night phone calls
Talking til like 3 in the morn
We found ourselves caught up
In the moment
