Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin
I cant tell where yours begins
I cant tell where mine ends
Brown skin, up against my brown skin
Need some every now and then

Where are your people from?
Maybe Mississippi or an island
Apparently your skin has been kissed by the sun
You make me want a Hershey's kiss, your Licorice

Every time I see your lips
It makes me think of honey coated chocolate
Your kisses are worth more than gold to me
I'll be your almond joy, you'll be my sugar daddy

Brown skin, you know I love your brown skin
I cant tell where yours begins
I cant tell where mine ends
