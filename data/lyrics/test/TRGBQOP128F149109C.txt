lemme talk to you for a minute
i got something to say
yeah

forgive me,
i'm guilty,
i'm filthy
baby cleanse me
i'm empty,
i'm ready to change
no more lies
no more lust
fuck a slut thrust ain't worth us
girl i'm ready to change
so i'll no longer be that way
close your eyes

close both your eyes
put your hands to the sky
just surrender to me
and i'll be your lover
for always
close both your eyes
put your hands to the sky
...
