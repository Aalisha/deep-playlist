I think honesty is right, think lying is wrong
Think Willie and Haggard wrote some awful good songs
Think God rides around with the radio on
In a ragged ol' truck just like mine

I don't think it's as bad as the newspaper says
I think Vegas is rigged but then I wouldn't bet
On these theories and thoughts rollin' round in my head
'Cause they change and they turn on a dime

But I know there's a sun and at night there's a moon
I get cold in December and sunburn in June
This ol' world keeps on turnin'
Time it ain't movin', it's slow
