I cannot see the day for night
I feel the clouds closing in
I cannot put a single foot right
I don't know where to begin

They bring me down, they push me around
They kick my face into the ground
And I know this because I was there

And then there's Leni with the love in her hands
When she's around I find it hard to understand
She winds me up and down again, again and again
She might as well leave me for dead

There are times when I will need you
