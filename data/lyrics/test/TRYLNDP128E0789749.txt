Callin' out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancin' in the streets
Dancin' in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City

All we need is music, sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
There'll be swingin', swayin' and records playin'
And dancin' in the streets
...
