Fuck y'all who thought we were taking a fall you made the call, but we didn't drop the ball.
Took drastic measures time to get the look of the trade, sick of the cry baby serenade.
What you say?
Come out and pla'ay
You know that ass will sla'ay.
'Nuff respect given to the Mojo.
If you don't wanna give it, then we'll take it ho'.

Originality get off the dick and all you jealous bands keep talking shit.
Back stabbers, ain't no friend of mine.
Cross the line.
You know that ass will be mine.

F.O.D.
Four piece of doom.
F.O.D.
Four piece of doom.
F.O.D.
Four piece of doom.
F.O.D.
Four piece of doom.
