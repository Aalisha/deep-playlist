VERSE ONE

Understand this, here comes another bad gal lyric
Whose more than over pissed that there's not a true verbalist
Giving competition to this super trooper lyricist
Whose blowing up most these emcees like a terrorist

Let me catch a bit of air
I'm about to smear another emcees career
And there's no stopping me there's no flopping me
In the ranks you'll never be on top of me, I'm new hot property

I'm hot here, your not near, I'm never gona stop here
Why? Cos I got a flow that no one ain't got
I'm like a stick of dynamite, behind a mic
I'll leave your skin itching like a parasite
(jeeze)

What am I like? Oh my days
Forget Simon said, this is Shystie says
I'm mc Shystie, causing controversy
On the mic or in your face I spit my lyrics horribly

CHROUS

Step back, you better ease up now
Take it down before I roll up my sleeves right now
Uh oh uh oh, its over now
Its about to get grimey now
