Silver gnomes all in my dome and cameras can finally roam
By themselves, they've got hearts to moan
And friends of mine have got friends with coke

Oh, rabbit, rabbit, you've this habit of breaking legs and nouveau carat
And my heart has passed its final rite and it's breaking legs for dollars

These blue boards keep on creaking in my head
...
