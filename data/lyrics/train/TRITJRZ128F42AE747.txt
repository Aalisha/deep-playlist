Words and Music by Rick Nielsen
(It's rolling)
(Oh, wrong song)
(It's rolling)

Invaders of the heart
Are messin' with my mind
Invaders of the heart
Can make your heart blind
Invaders of the heart
Are drivin' me insane
Invaders of the heart
Are playin' with my brain

I can't see anymore
Now I've gotten tunnel vision
I can't be anyone
I just got no direction
I can't see anything
But I don't need glasses on
I can't think anymore
I'm just a nervous wreck
...
