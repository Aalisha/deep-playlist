Love, Love, lov love lov, In passionate heart
In passionate, In love
In passionate, In love

In love with love, in love with a passionate heart
In love with love, in love even when we're apart
In love with love, in love with a passionate heart
In love with love, in love even when we're apart

I wondered the difference of how it could last
I heard the celebration of champagne in glass
No wonder, it's no wonder whyyyy IIII'm

In love with love, in love with a passionate heart
In love with love, in love with the form of the art

We love through the fighting of everyday life
