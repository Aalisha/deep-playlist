I really don't like your point of view
I know you'll never change.
Stingin' me with your attitude
I've got the mind to walk away

I really don't like your arrogance
Or your policies
Ninety-nine percent an embarrassment 
But just one quality

I don't mind it when you [whistles]
Brings out the best in me when you [whistles]
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
When you wind up next to me

I like it when you [whistles]
Can I have some please of that [whistles]
Satisfy my needs
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
And you wind up next to me

I really don't like your skinny jeans
