When I say I'm in love you best believe
I'm in love, L U V

I always saw you, just before the dawn
When all the other kids, were just draggin' along
I couldn't believe the way it seemed to be
Rememberin' the things, you used to say to me

I bet you know I can't be wastin' time
'Cause I gotta have my fun, I gotta get some fun
I got to keep on movin', can't stop till it's all done
And never done

Well, listen when I tell ya, you got no time for fix
'Cause I just gotta make it, can't afford to miss
And there's one reason, I'm tellin' you this
I feels bad and I'm looking for a kiss
