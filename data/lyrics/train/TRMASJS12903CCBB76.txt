Do you hear them calling from beyond?

As a foulness ye shall know them
As a foulness thou knowest thyself

Freed from the shackles of morality
And long long gone is the need for science
Through the wakening of the beast within

Oh did you not rejoice?
When you felt the power... the power in your mind
No longer confined to nocturnal solitude
...
