Top down in the summer sun
The day we met was like a hit-and-run
And I still taste it on my tongue (taste it on my tongue)
The sky was burning up like fireworks
You made me want you oh so bad it hurt
But girl in case you haven't heard

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hung over
I'll love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying
Say hello to goodbye
Cause just one sip would make me sick
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hung over
I'll love you forever, but now it's over

Hot sweat and blurry eyes
...
