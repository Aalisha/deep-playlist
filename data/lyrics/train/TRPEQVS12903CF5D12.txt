Degeneration tears your blackened eyes
The final descent for the last in life
No joy in our tired lives - the torment builds inside
The sun sets forever on a world of lies

Non-divine
World of lies
Non-divine
Release me

Demonic vultures feed on your mind
Disarmed of all your pride you die
No life in our alien eyes - the blind lead the blind
The sun sets forever on the non-divine
