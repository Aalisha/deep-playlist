They told me the streets were all paved with gold
But these dirty sidewalks are gray and concrete cold
They said neon lights were a beautiful sight
But how 'bout the one blinkin' in my room all night

And where's the magic in this magic town
Where's the good life they said could be found
Where's the magic to make all my big dreams come true

I gotta find it girl before I send for you
