Who do you love?
Who do you really love?
Who do you holding on to?
Who do you dreaming of?
Who do you love?
When it's cold and it's starlight
When the streets are so big and wide
I love you
An ordinary girl
Can make the world alright
Love me all the way
Saturday night, Saturday night
Quarter to five
