I listen to your footstep when you're walking up the flop
I'd like to love you babe
But you won't give me more
You don't understand today

Came back from a Party which is to be as foretold
I am so very sure then to meet you in this door
You don't understand the way

If you will gave a little chance in order to show you
Then I can give you more than I know how to do
