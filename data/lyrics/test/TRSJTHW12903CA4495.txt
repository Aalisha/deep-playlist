Yeah, it's B5
Yeah, let's go

When you wish upon a star (When you wish up a star)
Your dreams will take you very far, yeah, yeah, yeah
When you wish upon a dream (When you wish upon a dream)
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah

Once you see you light so clear
In the sky so very dear, oh

You're a shining star, no matter who you are
Shining bright to see what you can truly be
Truly be
