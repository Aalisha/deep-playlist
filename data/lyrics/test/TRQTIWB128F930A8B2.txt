Are you convinced
Or have you drifted in
Excuse me while I search for incentives
It's all conceit
The way you love everyone you meet
Everyone

I could say there's no damage done
But all around you we're faded

What we want
And what we need
Are one and the same thing
Are one and the same thing
What we say
And what we do
It doesn't fit when all roads lead back to you

We don't fall at the first refusal
We don't fall for your fake compliments
And you don't listen when I say I'm a mess
...
