Swan song over the rooftops
Call to the kid next door
Let it be proclaimed in the wind and the rain
Gotta do that

Do you really think so
Do you really think so

Hope the light of the first world
Won't dark the light of the third world
Wash the darkness from your eyes
It's time to let your nature rise

Roses in the garden
Hummingbirds and butterflies
Flutter by
