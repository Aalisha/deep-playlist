We had a good thing going
But it couldn't last
We had a good thing going
But now it's just a thing of the past

Love took a long time growing
And then it grew bad
You've got no way of knowing
Just how much I'm missing
All the love we had

Well I know that you don't
Want me any longer, baby
But my love for you keeps
Getting stronger, baby
...
