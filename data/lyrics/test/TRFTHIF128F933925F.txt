I've had the same jeans on for four days now
I'm gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybody's dressing up I'm dressing down

Life's one big circle, and it does end
When it ends will you still be my friend?
I'm not making a fool of myself
I said, I'm not making a fool of myself

So, when you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you don't know
Oh that's just made your head spin around
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the gro-o-o-o-o-ound

I've had the same jeans on for four days now
I'm gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybody's dressing up I'm dressing down

I take my hat off to the busker man
when he's drowned all his sorrows in singing songs
