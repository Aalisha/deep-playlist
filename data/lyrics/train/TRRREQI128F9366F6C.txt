Time moves slowly while you're gone
I haven't heard your voice in quite some time
But i still see your face

I cannot erase the things you've done
And all the ways you kept me hangin on
Now you're gone
I've moved on
And i don't feel so sorry
Can't you see
I'm bleeding
But I won't bleed any more

I held on for so long, now
But I have to let you go
At the end of our broken road
I know it hurts to hear the truth
