When I need a hand to guide me I find you there
And everything you give to me is filled with love and care
You take away the memory of a thousand rainy days
With promises of summer love you chase the clouds away

Now if the sky should fill with rain
I know the sun will shine again

When I think of all the heartache that I've been through
The many mistakes I had to make to lead me here to you
All the hurt and sadness don't seem so much
...
