Never been safe to live in contrast
They're passing out muzzles with the gas masks
This one's for you and all you've done
And what we will become
When they tear out your throat
Because you're singing different notes

They call it the "new Macarthyism"
The only thing that's new
Is the name it's coming from
Just leave your opinions at the door
They're not welcome anymore
Extinguish the light in your mind so they can get some sleep

Less is never more
Hear them knocking at your door
Take one for the team
Bury what you think
Save yourself now
