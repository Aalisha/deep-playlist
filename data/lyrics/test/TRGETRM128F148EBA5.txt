Yeah, yo this another Big Big Kid
Exclusive right here baby, Beatster Music
I’m gone slow it down foe the ladies right here
All you gotta do is wait a while
Let’s wait a while before it's too late
Let's wait a while our love would be great
Let’s wait a while before we go too far
We can slow it down wait around for a minute
And pick dis hang back up so we can get wit it
You know I’m feeling you gurl but I'm just sensing
That ya wanna get wit me and now I’m feeling tension
We can hit the mall sometimes throw me them digits
So we can floss a little ride wit me in my Bentley
Coordinated clothes true religion true religion
Then hit up the Hampton's and spend a they in Venice
But we can do dis all just as soon as I finish
I know you don’t like dis but gurl this is the business
