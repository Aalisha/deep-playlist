Landslide of love
Tonight to stars are shining
But inside I feel I'm dying
And there's no whisper in the wind
In my room I'm all alone
Waiting on the telephone
But I know it ain't gonna ring
That ain't the way it's meant to be
Every hour so long and empty
But I know that it ain't everything
Landslide of love you thrill me
Landslide of love you could kill me
Landslide you hit me from above
...
