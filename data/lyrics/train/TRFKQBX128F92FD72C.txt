I, I have this need
I need to see you bleed
I need to taste your brain
Oh god it drives me insane

Come, come over here my dear
Theres nothing for you to fear
I need a little piece of your head
So you too can be among the living dead

You know I need it
You know I feel it
You know I want it
Some fresh blood and flesh

Please forgive for me wrong
