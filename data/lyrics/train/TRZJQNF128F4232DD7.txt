Frozen from the sunlight
And burning from the cold
Reciting contradictions
On this dead-end road
He tries to keep his balance
Tries to not look scared
While sinking in ambitions
As everybody stares

Words twist too often
I'm dizzy from the ride
Spare the next moment
It's a wonder I'm alive

Can't you see
I'm trapped in shame
And I'm the only one to blame 
Can't you see
There's nowhere to turn
And I'm the only one to blame
