Holy was the preacher
Riding on his rig of steel in the rising sun
This was no grim reaper, but a man with a
Smile who took a pride in a job well done
Oh in a bloodred sunrise
He's preaching conversion, as you lay down and die
Die, die, die'

Just a God given holy roller
In a God forsaken land
He didn't choose this killing ground
He didn't want this scrap of land
He's gonna scorch the earth, yeah
And make the rivers run dry
Until we learn to hate like him
Oh kill for killing, live to die

Ride on you son of a gun, ride on, ride into the setting sun
Ride on you son of a gun, yeah
Ride on you son of a gun, ride on, ride into the setting sun
