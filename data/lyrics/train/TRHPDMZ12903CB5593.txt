Thinking back when we first met
I remember what You said
You said You'd never leave me
But I let go of your hand
Build my castles in the sand
But now I'm reaching out again
And I'm not letting go 'till you...

Hold me, Mold me
Sometimes I feel so all alone
See, I gotta find my way Back Home
So why don't You Shape me, Make me
Wash me whiter than the snow
I gotta find my way... Back Home
...
