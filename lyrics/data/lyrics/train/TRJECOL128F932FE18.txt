New fang, no thang
Had it made to parade
Found a sucker
Now I want another

Stand up
Step aside
Open wide
Hanging out and on
Until the feelings gone

Want to?
Yes I do
Wanna learn
Taking turns
Getting carpet burns

Loose lips
Lipstick spit
Come or go
I think its both i gotta know

Sometimes you break a finger on the other hand
