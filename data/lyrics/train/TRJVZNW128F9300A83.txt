The night was clear and the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down
I was standin' on the corner
When I heard my bull dog bark
He was barkin' at the two men
Who were gamblin' in the dark

Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw a seven
Billy swore that he threw an eight

Stagger Lee told Billy
I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new stetson hat

Stagger Lee went home
