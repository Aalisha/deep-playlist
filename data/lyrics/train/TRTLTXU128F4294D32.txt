im the one
that goes to school on sunday
im the one
that burnt it down
im the one
that goes away for the holidays
spend the weekends strapped down
im the one
that sits next to you
well dressed and so polite
im the one
that the doctors always liked

i couldnt be any different
your friends are doing fine

these are the things i need
the medications making me right
im ok
