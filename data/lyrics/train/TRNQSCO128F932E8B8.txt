When she flows
(Don't try to catch a river)
No one will ever catch her
When love goes
(Don't try to catch your lover)
For love is a kind of river

River flows over rocks and walls
And I'd like to know why
She seems to be far away from the sky

When she flows
(Don't try to catch a river)
No one will ever catch her
When love goes
...
