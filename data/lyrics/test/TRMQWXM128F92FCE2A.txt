Listen to Miss Kittin and The Hacker's new direction
Driving a car or three on three
Giving you a piece of life and energy
Somewhere out in the universe, for a novel
We try to analyze feelings
Thinking about you
Friends, mountains, and party times
I wish you could see us
How we are, how we love and hate

This is what our music is about, you and us
This is what our music is about, you and us
This is what our music is about, you and us
This is what our music is about

Listen to Miss Kittin and The Hacker
Our mind is real, on a cloud
When someone's playing us in a club at night
And receive smiling on the dance floor
Trying to forget everything
We don't know you
But you are a part of ourselves
And we can look into your eyes
Wherever you are

Because this is what our music is about, you and us
