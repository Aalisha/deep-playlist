You could have kissed me like this wasn't gonna last
Kept me from sayin' something I'll never take back
You could have held me like there was no chance
Of me waking up where I am
You could have stopped short of every dream I've ever had

So help me girl, you've gone too far, it's way too late to save my heart
The way it feels each time we touch I know I've never been so loved
