Listen, it's been three months
Since I was last with you
So many people trying to
Stop me getting through

The doorman he just laughed
(He just laughed)
But I don't want no autograph
(Autograph)

Now you listen to me, baby
All I want to do
Is talk to you

You know I didn't stop you doing
Things you wanted to do
...
