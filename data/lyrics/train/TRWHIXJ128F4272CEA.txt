Angel thought he was better than man
So God shook him up and changed his plan
Broke his wing. No longer could he soar
Jumped off of cloud and... he fell to
Floor, thinking God took him to war
Not in heaven, 'cause the views he saw
Hell indeed, burning at the core of
Earth. Focus... escape this hell through
Birth. Pure vibration teleport to womb
Human form... born in June
As a man... hunger... pain consumed
Spanked on the ass, starts to cry
Welcome to life, you was born to die
Learn lessons through suffering
Progress... from struggling
Years to adjust to the vehicle he's in
...
