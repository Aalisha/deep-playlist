I'm telling you now
I'm telling you right away
I'll be saying for many a day
I'm in love with you now

I'm telling you now
I'll say what you wanna hear
I'll be telling you for many a year
I'm in love with you now

Do you think I'm foolin'
When I say, "I love you?" I love you
Maybe you'll believe me
