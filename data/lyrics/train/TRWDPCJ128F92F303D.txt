Blue sky, sunshine
What a day to take a walk in the park
Ice cream, daydream
Till the sky becomes a blanket of stars
What a day for picking daisies
And lots of red balloons
And what a day for holdin' hands
And bein' with you
Lazy day
Just right for lovin' away
Lazy day
Made for strollin' a lane
Baby you and me
(Baby you and me)
And a honey bee
'Neath a shady tree
Lazy day, lazy day
...
