Let me hold you, let me hold you
Please make up your mind
Let me touch you, let me touch you
I know, I'm not a guy
Let me kiss you, let me kiss you
Please make up your mind
Let me show you
Let me show you
I'm sure it will be fine

I wake up in the morning
What are you gonna say
If I tell you I've been sleeping
With you a mile away
I wake up in a fantasy
I wake up in my dream
But I know you don't belong to me
And I must erase the scene

Let me hold you, let me hold you
Please make up your mind
Let me touch you, let me touch you
I know, I'm not a guy
