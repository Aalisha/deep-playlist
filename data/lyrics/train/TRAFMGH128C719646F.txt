Uh yea swing
Nel my dirty Jacob
Yea come on

Now if you gonna ride
Get inside lets roll
If you runnin' yo mouth then
Shit then shut my door
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me were you the one that's on the grind

If you gonna ride
Get inside lets roll
If you runnin' yo mouth then
Shit then shut my door
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me were you the one that's on the grind
(Check it was it you that was on the grind dirty)

They actin' like they really want it with me
Trust me they don't really want it they just want to be seen
They wanna disrupt my team with these publicity schemes
Tryin' to dismantle my panel with lies rumors and scandals
But uh I pull through it like I'm tuggin' a war
I tell ya the situation like I been here before
I'm still popin' dirty still smokin' point clickin'
Watchin' the doors open

No jokin' e'rything remotin'
No chokin' or bleedin' this ride is for free
No matter what you got your dying for free
Automatically I'm focused like 35 millimeters
All of the sudden like such and such wanna meet us
All of the sudden like such and such wanna greet us
The same will you believe us
Now they all tryin' to cheat us
In real life they can't beat us
Some time they try to repeat us

Now if you gonna ride
Get inside lets roll
If you runnin' yo mouth then
Shit then shut my door
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me were you the one that's on the grind

If you gonna ride
Get inside lets roll
If you runnin' yo mouth then
Shit then shut my door
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me were you the one that's on the grind
