Someone smashed my alarm
It's got me on the edge
You know it's so sharp
(Ah)
And you know I won't go
You know I won't go
I don't wanna go
(He won't go)
The corporation's boiling over
Everybody's taking over

[Chorus]
And I'm back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh
Back in flesh

You better sign your time card now
