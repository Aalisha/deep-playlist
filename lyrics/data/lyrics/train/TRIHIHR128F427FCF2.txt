Look at you how well you´ve done so far
Look at where you're standing, who you are
And all our moments, good and bad forever in my head
wish we could go back just once and laugh at things we said

It´s been wonderful and crazy knowing you
And I hope that I can always see the teenage girl in you
And I know that you´ll be fine, but I´ll be there everytime
