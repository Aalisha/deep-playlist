Alright, yeah
Alright, yeah

I got a feeling baby it's about the time of day
So let the dramas of the week just float away
I'm at the end of the phone if you wanna play
Who's got the je ne sais quoi? We do hey, hey, hey

So do the Madonna, hey do it the Madonna way
Get into the groove, keep it pumpin', ay
I'll make you feel alright, I'm gon' pick you up tonight
You gotta turn it up to get up and go

Let's get excited, I'm so excited
I know exactly what I'm gonna do
Let's get excited, I'm so excited
I'm a detective, I'm all over you

2, 3, 4

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

We're on the floor and you're makin' me wanna take you on
No competition, but the girls are coming back strong
