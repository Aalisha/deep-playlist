Another morning with my eyes towards the Hudson
Wishing the current would carry me away
And I would kill to make it to the Atlantic
If the world would only stop for me

Another day that I can't face your blue eyes
We are falling apart and I'm scared to death
You are much worse for the wear and I'm...
Taking the blame for this

I am falling towards the coast
Let the waves crash over me
To life, to glory goes the toast
As I become the sea

Lord get me out of this city tonight
Cause you are what made me feel alive
Here I am again running away from the truth
Just know that you move me like I've never been moved
Yeah, like I've never been moved

Another night looking past you towards the Hudson
