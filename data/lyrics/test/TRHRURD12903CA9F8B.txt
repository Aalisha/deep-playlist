There was an old woman that lived in a shoe
She had so many children, she didn't know what to do
They were doin' all right, till she took 'em to town
The kids started pickin' 'em up and puttin' 'em down
Now all your children wanna rock, mama
All your children want to roll
They wanna roll, wanna rock, wanna bop till they pop
All your children want to rock
Well, we're not tryin' to live too fast
