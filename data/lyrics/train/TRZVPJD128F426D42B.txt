The world watched as you deemed justice done
Cry's of rejoice from a vengeful son
A thousand tears shed
A conscience you dread
What's going on going on?
Tell me what's in your head
Come on come on come on
Tell me now cause there's something wrong
Can't see the world through tainted glass
I sense there's trouble and it's coming fast

So many lies you sold for your fame
Now you live in a world of eternal shame
How do you sleep in your bed?
Filled with regret
What's going on going on?
Tell me what's in your head
