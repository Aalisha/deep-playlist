When I was a little girl
I had a rag doll
Only doll I've ever owned
Now I love you just the way

But only now my love has grown
And it gets stronger in every way
And it gets deeper, let me say
And it gets higher day by day
And do I love you?

My, oh my
Yeah, river deep, mountain high
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I lost you would I cry?

Oh, how I love you, baby
Baby, baby
When you were a young boy
