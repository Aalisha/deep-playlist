There's a man who lives a life of danger,
For everyone he meets, he stays a stranger
With every move he makes, a bigger chance he takes,
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow

Secret a-a-agent man,
Secret a-a-agent man,
They're giving you a number,
And they take away your name...

Beware of those pretty faces you find,
...
