It's hard to see the sun sometimes
through these eyes.
It's hard to see the truth sometimes
looking through these eyes.
But yet I try.

Windowsill world of mine.
Maybe sometime I'll get up and go outside.
Leap of faith.
I could close my eyes and jump.
The hope of someday is safer
and it doesn't hurt as much.

I stand at the edge of the world and I cry.
