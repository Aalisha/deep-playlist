Crawl out my eyes and I
Feeling the sound and I
Get my feet, get my wrists
off the ground and I
Needed to say nothing
No more to give to ya
no more to tell ya
You curl up the blood in me

I want them all an I
I want them all an I
I want them all an I
To send the sea back out
Get off the sidelines
Just put ya feet forward
Get in my eye line and
sprawl out ya chains

You got a love like semtex
Bring it to me
