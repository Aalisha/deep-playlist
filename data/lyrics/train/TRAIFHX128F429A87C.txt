This time yesterday, 
I thought I was gonna die, 
Standing at the edge, 
Of my ordinary life. 
Now I'm looking far ahead, 
I only see clear blue skies, 
I hope this feeling lasts, 
Until the end of the time. 

[Bridge]
Now I don't see the things that bring me down, like I used to (no), 
There were times I felt like giving up, but we came through 

[Chorus]
All this time, we've come a long long way, 
I waited a life time for today, 
I'm praying this moment's here to stay, 
All this time, when everyone else said I was wrong, 
You gave me a reason to be strong, 
You gave me the will to carry on, 
All this time 
...
