With out ever knowing, don't waste no time
Got a face like an angel and the devil in my eyes
Come in closer, step over the line
So I can take your soul and keep you on my dime

[chorus:]
Well you can try to get away
But boy I've got you here to stay
Cursed in love now you become my prey

SHE'S A

Rock n' Roll Sweetheart
Left your heart right on the floor
