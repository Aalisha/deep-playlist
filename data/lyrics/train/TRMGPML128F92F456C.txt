I----I pushed off the pier
Infinity run cold
And filled up my ears
There's the weapon you hold;
There's the thing that you hold it to
And the thing you hold dear.

Oh the speed of a year
It runs the wood dry
And water unclear
There's the thing you hold high;
There's the thing that you hold it to
And the thing you hold dear.

I will be an enemy to men seen in the light!
Do you think it's all right?
Yes I think it's all right!
It's all right!

If you make the waves
The sun makes the rays
The speed of the light
Can be trusted to prey
To prey on the fools
That pushed off your pier
...
