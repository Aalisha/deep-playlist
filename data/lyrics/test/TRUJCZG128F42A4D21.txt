Every night 's some million years
Since we're not together
Time is crawlin'...crawlin'
Told myself I wouldn't call
Should've known better
Cause I'm fallin'... I'm fallin'

Catch my heart before it shatters
And make me live again

If you think baby after so long
That I'm over you, baby you're so wrong
I want you back
Every time I kiss, I still kiss you
No matter who it is, I still miss you
I want you back in my life
I want you back in my life

Don't know how it's been for you
...
