Don't believe in the stories I hear 
Don't believe in the things you fear 
Give me strength 
Give me time 
Give me you now 

Don't believe in the message you tell 
Don't believe in your heaven or hell 
Give me faith 
Give me words 
Give me grace now 

I see the light right in front of my eyes 
I drive alone 
It's a cold, cold night 
...
