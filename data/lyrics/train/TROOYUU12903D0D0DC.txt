Time likes to flirt with me
He knows I'm watching as he passes
He is merciless with my lust
He won't give me the satisfaction of glancing back my way

I can't seem to get enough of the way he tastes
It's like I'm always watching him
Watching him walk away

It's true Time will never stop for me
And he might not even be there when I need him at the end
But I will stand by this man until he gives up on me
Don't give up on me
I reach for him and he pushes away
It seems just when I feel him in my hands he's tempted to release
