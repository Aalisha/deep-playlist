All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need
All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need
There's beauty in the heart of the beast
Fear behind the eyes of the thief
I know you know we're all incomplete
Let's get together and let's get some relief

All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need
All we are
All we are, we are
We are all, all we need

Stronger than a mountain of steel
...
