(Laurelyn Dossett)

Listen now children a story I'll tell
Of a woman they called Anna Lee
She had a fine son and she raised him up well
And a daughter as lovely as she

I'll return to you, dear, in the dimming of day
As the sparrow returns to her nest
I'll return to you dreaming with each lullaby
Hold your sweet weary head to my breast
