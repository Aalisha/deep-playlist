YOU'RE IN LOVE
Open the door and come in,
I´m so glad to see you my friend,
I don´t know how long it´s been
Havin' these feelings again
And now I see that you're so happy, and oohhh
It just sets me free and
I like to see us as good friends as we used to be
My love,

Chorus
You're in love
That´s the way it should be
´Cause I want you to be happy
You're in love
And I know
That you're not in love with me, oohhh
