My daddy always was a gentleman
Never the kind who ever forced his hand
He would always be the last one to raise his voice
If anybody ever put us down
Well, you can bet that he would stand his ground
And he would tell me "Son, sometimes you got no choice."

You got to kick a little
Cause a stir
Sometimes you've gotta make some noise to be heard
If anybody ever tries to hold you back
You got to kick a little
Be tough
You got to let 'em know you've had enough
