If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place.
You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it
Love has problems I know but there problems, we'll just have to face.
If you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
We're gonna walk and don't look back.
Don't look back
And don't look back
And don't look back, baby.
Don't look back

The places behind you let them re-remind you
...
