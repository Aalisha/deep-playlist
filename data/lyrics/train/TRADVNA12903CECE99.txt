I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love
I'm waiting for the plains to tumble
I'm waiting for the sky to fall
I'm waiting for the cities to crumble
I'm waiting 'til I see you crawl
I don't want to know about evil
I only want to know about love
I don't want to know one thing about evil
I only want to know about love
