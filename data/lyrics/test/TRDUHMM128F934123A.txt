Well, I never felt more like singin' the blues 
'cause I never thought that I'd ever lose 
Your love dear, why'd you do me this way 
Well, I never felt more like cryin' all night 
'cause everythin's wrong, and nothin' ain't right 
Without you, you got me singin' the blues 

The moon and stars no longer shine 
The dream is gone I thought was mine 
There's nothin' left for me to do 
...
