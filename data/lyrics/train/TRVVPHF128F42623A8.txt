conflict dont judge me
i avoid competition
cant dream up the reasons why you'd try to strip me of confidence.
i have no defense

given no motive to stab me in the back,
i've only been your friend for years and years to come
i have no defense.

is it a joke?
cause i'm not laughing
well i guess it is,
cause im still standing
my ears are ringing
lets see who keeps stabbing
...
