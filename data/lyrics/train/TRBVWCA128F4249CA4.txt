Ok, flattery will get you everywhere
We're bored and frankly we are tired of waiting
Might as well have used our talent for something

When that time comes, we'll fight bonfire crowds
Will he write your name with sparklers,
If he writes your name at all?
Oh, he'll spell your name right

Get off before the ship goes down
Get off before the ship sinks
