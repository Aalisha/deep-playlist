You been all the world
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
Your are just one fellow's girl
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you

It would hurt hurt to know
That you ever where untrue
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud girl (I'm so proud)
