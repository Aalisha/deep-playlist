There's a rockin' time on the borderline
Between sundown and up
There's an off-the-wall cantina, man
Just waitin' to tear you up
The locals know that in you go
And out con nalgas fried
Night descends, and the fun begins
Way out the other side

But, I didn't say it
Oh, no
Vincent Price said it's alright
Vincent Price said it's OK
