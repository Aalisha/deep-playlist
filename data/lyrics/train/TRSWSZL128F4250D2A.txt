We have just begun
We should feel a part of us that we're leaving
Back home
We have just begun
On the deed that's done to us

To be grown
Waiting in a line
Not thinking of the time
We must go out and find
Whatever did we leave behind?
Soon we shall look back
On the past experience I'll remember
That dream
