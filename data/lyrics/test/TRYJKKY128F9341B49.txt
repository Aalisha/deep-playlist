The world is a wonderous puzzle
everyone a piece and every piece fits
every piece is alive making energy
energy pulls the pieces together
into a round ball
and there is love
it's a round ball
and there is love

The ball jumps the ball rolls
The ball lives in the moment I am told
The ball pumps and rolls with the flow
