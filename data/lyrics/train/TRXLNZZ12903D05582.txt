Don't leave me alone, I'm waiting for this to be
The last thing that I see
Well, if I tried real good, then I probably could
Get a couple more days, but the drugs are lame

So I'm looking for you to be the very last thing I see
Before I up and fly away
I'm counting on you to help push me through
With something good to remember on my red letter days

Don't worry
I only feel the good things

So let's dine, dine, dine, my darling
...
