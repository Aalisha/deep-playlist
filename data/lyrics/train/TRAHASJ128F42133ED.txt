Down upon our souls we will ride
And it serves you right to build your kingdom in the sky
I man na lie, what a lullaby you sing to a young man so

It was just a thought in the air, like something planted in the atmosphere, my dear
Oh my suffer loss is real

Oh why, why, why must we be shackled on ya
