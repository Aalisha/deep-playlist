Kind of like a summer breeze
You do exactly as you please
Drop a brother to his knees just for fun

I think it was the first of May
And girl I can't forget the day
Right then and there I knew you were the one

Do you think that possibly
You could spend your life with me
'Cause girl this love is growing and it's hotter than the sun

I get a little bit crazy baby
Everytime you call my name
My heart beats a little bit faster
After you are in my arms again

You try to fight it, don't even try to hide it
Emotions falling down like the rain
I can't find the words to explain it
Ain't it, crazy how I fall everytime you call my name
