We've got our fingers on your pulse
And we're waiting for your hearts to speed up
Start racing with ours
It's not so hard
No, it's not too much ask for
We're just moving faster than you

This is the part where we tell you
We won't stop now
We won't slow down, no
We've come this far
This is who we are

Just ask us and we'll tell you
We knew just what we were doing
Maybe it was wrong
