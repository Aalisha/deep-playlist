Storm - descends in hellish reign, a blight upon the skies
Run - all hope is now in vain, there is only time left to die
Fire - unfolds its choking grasp, a nuclear pyre upon which to burn
Scream - a nation breathes it's last, man is now ashes and the world is his urn

The storm before the calm
A darkness without dawn
All hope and life is gone
With the storm before the calm

Burn - in throes of genocide, breath comes in fatal fumes
...
