You can leave
You'll come runnin back to me you'll see
that's how and old boy use to think
like you was supposed to do what I said do.
Now I'm tripping cause you walked away
and all I see is clouds and rainy days
only one thing I want to say
I got to be a man about it I shouldn't been treating you that way I was
wrong.

I'm wrong, wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she
won't come back to me, won't come back to me no.
I'm wrong, wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she
won't come back to me, won't come back to me no.
