I hate the way that this feels, the taste,
it's nothing new
Your words they overtake me
here I am, I'm yours I feel it deep in my skin
Your grace is poisonous Your eyes they focus in on mine
Hold me close we're sinking fast

When all we know is falling I'll save something for you
You, who are all alone (all alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Or even if it's not okay I'll say:
it's all for you, for you, for you
For you, for you, for you and only you
