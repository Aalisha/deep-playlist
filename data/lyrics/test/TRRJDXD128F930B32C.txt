(In Darkest Dreams Part II)

For Neal who found what he searched,
From one who searched and found something entirely different

I. Ante-Room
And in the REM movement, reality restores,
A harsh-edged ambiance moves in,
Kicks me out the bedroom door
Adventuring in the real world,
Of substance, time and change
Turn off the gap!
Forget the gap!

II. Time For You
[instrumental]

III. Troubled Awakenings
Where is this place that I see here?
What is is this place? From whence this fear?
This is not my world
Whose is this room that I sit in?
Whose is the light that shines so dim?
This is not my world

What am I doing here at all?
If I look down will I fall?
These thoughts cross my mind as…
I burn the midnight lamp
As I sit in my tiny room

IV. The Inanimate Object Conspiracy
Something's wrong with the inanimate!
The furniture is crowding in…
The ceiling swins on a pendulum,
Opens up onto a world that lies within
Buildings that rise up and claw at the sky,
Shatter the blue and cry out in the night
Sucking me upwards into the fright and hell of this dream
