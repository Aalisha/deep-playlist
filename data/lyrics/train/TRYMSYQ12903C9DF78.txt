[Fizzy Womack:]
From rags to riches to cash to bitches, the fun
They said we can't and it couldn't be done
If we don't get it with this rap shit, son
Then I'm a get it with my motherfuckin gun

[Verse 1:]
I put you on that shit, my nigga, Ty Nitty shit
That ice grill you wearin don't scare me, you little bitch
It's only gon' get me real amped up instead
And have me outside creepin, one up in the head
Yo rockabye baby, your time is up
Get on your knees and pray cause you gon' need God's help
Cause stuntin on Noyd, kid, that's prohibited
You think I can't get you hit, that's ridiculous
I know niggas that pull more strings than Aerosmith
That'll have you in your casket, bastard, real quick
Yo, this is real shit, I talks what I mean
And I rolls with a team who keep them things on they hip
Shit, enough talkin, y'all niggas wanna see me
You can find me in QB or anywhere up in New York, man
