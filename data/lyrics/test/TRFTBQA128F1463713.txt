Climbin' every mountain, always killing me
Count the cost as days go by
Monday I've got Friday on my mind
Why don't we make love
Instead of making plans.

Angels cry when they hear that tune
It's sleepless nights for the man in the moon

And it's the rhythm of life
My mind's made up
Lucy's sign is a Chinese dragon
