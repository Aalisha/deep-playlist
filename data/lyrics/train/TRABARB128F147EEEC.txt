Cellophane flowers never happened for me
Been sleeping the day off
Watching the night fall
Covering nowhere
Filling my time share

There's a woman in the mirror in a firey state
As she motions to me, I start turning away
She's lifting her dress up
Trying to keep up

Oh, you'd be surprised how we race
While our lives erased

Another alone on an everyday night
Thinking the morning looking for alright
Warming the blood flow
...
