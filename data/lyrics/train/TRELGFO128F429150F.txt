Thug: Hey babe, is this where the party is?
No, no, you don't know me,
but a guy told me there was a party up here, you know?

Nina: I know your face.

Thug: Yeah, well look up the fuckin' number.

Nina: So are you gonna come?

Thug: Eventually babe, eventually.

Nina: Well then you better come right now.

Thug: Right.

On Portobello Road Road we've got a nice little squat
It's a secret nightclub 'cuz we're so smart
Our landlord is Jesus Christ and Mickey Mouse
'Cuz we're the most happening green house
All the newest bands are playing
You don't have to pay to get in
I'm gonna be the host
Me, my friend and the holy ghost
The Mutoid Waste Company is on the drum
They come from another planet
And they're so much fun
