Look in the mirror
The face is familiar
But not the one I used to see
Got a fever-can't shake it
There's no way to break it
Something's got a hold on me
And I can't give it up
I won't give it up
It feels good to me
But I don't know the man
Standing in my shoes.
That's what love can do
Turn a wise man to a fool
That's what love can do to you
And I lose my head every time I see you.
That's what love can do to you
