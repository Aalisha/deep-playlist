Everybody is talking about the girl who went and killed the delivery man
But she looks so kind and gentle, it just doesn't stand to reason
I saw her right there just the other night as stately as a slot machine
But when she looked my way something mad as hell came over me

Anesthesia, Mona Lisa
I've got a little gun, here comes oblivion
I never loved you, how did you find me?
The cops will never prove complicity now
