In this moment
No one is pulling me down into the ground
In this moment
No one is pulling me down into the ground
I can't help it if I'm happy
I can't help it if I'm happy not to be sad
'Cause when you walk in the room
I see things that I can't understand
I want you endlessly
I want you endlessly
I want you endlessly
