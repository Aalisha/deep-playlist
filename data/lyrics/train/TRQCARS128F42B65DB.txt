Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometime, to brighten up your day
Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometimes, if it's only but a ray

There are days when we all feel like
We are lost in a maze, nothing's going our way
It's just one of those days
Can I get a witness, oh now

At some point we all need something
Or someone to come through with a kind word or two
Something so small can make all the difference
In the world, that's why

Everybody needs a little sunshine, in your life
Sometime, to brighten up your day
