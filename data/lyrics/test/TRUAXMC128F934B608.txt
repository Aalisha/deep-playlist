Sleep can't catch me
These deformed pictures taunting my mind
Recycling a non stop visible vortex
Snapshots creating a Polaroid past
Seeing minutes turning into hours
Nights turning back to days
The light I see is hurting me
Not going to struggle on this way
Greed was your only entertainment
Still hoping for an erased trail to find
Growing envy triggered the need for more
Leading you behind the lines
Sleep can't catch me
These deformed pictures taunting my mind
Recycling a non stop visible vortex
Snapshots creating a Polaroid past
