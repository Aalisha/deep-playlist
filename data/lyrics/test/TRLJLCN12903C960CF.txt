Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh these bitter things I find,
Should have read
That detour sign

Headed down life's crooked road, lots of things I never knowed
Because of me not knowin', I now pine
Trouble got in the trail, spent the next 5 years in jail
Should have read (should have read) that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead, detour
Paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh these bitter things I find,
Should have read
