Wish I could stay but I got to run
I got some miles to go and no destination
And like you've never seen
My light is always green

The ice is melting and the bitch ain't helping
I sink the eight-ball from the cue, before you know I'm through
With blurred validity
I can see you in me

Put in my hand
A hundred proof, I'm bad
Is this the same wine that Christ permits to dine with?
Can't part with

A light show, a shadow
