They say you're bad for me.
They say you're no good
Don't want us happy,
I say its jealousy,
They're just wishing they
Could be me

They say we'll break up,
Why don't I just wake up
I say they're full of
Envy and jealousy
They're just wishing they
Could be me

It's like I hear it everyday
How you gon dawg me out
Don't know what they're talkin bout
...
