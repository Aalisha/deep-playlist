Older chests reveal themselves
Like a crack in a wall
Starting small, and grow in time
And we all seem to need the help
Of someone else
To mend that shelf

And he found someone who understands
The ticking, and the western man's need to cry
He came back the other day
You know, some things in life may change
And some things they stay the same
