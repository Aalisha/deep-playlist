Gather your deeds and your possessions
Whatever certainty you've known
Forget your heroes
You don't really need those last few lessons
Stand in the open
The next voice you hear will be your own

Well alright, they knew how they could hurt you
And you let them cut you to the bone
But god forbid
You allow them to rid you of your virtue
