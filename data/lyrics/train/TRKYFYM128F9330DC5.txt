From empty promises to discontent and broken compromise
Now looking back I may have said I had the answers to it all

A tear is shed as boy parts girl to go their separate ways, in hopes to find another one someday

And now Ive found the secret to the broken-hearted
Take a stand and Ill guide you to the very end
