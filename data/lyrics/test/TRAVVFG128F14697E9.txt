The sun sings that he wants you all to know
What dawns behind our lunarsea
For since our very words were commandeered
We've explored the infinite circuitry.
To try and find a scheme that gave us form
It burns our curiosity.
And the answers that we sit and hope to find
Are living here inside of we.

And so we set foot on the pathway
Between the pillars of black and white
To put aside the fears and doubts that hold this old world down
And open up our hidden store of Light, within.

I saw all the stars that glimmer above me get off
their pegs, and gently flicker down.
And all the people of the world dissolve into
a sparkling dust.
