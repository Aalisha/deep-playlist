Swifty:
Huh, yeah this's just one of those days when yo' ass just wanna chill out.
And motherfuckers be all in yo' where and shit...
And that naggin bitch, it's just like to hear herself talk...
Blowin all yo' high away. Yeah, that's some fucked up shit.
But it happens, youknowimsayin?
(Yeah, yeah)

(Eminem)
Schizophrenia
How many of you got it?
How many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?
How many motherfuckers can say
They brains dryrotted from pot?
You got it like I got it or not?
If you did you would know just what I'm talking 'bout
When your tongue's rotting out from cotton mouth
When you end up becoming so dependent on weed
That you end up spending a G
In the vending machine
You got the munchies
Look at you
Junk food junkie
Potato chips and lunch meat
Up in the front seat
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
That it's got you thinking the whole world is watching ya
Or maybe you don't smoke
Maybe you just grow
But whatever your drugs, yo
Go for the gusto
Just don't
Come fuck with me when I'm doing my drugs
You see me in the club don't come fucking my high up and

(Chorus)
Blow my buzz
Do what you want to just don't
Blow my buzz
Then I'm gon' sit here and just
Roll my drugs
And if you talk I'm gonna
Fuck you up
Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

(Bizarre)
(doorbell)
Bitch let me in the house
(avon)
Naw, just came to eat your mother out
It's the big guy
Doing the butterfly to the ground
Go 'head
(Bizarre, sit your nasty ass down)
I spot this fat bitch from across the room
Now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom (ya ya)
