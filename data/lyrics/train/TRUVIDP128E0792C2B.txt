I survive

Jah Jah watch over I . . .
Evil, what you, what you sonna do? Yeh,
Jah Jah watch over I, yeh
Convicted and restricted still ...
Jah watch over I
Evil, what you, what you gonna do? Yeh
Jah Jah watch over I yeh
Physically defeated I,

I felt a stroke at the crack of dawn yeh,
And I paralyse my mind, my imagination, To my execution
To every anil of death I heard
I count the links to which I'm bound eh...
