Lost again. Somebody tell me how to get there.
'Cause I can't take another hand shake or another blank stare.
Thought I knew what I had to do to get through to you.
Guess your head is thicker than I thought.
You know I am starting to think that it might be you.
'Cause I know you've got a lot of things and people you look to.
Do you believe that I never see what you're doing to me?
I'll keep smiling till the door closes behind me.

I know where I wanna go,
But I just don't know, no I just don't know how to get there.
I know where I wanna go,
But I just don't know, no I just don't know how to get there.
