Ruben james, in my song you live again
and the phrases that i rhyme
are just the footsteps out of time
from the time when i knew you ruben james
Ruben james all the folks around madison county
cussed your name just a no
count share croppin colored man
who would steal anything he can
and they always laid the blame on ruben james
