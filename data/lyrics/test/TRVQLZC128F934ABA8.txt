Turn up the mayhem, turn up the night
Feeling so crazy, I love to fight
Time to put on your studs and leather
Time to go out into some heavy weather

Metal knights-live on
Metal knights-rock is gone
Metal knights-stand proud
Metal knights-posers will die

I prowl the streets, looking for sin
Found my steel, so I'll go to length
...
