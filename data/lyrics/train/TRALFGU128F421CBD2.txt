I've made you mad as hell
Heard you yell,
But I've never seen you cryin
It's clear to us
It's serious
We've never been this close to dyin

We've gotten way to reckless
With the love I thought we used to treasured
If we keep on like this,
We just might miss forever

Baby, we never thought to swerve
It's like we drove straight into the curve
And baby, we better hit the breaks
And take it slow
...
