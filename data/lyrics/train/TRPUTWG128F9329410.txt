Once I was happy as I could be
But I let a girl make a fool of me
And ever since she let me down
The blues come around when the sun goes down

Oh, the blues come around
Oh, the blues come around
Lord, the blues come around
Ev'ry evenin' when the sun goes down

As long as the sun is in the sky
These doggone blues never make me cry
But ever since she left this town
The blues come around when the sun goes down
