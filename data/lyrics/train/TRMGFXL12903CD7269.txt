I hear the music in the air,
I hear the music everywhere.

I hear the music in the air,
I hear the music everywhere.

I feel like praisin',
I feel like praisin',
I feel like praisin' the Lord,
I feel like praisin'.

I feel like praisin',
I feel like praisin',
I feel like praisin' the Lord.

I feel the rhythm in the air,
I feel the rhythm everywhere.
