Once… when I
Look and saw you standing by the subway line
But if you found out it was a lie
I would die to know where you lie to go
Oh! What does it mean?
Baby didn't show up on the 8: 15
And should you love another guy
I would die to know where you lie to go
To see him tonight

Try… a little luck
With a sunny smile and a witty eye
And you may find a smiling guy
And a little air between your lips and I
Oh! Try…
Almost like a baby so don't be surprise if you don't find
You can comply
When I'm on my knees looking for recipes
