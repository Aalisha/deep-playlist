But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean

And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death bell ring

By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
