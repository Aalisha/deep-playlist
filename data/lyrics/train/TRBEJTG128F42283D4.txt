Don't Stand So Close To Me
Backstreet Boys
Don't Stand So Close To Me
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking
She's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand
Don't stand so
Don't stand
So close to me
Don't stand
Don't stand so
Don't stand
So close to me
