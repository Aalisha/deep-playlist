So the ambulances came
They took your pulse and packed up your things
And the papers read
Some boys forget what the heartache brings

And the pounding in the street
Was your heart in 4/4 time
And the taste of defeat
Was never too far from your mind

And with a suitcase in her hand
I always kinda sorta wished I looked like Elvis
And in my head there's all these classic cars and outlaw cowboy bands
I always kinda sorta wished I was someone else

So gravity came
