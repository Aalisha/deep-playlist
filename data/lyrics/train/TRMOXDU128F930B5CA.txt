You're on top of the world
You're on top of the world
And you can't get any higher
You're on top of the world
You're on top of the world tonight

It wasn't easy, it was hard as hell
You didn't get luck in a wishin' well
Never worked so hard, had so much pain
Wouldn't change for anything

Learned love from a movie screen
He was tough, she was wild at fifteen
Hated school and had no dreams
Wasn't going very far

Then he got religion and she got a God
It's on her back and it's in his job
It costs lots of money, honey, oh, no
