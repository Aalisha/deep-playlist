Another face at the window
To take me away from you
To a place that I just won't go
It's always hard to remember
Was it pleasure or pain, oh well
I just don't want to know

And there's service with a smile
Don't need to see your money
But one more thing to do
And we're just about to do it to you
The turn of the screw

He was born to be angry
A fire that just burned cold
And you knew you should keep away
...
