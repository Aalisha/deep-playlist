First I was a hatchling waiting for my little bones to form, oh no
Next I was a fledging leaping from the nest despite the fall
Oh they fall, how we fall
But if I speak to you of days upon the ocean
I can speak to you of memories and dust
There won't be time for all of us,
I know there won't be time for all of us

I landed in the garden longing for the view behind the fence
Oh my god
I prayed my bones weren't brittle
For the air we float on can feel dense
Oh the weight of it aches
