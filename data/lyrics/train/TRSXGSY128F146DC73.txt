We have never seen so far as this
Distance fails my feet as our minds think

If you could look in our eyes through the walls
Igniting the fires will be hard to ignore
If you don't act now, you'll never know

I will never walk this far again
We're all so weak broken hearted here

If you could look in our eyes through the walls
Igniting the fires will be hard to ignore
