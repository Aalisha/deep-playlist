Dreams of torture bring pleasure, inflicting pain is my need
Breathing the sickest desires, to hurt the living, make them bleed
Visions of anguish and torment, control my every thought
Can't tear the eyes out of my own mind, I cannot make it stop
Strip the flesh, burn the flesh, exceed the limits of pain
...
