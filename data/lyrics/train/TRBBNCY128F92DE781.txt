ayyyyyyy
Her Love means more to me than silver and gold
And how i need her and she she may never knowww
she said she loves me but she cant take the paceee
and now I'm crying and its like puddles of rainnn


(stay stay stay stay with me) stay with me
(stay stay stay stay with me)if you are gone there is no sunshine in my world so
(stay stay stay stay with me) stay with me
(stay stay stay stay with me)cause now I'm standing on your front line yeahhhh


All that I ever want was bring joy to her soulll
And now she telling me that she thinks we grow colddd
