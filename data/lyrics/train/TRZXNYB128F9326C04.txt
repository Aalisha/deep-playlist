To know you,
Is to know the love of an angel,
Sent from above,
To save me,
From all of the heartache I've known
To hold you,
Is to hold in my arms of forgiveness,
Of a compassionate heart,
To be beating, pieces and struggles a lie

We all make mistakes
In our lives there's a way,
It is to hold onto what is right
We all get the chance in our lives,
To make right
If I've hurt you,
I am sorry,
Forgive me,
Forgive me
