I'm Gonna give you no less
Every word that I have ever said
Is it true or just what's in my head
I can say my life is in Your hands
But You're askin' me where do I stand

When they're askin' me who do I really trust

I wanna give my all and no less
I wanna live my life with no regrets
I'll listen to the call 'Cause you gave it all
So when You put me to the test
