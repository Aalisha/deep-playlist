I stole the keys to the skies
We'll leave this place for the final time
No crying words, no goodbyes
Yet tonight we're burning all the dark times

Drown all the fears that we had
These are the things that we'll never understand
This time, fight fire with fire
'Cause, baby, tonight the world belongs to you and I

This boy's in love, love
...
