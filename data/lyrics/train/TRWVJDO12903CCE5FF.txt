On
Love keep moving on
Your love is moving on
Your love just make me strong
Oh yeah.
Take this love and receive
You are all I need
I got no trick up my sleeve
Oh yeah y yeah
Take this love and receive
You are all I need
I got no trick up my sleeve
Oh yeah y yes
Thoughts of you up in my head
And every second I feel it spread
Forcing thruogh my vein vein vein vein vein
Well

Cant wait to get home to look up in your face
Cause gal you build my vibes
I'm so gald you with the i i i i i i
Well
We laugh we cry sometime we fuss
But that happen to all of us
I'm so glad you're mine mine mine mine mine
Well

Take this love and receive
You are all I need
I got no trick up my sleeve
Oh yeah y yes
Take this love and receive
You are all I need
I got no trick up my sleeve
