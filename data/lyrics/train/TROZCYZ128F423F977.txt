Matraca Berg, Jeff Hanna

Little angel, are you lonely?
Did I hear you calling?
I will be there right beside you
Before night is falling
For you I'd walk across the blazing sun
And when my time on earth is done...

I'll fly, little angel
I'll fly to get to you
I'll fly, little angel
I'll fly if you want me to
...
