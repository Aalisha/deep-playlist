Hey, yeah.
Here come the jesters, one, two, three.
It's all part of my fantasy,
I love the music and I love to see
the crowd,
Dancing in the aisles and singing out loud, yeah.

Here come the dancers one by one,
Your mamas calling but you're having fun
You'll find you're dancing on a number nine cloud
Put your hands together and sing
...
