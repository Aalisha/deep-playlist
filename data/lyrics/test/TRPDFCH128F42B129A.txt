I call ya
You ain't in
What's this cold reaction
Where you been?
Ooh baby
Layin' it on the line
If this is last call
And you say that's all you can take
It's fine

I'm sorry but
It don't make sense
You'd be a fool
If you just run out on first offense
Ooh baby play it smart
Before you go south with your big mouth
Better check your heart
