the boy only wanting to give mother something
and all of her roses had bloomed
looking at him as he came rushing in with them
knowing her roses were doomed
all she could see were some thorns buried deep
and tears that he cried as she tended his wounds

and she knew it was love
it was one she could understand
he was showing his love
and that's how he hurt his hands

he still remembers that night as a child
...
