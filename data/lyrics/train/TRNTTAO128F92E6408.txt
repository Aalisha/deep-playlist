Well, well, well, well
Seems like it was only yesterday
When my mama told me don't fall in love
With the first guy that comes your way

He was handsome and nice
But, I took her advice and passed him by
Years have passed and don't look like
Love's gonna give me a second try

Boy, the look on your face tells me you understand
Could it be your love life's like mine
