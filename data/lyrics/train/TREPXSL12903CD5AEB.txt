We hear your one hand clapping
It's music to our ears
You don't like the way we sound
We don't like the way you hear

Sorry we ain't hard enough
To piss your parents off
Hatred's not our policy
We tried that game and lost

You keep saying you're just killing time
Be careful, you're killing some of mine
I don't want it, keep it to yourself
You can't help it, so put it on a shelf

Well hate makes hate, it percolates
You're brewing up a storm
