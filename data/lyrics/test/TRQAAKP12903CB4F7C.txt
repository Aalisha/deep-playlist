My Laurie Ann, speak to me sweet and gentle
Oh Laurie Ann, say something sentimental
Now is the time, I wanna hear you say, I love you
(I love you, it's you I love)
Please understand, don't leave me cold and lonely
Oh Laurie Ann, you are my one and only
Now is the time, I wanna hear you say, I love you
For a while I had your kissin' and all at once you started missin'
Laurie Ann, Laurie Ann
