There you go again, pretending that the world is blue.
And you see red when I explain, that I don't share your point of view.
Well I say open up your eyes, for the world is like a rainbow.
And maybe blue is just the colour of the world inside of you.

-bridge-
But that kind of blue world, that's not my world
I don't want to paint your pictures,
I ain't here to sing your sorrows.
Ain't got time to be a hero,
I don't want to be your poet.
