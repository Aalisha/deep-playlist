He fell to his knees and he cried out for mercy
Heart-felt confessionals to an angry mob
But vengeance was theirs as they bellowed for justice
"Death to the man who has sinned against God."

I joined in the chant feeling so high and mighty
Pointing the finger from up on my throne
'Til I looked in his tears and I caught my reflection
And I knew that I could not cast the first stone.

Let the gavel fall slowly tho' truth's been revealed
Sequester the jury for a moment to feel
And in the courts of compassion I hope we can appeal
To the better angels of our nature, to the better angels of our nature.
