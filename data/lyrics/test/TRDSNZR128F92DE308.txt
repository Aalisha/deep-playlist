Changing stages to the love and games
Silent whispers in the falling rain
It took your heart to expose me to love
There's a look (there's a look) in your eyes (in your eyes)
And in your smile even just for a while
In the still (in the still) of the night (of the night)
I've got to show you, baby, how I feel, oh (oh)
And melt you with my love

Exposed to love, ohhh ohhh
Never felt like this love
Exposed to love, ohhh ohhh
Never felt like this love

Hear my echoes, they are not in vain
Listen to me before I go insane
