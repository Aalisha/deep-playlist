This is the anthem
You are in control of your thinking
You are responsible for your actions
You create your own limitations
You know well the situation
This world is broken

You are in control of your thinking
You are responsible for your actions
You create the limitations
You know well the situation
This world is broken

You will catch it, you will catch it
You will catch it with your head
