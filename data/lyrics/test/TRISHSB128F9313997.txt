Tell you like it is with a kiss,
Baby when it drips from your lips.
Tell you like it is it’s like this,
Don’t be such a slave to your brother.

Baby get shaky after school,
Oooh ooh there you ooh there you baby go crazy break the rules,
Oooh ooh there you ooh there you go go go go go go ohoh there you go!
