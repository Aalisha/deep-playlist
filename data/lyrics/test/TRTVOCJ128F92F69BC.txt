Guess who just got back today
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, had much to say
But man, I still think them cats are crazy
They were askin' if you were around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
