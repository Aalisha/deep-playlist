Tonight is the night it's the night of love
Forever and ever it's never enough
Tonight is the night it's the night of love
Together forever I can't get enough

Come on in mon, mu-huh

Hold me, hold me, ya squeeze me, squeeze me
Yes come and rid the lovin cause you know it's not easy
Hold me, hold me, yes nobody love me
Yes come and rid the music come receive the pardon
Yes run come give me love and come-a, give it to me
