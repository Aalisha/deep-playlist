It's so simple to look at every little thing I do wrong
It's so simple to overlook every little thing I do right, right?

I think too much
I feed too much
I'm gone too much
I skate too much
I snore too much
I'm blowin too much
I ate too much
I'm way too much too stuck up

You're probably right
This time, but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time, but I don't even care
