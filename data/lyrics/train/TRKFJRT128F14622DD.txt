A war against time, destined to lose, I'll just sit and watch TV
A magical force, hypnotic drool, I'll take in all that I can see
I'm seeing chains... now hold me down, the recline of modern man
Neatly displayed and bundled lies, an hour glass and I'm the sand

Chorus:

Generator, decimator ahhh
Universal, devastator ahhh
