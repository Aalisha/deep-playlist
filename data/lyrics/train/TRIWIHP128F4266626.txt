I'd be lyin' if I said-
I never prayed for this,
I can show you here and now,
how much love you've missed

Im happy that you're sad- I know
that sounds so wrong,
But darlin you must know
the pains gone on too loong

Come in out of the pain

let me dry your teears
hes been gone for daays
and ive loved you for yeears
