Did you ever think about running away
'cause I was thinkin' about leavin' today
We'll follow forever where our hearts wanna go
Maybe we'll end up somewhere that nobody knows our names
Then things might change for the good

I wanna be somewhere so far away
To lie under the night at the end of another good day
I can't tell you how long we'll be gone
But as long as we're together then forever is never too long
Too long, oh no
