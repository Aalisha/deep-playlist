If you try hard enough you'll see
day light at the end of all your tears.
Get loving you this way
I just can't win
Let the heart ache begin .
Can't you feel the rhythm of the music
Can't you feel it deep inside
Can't you feel the tears of emotion
coming on like a railway train
Tears are falling like rain.
There's always tears on my pillow, tears on my pillow, tears on my pillow for you.
