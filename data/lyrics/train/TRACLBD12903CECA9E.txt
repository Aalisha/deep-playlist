Reuben James In My Song You Live Again
And The Phrase That I Rhyme Are Just A Footstep Out Of Time
From The Time When I Knew You Reuben James

Reuben James, All The Folks Around Hadison County
Cussed Your Name
You're Just A No-count, Sharecropping Colored Man
You'd Steal Anything You Can
And Everybody Laid The Blame On Reuben James

Reuben James, For You Still Walk Over Fields Of My Mind
Faded Shirt, Weathered Brow, Caloused Hands Upon The Plow
Loved You Then And I Love You Now Reuben James
