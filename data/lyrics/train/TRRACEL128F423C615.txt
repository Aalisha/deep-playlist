All my pride has been confiscated
I overestimated my ability to hold out
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think
Of anything but you, babe

And it's not that I don't know your kind
Your aim is to mess up my mind
And now I know you'll succeed, yes, indeed
I go down, hang around till I crawl
Feet are small
And there's not a thing at all that I can do, babe
But I happen to love you, baby
...
