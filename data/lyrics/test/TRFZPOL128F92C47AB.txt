Just about the time the shadows call
I undress my mind and dare you to follow
Paint a portrait of my mystery
Only close my eyes and you are here with me
A nameless face to think I see
To sit and watch the waves with me till they're gone
A heart I'd swear I'd recognize is
Made out of my own devices... could I be wrong?

Time that I've taken
Pray is not wasted

Have I already tasted my piece of
One sweet love?
Sleepless nights you creep inside of me
Paint your shadows on the breath that we share
You take more than just my sanity
Take my reason not to care.
