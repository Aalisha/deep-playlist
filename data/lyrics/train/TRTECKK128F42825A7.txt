The Beginning
Thx Sonic for lyric^^
You don't know what it's like
To be there when it's over
If love was like a battlefield
Would you put me on your shoulder
But time don't mend broken hearts
And this one's getting colder
And the seasons fall apart
And I feel alone and older
I know you're alone
To leave me where I'm standing
