Here's another song the DJ's hate
Here's another song the DJ's hate
Although this time I did quite a bit

Don't pick on me, don't scream, don't shout
'Cause my myspace friends will help me out

From bad breath I won't comatose

This song is just for me

Here's another song the DJ's hate
Here's another song the DJ's hate
Although this time I did quite a bit
I put»Hey«and»Yeah«and»Fuck«in it
Here's another song the DJ's hate
Here's another song the DJ's hate
Although this time I did quite a bit
