I brought flowers to your door last ni-ight.
I done you wrong and I wanna make it ri-ight.
You say I'm not welcome here,
I know it oughta be perfectly clear.
But I can't help but wonder what it might be like...

If I had two dozen roses,
And an older bottle of wine.
If I really coulda hung the moon,
Would you change your mind?

If I could cry a little harder.
