Molly dear now did you hear
The news that's going round
Down in a corner of my heart
A love is what you've found
And every time I gaze into
your Irish eyes so blue
They seem to whisper "Darling boy, my love is all for you"

Oh, Molly, my Irish Molly, my sweet achusla dear
I'm fairly off my trolley, my Irish Molly when you are near
Springtime you know is ring time, come dear now don't be slow
Change your name, go out with game,
Begorrah wouldn't I do the same
...
