For every lovers kiss
For every child that laughs
And every moment missed
For every dream i've cast
And every flower that blooms
It keeps reminding me
That your heart is just a beatbox
For the song of your life

And for every time I fell
Every time you picked me up
And when I wasnâ€™t well
You gave me the healing cup
Just like a magic spell
It captivates my soul
That your heart is just a beatbox
For the song of your life
