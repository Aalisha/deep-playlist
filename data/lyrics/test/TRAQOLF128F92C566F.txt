The secret dream has been drugged,
It's fallen asleep.
I can't wake up.
The slightest twitch in your eye cuts off the blood
To my good side.

If I were a wreck,
Would you stand back and watch me crash?
If I was upset,
Would you know how to make it last?
I know I'm a wreck,
But I think you can understand.

Oh, who the fuck are you to say
That the dream is washed away.
