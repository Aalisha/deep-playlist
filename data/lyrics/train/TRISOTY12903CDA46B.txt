No telling how this came to be
You ending up here when you didn't agree
But now that you're gone, when people fall wrong
You'll be the one who's missing the fun

No turning back to what you do
You'll float in the air and you'll savor the view
And when you get down, just look all around
It's all or none in what's to come
