Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, for your love

I would do anythin', I would say anythin'
I would try anythin' for your love
I would run anywhere, I would go anywhere
I would walk anywhere for your love

Oh, girl, I've probably said some corny lines
That I know you've heard a thousand times
I would do anythin' and everythin'
To respect our love with you, I don't care but I gotta do

A thousand armies couldn't stop me, no
'Cause there ain't nothin' impossible
There ain't nothin', nothin', nothin' impossible
For your love, your love

No matter what people say
No matter how far you stay
...
