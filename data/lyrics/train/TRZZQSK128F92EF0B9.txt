A little one that's full of innocence
He doesn't know that something's out of place
Another one dreams murder all night
He's been living full of hatred all his life

Well, I guess it's always been this way
A world that's full of love and hate
Oh God, but will it stay this way?
So much love, so much hate

It goes on and on and on
Around and again
It goes on and on, and on
Around and again

A mother is willing to give her life
While another one throws away her child
A son stands and he turns the other cheek
While another one spits in a face while it bleeds

Well, I guess it's always been this way
A world that's full of love and hate
