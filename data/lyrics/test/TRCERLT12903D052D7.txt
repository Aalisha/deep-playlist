You would look a little better, don't you know?
If you just wore less make-up
But it's hard to realize when you're sky high
Fighting off the spaceships

And so you're drinking in your room to make it all go
It didn't end too soon, you've got the next one
You're holding on too long, you've gotta let go
Your other love is gone and you know

It's too late, it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same
It's too late, it's too late
You've got another one coming and it's gonna be the same

I tried to find a quiet place that we could go
