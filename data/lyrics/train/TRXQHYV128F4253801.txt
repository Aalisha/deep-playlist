They pass me when I close my eyes
Ragged lines of ragged grey
Grey their faces, grey their hands
Grey the ghosts that haunt this land
Their pain, it echoes through the hills
Through no one living ever left

This is Kolyma - a graveyard for the lost

The muffled sounds of cries and moans
Od swearing, shooting and commands
They all disappeared in this big land
Where summer's harsh and winter kills
...
