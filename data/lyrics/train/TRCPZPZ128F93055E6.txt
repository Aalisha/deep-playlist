Saw a story on the local news last night
'Bout one more struggling single mother
She was talking about how hard it is getting by
With no help, no money, no nothing from the baby's father

Made me think about this guy I know with a wife and a child
Who's working two jobs just to get by
Yeah, he says he'd do anything he could in this world
Just to give his young family a better life, yeah, a better life

Oh! That's a man!
That's a 19-year-old, modern-day hero man

Those two young Marines over there fighting for their country
Man, they're gonna be friends forever
Well they'd both come back eventually
But as bombs and destiny would have it
They don't come back together
