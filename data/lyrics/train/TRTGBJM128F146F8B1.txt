"A is for action
P is for paranoid, a is for anger
Out here in the void
C is for countdown
O is for over
LYPSE are for your lips smashed on mine when the world blows up

Hang hang hang on
Where do they go?
Save your souls now
Got to stay strong
Hang hang hang on
Hanging on hanging on

O is for order
V is for villains in the three-piece suits defining the borders
E is for empire
R is for revenue
N is for not for me but was
