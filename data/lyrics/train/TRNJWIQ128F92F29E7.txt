I'm alone above the atmosphere
And no one looking up can find me here
'Cause I can close my eyes and disappear
(Disappear, disappear)
When I climb the stairs to watch the sun
Above the station walls the colors run
To fill the swimming pool when I am done
(I am done, I am done)

I am the captain of an oil tanker
That travels through your veins

When the satellites hang all around
And I can finally hear the lovely sound
When all the engines in the back room die down
(Die down, die down)
All the airships move across the sky
...
