We've got land, we grow food
We bake bread, and fell wood
Spring lambs in the fields
Sweet water in our hills

And at sunrise each day
We connect, we pray
We've got faith to spare
We bond, we share

So, sit down, stop running
He's near, he's coming

And Jackie taught, Alan drove a tank
Ellie travelled, and I drank
