They say it's meant to change your life
When you fall in love
If this is what it's like
I couldn't ask for more

You put out the fire
But I'm not too vain to make a change
Even though it's not my style I try
To say goodbye
And I never ever wanted to be part of this

When I'm out with her
You know that I don't care
You know that I don't care
When I'm out with her
You know that I don't care
You know that I don't care

If you choose another
Well I won't suffer
It's true you never needed anybody, anytime
So the guilt is mine

You make everything
And I know I shouldn't care at all
