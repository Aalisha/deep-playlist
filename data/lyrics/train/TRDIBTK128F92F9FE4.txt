I reach for your arms
but i only get smiles
this has been happening
a little while
i say how i feel
but you only get riled
accusing me of being a child
Remember the laughter
the night that we met
you flashed me a look
that i cannot forget
you dared me to leave
but i haven't gone yet
we're giving both
as good as we get
You call me honey
and i call you baby
you say i'm dumb
and i say you're crazy
my memory's clear
but the details are hazy
the words come out all wrong
are we lovers or are we friends
and can we ever be both again
...
