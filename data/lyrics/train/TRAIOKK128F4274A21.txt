Ever since the day you were we born
You've been tipping the scales
On your own you try to pull them back
You always fail

Incrimination set by adding weight
You can't undo
Your few good deeds will not compare to what
You've stacked against you

Tipping the scales with your insolence
Tipping the scales with your greed
Tipping the scales with a wicked heart
