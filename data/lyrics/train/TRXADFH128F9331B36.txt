I dont do black music, I dont do white music
I make fight music for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
from a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
so I get pissed and cant pick which wrist to slit
little rich kids in cribs dont attempt this shit
so step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch
so I says to the girl I'm like what up girl
shut up girl, showed her a cut up squirrel
she screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her
slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes kissin' on a futon (yo baby) (what are you on?)
I looked at 'em both and I was like look
check this out toots I'm lookin for Cookie Puss
I need to speak to him immediately
they played my video on MTV last week
and just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some
here comes Fred Durst
Fred: yo Shady let me get someone
who knows what galaxy I came from
one where a bass drum hung from my high chair
now I'm a nightmare you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
see me and Shady I think we got it locked down
shocked by the sound I got you crusin' with your top down
these two blondes I offered them both a drink
and this you would think could get the party started
