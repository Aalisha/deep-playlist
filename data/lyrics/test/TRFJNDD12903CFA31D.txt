The brightest outlook, 
The darkest souls.
Bound together, 
So no one falls.

Still unbroken, 
Never fading, 
Down forever, 
We are the undead! 
Time can't change us, 
Out of order, 
Liberated, 
We are the undead! 

I swear on my life - (hope never to die)
We're all gonna live forever.
I swear on my life - (hope never to die)

Dead already, 
Just killing time, 
Walking corpses, 
Just fall in line.

Still unbroken, 
...
