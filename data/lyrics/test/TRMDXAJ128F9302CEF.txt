Don't think it's over When you say goodbye
You think it's easy To break a Heart
But don't forget ten thousand tears
I cry
Love's game I knew it from the Start
Love is the Name of the Game Oh stop
let me feeling this Game This love
You're a part of my Heart
Don't leave me lonely in the Heat of the Night
Oh Oh Love
is the Name of the Game
Don't stop
when you're feeling the same My love
I'm living just for you
Please, make my dreams come true
That time I've changing Boy, why can't you see
