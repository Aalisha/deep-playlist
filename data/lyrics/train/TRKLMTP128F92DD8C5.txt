Confusion, baby
(Confusion)
Confusion, baby
(Confusion)

(Confusion, baby, confusion)
Confusion, baby
(Confusion)

Heaven helped a man who is confused as I
 (Confused)
She keeps me guessin', oh me, oh my
 (Confused)

(One minute I'ma happy, next minute I'ma blue)
Confusion, baby, I don't know what to do
I don't know whether I'ma goin' or comin'
I just don't understand this woman
Confusion, baby
(Confusion)
