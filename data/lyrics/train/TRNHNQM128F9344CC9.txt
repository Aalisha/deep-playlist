Well I met her at the Trocadero, In Philly
Backstage at the Bloohound show
She said she was from Cherry Hill, Cherry Hill
Through Lips like cherries in the snow

New Jersey Girl, New Jersey Girl
Come on and Rock my world
New Jersey Girl, New Jersey Girl
I wanna Love you
New Jersey Girl, New Jersey Girl
With your crazy fucked up hair
New Jersey Girl, New Jersey Girl
Your wicked awesome

No she didn't talk to Charlie (our old bass player)
And she didn't go off with Steve
Not the cougar, not the cougar
