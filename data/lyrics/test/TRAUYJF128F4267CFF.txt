ZERO:
I'm zero the hero and my head has
floated away in the sky dunno why
and now this space ship headin for me
i thought i was lost in the spaces
& now all these faces
and still i can't tell
if its really a spell
or exactly wot's happening to me.

LOOK OUT
WE'RE BEING INVADED
HANG ON TO YOUR HEAD
WE'RE BEING RAIDED
