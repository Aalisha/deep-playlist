Sifting through the wreckage - the empire of those killed
Sword of Damocles now fallen - brought down by totalitarian wills
Nuclear strike
Atomic might
Came crushing down
To split the ground

Crawling from the carnage - twisted, chaos breed
As it once was it shall be again - arise, archaic creed
Mankind has fell
Earth now a hell
Unspeakable things
Forgotten grotesque beings

The scourging
What for aeons slumbered is now awake
The scourging
A world that will nevermore be sane
...
