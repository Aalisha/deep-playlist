Why do we cry
When there's no more goodbyes
Don't wanna get left behind
Don't wanna be the voice inside

Suicide to think of you
But I still like the pain
The consequence of losing to you
But I still play the games

But I can see what you do to me standing over tall
And foolishly I act small
I can't explain how you've got me
Can't explain how you've trapped me
So I take what I can get whatever you give me will be the company
I keep when I run run run run from defeat
Oh oh, I wonder

Why do we cry
...
