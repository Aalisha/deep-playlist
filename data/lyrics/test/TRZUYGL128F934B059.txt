Some things burden me
These thoughts cut deep
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I see

I won't close my eyes
I won't look away
We've chased our dreams
We've had our way

Stood here so long
I've forgotten what I was even looking for
Nothing changes
It's all the same if nothing changes, changes

I thought I never needed
