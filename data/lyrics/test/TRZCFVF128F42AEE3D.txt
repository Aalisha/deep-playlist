My tears are fallin'
'cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say

Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do

Aww, take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
...
