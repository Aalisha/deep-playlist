Take this banner, hang it upside down
This country's in distress
From the schools to the factories on the dead edge of town
This dream's a fucking a mess

This dream is fucked
Here we go

Our sisters' and mothers' rights to choose
Powers determined to fake the news
This poison undertow
The bigot's power grows

And we put our will to sleep
In the radiation of
Rioting pictures
We let them jail and murder our sisters

Break out!

Up on the hill, where the road is red
If you look close enough
Down in the valley, we're the living dead
While our hands are cracked and rough

For every deception that the papers print
To fortify their lie
...
