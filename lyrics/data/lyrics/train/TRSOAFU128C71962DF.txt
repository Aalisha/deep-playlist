If I close my eyes 
I can almost hear my mother 
Callin', "Neil, go find your brother 
Daddy's home, and it's time for supper 
Hurry on" 
And I see two boys 
Racin' up two flights of staircase 
Squirmin' into Papa's embrace 
And his whiskers warm on their face 
Where's it gone

Two floors above the butcher 
First door on the right 
Life filled to the brim 
As I stood by my window 
And I looked out of those 
Brooklyn Roads
