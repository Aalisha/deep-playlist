I got the message long before you said you knew
There was no chance of us at all
With no velocity, an empty headed heart and far too long
I spent two years alone with you
Just when I thought I had forgotten
You came back soft without a sound

You said we were an accident
With accidents you'll never know, what could have been
So we were an accident
You'll always be my favorite one

You hit the road and left me an ocean
I can't swim in the silence of your skin, skin, please let me in
