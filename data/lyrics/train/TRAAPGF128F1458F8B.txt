This is not a love song

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
Not a love song

This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
Not a love song
This is not a love song

Happy to have and not to have not
Big business is very wise
I'm crossing over into e-enterprize

Not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
This is not a love song
Not a love song, I know
