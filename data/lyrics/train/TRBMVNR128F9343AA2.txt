A look of discontentement fills your hazel eyes
As I ask for the millionth time what's goin' on?
You seem to be confused about just where you stand with me tonight
As we tear apart all that wasn't lost to another fight

And so we turn against each other once again
You run and I go hide
Talkin' to myself again 'bout all the things I should've said
And I wait for you
I still wait for you

I wanna know where this is going
And do we still have a chance to save what we haven't lost again
I made a promise to myself no to let this go
But now I need to see this trough
