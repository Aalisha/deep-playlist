(Kilfelt)
Guilty of a common sin
Destruction marks our path
Bloodshed of the fallen victor
Genocide befits the wrath
A reason seems so hard to find
The cause obscured by clouds
That blinds the violent hate reaction
Created by the mind
None withstanding keep Christian Resistance
All are martyred in their minds to all
Troopers of the Baptism must fight
In the name of Jesus Christ we massacre
Every action brings reaction
