Yeh
Every evening when all my day's work is through

I call my baby and ask her what schould we do?
I mention movies but she don't think with me beg.
And then she asks me why don't I come to her flat
And have some supper and let the evening pass by
By digging records beside a groovy hi-fi.
I say yeh-yeh, that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh.

My baby loves me
She gets me feelin' so fine
The way she loves me she makes me know that she's mine.
And when she kisses I feel the fire get hot
She never misses
She gives it all that she's got.
And when she asks me if ev'rything is okay
I got my answer
The only thing I can say,
I say yeh-yeh; that's what I say, I say yeh-yeh.

We'll play a melody
And turn the lights down low so none can see.
We gotta do that
We gotta do that
