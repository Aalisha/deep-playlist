[guitar solo]
I'm waiting for the day this finds you
They'll give a piece so heavy you wont know what to do
What comes around, Comes around and it's coming your way
I know it's coming, you'll hear the victims say
Please tell me, how could you?
Please tell me, 'cause I'm dying to know!
Please tell me, how could you?
Please tell me, how could you take it away?
And go with your life
How can you live with the blood on your hands?
I'm waiting for the day when you open your eyes
And see the blood is on your hands
