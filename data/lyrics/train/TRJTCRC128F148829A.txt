Pretty charms, pretty little charms
See how they sparkle in the sun
Ding dong ding listen to them ring
They seem to be telling everyone
That you're my-y baby
With a twist of your wrist it can be told
You're my-y baby
There it is, in fourteen ca-a-a-ra-a-at golden

Pretty charms, pretty little charms
...
