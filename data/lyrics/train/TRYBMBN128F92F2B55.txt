One track mind, focused on important shit,
Eyes on the prize, one track mind(yeah, you gotta)
One track mind (ha ha yeah)focused on important shit
Eyes on the prize (yo I gotta little story for ya)
One track mind

Yeah, now Davy works hard in the dark yard
But wants to be a rock star, drivin' fast cars,
Livin' large, getting girls like an all-star,
Filthy rich knockin' hits out the ball park
with his Les Paul Guitar and his call card.

He fell in love with the music, it was all hard,
And when you reach high sometimes you fall far.
You gotta give it all you got once the job starts,
Focus everyday, similin' when he played
His finger prints took a beat and almost fade away.

His family didn't know, or couldn't understand,
They thought he'd snap out of this like a rubber band,
But we know he seems (gone) got his first taste
A couple show dates always coming home late
At the break of (dawn) his girls sleepin'
Barely ever see him cause he's gigin' on the weekend
And when he was around it was like his mind wasn't
...
