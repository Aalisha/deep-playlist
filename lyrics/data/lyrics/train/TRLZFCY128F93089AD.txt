South China moon
What you trying to prove
Shining like a light, in the night

Put a thought in my head,
Make me worry instead
Burn a hole in my bed
Out of spite

There now I said it
I turn the light out
And now regret it (?)
Decide, decide, decide, decide it's true
And I'll come back to you
South china moon,
