I'm gonna suture up my future
I ain't jaded, I just hate it
See, I been down too long
It's kinda hard to explain
Burned and buried, all I carried

All my evil through a needle
As if pulled through the eye
What was and what will
They're all gone

Don't sweat it
Thread it to forget it
To feel like you're already gone
...
