I've been around a long time,
But still u don't know I exist
I'm the 1, the only 1,
The saviour u've been waiting 4

& I'll ride on till my time has finally come
When I finally see the dawn, & on & on

Years gone by, I've learned 2 defy
Till I get what is mine
Sing the song, I'll carry on,
The saviour u've been looking 4
