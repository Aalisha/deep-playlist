Well, give that girl my very best
Though it never made the grade
If it seems that it's just not enough to love
Then love lie down

And would you tell her
Not to talk as if I died
Though a tiny part just did
And would you tell her
I'm from a long line of survivors
And I'll be swinging with the kids

Keep your sympathy
Don't need the healing to start
You've gone
Gone and made a beautiful hole in my heart
...
