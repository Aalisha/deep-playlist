It's the Duke of Earl…
(Celebrating time)
Ah! You know who it is…
(FreeNation)

Finally

The one that takes me deeper
Soothingly
The way you walk on water
Gently
Your voice is always sweeter (sweeter)
Your voice is always sweeter
Verily-ly
Your smile is always purer
Lovely

When I met you at the alter
Truly-ly
There's no one else like you
I raise my glass to you (you, you)

Because you drink from the water
All of us
We drink from the water together
I like the way you show the ladder
(to) Higher

And because of you we gather

So thank the Lord for you
Hip Hip Hip Loke Loke Loke
Hip Hip Hip (Hey!)
