Hold me
Show me all the talent God has given you
I want us thinking outside the box (all night long)
Just keep on going

You've done good things for me
Though I'm not an easy girl to please
I'll never run out of faith in you (all night long)
Just keep on going

Long time long time
That's the way I've loved you baby
Long night it's been a long night
I'm breaking the record, told ya

Long time long time
The minutes are eternal lately
Long night it's been a long night
Can't wait to touch you, touch you
