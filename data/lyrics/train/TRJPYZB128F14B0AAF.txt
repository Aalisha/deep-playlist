walk into the sunlight so bright
illumination blocking out night
she knows that the promises are airtight
there is no doubt and you can see it in her eyes

you'll hear her singing to heaven - even
without letting out a word to be heard
in every single situation (none too big - none too small)
she looks up and the world looks on

she sings hallelujah
when all has become nothing
and her hope in the saviour
has colored all she does
and taints the way she loves
...
