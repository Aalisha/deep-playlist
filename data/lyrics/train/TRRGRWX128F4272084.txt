Okay, so I'm gonna say it
I'm not afraid to say it
The clocks on my wall keep ticking
The moments that I keep missing
Okay, so I must confess that
I've settled for so much less than
What You designed
I'm not taking my life one day at a time

[CHORUS]
'Cause life is short and quickly passing by
Father, will You help me make the most of what is mine
With eyes open wide
I'm taking You in
Making the time
Mean all that it can
I don't need a sign
I just need to begin, need to begin like this
With every second of every minute
I'm livin' in it and that's how I say it
Oh yeah, I'm gonna say it, oh yeah, yeah
That's how I say it
