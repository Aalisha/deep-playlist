You know there's always something
And really worth the wait
I wouldn't switch for nothing
There's nothing worth the change

People always try to take you for a ride
Ain't no big surprise, ain't no cause to cry
Know that you'll get by
If you're strong in your own mind

You don't have to change the way you are
I really don't think you're giving yourself a chance
I wish you could hear someone who says
Baby, don't change, baby, don't change
Do your own thing, you're beautiful the way you are

In your search for something
You didn't have to chase
You sacrificed the best things
And nearly lost your way
...
