I'm turning away, I'll face my world on a different day
Something new, anything else that doesn't remind me

I'll face it in time
But I will give in again and again
Afraid to lose, the memory of you

If I could take it back where we once stood
I will hold your hand any way I could
I could make it back to the world I knew
But it wasn't for me
It was for somebody else
Somebody else
