(Verse 1)
(Buckshot:)

I woke up in the night
grabbed my forehead
wipe my forehead with the sweat on to the bed
Deep inside thought
thinking of a way to strapped
and walk the streets without getting clapped
Just because I'm tieing the fuzz growing in my buzz
I'm doing my justice, bust this slug to the ignorant
Who said I didn't have knowledge of self
So come and feel the wrath
So listen
First of all let me explain
That when i drop a rhyme I I make it hard enough to gain
The god is heavy
I blow you up like dynamite
Into my dome I let the L ignite
Fight, I take you on flight here
The war starts here.

(BCC:)
See we murder MC's every day,
motherfuckers dont play,
straight from the Bucktown side of the block
