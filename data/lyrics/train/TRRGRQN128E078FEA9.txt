My little dreamone, you O. K.?
I'm thinking about you everyday
along with your smile, I took my belongings
along with the sunshine, I went away
There is a space here, there is a void
I need to find, a little more time gimme time
Of all of the fuckups that I do
I've saved up the best one for you
heaven and moonshine, you gotta be kidding
you wanted to give it a try and I didn't
I never wanted to be looking back
