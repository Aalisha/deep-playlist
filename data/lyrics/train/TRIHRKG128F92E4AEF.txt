born alone, i'm always trying and failing
to escape the slowly sinking feeling
i have worn like a weighted crown of thorns
can we share this burden of being born alone?
we fucking die alone
no words can change what's written in stone
so i fall, fall down to my knees
oh god save me from the hands of my fellow man
