Sitar singing on the operation
And people say they can't walk out
I remember you walking in
That's why you got this door looking lock stock

Oh, in the olden days my time
Seems to be running away
Singing up songs of the rights and wrongs
Oh, don't expect anymore from me

To all the dead people, especially out to Diego
A friend and with the criminal intention about a liaison
To all the dead people, especially out to Diego
A friend and with the criminal intention about a liaison

Take your problem to United Nations
Tell old Kofi about the situation
Tell him how you left the whole congregation
Sitting in the pews, in the pews, all alone

Have a go heroes shutting the young door locked
Sitting it down with socks?
For the breaks of the no go zero
Kicking it down, don't want to raise
Diggin' up, diggin' the ways, have a good luck
I ain't no abacus but you can count on me

To all the dead people and especially out to Diego
A friend with the criminal intention about a liaison
To all the dead people and especially out to Diego
A friend with the criminal intention about a liaison

Take your problem to United Nations
Tell old Kofi about the situation
