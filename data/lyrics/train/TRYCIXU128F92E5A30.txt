People talkin' like it's the end of time
And I look up to the heavens for a sign
Everybody's lookin' at me but I won't be deceived or afraid
'Cause I know that the Son is on the way

Yeah, sky falls down, it crumbles into the sea
The sun goes out, He's coming back for me
I'll be found at the place where the gravity leaves the ground
And I won't be comin' down now
