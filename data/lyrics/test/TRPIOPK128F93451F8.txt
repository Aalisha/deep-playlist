Should have seen those tell tale signs
I should have read between the lines
Such a fool for love and your lying eyes were
Only here to waste my time but

Ooh, you speak the language of love
(Oh, amore)
It came to nothing, push to shove

You're just a dum, dum boy, making noise
Dum, dum boy, dum, dum boy
Just a dum, dum boy with all your toys
Such a dum, dum boy, dum, dum boy

Who do you think you are?
You ain't no superstar
You're just a dum, dum boy, that's all you'll ever be
Stay away from me
