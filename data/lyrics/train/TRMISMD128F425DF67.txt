I would climb these trees and you would let me in
but I burn those bridges and the heat it all burns from within
my mind says it your arms that wrap around him
and the flow of lust is all that pulls if you're happy with him
[chorus]
When you ask me
if I'll be alright
just to pick you up from the alleyway!
And you ask me do I feel alright
can I pick you up
and its here we stay!
You open the door and I follow you in
and the shock of light is all that stops our eyes from speaking.
I kiss your lips and there's a taste so clear.
Is it true that everyone knows the taste of a kiss with a tear?
When you ask me
if I'll be alright just to pick you up from the alleyway.
