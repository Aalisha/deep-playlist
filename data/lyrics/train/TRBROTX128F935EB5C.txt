I Love the Way You Love

Peaked at # 9 in 1960


The sweet things you do to me like holding my hand
When I'm low you let me know you always understand

And, I know (I love) the way you love
You make me feel so fine
I love the way you love
Because I know you're mine, all mine

I'll never do you wrong, I'll never make-a you cry-y-y
If you stop loving me I know that I'll just die
