Construct me to your fate. But I'd agree anyway.
Guide this spear through my spine
And punch these holes in my heart
Those photos I can't bare to see
Touch the radio and I'll leave you here
Make sure to print your name
just a remembrance to the pain
There's nothing in between just a silhouette of me.
wilted as you say
another memory to keep
All these folded lines
I've seen (there's nothing in between).
scissors cut from seam to seam (another memory to keep)
All these photographs that show (there's nothing in between)
Tear me from heart to soul. show me the faces to outline.
it's hard to see from time to time.
