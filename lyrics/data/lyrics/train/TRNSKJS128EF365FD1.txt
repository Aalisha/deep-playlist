there's a knocking at my window
not two for yes, but one for no
some spirit is unsatisfied
from watching her world spin out of control
at night she goes walking around her old home
objecting to how it's all changed
she prefers her arrangements to the ones which we made
walking the ghost
walking the ghost
walkin the ghost

there's baggage on my shoulders
making me stoop, bending my frame
my neck is crooked, lopsided
I will never be tall again

at night she goes walking around her old home
you can feel so much sadness locked up in her bones
I can feel so much sadness locked up in her bones
walking the ghost
walking the ghost
...
