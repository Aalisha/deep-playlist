You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance with someone that you'd met
And telling me how sorry you were, leavin' so soon
And that you miss me sometimes, when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on, just holding on to time
...
