Formed a band, we formed a band
Look at us, we formed a band
Formed a band, we formed a band
Look at us, we formed a band

Formed a band, we formed a band
Look at us, we formed a band
Formed a band, we formed a band
Look at us, we formed a band

Honey pie, I don't know when it started
Stop buying your albums from the supermarkets
They only sell records that have charted
And Art Brut, well we've only just started

And yes, this is my singing voice
