(Johnny, you're too young)
But I'm gonna get married
(You're so young)
My name she'll carry
(You're too young Johnny, you're so smart)
But not smart enough to hide an aching heart
How come my heart deserts me
Burning full of love and desire
How come every time she kiss me
It sets my soul on fire
How come every time she leave me
It seems like I've lost a part
I may be too young to marry
But not to hide an aching heart
...
