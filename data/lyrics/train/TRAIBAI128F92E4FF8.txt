Na na nan na
Na na nan na

I swear to tell the truth
And nothing but the truth
Loving him ain't easy
He's bad bad news, yeah
Mama say "Use your head
You don't need him
Look at all the shit he put you through"
Papa curse "Baby girl if you don't leave him
There's nothing I can do for you
There's nothing I can do"

He's a mean man, but he's my man
My man alone
He's a mean mean one
A son of a gun
He keeps me by the telephone
He's a mean man, my man, my man alone

Na na nan na (He's my man)
Na na nan na (My mean man)
