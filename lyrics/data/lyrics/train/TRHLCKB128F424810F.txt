I'm in love with a girl I hate
She enjoys pointing out
Every bad thing about me
I'm in love with a critic and a skeptic

A traitor
I'd trade her in a second...
She's a backseat driver
A drama provider

An instant update of the world
She's a first-class liar
A constant forgetter (She's attractive but bitter)
Did you scream enough to make her cry
Did you turn around
Turn around

Baby don't return to me
If you think
That I'm not worth your time
She's a lady
And ladies
Shouldn't be mesed with

She's a lady
