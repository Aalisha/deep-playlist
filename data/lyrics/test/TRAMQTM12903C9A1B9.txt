I've been down, I've been out and I've been looking for some kind of attention.
Yeah, you know I've been trying to this out, this city, alone.
In this desperate times the destruction in me made me go back.
Yeah, you knew that I'd come, that I'd be coming back for more

And you know that I wanted to stay by your side.
And I wanted to hold the line.
And I wanted to stay by your side.
But now I'm watching you going down.

I've been down on my knees and I've been trying not to be this stupid.
I can't change what I am I'm just a stupid child for you.
