I love you, I love you, honey I love you I do
More than you ever know, it's for sure
You can count on me forever more

I need you, I need you, baby I
I need you right now
Say can you understand, you're my man
You're my one desire that's keeping me satisfied

Baby when we, when we're together
Say I'm alright and your alright it's like paradise
