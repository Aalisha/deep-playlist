if the waters cool i might just swim,
if the sun shines right i might be here all day.
i drift away, in a sunken state
i'm busy lappin' it up, i might be here all day.

with the tides, and their little secrets,
whispering me to sleep.
would you take away my weakness,
drift on, drift on.

if the waters cool, i might just swim
if the sun shines right i might be here all day
...
