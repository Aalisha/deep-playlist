Jimmy was a local boy but he's seen much more than the change in the weather
Sitting in a uniform of a three-piece suit and the ribbons from his past
Looking for a little boy at the bar with the mouth who thinks his clever now
Dreaming of a day that he goes home from a war to his childhood sweetheart

Now he don't need anyone, there's no one there for him
Just a feeling of an empty place deteriorating
Jimmy was a local boy, but he's seen much more than I'm bound to ever
