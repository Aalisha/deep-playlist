Drinking wine in the alley, drinking wine in the alley
Making time, drinking that wine
Out of my mind in the days gone by

Making time with Sally, drinking that wine
In the days gone by, talking all out of my mind
Drinking that wine, talking all out of my mind

Spin and turning in the alley, spin and turning in the alley
Like a Whirling Dervish in the alley, drinking that wine
Drinking wine, making time in the days gone by

Boogie woogie child in the alley
Drinking that wine, making time, talking all out of my mind
Drinking wine in the days gone by, behind the ritual

Behind the ritual, behind the ritual
In the days gone by, drinking that wine
Making time, drinking that wine, way back in time

Spin and turning and rhyme in the alley
Spin and turning, making up rhymes, talking all out of my mind
