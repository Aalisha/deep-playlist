Every night, this emptiness:
Yearning for something obscure.
Like spikes in roses my love is frail
When I saw you I knew â€“ Cinderella in black.

My dark beauty
He saw you as the shadows slithered by
The ultimate sacrifice
He is willing to give up for you
Just come and embrace our sorrow
My dark beauty
