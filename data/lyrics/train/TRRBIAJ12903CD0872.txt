Getting up is easy, when you're first to get the message, that it's time to put your money where your mouth is today
But if your friends are all asleep and you've got pillows on your feet, then your objectives will be lost, you will float on away

When the cavalry comes, you'll find us lookin for a reason, to break down these walls and jump
When the cavalry comes, you'll find us lookin for a reason, to show you the brave don't run, don't run

A proper cup of coffee, from a proper coffee shop, was all I needed to get a little purpose in life
Well the reasons are clear, my bearings aren't there, my compass points me in the wrong direction all night
