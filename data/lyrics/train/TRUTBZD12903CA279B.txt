Well, my old man had a heart of gold
He had eyes of steel and a real deep soul
He was a quiet man, he never said too much
But when he did, you'd better listen up
I was ready to waltz all around the world
Ready to love every blue eyed girl
My bags were packed and I was ready to leave
He shook my hand and said to me, me, me

I wish you luck and love, love and luck
