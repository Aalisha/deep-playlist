Sundown like a showtune
Trumpets play full blast
To create a great impression
Ah, but it doesn't seem to last

Flat stuff, flat stuff
Way out to the way out to the setting sun

The muskrat and the bullfrog
The rabbit and the skunk
Old barns full of blue sky
Backyards full of junk

Flat stuff, flat stuff
Way out to the way out to the setting sun
