Keep on moving
don't stop like the hands of time

Click clock
find your own way to stay

The time will come one day.
Why do people choose to live their live this way?

Keep on moving
don't stop
no
keep on moving

Keep on moving
keep on moving
don't stop
no

Keep on moving.

It's our time
time today
the right time is here to stay
