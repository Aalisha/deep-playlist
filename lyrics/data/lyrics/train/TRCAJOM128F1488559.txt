I've been workin' on a night train
Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine
I'm out here on my night train
Tryin' to get us safely home

Well in a little country station
Somewhere out in the midwest
I see the people out there waiting
Heart beating in my chest

And I'm thinking 'bout a woman
Who I put no one above
I'm not lookin' to replace her
Just need someone to love

While I'm out here on my night train
Drinkin' coffee takin' cocaine
I'm out here on my night train
...
