Some are born to educate and raise our IQ
While others imitate their gods and tell us all what to do
All I want is simply to be all about you
You're my only motivation
Everybody's got their or her own internal desire
But let their popular opinion keep them out of the fire
All I want to do is make you sweat and perspire
It's my only occupation

Chorus:
Would you let me please come over
Let me roll in your golden clover
