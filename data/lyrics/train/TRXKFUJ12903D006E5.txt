It's getting dark, I hear a voice
It's whispering, I turn around but no one's there
Against my face I sense a breath
I close my eyes, I'm flying
A mellow smell, I taste the air
I realize, someone's lying next to me
I feel a hand against my hair
It makes me weak, I'm crying

No one's there to tell you the moment's coming
You will never hear when there's a thunder drumming
A tenth of a second that is all it takes
