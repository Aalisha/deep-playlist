Just say goodbye.
And close the door.
Turn off the light.
And pick up the pieces if you need them.
This world is cold, but just know you're not alone.
No, you're not alone.

I know what you're thinkin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
I know how you're feelin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
Believe me.
Wooooaaaahhh
You're not alone.

I know what you're thinkin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
I know how you're feelin'.
Wooooaaaahhh
Believe me.
Wooooaaaahhh
You're not alone.
Wooooaaaahhh
