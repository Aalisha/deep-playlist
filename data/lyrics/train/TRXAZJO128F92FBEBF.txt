Yeah Ju-Jamal, know what I'm sayin'?
Reef the Lost Cauze, know what I'm sayin'?
Like a day time vampire, know what I"m sayin'?
Bout to shit out these niggas
Yeah, there's nothing that y'all can do
Yo amongst the niggas, dirty Ricans, and white trash
Got me pondering, what value does life have?
The wizard that don't carry no white staff
A tight mag, hear the slight blast
How long will ya life last?
As long as my Dutch so puff and take a nice drag
You take a loss either way when you fight fags
So I'll leave y'all bitching amongst
The chickens and chumps, the stitches and lumps
The triggers and pumps, rivers and dumps
You niggas is punks, yeah I said it
We'll see how ya vision end up
Aggression pent up, years strugglin', ten plus
So cop the city for ten bucks and get ya shit stuck
Like a bobby pin, your favorite rapper, who bodied him?
The man responsible, I'm probably him
Ju-Ju Mob lurk where the lobby dim
