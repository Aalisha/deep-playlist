Greeting cards have all been sent
The Christmas rush is through
But I still have one more wish to make
The special one for you

Merry Christmas darling
We're apart that's true
But I can dream and in my dreams
I'm Christmasing with you

Holidays are joyful
There's always something new
But every day's a holiday
When I'm near to you
...
