I've had my ups and downs
But never fell this far behind
Got to thank my family
They helped me through the hardest of times
Nothing I can do, even if i wanted to
Seems like I've had no luck
I feel beaten black and blue

I'll never give up, I'll never give in
I'll climb my way back to the top again
Never give up, never give in
I'll find my way back, I'll be back on top again
