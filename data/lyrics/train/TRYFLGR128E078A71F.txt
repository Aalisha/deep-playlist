Now we’re broken on the floor
She just wants me to share her
It hasn’t been this way before
She just wants me to dare her

The phone rings
And she screams
Stab my back
It’s better when I bleed for you
Walk on me
It never was enough to do

Can’t get past her
Falling faster
True.
It hasn’t done a lot for you
