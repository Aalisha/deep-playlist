Newsman says we have 2 years to live
Living to die
Fractured earth can't sustain humanity
Waiting to die the god is broke and stuck on catastrophe
Waiting to die
World leaders plead, there's nothing we can do, extinction has began
Anthrocide
People laughed, others cried, some confused
Anthrocide
Chaos erupts, thieves control the meek
Under marshal law
Anthrocide
In a panic surge
No where else to go
From terminal death
Anthrocide
Disbelief breed defeat, featuring the afterlife
Living to die
From this cruel joke
Who can survive
Waiting to die
Cling to the faith lord will right it
Living to die
Living day to day
To make it go away
Minds in disarray
