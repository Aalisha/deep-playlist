I followed your rules
A willing fool
Branded by shame

My soul suffers from your hostile ways
I bear so many scars, hit me hard
Time to change we have to rearrange
For this has gone too far, way too far

Creating new laws and living by unwritten rules
Restricting us

My soul suffers from your hostile ways
I can't let go

Creating new spins on ancient creed to fit your views
Denying us

You created this world
Where honesty is not allowed
You created this world
Where ignorance is being taught

You created this world
Where I am all, you'll never be
You've been drilling these
Such falsely-based philosophies
Â…in me

The curtain has fallen
There's no one behind
Corrected one mistake
But I am still around
