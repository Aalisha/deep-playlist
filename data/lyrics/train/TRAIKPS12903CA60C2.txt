Have you ever had one of those days
That had you freakin' out
Nothing ever goes right
Makes you start thinking
'Bout what you want
And everything that you need
And if you start losing control
Just see the top of the rhyme
You got a head start
Now I'm tryin' to figure out
Why you play a game you know
Will never be won

Think about ooh
There's not a lot I can do
But if you take a good look at yourself
Your gonna see that I'm stronger
It's not about you
I found you breakin' the rules
