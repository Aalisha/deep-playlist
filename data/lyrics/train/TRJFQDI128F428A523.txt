(Bowcott, Grimmett)

What's wrong with our society, is it fear or apathy,
Don't let other people run your life
So those with power don't use it, they simply
abuse it,
And believe me that cuts me like a knife.

We gotta make sure that this don't happen,
'Cause to me and you it just ain't right,
Gonna make damn sure it don't happen,
This is what I'm gonna do

Rock you to hell, packin' up and shippin' out,
Rock you to hell, hear them scream and shout,
Rock you to hell, but I'm never giving out,
Rock you to hell, Rock you to hell
