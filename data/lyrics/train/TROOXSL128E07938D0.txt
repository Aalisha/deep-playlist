[I'ma say this and I'ma end mine. If you ain't down for the Africanshere in the United States, period point blank, if you ain't down for theones that suffer in South Africa from apartheid and shit -- devil you need tostep your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step inand start puttin' some funk in that ass!]

Break 'em off somet'in'
Break 'em off somet'in'
Break 'em off somet'in'
Break 'em off somet'in'
Break 'em off somet'in'
Break 'em off somet'in'
Break 'em off somet'in'
Break 'em off somet'in'

[Snoop Dogg]
I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin' in the city it's do-or-die

[Dat Nigga Daz]
They wonder where me bailin' and don't really understand
The reason why they take me life and meÂ ? hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
Me gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them riot in they Lakers and don't really wanna see
Niggaz start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock it down at seven o'clock, then again it's like Beirut
Me don't show no love cuz it's us against them
Them never ever love me cuz it's sport to break them,
And kill at my own risk if I may
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest

[Yes we have. There have been riots, ahh, rioting, well I don't wanna sayrioting but there's been looting downtown, but right now Bree, what I wantto show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street.]

[All] How many niggaz are ready to loot?
[Snoop] Yeah, so what you wanna do?
[Dre] What you wanna do?
[All] I said how many niggas are ready to loot?
[[KRS-One] Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9]

[What they told us today, in other words, you're still a slave. No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit]
