You fell down the stairs into my arms
And swiftly ran the other way
And I heard the steady swell of applause
For two drunk kids trying to figure out which way was home
They got lost as they were taking off each other's clothes
They realized there was a hole in the boat
And with no lifesaver you try your best to float
...
