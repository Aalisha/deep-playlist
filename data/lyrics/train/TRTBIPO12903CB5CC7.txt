Walking, wounded children lined the roads about the town
Aging little faces full of need
Who never should have suffered from this hunger
There's a better world to go to, I believed
Before our journey to Canada
My love and I were married in the town
One day of freedom from the anguish
We sang and danced with friends from all around

A stor mo chroi
I'll always love you

On an overcrowded ship we crossed the ocean
Many found their graveyard in that sea
Those who set their dreams on a life in Canada
Surrendered to the fate that was to be
Finally my true love's heart was broken
In a fever shed in Canada she died
Though I will assist my fellow countrymen
