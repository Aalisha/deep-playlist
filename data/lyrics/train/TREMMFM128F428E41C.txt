We are the leaders and nothing can beat us
It feels so good the angels can take you there
You better beware of devil may care

Tell me where you want to go
We are the leaders
Heaven's above and Hell's below
We are the leaders
Oh sing hallelujah sing hallelujah
Giving it to you
We are the leaders

Black night white light
The other side of midnight
