Oh, baby, I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready to let you go
My hands shake, my heart's unsteady
Oh, how I once loved you so
I know all the magic's gone
Wish I had a magic wand
I would put a spell on you
You would see it as I do
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
