Time came around, and I was in need
You came by my side, all my troubles to ease
You collected my heart, healing the past
You'll never lay down and i can count on you

We all speak well of a bridge that carries us over
...over safe
The art of compromise has surely been our greatest strength
...our greatest strength.
