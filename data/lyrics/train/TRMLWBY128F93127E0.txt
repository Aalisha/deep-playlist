I wake up in a waiting room
With the taste of blood and a clouded view
I notice there is a tear in my jeans
The sleeves of my shirt have been ripped from their seams
My memory is a little bit blank
The thought of my name doesn't seem to come back
And I turn and scream "what am I here for?"
The nurses yell "you were left at the door!"
I'm a stranger; someone left me for dead
and I need to decide what to do next

Oh, just then I found a note in my pocket, it read:
"I don't ever wanna see you again"
And I guess that explains why I can't remember the rest of the night

I should have listened to my friends
I should have listened to them
when they told me you had bad intentions
