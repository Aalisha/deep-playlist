Sad to say
Its over now
Here come the huns
Pick a side
Pick a spot
Here come, here come
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!

Cal state
No fun
Stay put
Here come
To clean the slate
To pass the time
To erase
Yank crime

Why waste
Your time
Here come the huns
Be my
Date tonight
Here come, here come
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!
Rome plows! Rome plows!

Cal state
...
