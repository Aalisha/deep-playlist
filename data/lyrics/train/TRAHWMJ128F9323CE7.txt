For every lonely lady there’s a man that’s just her type
That’s gonna love her in the mornin’ after he loves her through the night
But not all of us are lucky, no not all of us are blessed
The world is filled with failures that tried to do their lovin’ best
And for every desert flower there’s a dozen cactus spines / spikes
And for every idle hour there’s a true love left behind

And all of us are children, no not all of us are young
