So glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
Back where I belong

Oh, I went out to do my thing
And I was totally rejected
I put you down for love unknown
But it wasn't what I expected
So frightened and confused
I came running back to you
I got right down on my knees
And said darling, won't you please
I don't know why you did it
But I'm not too proud to admit it, baby

Thank you, baby, thank you, baby
...
