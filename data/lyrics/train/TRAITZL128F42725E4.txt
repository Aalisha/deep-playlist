disengaged, we're forsaken now
communication does suffer
the moral stare of Big Brother
not a chance, no compromise
battling the barrier of belief
not to try anymore

don't want to murder the only memory or hide
try to accept that it's all worthwhile
when you've been disengaged
severed from any world that's mine
