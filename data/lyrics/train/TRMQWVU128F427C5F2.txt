Caught out in the pourin' rain
Wish I could start this day again
Soaked through and through
Darlin' all I want is to get home to you

I could have sworn I saw your face
Smilin' back at me today
Oh, but I, I'm such a love sick fool
Everything I see reminds me of you

I wanna be in your arms tonight
I wanna tell you everything's alright
I wanna feel you close to me
