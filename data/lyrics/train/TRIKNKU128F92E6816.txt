Everybody let me tell you about my love
Brought to you by an angel from above
Fully quipped with a life time guarantee
Once you try it I am sure you'll see

Without love there's no reason to live
Without you what would I do with the love I give
All my loving to you I'll be giving
And I promise this I'll do as long as I'm living

I'm thinking of you and the things you do to me
That makes me love now I'm living in ecstasy
Hey it's you and the things you do to me
That makes me love you now I'm living in ecstasy
