When the runners came from Bethlehem
All breathless with good news
They were passing a baton forward through time

The commission, from God? s lips to our ears
Carried by His Saints, two thousand years
Connects us all to the same lifeline

As I fix my eyes ahead
I can feel the Spirit? s breath

And I can hear the mission bell
Ringing out loud and clear
It's the revolution Jesus started
And it's here

Echoing across the world
From the shores of Galilee
I can hear the mission bell call
For you and me

I wanna run with fire
It? s my heart? s desire
