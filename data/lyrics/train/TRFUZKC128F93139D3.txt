(I was born and raised in the slums of every city)
(I was born and raised in the slums of every city)

[Hook: x2]
(I was born and raised in the slums...)
Coney Island, Coney Island
(... of every city)

Yo
It ain't gon get more hood or get more slum
Than 23rd and Mermaid, that's where I'm from
And even though the beach and board walk is fun
Come seven blocks past Nathan's, you're done
Neptune and Surf, murder made the worst
Niggas came in Benzes, left in a hearse
And if they spare your life, your jewels and your cash
You're dispersed, biz know CI niggas thirst
You prolly think it's all beach and amusement park
You would be a fool to peruse after dark
You will see the tool comin through Kaiser Park
Cause late night niggas dig graves, and it's comp then
...
