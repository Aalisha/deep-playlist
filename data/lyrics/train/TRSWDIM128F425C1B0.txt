Come to my heart and listen to my soul
Im standing still where is my way to take me home
If theres no way I wont go further anymore
My whole world leaves me cold and alone
Memory hurts so many times
My destination
Is there anything covering all
My destination

Come to my heart and listen to my soul
Theres so much in life I really try to forget
Its not just the sorrow the emptiness and pain
Even the glad days burning deep inside
