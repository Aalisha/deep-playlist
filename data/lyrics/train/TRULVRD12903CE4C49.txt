He Calls That Religion Trk 20 3: 30
The Mississippi Sheiks
Sam Chatmon - bass guitar, (brother) Lonnie Chatmon - fiddle
(brother) Bo 'Carter' - guitar, Walter Vinson - guitar

Well, the preacher used to preach
To try to stay atoned
But now he's preachin'
Just to buy jellyroll

Well, he calls that religion
Yes, he calls that religion
Well, he calls that religion
But I know he's goin' to hell when he dies

It was at a church last night
Had desire to be
The old preacher
Was tryin' to take my wife from me

Oh, he call that religion
Yes, he call that religion
Well, he called that religion
I know he's goin' to hell when he dies
