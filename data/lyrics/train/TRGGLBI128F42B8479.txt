Look at the world and all the trouble it's in
We've traded righteousness for pleasures of sin
And now that things have gotten way out of hand
You're wondering how and you're wondering when
Hate is filtered right into your home
Takin' the love that the family once owned
Mothers against the daughters, dads against sons
The way that it looks, seems like evil has won

(CHORUS)
Anybody wanna pray with me, anybody wanna pray with me
Anybody wanna, anybody wanna pray with me
(and chase all these troubles away)
Anybody wanna pray with me, anybody wanna pray with me
Anybody wanna, anybody wanna pray with me
