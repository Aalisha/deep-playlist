Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

Get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight

You, preacher man, don't tell me
Heaven is under the earth
You, a duppy and you don't know
What life is really worth

It's not all that glitter is gold
And half the story has never been told
So now we see the light
We gonna stand up for your rights, come on
