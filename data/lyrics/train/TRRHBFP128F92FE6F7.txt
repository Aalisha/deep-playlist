Honey I know, you've been alone some,
Why don't you fool some, 'cause I love you.
And honey I know, I've been away some,
I've had to pay some, and you have too.

But the one thing I know that when I, I turn out the light,
visions of you dear, dance in the night. I've been,
put down, pushed around, apprehended and led downtown and I,
can't help it if I'm out of sight, 'cause I'm restless tonight.

Just can't stand bein' alone,
...
