Three two one, kick it

Lord help me to believe I've got the need
Killed by the world I'm filled full of greed
Dead to the touch of my human hand
Can't stand, beaten down by a broken old man

Broken men fill a city full of sadness
Broken rooms fill a body full of badness
I need a need other than the sting of sin
I need a sweet kiss to syncopate the rut I'm in

I've got a lover, she clothes me in another
A bad thing to bring, a sacrifice under the covers
She said, cut all that record from inside of me
Like something living made a decision to cease to be

Life isn't like that, life isn't like this
I have a need to know what it is

Have you stopped to see what it is to be free
How the world has become a giant shopping spree
Lord, help me to believe how the word has changed
If it happens enough does it seem the same?

If it happens to me over and over again
Will I cease to feel all the pain I'm in?
Will I cease to feel? Will I start to believe?
Will I need nothing more than the air that I breathe?

Well, why waste breathing on a living death?
Why even bother with another breath?
Why believe, why care, why even fuckin' feel?
Why try to see beyond the evening meal?

They tell me four billion people are alive today
