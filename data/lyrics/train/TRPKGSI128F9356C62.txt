I'm not a virgin anymore
I just thought you should know
Darlin', I been around
Yeah, I've been up and down your block
In fact, I have been all over town
Down by the lake
And underneath the table in my living room
Outside by the blue, blue moon

You can call me what you will
Call me a slut, call me a jaded pill
Darlin', I've got your number now
I'm not a virgin anymore

I've been taken
I've been hung up, I get down
And start it over again
I've been opened
I've been closed like a book
And burned out like a written sin
I just thought you should know, my darlin', before we begin
I'm not a virgin anymore
Just thought you should know

Before you let another lie get through your crooked little teeth
I don't think you wanna start that shit with me
Much better yet, tell me something dangerous and true
