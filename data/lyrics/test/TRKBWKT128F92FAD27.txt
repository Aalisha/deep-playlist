For months you've been away,
You're here a couple days,
I've got all of the time in the world.
To do with what we please,
If it were up to me,
We'd have all of the time in the world.
Just stay right where I can see you.

When you go away I get so low,
Like temperatures when they're at their coldest.
When you go away I get so lonely,
And I'm stranded by the side of the bed.

I can name all 50 states,
