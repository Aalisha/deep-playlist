I never knew why
Why we can't see eye to eye?
Like a fool I believed
We'd find a way to survive

I wish we could be
More than just a memory
'Cause we loved, we laughed, we cried
And there's no good in goodbye

You tell me, you need some time
Some time to be on my own
Right now when I need you so, oh oh

Don't know how long it will take
Do you expect me to wait?
But baby I gotta go, oh oh
Then you gotta go

If you must go, you ought to know
I'll get along, I will live without you
If you must leave, I hope you see, yeah
I won't be around baby, if you should leave
You're gonna need me

You might think that leavin' is easy
I had no right to lead you on
