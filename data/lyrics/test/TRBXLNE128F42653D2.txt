well the sun? s coming up
and the dust it is clearing
down the line I am hearing
there? s a train coming in
i left my home and my girl
tried to find some place better
but i never could forget her
so let this train take me home

oh please my darling forgive what i√Ç? ve done
i? ve found nothing
just some big lonely world
so take me back please my lover
take me back please my lover
it took a train to discover
i cannot be without you girl
