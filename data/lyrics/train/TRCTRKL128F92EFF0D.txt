laying on the floor listening to your records
thinking how I met ya, stayed around for so long
and oh-I'm-glad, the time we had
it really helped me out and I hope that you ain't got it bad

I had a feeling about you and it's all we know
you got me feeling high, you kept me from the low
and it was just what I was looking for
you don't always need somebody to adore
