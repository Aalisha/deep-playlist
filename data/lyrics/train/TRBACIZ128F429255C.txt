No matter where we are and no matter where we go
It's our style our line and our music that we show
Just listen to the beat and a little later you will know
It's really freaky funky stuff and honest too
Forget the shit that you hear and you see
Every night and day on your color TV
Just listen to peppers pray across the land
They're really freaky funky and no beat box band
