On the day of my final sacrifice
The chilling steel open my veins
Blood staines my skin
Silver chalice must be filled

Drinking the poisoned blood
I enter my shadowed coffin
Two goathorns in my hands
I raise my arms and close my eyes
To receive the infernal hails
From my brother in the land of the damned

The howling wind blows in the naked trees
Moonlit fields are glowing in the dark
...
