Everybody makes mistakes,
But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not not making me wait,
But it seems alright as long as something's happening

I try to make you late,
But you fight me out like a fire does
You try making me wait,
But it feels alright as long as something's happening.

Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
