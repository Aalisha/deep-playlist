Parker

Got out really early from the factory
Drivin' like a nut in the rain
Don't think I was actin' so hysterically
But I didn't see a thing until it came
Met the dumb suburbos in the takeaway
Beating up the Chinee at the counter
I put a few inside me at the end of the day
I took out my revenge on the revolution counter

Crawlin' from the wreckage, Crawlin' from the wreckage
You'd think by now at least that half my brain would get the message
Crawlin' from the wreckage, Crawlin' from the wreckage
Into a brand new car

In walks Bud with his exploding nose
He's been giving it maximum today
Shouted, How the devil, you in trouble, I suppose
All you ever do is run away
