You came in to my life

Close those doors
Close those doors now
Now, now, just keep em open
Keep 'em open
Yeah, keep 'em open
I'll keep on, keep keep on going
Taking it in so, so heavy
Take it easy son, this ain't so deadly
Got keep on, gotta go on, gotta go on
Take it all with what we've done
Gotta push it push it push it
To the top of the building
Even when no one is feeling
