Don't wanna leave you again, baby
But you know I have to someday
Don't wanna be alone again, baby
But I know we found our own way

We hold ourselves together
It's a bond that can never be broken
I know we'll last forever
But there's something that I just gotta say

And that's wait for me, my lover
Wait for me, no other
Stay with me, oh, please
Wait, wait for me

You know it's really hard on me
To have to turn an' wave good bye
An' I know it's hard on you too
All those lonely nights we cry but we

We hold ourselves together
