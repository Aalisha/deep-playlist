I don't remember going out last night
Someone said I made myself a fool
I don't recall the things they said I did
I know I'd never do that as a rule

'Cause all I can remember
Is dancing in the rain

I just can't seem to concentrate
I've tried time and again
But all I can remember
Is dancing in the rain
