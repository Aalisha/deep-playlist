I was standing with my paper there
minding my own news
For everything that someone said
someone else had a different view
I watched the whole thing there
unfold upon my T.V. screen
"A new World Order is on its way"

Sure find out real fast who's a sitting duck
When it's a

Shake your hands and say good luck. It's a . . .
Mad mad world
