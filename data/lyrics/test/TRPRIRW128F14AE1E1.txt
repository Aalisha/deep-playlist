You are forever...

Whoa whoa yea yea

You are the hero I'll never be
But don't You know?
I wanna be like You?
And I'm so glad You're a part of me
I'll go with You
Wherever You want to

You caim to save me from myself
You took the blame
You love me like nobody else
So I say...

(CHORUS)
Now and forever
I am with You
