You don't know what's going on,
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine

You're out of touch my baby
My poor old fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes you are left out, yes, you are
I said you're left out of there without a doubt
'cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

You thought you was a clever girl
