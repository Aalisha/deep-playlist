Go without 'til the need seeps in
You low animal, collect your novel petals for the stem
And glow, glow, melt and flow, eviscerate your fragile frame
Spill it out on the ragged floor, a thousand different versions of yourself

And if the old guard still offend
They've got nothing left on which you depend
So enlist every ounce of your bright blood and off with their heads
...
