I am not trying to seduce you

When I dance, they call me Macarena
And the boys, they say que soy buena
They all want me
They can't have me
So they all come and dance beside me
Move with me
Chant with me
And if you're good, I'll take you home with me

Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria y cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Hey Macarena

Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegria y cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
Hey Macarena

But don't you worry about my boyfriend
He's a boy whose name is Vitorino
I don't want him
Couldn't stand him
He was no good so I (hahahaha)

Now, come on, what was I supposed to do?
He was out of town and his two friends were sooo fine

Dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena
