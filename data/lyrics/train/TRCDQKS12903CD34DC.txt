This is the marriage of silence and love
here is the temple where I come to learn
here are the eternal little things I always loved
here are all my tears just waiting for my return

live what I dream and be the way he seems

and I have no doubt here I fall and rise
here I can be poor and feel so rich inside
here I come back to me here I come back to see
