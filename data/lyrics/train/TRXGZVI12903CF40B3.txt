Falling into obscure demise
Ripping death confronts their lives
Born as a freak in decrepit birth
Ignorance prevails, buried in earth

I seem contorted, a victim of death
Corrupt reality, a poisoned breath
From beyond the grave, a sight of gore
Rise from the crypts, life no more

Rancid corpse, afterlife bliss
Greeting the night with a vulgar hiss
Pulsating innards for me to bless
Drowning in bile, enjoying the mess

Aiming at your face
Using piss for mace
...
