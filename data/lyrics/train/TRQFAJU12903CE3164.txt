I've always been there everytime he let you down
I caught your falling tears before they hit the ground
But I just heard somebody say that you finally told him goodbye
Well girl now you've finally made your move
Now I'm here to make mine.

I want to be there when you wake up, be more than just your friend
Baby there's no mistaking you're the love I wanna be in
