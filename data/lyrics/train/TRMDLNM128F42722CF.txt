It's been five months
Since you went away
Left without a word,
Nothin' to say (nothin' to say)
When I was the one,
Who gave you, my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you
No oh-oh
So I asked God

God send me an Angel
From the Heavens above
Send me an Angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I dooo... is cry (is cry)
God send me an Angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes

And I, know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still loved you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
