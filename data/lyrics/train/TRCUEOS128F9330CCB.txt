I wonder who she comes home to if anyone
I wonder if she's in love, if there is someone
By the look on her face I can't figure it out
If there's people at all she can't live without

I wonder what's in their future if they met just now
The way they look at each other like they don't know how
They could be this lucky as never before
They doubted they'd find love well not anymore
