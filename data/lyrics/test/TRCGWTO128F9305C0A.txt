Reflecting from my deathbed
I'm balancing life's riches
against the ditches
and the flat gray years in-between
all I can see are the never-laid
that's the never played symphonies

I can't see those who tried to love me
or those who felt they understood me
and I can't see those who
very patiently put up with me
...
