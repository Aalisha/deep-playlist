Well it's been a long day but I don't like to moan
It's the middle of summer and I'm chilled to the bone
There's holes in my shoes where the rain comes in
I'm sitting on top of the world

Walking in the shadows of empty office blocks
I was talking to a stranger and he's on the rocks
Down on the pavement living in a box
I'm sitting on top of the world

Oh no can't anybody see
It's been a bad day and I want a little peace

Oh no won't you please help me
I want to lie down but there's no beds free
