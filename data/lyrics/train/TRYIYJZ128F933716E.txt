And if I do dream I dream you're like
pink and green and white blue and gray and light
and if I do wish I wish you're right
right here by my side like the pink and green and white
the colour of my dreams tonight the colour of my dreams tonight
the colour of my dreams tonight the colour of my dreams tonight
the colour of my dreams the colour of my dreams
the colour of my dreams the colour of my dreams
When you fall in a deep sleep let me be the one that you seek
make your dream pleasant things thoughts of love as angels sing
make you see a clear blue day watch the sun shine our way
as I hold you near make you feel no signs of fear
but only treasure the pleasure when we are together
