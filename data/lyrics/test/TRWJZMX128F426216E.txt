I don't need to tell the truth
But I never lie
I don't need to bow to you
You're just passing by

I never wanted to be the one
You bitch and moan and come home to
But as long as you look good
I'll talk back to you

Get inside my troubled mind
With all of your threats
Sometimes I think I was blind
Not before we met

I never wanted to be the one
...
