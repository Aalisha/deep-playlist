Baby, if I had your lovin', I'd have everything
I needed
If anybody told me I wouldn' a believed that I'd be
Head over heels in love with you, baby
Now all the unfinished dreams on the
Unmade beds
Are ungathered blackberries in my head
Baby, I know really am in love with you.

Cause you're sweeter than honey, baby
warm as a piece of the sun and
Darker than nite to a blind man
Softer than starlite shinin'.

So let's get together and make love
Ain't nothing else to be prouder of
I need you bad, baby, you're the best thing I ever had
...
