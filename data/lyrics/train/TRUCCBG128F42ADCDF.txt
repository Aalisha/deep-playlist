i wanna hold you baby

i wanna hold you
never be lonely with me by your side
say that you want me baby
i got the things you've needed to get by

i wish you love me too
this time you promise and look into my eyes
i can give you lovin' baby
show me the way to make you feel all right
falling in love to you

i wanna be your number one
nobody else tonight
you gonna be my crazy love
i'll never let you down
