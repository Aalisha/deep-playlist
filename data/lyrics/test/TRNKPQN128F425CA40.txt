Do, do, do-wah Do,
do, do-wah (Goin' back, goin' back)
I'm going back to country living
Where the air is fresh and clean
Going back to natural living
Where the grass grows tall and green
And the skies can be seen
I'll say goodbye to Kingston city
City life is not for me
Going where the stars shines brightly
And the sound of nature's voice
...
