I'm sayin' ooh la la
To let you know it's real, yeah
Ooh la la la
I'm sayin' ooh la la
To show just how I feel
You came to me, when I was sad & lonely
In need of, a love so faithful & true
Now all my bad days are gone, thanks to you
Good times have won
I found a best friend in you
2 - Juliet had a Romeo
Wherever she'd go, he would follow
Feelin' so much deeper, than love
You & me share a heart of gold
