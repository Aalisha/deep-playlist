You're everywhere and nowhere, baby,
thats where you're at,
Going down a bumpy hillside,
In your hippy hat.
Flying across the country
And getting fat
Saying everything is groovy
When your tyres are flat

And it's hi, ho silver lining
and away you go now baby
I see your sun is shining
But I won't make a fuss
Though it's obvious.
