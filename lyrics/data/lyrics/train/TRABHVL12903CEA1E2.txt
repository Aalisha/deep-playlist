Count the days and several ways to die
This is the drug that told her she could fly
The best way to die was found here tonight
They've all lost control but they're feelin' alright
The best way to die was found here tonight
They've all lost control but they're feelin' alright

Feel her pulse beating gently in the vein
Alive but dead, so close, nearly the same

The best way to die was found here tonight
...
