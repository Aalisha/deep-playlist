Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time.
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.

And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
and I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
