Rain and thunder and lightning
Crumbling buildings
Falling hurricanes
Earth shattering mid-rains
Scattering insane
Happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting
Now--

The sky is falling, life is appalling
And death is lurking, niggaz killing each other
Leaving bodies nobodies searching for
And youth announced ..., catching a bit of murder one
And mothers is drinking and drugging, hoe-in; searching for their son
And liquor stores upon every corner
And younger people done accepted defeating
The melting pot of lavas seeping
And the hood is all the mic can conceive when your foes bleeding to their death
And you picking their pocket
Wanna just get even
Niggers is banging and coppers is banging punk snuggin
Highly intelligent Africans lowered to punk smuggin
And capitals of the planet, planets run by the government
And genocide 's overwhelming, devil is loving it
And children in highschool go 'n smokin their classes up
And people thats rich don't be checking for what is happening
Degrading all women, knock em up, leave em, now smack em up
And ain't no way to reach us we're sleeping like hells castle
Sky is falling

Rain and thunder and lightning
Crumbling buildings
Falling hurricanes
Earth shattering mid-rains
Scattering insane
Happening
Souls keeps burning
...
