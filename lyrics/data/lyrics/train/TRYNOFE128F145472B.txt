Fools they think I do not know 
The road I'm taking 
If you meet me on the way 
Hesitating 
That is just because I know which way I will choose 

The corridors of discontent 
That I've been traveling 
All alone in search for truth 
The world's so frightning 
Nothing's going right today 
'Cos nothing ever does 

Oooh, I don't wanna know your secrets 
...
