JEANE
The low-life has lost its appeal
And I'm tired of walking these streets
To a room with its cupboard bare
JEANE
I'm not sure what happiness means
But I look in your eyes
And I know that it isn't there
We tried, we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried

JEANE
