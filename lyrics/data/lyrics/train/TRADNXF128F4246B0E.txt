Aaw... gonna take it to the limit... yeah!
Come on...

I've been pushin' my load uphill
And my back is bent
Now I'm lookin' for a thrill
'cause the juice ain't spent
Slippin' in for satisfaction
Gimme a piece of your sweet love action
'Fore the night is through...
Gonna rescue you

'cause I'm a hellraiser
...
