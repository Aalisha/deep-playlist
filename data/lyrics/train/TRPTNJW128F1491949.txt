he threw one down from the top of the stairs
beautiful women were standing everywhere
they all got wet when he smashed that thing
but off in the dark you could hear somebody sing

his mama wouldnt buy him that new red harmony
he settled for a sunburst with a crack
but hes still trying to break his mamas back
