If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you

The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd lost my one and only
They'd be sad, if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin'
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
...
