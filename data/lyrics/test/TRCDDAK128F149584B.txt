[Intro]
Yo, whassup?
Miss me?
I miss you
Tellin' me no
Yo, whassup?
You want me?
I want you
Tellin' me no

Remember what you said
Talking on the phone
Saying little things, freaky little things
Just to turn me on (Turn me on)
But when I try to come by
You have the tendency to wanna freck on me
If no means no then I'll leave you alone
Picture you tellin' me that you really want to get it on
When things get hot, that's when you begin to tease
Can't take it no more, so I'm gonna leave

Why you tellin' me no
Then you're leading me on
Pushing me away
When you know you want some
Make up your mind
I really don't have the time
Been waiting too long
So I gotta move on

I don't think you understand
