(By Deana Carter, Chris Farren & Chuck Jones)



Caroline was born about a mile from the Mississippi
Kinda like the kudzu, she grew up fast and pretty
A little bit of Memphis, little bit of New York City
All the boys would come around, blocking up her Daddy's driveway
But she could spot a come-on coming from a mile away
She hears them callin' but she ain't fallin'


She wants a love that's gonna last forever
She wants to stand where her feet don't touch the ground
She's holding out for a piece of heaven
She's gonna fly and she's never comin'down
