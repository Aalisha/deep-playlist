Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yo, Jojo

Isn't it funny? The things you said and done to me
You said, you want me but now lady I wanna be free
You lied to me, you said, you never would play me
But I found out that you were lyin' all the time

You pick me up
You bring me down
When I thought I found in you, solid ground
And you turn my smile into a frown
Girl you promised that you'd never let me down
But now you're not around

Jojo help me, yeah, yeah
Can I get a witness?
I can go on and talk a little 'bout me
