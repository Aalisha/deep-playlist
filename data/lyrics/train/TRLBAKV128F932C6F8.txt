Crazy bout you baby
And I got you on my mind
I'm just trying to tell ya
This is the place and the time
Say what you wanna say
Do anything you wanna do
But don't deny me of loving you

Can't you see I love you
And I've loved you from the start
Can't you hear the beat
Can't you hear the beat of my heart
Say what you wanna say
Anything you wanna do
But don't deny me of loving you

Love you like an open book
You better stop now and take a look
Your love is like a burning flame
