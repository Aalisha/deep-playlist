(Deniece Pearson)

Watching all the films as they go back in time
Waking all the pictures, but I never knew why you went
Rivers run dry
Reading all the letters made up in my mind
Never thought that moment would have ever been mine
But then I threw it all away

You were nearly mine until yesterday
'til I found out you were playing around
While I was waiting for you, so

Chorus:
Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know the truth
Stay out of the darkness
While I'm reaching for you
Stay out of my life
I don't wanna know the truth
Cause the memories surround my mind
Oh you can never forget a broken heart
...
