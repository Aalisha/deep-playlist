1991 they live a hit spot in town (A.K) son of a gun
what you want turn it up pump up these shit infinite all day and shit.
I see twoos hanging out at the corner we know no lickses played out
licks.
Once i was top 10 to porterflick, champagne put all up in the mix
dance put yourself passatoos radio match got nothing to lose
we dont need no educacion, what we need is a radio station

(Chorus)
All i see is all i get i stole the music with no regreats
all i want is all i need im a thief i stole the beat.
