Now, being hailed as the ultimate fourth dimensional guitar hero,
Ziltoid feels confident in his complete victory.
But Captain Spectacular has seen through Ziltoid's facade,
and now sets out to expose Ziltoid for what he really is;
A nerd... A nerd!

We now join Captain Spectacular,
as he introspectively gazes out his starship window
on his way to find the fifth-dimensional Nebulowenine

Did you know that time is not a straight line,
Everything that you learn, now it's gone, gone away.
You take your turn if you choose, you burn everything that you were,
Now it's gone, gone away. Yeah it's gone gone away...

Yeah it's gone gone away

Gone, and the world is gone
And we find there's no one that's waiting for the light to call,
And we're on our own,
and we find there's no one that's waiting for the light to call.
