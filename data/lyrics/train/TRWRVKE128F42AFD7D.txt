There's a little boy waitin' at the counter of the corner shop
He's been waitin' down there
Waiting half the day
We never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around
Knocked to the ground
But he gets to his feet and he says...

What about me
It isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see
I wanna live
But you just take more then you give

There's a pretty girl standing at the counter of the corner shop

She's been waitin' back there
Waitin' for her dreams
Her dreams walk in and I begged 'em to stop
Well she's not too proud
...
