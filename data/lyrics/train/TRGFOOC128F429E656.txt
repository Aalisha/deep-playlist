The truth is y'all haters had to lie to do it
I am loose like a loop is with a loop chick grindin' to it
Old school like colt 45, lunch lines and pumas
You heard I blaze hoop? I denied the rumors
Your mic don't sound nice, you shouldn't even check 1, 2
I disrespect who come through, my intellect is kung-fu
In the midst of the women, that miss the man
The new millennium bush baby, with a mystic plan
Digi download, sound scan exam, top ten choice
You wanna speak out? My label keeps getting my invoice
If I sound sarcastic, I meant to do it
Wack emcee's breath stink, you need a mint

Revenge of the first
Rap, hip-hop, underground, mainstream
Stop lick a shot, pop, hit the charts
Aim for the top, and still get down when we drop
X2

I got different flows for different shows
They don't know the half, I am different on a ho
I use a knife to cut clad, but if the fights not ending
These old school slugs can get ya life suspended
