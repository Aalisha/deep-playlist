Hesitation is a hole in the head
And contradiction buys you time
A battle worth winning is a battle worth losing
Sometimes revolution is kind

Can stop and pray for rain
We can march and beat the drum
The storm's about to rage

He who speaks loudly will surely be heard
But a whisper cannot be ignored
...
