(Deen/Kilfelt)
In it's wake the immoral wasteland
Fallout erodes the technological shrines to greed
Damnation of the most sacred mother
Three piece jackal prophecy decreed
The fusion heavens, the burning rainfall
Allied breaks in the pattern of all that is
Righteous faction, bribe a blessing
Respite fallacy by blinded ghouls
Defend the keep, Garrison resolve
With mail upon thy soul
Antipathy, resist the mark
Covenant of pure belief
The crow he flies, God speed be with you
The insatiable want for all
The ember riders, on steeds of death
