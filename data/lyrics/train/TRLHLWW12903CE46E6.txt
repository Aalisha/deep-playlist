She was a be-bop baby on a hard day's night
She was hangin' on Johnny
He was holdin' on tight
Oh
I could feel her coming from a mile away
There was no use talking
There was nothing to say
When the band began to play and play -

And we danced
Like a wave on the ocean
Romanced
We were liars in love and we danced

Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced
...
