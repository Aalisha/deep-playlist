Please don't guide me again
Could you just leave me here?
I'll bury these wounds with you
I'll be gone by nightfall

The shadow is gone and then you're leaving coldness here
It's getting darker now, the night is drawing closer my dear

To writhe.
I found my suffering - the life
I hear you suffer me - to writhe
I bound my suffering - tonight

The start of cold seasons
