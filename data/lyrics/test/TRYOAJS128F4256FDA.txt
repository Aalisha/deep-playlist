Thoughts collide, raping shreds of sanity
Invading my mind through light and dark

A vision of beauty, spreading wings, envelope my soul
Breathing life, releasing the pain
Lighting flames upon a darkened path
Awaiting reprieve, one image burns

I no longer control myself
Pushed and pulled
Beyond my strength
Eyes that shine, words unknown
...
