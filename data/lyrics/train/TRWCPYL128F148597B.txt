Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello

Hello operator, please connect me
To the human race, I'm disconnected
I don't wanna hang up, won't you help me?
Mrs. O

I had a really bad day, can't you listen?
Everybody got drugs but mine won't kick in
Everyone's mad, dumb or wicked
Mrs. O, please help, don't go

Hello operator, please connect me
To the human race, I'm disconnected
I don't wanna hang up, can't you help me?
Mrs. O
