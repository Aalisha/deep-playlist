Je suis désolée 
Lo siento 
Ik ben droevig 
Sono spiacente 
Perdóname 

I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before

I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore
