I Am The Black Goat
Wandering Amongst The Trees
Bastard Of Thousands
Selfish God Of All

Sullen Skies Alight In Curiosity
If All Else Ends, This Time Man Has Arranged A Doubt
In All Shortcomings Brings This Struggle
To Ignite The Once Force Of Stable Unity
To Die As One In This Creative Legion
These Colors Of Life Almost Bleed Out Loud
These Ancient Lores Of Kindreds Unknown
A Myth Unveiled To Bring The End Of Eternity

I Am Drunk On The Blood Of The Unborn Child
The Wolves Gather Around To Greet Me In The Shadows
