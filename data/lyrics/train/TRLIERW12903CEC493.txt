(Jess)
Did you honestly think that this is all it takes?
To be my boyfriend can’t you hear my heart break
Can’t you tell how your silence is making me feel
When you’re always away even though you’re right here
 
(Daizy)
Everytime that I try to discuss what’s going on
Everytime that you don’t want to tell me what is wrong
 
(Phoebe)
Feels like I keep giving all to you
But I never get anything back
Feels like I keep calling out for you
