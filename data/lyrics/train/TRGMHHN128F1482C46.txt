Who is this man
That follows me
This blue eyed boy
Who wants to be

This worthy cause
Of human kind
This pawn set up by time

Like a bright light on the horizon
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying
He'll drive you away, he'll drive you insane
But then he'll remove all of your pain
Like a bright light on the horizon
Shining so bright, he'll get you flying
He'll get you flying, he'll get you flying
...
