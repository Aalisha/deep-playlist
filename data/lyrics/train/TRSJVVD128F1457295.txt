Something about the way she walks
The way she wears her hair
Something about the way she talks
She makes her meaning clear
Animal grace, the angel face
She gets it all for free

You'll be sorry, believe it
She used to put that on for me
Fire's in her eyes but eyes can lie
Blinded by the light of the stars

She's a mean mistreater, and you just can't leave her alone
She's a mean mistreater, no, you can't leave it alone
