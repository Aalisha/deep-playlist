My mother spent 10 years sitting by a window
Scared if she spoke she would die of a heart attack
She listened as her dreams silently screamed
They drowned like little dolphins caught in a fishnet

Dear world i'm pleased to meet you

Hey everybody when you walk the walk
You gotta back it all up you gotta talk the talk
Hey everybody when I hear the knock
Don't wanna measure out my life to the tick of a clock

Hey everybody when my daddy died
He had a sad sad story written in his eyes
Hey everybody when you walk the walk
You cannot measure out your life to the tick of a clock

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drum
I wanna walk to the beat of my own drum
I wanna walk to the beat of my own drum
I wanna walk to the beat of my own drum

Hey everybody
When you walk the walk you gotta back it all up
But can you talk the talk
Hey everybody when I hear the knock
Don't want to measure out my life to the tick of a clock
Hey every Hey everbody

I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums
(Say what?)
I wanna walk to the beat of my own drums
(Say what?)
