You
I just wanna walk and talk with You
Every minute of my time with You
All I wanna be about is You
'Cause I can't live without You

Wherever I go I wanna see You
No matter who is watchin' me You
Everyday that I wake up You
'Cause I can't get enough of You

Lot of people callin' me
Tryin' to get my attention
Do some things I ain't suppose to
Lead me in the wrong direction

But the only road for me
Is to where ever You are
I will follow You wherever
No matter how near or far

You
I just wanna walk and talk with You
Every minute of my time with You
...
