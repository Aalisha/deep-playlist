Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door, door, door
Crazy little mama come knocking
Knocking at my front door
Crazy little mama come
Knock, knock, knocking
Just like she did before
I woke up this morning
With a feeling of despair
Looking for my baby
And she wasn't there
Heard someone knocking
Much to my surprise
There stood my baby
Looking in my eyes
Crazy little mama come
Knock, knock, knocking
Just like she did before
