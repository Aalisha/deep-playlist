Take a look around you, can't you feel the disease 
Some want to save their soul, some save the trees 
The whole world is going down 
Like a bottle rocket flies to it's death and 
I can't help but think that I might barely make it to my last breath 

Going, going, going down 
Can't you won't you hear the sound 
Going, going, going
