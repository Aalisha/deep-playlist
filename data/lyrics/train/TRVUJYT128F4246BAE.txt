Come on baby

Oh, no no no no no no.

We crack it up, we hit the top.
We're moving through time.
We're thunderous, mysterious and glorious.
We're born to born to born to
To raise some hell.
We speed at night move out of sight.
We break the chains.
Oh, we break the chains
Oh, yeah!

Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in the sky.
We are on the move.
And we will prove.
We're the strongest of them all.
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
United we stand.
