A Journey Fom A To B

I measured the distance from Heaven to Hell
How will we do only time will tell
Oh when you stop worrying
What anyone says doesn't mean a thing

Just tell me you're feeling it
And you're not disbelieving it

I'll pay you in kind or silver and gold
I want to ignore all the stories untold
Make me an offer I cannot refuse
You know if I win then that means you lose

Just say you believe in it
