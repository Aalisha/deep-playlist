You say that I'm your girl
And you tell me that I'm your little sugar-honey bunch
But I don't feel safe with you
cause in your world there's a lot of little sugar-honey bunch

I'm not the type of girl you need (oh no, no no)
My friends keep telling me again, and again, and again
I'm not your call girl
I'm not your call girl
I'm not your call girl
I'm not your call call girl, in the night
