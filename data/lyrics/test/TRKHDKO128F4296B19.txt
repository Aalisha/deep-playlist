Eyes open, I want to masturbate in a locked...
Eyes open, I want to masturbate in a locked...

Your lover is at yoga, breaking a sweat,
While you shoot mid-morning coffee nerved on the front steps.
Pouring its slave labor likelihood all over
Your wounded lung. everyone's allowed to have these thoughts.
After all, this is the song where you sing i am a drug addict for 8 bars.
It is a blessing to have rifle eyes in times of war.
One is lucky to go deaf over the course of one's life.
I love these legs.
In the speaking up and claiming of my projector,
It's a dancing fool moment happy taking the blame
For all my hammer marks and... dropped gavels... and eyes
Open, i want to masturbate in a locked planetarium.

I am a drug addict, i am a drug addict, i am a drug addict...
Iamadrugaddictiamadrugaddictiamadrugaddict...
