we`ve been sweethearts for so long
but now you say we`re through,
the love we shared is now a memory.
i had built a ship of dreams
and planned them all for you,
and now,
i guess,
what is to be will be.

i`ll sail my ship alone
with all the dreams i own,
drifting out across the ocean blue.
i`ll sail my ship alone,
though all the sails you`ve torn,
and when it starts to sink
then i`ll blame you.
