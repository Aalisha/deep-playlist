Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow

Life's too short to make a mistake
Let's think of each other and hesitate
Young and impatient we may be
There's no need to act foolishly
If we part, our hearts won't forget it
Years from now we'll surely regret it

Give me just a little more time
And our love will surely grow
Give me just a little more time
...
