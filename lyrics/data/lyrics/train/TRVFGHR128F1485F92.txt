She came from Greece
She had a thirst for knowledge
She studied sculpture at Saint Martins College
That's where I
Caught her eye
She told me that her dad was loaded
I said, "Well, in that case I'll have a rum and Coca-Cola"
She said, "Fine"
And then in thirty seconds' time, she said
"I want to live like common people
I want to do whatever common people do
I want to sleep with common people
I want to sleep with common people like you."
Well, what else could I do?
I said "Oh, I'll see what I can do."

I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why, but I had to start it somewhere
So it started there
I said, "Pretend you've got no money."
And she just laughed and said, "Oh, you're so funny."
I said "Yeah?
Well I can't see anyone else smiling in here
Are you sure
You want to live like common people
You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people
You want to sleep with common people like me?"
But she didn't understand

She just smiled and held my hand

Rent a flat above a shop
Cut your hair and get a job
