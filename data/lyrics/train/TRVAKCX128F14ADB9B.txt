I am
I am
I am
Oh They all fall
Like a million raindrops
Falling from a blue sky
Kissing your cares goodbye
Oh as They all fall
Like a million pieces
A tickertape parade high
And now you're free to fly

Carryin' a millstone malaise
It's been pulling down your gaze
You pound the pavement
It don't give or care
This weight ain't yours to bear

Why you holdin' grudges in old jars?
Why you wanna show off all your scars?
What's it gonna take to lay a few burdens down?
It's a beautiful sound

When they all fall
Like a million raindrops
Falling from a blue sky
Kissing your cares goodbye
Oh as They all fall
Like a million pieces
A ticker tape parade high
And now you're free to fly
...
