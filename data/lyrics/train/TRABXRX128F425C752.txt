I'm the icing on the cake
I'm the secret ingredient you're missing
I'm the sidewalk but I'm not complete
And I'm the reason that baby, you're trippin'
Ohh decisions you didn't make
I'm the chance you chose, not to take
And I'm the one you wish you were kissing
Pray for clear skies tonight
You better start wishin'

So you write the title
And I'll write the chapters
We can read a story
Of a love gone disaster
You write the moral
And I'll write the lesson
And we can read of love
That kept us, guessing
...
