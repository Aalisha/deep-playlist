Wanna take slow but you take it hard
Nobody told me it would go this far
Fucking taking everything in sight
You are the blister that never heals
I wasn't always this green and naive
It takes years to develop
This lie you believe
Slowly work my better half
Still just as worthless as fighting death

It's all because of you
My Body's bruised
It's all because of you
