Standing like a sore thumb out,
Notice your image is different.
Traits that change, it's just too quick,
Follow on clues and guess what,

That's what, it's like.
Follow your ups and downs,
It's safe to say that I can't tell.
All sense aside.

Left out in the cold,
Sight of your routine getting old.
Blame some indifference inside,
Taken on shapes not to selective.
