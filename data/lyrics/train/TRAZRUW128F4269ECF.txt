Lost in a dream
I don't know which way to go
If you are all that you seem
Then baby, I'm movin' way too slow

I've been fooled before
Wouldn't like to get my love
Caught in the slammin' door
How about some information, please?

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever
Or am I caught in a hit and run?

Straight up, now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together
Or are you just havin' fun?

Time is standing still
Waiting for some small clue
I keep getting chills
When I think your love is true

I've been fooled before
