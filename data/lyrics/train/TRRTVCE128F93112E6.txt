When all this mess will get me down we'll depart from Chinatown
Weaving in and out of line the sidewalk's full of merchandise
My nervous tic has got to quit my cheeks are chewed down to the bit
Up on the roof they're still around the hustling crowds still reach down
I go up there and light a leaf and wish our turn was next week
All pared off in a summer month that's back inside a haunted house
I pack my bags and feel the family is cried by millions
Empty and bad we're forced to think
Come dig me out my lucid brain

This wilderness up in my head
This wilderness up in my head
This wilderness needs to get right out of my clothes and get into my bedroom

Is there no reason it can't be the way it was musically?
My three best friends so casually just letting go so joyfully
If I let my work get tired, if I let my spirit cry out
Always be that fear battle is it just tryin to divide?
It makes me think my purest dreams are not what they're supposed to be
I trick myself when it is hard I've got to keep up, oh my god
