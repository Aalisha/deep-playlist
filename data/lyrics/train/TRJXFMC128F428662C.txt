Drove from Albuquerque to Ft. Smith, Arkansas
Then all the way to New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras
You should have seen... the craziness down there
What I really mean... I wish you were here

And we were down on Beale Street, Memphis, Tennessee
With the blues, the booze, the bar-B-Q's, our name on the marquee
And you should have seen... the crowd we drew in there
What I really mean... I wish you were here
