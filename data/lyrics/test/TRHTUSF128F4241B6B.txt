Slow down, please, slow down
I need to find peace anywhere in me
I feel like I'm under water, struggling to get air
I feel like I'm lost in this body, trying to get inside my head

I wanna know what im thinking what I'm feelin
What I want my life to be
I wanna know how I plan to make things easier
For everyone but me
