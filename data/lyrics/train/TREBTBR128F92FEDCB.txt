I used to be a sinner used to have my cake and eat it
They warned me of my fate but I was quite prepared
To meet it
You'll go to Hell they smiled at me
And told me of the roaring fires
But I was happy living wild
And fuelling my own desires
I was a wild man
Drinking, smoking and messing around with women
Lots of women
No, not swimming, women

I wanna go to Heaven
The place to be is right up there
I wanna go to Heaven
It's gonna be good so I won't despair

I decided to reform and pray
Beg mercy for my soul
I prayed in Church
Threw away my bad habits
Prayed out of Church
Adopted an entirely different role
I gave money to the poor
Until I was poor
But at least I ensured
That I would go up there
Instead of down below
