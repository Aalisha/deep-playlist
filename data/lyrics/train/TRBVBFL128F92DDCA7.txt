Baby send me money
That’s all she seemed to say
Baby send me money every night and every day
What about the lovin?
The love you promised me
The love you took -
Won’t give it all away for free

Aint no reason
No reason in the world
For you to ever treat me like you do now girl
Cause I’m a good man
I’m not so blind
Said I’m a real good man
A good man’s hard to find

Let’s get close, close together
...
