There's an ocean, and as far as I can see
It must end eventually
This distance is discreet
Slowly water, it will wash right over me
When perfection is deceit
If this thing was meant to be, it will be

And when the tall ships come to carry me
I'll be waiting patiently
And when the time has come for me to go
I will try to make you see

And when the tall ships come to take me home
It will be with dignity
And when the tall ships come ...
