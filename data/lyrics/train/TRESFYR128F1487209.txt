Verse 1

Look at my heart again
Look at the mess I've got it in
I'm learning to trust in You
To know that you'll see me

Through my pride
Through my shame
Into Your love
Into Your grace
I'm not looking back
Till I see Your face
I'm running straight to You

Chorus
---------
All I really want to do is to fall into
The emptiness that is
The space in-between us
To break this division
All I really want to do is to fall into
The emptiness that is
The space in-between us
Erase it and bring us together again
