When you walk, you don't leave tracks
When you talk, they don't talk back
Believing every word you say
But they don't know, they don't don't know

Secrets that you just can't keep
Promises that you made me
You twisted it to suit yourself
But now I know, I know, I know
Everything that I told you
You just smile and then you
Kiss and tell everything I say
Stuck inside your little web

Everybody wants to know, yeah
Lips that lie, caught in your trap
Sold me out and you just laugh
Tell me were friends until the end, yeah

But you don't mean it, don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it, no
