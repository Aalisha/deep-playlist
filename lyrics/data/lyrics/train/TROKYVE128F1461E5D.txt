Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say I won't stay
In a world without love

Birds sing out of tune
And rain clouds hide the moon
I'm OK, here I'll stay
With my loneliness

I don't care what they say I won't stay
In a world without love
...
