I sat there looking ugly, looking ugly and mean
I knew what you were saying, you were saying to me
Baby's got some new rules
Baby said she's had it with me

It seems a shame to waste your time on me
It seems a lot to waste your time for me
Left me to love
What it's doing to me

There's a lot of honey in this world
Baby this honey's from me
You've got to do what you do
Do it with me
