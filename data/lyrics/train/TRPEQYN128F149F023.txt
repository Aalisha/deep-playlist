Law of the land
Well, well, well, well
Some people are always heaven made
Some people will live impermanent for the rest of their days
Time marches on
Yesterday is better than tomorrow
Life is uncertain, let me hear you say 'yeah'
That is that, oh yes it is
There'll be days of sunshine and laughter
But don't forget you will have to shed some tears - oho

It's the law of the land - my brother - oh
Whether you like it or you'll understand - ah hey hey
It's the law of the land - hey hey hey hey
'Cause made by almighty men

Live by the good book if you're able
You must play your cards on top of the table
When you gamble you either win or lose
