When it happened
Something Snapped inside me
Made me wanna hide
All alone on my own, all alone on my own
I stood up on the stand my eyes shut tight
Didn't wanna see anybody
Feeling alright, having a good time
Doing alright, doing alright
Doing alright, doing alright

I saw into the dancing crowd
Felt like screaming out loud
I saw you standing there
Saw your long, your long hair

Opened up my eyes baby
