No strength to carry on, carry me, carry me
I feel your hand slipping and it's scaring me
All my dreams have died
Push mountains and I'll sing into their valleys and subside

Difference is yet to hold hands
While we swim like fish and fly like birds, we are still yet to hold hands
Our greatness was gathered into an oasis
Which the plagues stirred t he sands and swarmed us in it's barren lands.

The sea of tears swallowed us in it's tide
Facing death, no reason to go on
