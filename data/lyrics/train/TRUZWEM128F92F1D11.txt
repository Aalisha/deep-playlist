Hey, hey, hey, h-hey, hey
What you say, get dis money
If they say what you gon' do today, just say
Hey I wanna get paid, pay day, pay day, pay day

Hey, hey, hey, h-hey, hey
What you say, get dis money
If they say what you gon' do today, just say
Hey I wanna get paid, pay day, pay day, pay day
Pay day, pay day, pay day

We dedicate this to these people out here gettin' bank
Where the oops you lose the money it's reality
Never front on a click that you can't evaluate
See I got things out here I need to situate

I got a fresh ass car on some gloss paint
People walking down the street until they feet stank
I got accountants out here handling big thangs
As I slip into the crib wit the sashay
Have my room wit the shark wit the big tank
Don't get mad 'cause I'm doing things you just can't

Hey, hey, hey, h-hey, hey
What you say, get dis money
If they say what you gon' do today, just say
