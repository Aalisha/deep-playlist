Aw, comin' through fo' real, we, Cypress Hill

Oh baby, got that crunk for yo' trunk goin' gangsta crazy
We some real life hustlers playin' games in the street
We got that low rider scrapin', dippin' on three
(Low rider)
So pop your collar, give a holla, throw yo' dubs in the air
We tear the roof off the mother, lady let down yo' hair
Playa do that thang that make you feel alright

(Low rider)

Smoke that tree, crack that brew, we gettin' freaky tonight
Now when people are done, bumpin' they head to this
You wonder why you wanted anything instead of this
We been makin' you bounce for many years already
Rock steady and cut many niggaz to confetti
But I just want to blaze it up
Whether it's the mic or a spliff, yes, my gift is to amaze you all
Thought I couldn't come for ten my friend but guess what?
I slay niggaz and still savin' my best nut
(Low rider)
But you better cover your eyes 'cause you never know when
I spit it out and start some flowin'
I drop rhymes that grow like trees you're smokin'
Ear drums feel like lungs, your brain's chokin'

Just let it soak in, seep in, creep in, I'm keepin'
All you motherfuckers in the deep end
