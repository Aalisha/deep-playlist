Your world is an ashtray
We burn and coil like cigarettes
The more you cry your ashes turn to mud

It's the nature of the leeches the virgin's
Feeling cheated
You've only spent a second of your life

My world is unaffected there is an exit here
I say it is and then it's true
There is a dream inside a dream
I'm wide awake the more i sleep
You'll understand when i'm dead
I went to god just to see, and i was looking at me
Saw heaven and hell were lies
When i'm god everyone
Die, can you feel my power?
Shoot here and the world gets smaller
