I got a freaky freaky freak, give you a freak you turns em out
I put them hoes in a row and turn out Queens no doubt
Don't need a vest, but flow like bullets freely through shootouts
I be the real supernatural, so check it out
I was concieved in the center of an inferno
The ninth month I slipped out my mom's vaginal
Cavity, now I'm surrounded by creeps and freaks
Had to watch my back in the New York streets
Fly, like an aeroplane,
more powerful than the engine of an A train won't let it stress my brain
You know the fame that has men sold and bought
In a single bound, I let the criminal court
Walk through the desert and don't perspire
Touch the microphone, the whole joint catches afire
Use the opportunity to call the devil a liar
And I won't stop flipping shit til I'm forced to retire
Because...

...that's how I'm living
(Chorus)
Cuts:
"Now You know, goddamn"
"mass confusion niggaz losin by the minute tryin to win it"
...
