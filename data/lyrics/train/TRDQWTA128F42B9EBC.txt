I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi

And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
But don't get me wrong

Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time

I don't wanna wreck your Friday
