Don't look at me
Mm, mm,
Yeah, eah, oh, ooh,

Everyday is so wonderful, and suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure, from all the pain
Feel so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes words can't bring me down, Oh no
So don't you bring me down today
