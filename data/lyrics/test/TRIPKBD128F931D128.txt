The story is told of the power of gold
And its lure on the unsuspecting
It glitters and shines, it badgers and blinds
And constantly needs protecting

Balance the cost of the soul you lost
With the dreams you lightly sold
Are you under the power of gold?

The letters and calls got you climbing the walls
And everyone wants a favor
They beg to remind you of times left behind you
You know the past is a loser

The face you're wearing is different now
...
