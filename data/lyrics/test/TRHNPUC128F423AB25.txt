She gives me everything I need 
Everything except a guarantee 
She doesn't know that I'm losing sleep, 
Though, does she now 

No matter how hard I try 
She has a reason just to pass me by 
She makes me cold in the summertime 
Doesn't she now 

Oh Katie Q 
Can I be with you 
I know the love is true 
My Katie Q 

I love your skin 
And I love all within 
You make me wanna sin 
My Katie Q
