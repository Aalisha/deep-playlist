Hello Miss Heartbroke
Sit your sweet self down
It's good to see your dancin' feet back out on the town
Rumor has it you've had trouble with your man
I've had trouble of my own, I think I understand

We'll put out your old flame
We'll build a bigger fire
I'll pick up where he let you down
And take you so much higher
And if his memory comes around
And you think you still care
We'll burn that bridge when we get there
