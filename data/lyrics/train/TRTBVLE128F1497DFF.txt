Home is where beds are made and butter is added to toast
On a cold afternoon you can float room to room like a ghost
Take the creche out and argue about who gets to set up the kings
And I know that it's home because that's where the stereo sings
"((Otis_Redding: I've_Got_Dreams_To_Remember|I've got dreams, dreams to remember.))"
But not even home will be with you forever

It's Christmastime and the plane flies me over white hills
To a town in a dream where the sky, it is frozen and still
And a room that's not mine but it's just like I left it before
