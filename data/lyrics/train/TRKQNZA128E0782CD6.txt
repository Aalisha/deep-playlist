New York City boy
you'll never have a bored day
'cause you're a New York City boy
where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

When you're a boy
some days are tough
lying on your bed
playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp
you gotta escape
Wanna go and wander in the ticker-tape
You feel
The deal
is real
You're a New York City boy

So young,
so run
into New York City
