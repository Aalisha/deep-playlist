I don't wanna be no soldier - I don't wanna shoot no gun,
I don't wanna drop no bomb - I don't wanna hurt no one,
I don't wanna fight no battles - I don't wanna settle no score,
I don't even understand - What we're fightin' for,
No it ain't my war.

That's the way of the world - That's what they tell me,
That's the way of the world - They can't sell me,
That's the way of the world - I can't explain it,
That's the way of the world - But we can change it.

We're burnin up the ozone layer - We're walkin on a real thin wire,
...
