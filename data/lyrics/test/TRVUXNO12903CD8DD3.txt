(Oh, yeah) come on, children
(Oh, yeah) hey

Can you do the Jerk
Come on, let's work
Move your shoulders up and down
Your feet don't leave the ground

Friends, there's nothing to it
If you're young or old
All it takes is soul

And I just wanna know
Can you Jerk like me
Come on, children, hey
(Can you Jerk like me)
Come on, children now
(Can you Jerk like me)
Hey, baby, I just wanna know
Can you Jerk like me, hey, baby
