Step inside and steal some time
Hide and seek is on your mind
Think you'll find your destiny
Shallow grave is all you'll see

There's raindrops around
All darkness, no sound
Your lips wet and fine I'll let you in my mind
A kiss for the night
The black widow's now inside
I now know your dreams ain't what they seem

Better watch out when you close your eyes
Cos I can see your lies
Little lady try to sleep tonight
The devils got your eyes

Step inside and steal some time (steal some time)
Hide and seek is on your mind
Think you'll find your destiny (destiny)
Shallow grave is all you'll see
Step inside and steal some time (steal some time)
Hide and seek is on your mind
