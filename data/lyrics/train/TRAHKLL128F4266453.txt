There comes a time when baby you and me
We gotta work it out whatever it will be
It feels so right but somewhere deep inside
You dont know how you feel you dont know if its real

'cause Love don't come easy
Do you want it
Do you need it
'cause Love dont come easy

There comes a time when you wake up one day
