Freedom ... free the man

I wanna feel so free
I wanna feel so free
This time I'm free
This time I'm free to do what I want
This time I'm free
This time I'm free to do what I want

Free up mother land
We go free Africa
Free up the hungry youths
In the place Rwanda
Freedom is a right and it's no privilege
Come follow me
Freedom is a right and it's no privilege
We callin' on the juntas all over the place
...
