I told Mary about us.
I told her about our great sin.
Mary cried and forgave me,
Then Mary took me back again,
Said if I wanted my freedom
I could be free ever more.
But I don't want to be,
And I don't want to see
Mary cry anymore.

Oh, DEVIL WOMAN,
DEVIL WOMAN, let go of me.
DEVIL WOMAN, let me be,
And leave me alone.
I want to go home.

Mary is waitin' and weepin'
Down in our shack by the sea.
Even after I've hurt her,
Mary's still in love with me.
DEVIL WOMAN it's over,
