It's the season the trees die
The birds don't sing anymore
The rivers never come back
Nature dies out.
It's the season the trees die
The birds don't sing anymore
The rivers never come back
Nature dies out.

Focus tomorrow's horizon
Sorrow means no future
Cover my face
With my guilty hands

This tragic future
Destinied to hurt never heal
What end can save me?
