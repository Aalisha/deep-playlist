Can you see her, slender and pale?
But so graceful she walks down the stairs
A perception of musk fills the air
The kiss of darkness, the baron's own heir

In the tower... shadows lurk
Full moon power... the Baroness' noble sleep
The daily escape... nature's mistake
Soon awake... ready for her nightly slay

She's so ruthless... evil, grotesque
In her glory... the Baroness... godless
Blood is precious... so delicious
Vampire white... ferociously vicious breed

Her heart is bleeding, time is fleeing
...
