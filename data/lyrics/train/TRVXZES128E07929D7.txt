(written by: Gilby Clarke)
I got this dirty politician
In my pocket full of greed
I take him out for parties
And let him do his thing
Did you see that silver T.S.
Showing off his new glam, man
Then he pushed his platform boots
Through his bitch's velvet pants

I'm gonna, wanna get it
I'm gonna, wanna spank it
I'm gonna wanna spend it
Faster than you can
I'm gonna, wanna get it
I'm gonna, wanna spank it
I'm gonna, wanna spend it
Faster than you can
