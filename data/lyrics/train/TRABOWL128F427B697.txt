Mechanical shutdown due to reactorcore meltdown
And outdated parts collapsed and discharged
Autopilot on emergency power from
Random fuel devoured
Red alert sirens sighing
Rusty pipelines dying
Empty hull shatter into cold dark matter
Unknownspacepioneer the end draws near
What once was acrobatically flying
Is now burnt out and dying
Now that I am shipwrecked
A piece of shit falling
Through space and time
Moaning oh why oh why did not I
Just stop in time
