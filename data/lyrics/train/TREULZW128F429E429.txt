Make it happen
let it fly
go and get it
I won't mind

but remember you're alone now
and no one's gonna catch you when you fall
you're really on your own now
and no one's gonna need what you can offer anymore

still I'm with you
day and night
I've got to tell you
I think you're right

I can be so disabladging
I can be so mean with what I use
though I'd like to say I'm trying
...
