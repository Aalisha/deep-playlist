The thrill here is quicker than you'd think
The way some jet-lagged bar kept pouring the wine
From over their heads then sit back down again
Four times is once too much for luck
And that's how many times the clock struck
I wandered home saying your name

The arches here were built 'cause they don't fall,
The cathedrals to make you feel small,
That you might find your small soul.
But leave the preaching to the president.
The crowd cheers. His eyes get wet.
I'm full as it is, I'm full as it is
...
