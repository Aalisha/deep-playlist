See me coming down the road
I'm coming down for you
Standing by the end of the line
What you gonna do

Intuition can't you see
Mistreat or got the shake on me
Fire and water rollin' dice
I'm gonna get you
No matter the price

I'm a hard man fight
I'm an easy man to please
Baby don't you mess with me
'Cause you couldn't take the heat

I wanna be your man
I wanna be your lover baby
