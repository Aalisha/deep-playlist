I took, one look, in your eyes tonight,
And I saw, it all there in a different light,
Just when I thought I was out of the rain,
Suddenly I'm in a hurricane,
And all around me voices in the wind.

Say again, what I know I know,
It's time, it's time, to learn about letting go,
Why does it feel like I just exist,
Stuck out here on the precipice?

They say the future's out of our hands,
So why is it making demands?

If I have to make up my mind,
Maybe now is the time to decide.
