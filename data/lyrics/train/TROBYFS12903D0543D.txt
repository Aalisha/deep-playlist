Scratch my back again, my butchy girlfriend
Pay me, or I'll come again
I'll take your law into my hand

LOW, I've hit rock bottom
The only one who cares about me is my own kind
NO, my crime is my passion
The only one who cares about me is my own kind

(Chorus)
Kick on the upperclass
Take them out with the trash
Kick on the upperclass
The battle lies in my hand
Kick on the upperclass
Take them out with the trash
Kick on the upperclass
End of class

He's just a millionare with a tasteless touch of class
...
