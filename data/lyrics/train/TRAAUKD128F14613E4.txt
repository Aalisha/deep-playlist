another day all alone again
someone please love me
another game another broken heart
why do i do this to myself
I could look and try to find someone who won't leave me lonely
Then i found i didn't need to search
you were the one and you came to me

you fought for my heart and you have won it
you've taken me over and I like that
i tried other love but i couldn't feel it
i'm so glad you found me because

I need you so close to me
cuz ur the Only one who makes my life complete
(Oh Lord I)
I know it took so long to see
you are my security
you won't go away from me
and now I know that I don't ever have to worry
Cause my heart feels so very free
You're my security

another day here i go again, drive my self insane
stop to think how could i forget
you're with me every single day
