You had enough so you moved out
To find out what the world's about
Then you hit 21 years old

Something snapped and now all of your stories don't make much sense
Losing touch with your job, your school, parents, where are your friends?
Static grew and somehow faces end up black and blue
You got me out of bed for what?

Watch you getting drunk and yelling "fuck 'em all"
The fall flew in and fell on you
Flood the room with wine, you float across the floor
The war spilled out, I'm wading through

Talk about the kid who took the window down
And fell in a snowbank, broken man
I wonder if he thinks he should've took the stairs?
