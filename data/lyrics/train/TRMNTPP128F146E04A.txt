Words and music by roddy frame

How does it feel
To have time on your side
And never worry too much?
Never alone, kicking at stones
As though you're never been touched
Touched by the feeling
That nothing is real
It's all an illusion
Wheels in the drive
One of the guys
With nothing to prove

Beautiful girl, how in the world
Could you be suffering so
Life's lost it's appeal
