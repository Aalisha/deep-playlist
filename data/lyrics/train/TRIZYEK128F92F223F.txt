"Grey Sky Eyes"

Grey sky, always in your eye
Where is the girl behind the cloud?
Grey sky, always floating by
But I only peek when I'm allowed

You welcome me in
And your veil is so thin
But the mystery continues to grow
You say you must realize
That my grey sky eyes
Neither rain, nor they glow... now you know
...
