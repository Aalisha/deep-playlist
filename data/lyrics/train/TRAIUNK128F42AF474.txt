Mafia

I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction
I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Start to stand but my knees go weak
What's happening to me?
In the dark, can you tell me what it means?

I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
You're the reason why

You're always on my mind
When you come around I get shy
When I see you (See you)
When I see you

I never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you
When I see you

I scribble x and o's in my notebook
