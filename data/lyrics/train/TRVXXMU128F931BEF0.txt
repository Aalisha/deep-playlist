Jackson 5
Don't wanna see
Michael
No no no
No no no
Jackson 5
Tomorrow
No no no
No no no
Don't wanna see
Michael
No no no
No no no
Love has brought us to a fork in the road
Giving us a choice of two ways to go
My hope has always been to stay with you
But you like to leave me so all alone
Jackson 5
Don't wanna see tomorrow without you girl
How can you say it has to be this way?
