How does she break me down
Why am I still around?
Piece by piece till I fall
When did I lose my balls

I'm not gonna think about it - this will be the last time
Sobsodded and broken-hearted, well this will be the last time
So stop tryin' to get me started, cause this will be the last time
This will be the last time, This will be the last time
That I will think about...

All the ways ya pushed me down
Held my face to the ground
...
