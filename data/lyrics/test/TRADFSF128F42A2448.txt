Noon siesta floating off the radio
May has come to rescue Central Park
Watch the kids revive the sounds of Mexico
It gives them a spark and something to breathe
The beauty of everything unseen

The figure of eight goes 'round
It leaves you alive where you started
It's good to be up when you're down
So what were you waiting for?
If all of your past is now
The figure of eight, the figure of eight goes around

These are days you read about in magazines
These are times they used to call a book
Every option sitting here in front of me
