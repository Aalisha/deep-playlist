Got my window open wide
Got my window open wide
Got a good woman by my side
Got a good woman by my side

Now this kind of day has no night
Yeah this kind of day has no night
Ain't got much on my mind
Ain't got much on my mind

'Cause I know something good this way comes

Now watching the streets filling up
Watching the streets filling up
In the shade of the summer sun
In the shade of the summer sun

Got sweet apple pie on the stove
Got sweet apple pie on the stove
