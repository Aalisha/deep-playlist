Go West
Miscellaneous
All Day All Night
Anyone can see, all I wanna be is by your side
What you do to me make me feel like light up inside
And I don't care what they say, baby
I love your way with me
When I look into your eyes
I see just what I want to see
'Cause you make me believe yeah yeah

You know I dream about you girl, all day
Until the minute I can get away
'Cause I'm in heaven in your arms, all night
And all I wanna do is hold you tight
I never knew I could be so in love
