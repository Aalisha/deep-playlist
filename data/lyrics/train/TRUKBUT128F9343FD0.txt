Through the fires of night
The warrior feels the
Start of the fight
Through the light in your eyes
The blackest cold
Is brighter make it right, alright

Through the mystery seam
There's cover fire
By a haze
In the purple rain
It's black and white
He only feels the pain
Pain, pain
Pain, pain
Pain, pain

The personalities
Are never as they seem
The music makes you scream
Oh, oh
The personalities
Are never as they seem
The music makes you scream
We're back to fight the fleas
Fight the fleas
