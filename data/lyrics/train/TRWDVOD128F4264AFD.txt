there were times when I just wanted
to get the passion started
but I had to wait till you were mine
every time we got together
I could tell that you were better
than all the other girls in my life
now that you're with me
I can see clearly, no doubt
it was worth all my time
whenever I'm in need
you always seem to know
how to make it all right, then you
give me all your lovin girl
give me all of you
you make me feel so good inside
you know just what to do
give me all your lovin girl
give me all of you
if you give me all your lovin girl
I'll give my all to you
you're so happy your my girl
let me show how much I care
when you need me baby I'll be there
wanna hold you in my arms
wanna keep you close to me
