Born unto fire and passion
a warrior princess to be
the maiden hero in her prime
earning her nobility

Rebellion and rage were all she knew
in the time before he chivalry
malevolence fading away
on the face the enemy

Staring boldly at fire
with majestic eyes of ice
a lifetime quest never to end

There's no rest for the wicked
Xena charging on to battle
fighting for the honour of her countrymen

Danger lurking in this mist
