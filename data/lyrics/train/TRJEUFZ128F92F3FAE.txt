Standing in line, marking time
...
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by

As he catches the poor old lady's eyes
Just for fun he says, "Get a job."
That's just the way it is
Some things will never change

That's just the way it is
Ah, but don't you believe them
Said hey, little boy, you can't go where the others go
...
