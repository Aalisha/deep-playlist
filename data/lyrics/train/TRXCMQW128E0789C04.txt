Cracked windshield
Crumpled up cans and a beat up bag of red man chew
Fix a flat, jonny cash box set
Half a dozen parking ickets that I aint paid yet
Litten on that long bed seat
I got my shot gun girl right next to me

chorus:
Four wheel turnin
Two hearts burnin
We go runnin wild
Gonna make a million
Memories for every hundred
...
