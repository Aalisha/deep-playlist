Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents on the verge of drastic ways
Can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying

Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter

Someone hear me please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe and I can hardly take it
...
