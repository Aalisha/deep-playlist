[Kam]
Will I trip as my dick the organ I think with
Are y'all ever gon' see me and my click sport pink shit
Do me and bro got the same flow
Money and fame, is that all I'm in the game for
Should I floss at my peers
Is that what motherfuckers that's struggling really want to hear
Is east coast gangsta rap the hardest
Do west coast radio, support their own artist
Am I just gon' fade out
Will y'all fall the trap this conscious rap played out
Is all money good
Am I gon' ever say "Fuck the hood" and go Hollywood
Do I need to roll with some security
All that glitter and gold, is hip-hop still pure to me
Am I a sucker for trim
You think you could come back to me after you done fucked with him

[Chorus: Tracy Lane]
No, I don't think so; no, I don't think so
No, I don't think so; no, I don't think so
Some man gotta be gettin' pimped in the game
