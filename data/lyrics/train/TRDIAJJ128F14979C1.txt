I'm caught in excitement
An unusual spell
It's pure in a sense
And abstract from our lives
And we talked a lot,
Abstraction came into focus

Her tales of the tour
And a hardcore life
Were unmatched by the
Pop sub-culture in mine
And we talked a lot
And soon it would come into focus
(I tried to focus, I tried to focus! woah!)

There's no time for fighting
Any sex is personal
