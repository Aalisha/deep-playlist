One's not enough
I won't stop 'til I've given you up
Here, right as I am, it's hard having fun
It's much easier said than it's done

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

No, you don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't have you anymore

But I thought you should know
You don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
'Cause I can't take it anymore, oh

The room's still now when I'm lying
'Cause the well of the night has gone dry
When they ask to behave I paid them no mind
Now I doubt if I'd have been so kind

Hold me like before
Hold me like you used to
Control me like you used to

No, you don't move me anymore
And I'm glad that you don't
