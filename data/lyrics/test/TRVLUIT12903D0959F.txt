I know what you think of me but I had to move on
I know I'm landing on my feet and the hating's gone
Well, here I go down this path again
They say every road must come to an end
When the sun rises then falls into the dawn
Said everybody knows what's going on

All my blood has been forgotten
And all my tears have dried alone

Until the end begins
It seems that everything is coming back again
The end begins
Sometimes you have to start where you begin
