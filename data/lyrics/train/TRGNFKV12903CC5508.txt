You'll burn my flag
You'll crash my car
You'll kill my cat
You'll break my balls
You'll watch my cities fall
but not tonight

You're the devil's own
You'll cheat and lie
and you won't stop until
you stole the glimmer from my eye
but not tonight
Cause i won't let you
i know you want to
but not with me
Its all so clear to see
you can try to destroy me but not tonight
cause i won't let you through
you can fight if you like some other time
you'll find i'm out of reach
your words can't hurt me i'm out tonight
