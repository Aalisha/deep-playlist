I always knew you were a landslide
Like plains are roofs until they fly
What you've been calling minor cracks dear
I fear are bound to shift to gaps of greed

Leave
Before they come and call you
Before you're stuck with me
Never ask for any meaning
Never ask me to be dealing
With the cure for what i? m healing
Wait in vain for prefab feelings

Now comes the time to face your plot dear
And to embrace this mental plague
I'm your neurotic countercrashtest
May i steal the engine from your burning wreck?
