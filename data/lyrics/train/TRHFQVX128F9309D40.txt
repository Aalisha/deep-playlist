Ive gotta have your love
Ive gotta have your love
Ive gotta hear you say baby hey youre the one that Im day dreaming of

Ive gotta have your love (Come on baby)
Ive gotta have your love (Come on baby)
I gotta hold you tight I would fight, punch and kick, scratch and bite push and shove
(Come on baby)

I need you every day
Why die if I couldnâ€™t have my way
