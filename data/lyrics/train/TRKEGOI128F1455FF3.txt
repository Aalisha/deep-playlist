Back in my shooldays acting the fool days
One and one and one makes three
And a man said, kid come and cut yourself
A piece of the big time

Armour clad forces riding Trojan horses
Never made sense to me
I didn't wanna be a part of the great
Debate on moonshine

Stop pay the price, they said to me
Take this advice. Your out of your head
Said stop hold the phone, this has to be
Cut to the bone. Too bad I see red
I see red I see red I see red

When the sly man stumbles twists and he tumbles
He always lands on his feet
and he sets his face towardsBR> the far horizon

Want you come this way can't you go that way
...
