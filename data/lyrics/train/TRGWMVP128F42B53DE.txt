A short delay,
The parrot blues
Little voices mimic you
It's not so hard to make that sound

So watch your back,
The Ides of March
Cut your hair like Joan of Arc
Disguise your will
They'll find you out

And when they do...
Look out

There's money lenders inside the temple
That circus tiger's gonna break your heart
Something so wild turned into paper
If I loved you, well that's my fault

A bitch in heat,
The alpha male
Not something she'd ever tell
Except when she got deathly high
...
