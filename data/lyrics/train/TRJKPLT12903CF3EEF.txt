Learning ways to fly
just never too high to die
pushing limits into the ground
Until I never come down
Burning through lifetimes without form
pure energy I am the shattered norm
I'm the lost one chasing colors to the sun
colors bleed but never fade
I'll just fade away
To swim these sentient seas
windows into eternity
...
