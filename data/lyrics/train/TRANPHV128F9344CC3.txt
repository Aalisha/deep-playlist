nervous breakdown come take me away
nervous breakdown cafeteria today
i fell down on the floor oh god i spilled my milk
someone pull up my pants i think i need some help

and i can't believe that i'm fallin
no i can't believe i'm fallin again
will you visit me at the bottom?
yeah i'm fallin
gonna give the devil his dues
