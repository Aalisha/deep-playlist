Baby let me know
I'll give even more

I heard about your past
About the tears you shed, the pain you felt
And I just want to ask
Could you just try again
And I know about your friends
The way they lied to you and used you
Well here and now it ends
Can I just duce my love to you?

If you would trust me enough to let your guard down
