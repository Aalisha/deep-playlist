I've been asleep for far too long
And in my dreams you sang this song
You had the hottest red dress on
I only want for you to stay
I know I'll lose you when I wake
Alarms will sound and now you're gone

Wake up a little older
Get back move it closer
I shout "Baby please just let me out"
I feel you creep into my bones
Every time I wake up alone
You feel so sweet inside my lungs
Taste it on the tip of my tongue

My desire set ablaze
