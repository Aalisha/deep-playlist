God I think the world is about to collapse! C’mon
The buildings and walls are all falling
If you don’t know, you should by now
It’s the motherfucking Snowgoons (Snowgoons in the building)
And you’re rocking with Singapore Kane
And Slaine
Motherfucker fucking around no more
No one's fucking around. C'mon
It’s 2008 dummy

All eyes are staring at me, people watching the villain
They see my rising with the rebels to the top of the building
Being stuck down at the bottom is the vilest feeling
Desolate soul for vodka that’s swilling, popping the pilling
Jealously swirling in their eyes, they’re plotting to kill 'em
But I been there and believe me, I ain’t forgotten the feeling
I lived the dark nights and heard the pain crash from the ceiling
I mean the raindrops hang in ‘caine spots with dealers
Now fighting a different war, smoking less, sniffing more
Every week a different chore, every month a different tour
I got a gang of haters everyday I piss 'em off a little more
What you think I got a fucking pistol for
