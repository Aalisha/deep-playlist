Ohh, I am tireless, sub zero, comin' from the wireless
Won't be no scenery, no part of the machinery
I go on and on but never below
So, now you see me and know, you can check it and go

'Cause I'm so bored that I can't even pretend no more
It's so pathetic that I'm rolling around on the floor
Laughing at one big gag
And every now and then they pull another rabbit out of the bag

Of sad diversions, useless tedious excursions
Roll into unrealistic, crypto-fascistic
Comedy doctrine, kick the ballistics
Again and again and again, just say when

Ya had enough, sad enough or mad enough
To do something simple and kind
Now is the time
A change of state of mind

I am a loner, a zoner, I utilize the microphone
And if they try a tap, I leave 'em hangin' on the telephone
