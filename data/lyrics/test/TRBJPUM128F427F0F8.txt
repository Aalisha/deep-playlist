You caught me in the middle dazed on the carpet
I was following the lines that move like more snakes thinking
Something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side, standing to your right come on

You caught me in the middle dazed and confused

You got the devil on your side, standing to your right come on, come on

I get along, I get along
I get along, I get along, get along
(Get along, get along, get along, get along)
