Standing here helpless
Where do I go if you leave me alone?
Where do I turn now if it don't work out?
As far as I can see, this isn't the way that you said, it would be

Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded
If you walk away now, you leave me empty handed
Don't leave me like this, don't leave me stranded
Don't leave me now, don't leave me

Wasn't it you who brought me here to the place lovers go
