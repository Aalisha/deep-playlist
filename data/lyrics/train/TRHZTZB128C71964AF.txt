I got this feeling that I need to express
Laying it out so you don't have to guess
I'm making myself vulnerable
But you keep holding back, so scared to let go
If you're looking for love I think I could be the one, the one, the one

Tell me why you wanna be so cruel
Acting like you don't feel the way that you do
We've got the strongest compatibility
I just wanna explore the possibilities
But if you only wanna play games with me, I ain't the one, the one, the one
