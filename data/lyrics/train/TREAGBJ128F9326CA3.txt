Take a step outside
The boundaries we live in
Get to know yourself
The real you, the real me
Join the hands of faith
That hold you, that know you
Let the love go free
It's in us, it's in me

Love lives in me
Love's free to be
Pain grows to burn
Lessons concerned
Unconcerned

Open the eyes of all
...
