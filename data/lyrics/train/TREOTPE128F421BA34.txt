When you stood there
As the glaze grown over your eyes
Still waiting and nervously gazing out
Through the pines

I'm sure you got a little tired of standing
Like a man with a stick (pike) in his hands
In the mountains

Rest your tired feet
And take in life with me [x2]

So justice is far from us
And righteousness

We look for the light
