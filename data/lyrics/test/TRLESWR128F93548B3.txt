With the winds of fortune they went
Out to the sea to find land of the free
Set their sail for the setting of sun
Placed their hope in the journey begun

Hear the captain cry his commands
Feel the swaying of the ship, Can you
see the approaching storm?
That will take, will take it's price

[Chorus:]
Sail, sail, sail away, now
Dream, dream of green shores
