While you're hung up on yesterday
You got nothing going today
While you're hung up on tomorrow
All the good times are slipping away
Life is right now and if you take it
The share will be the biggest amount
There's only one way to make it
That's making every minute count

Making every minute count
Making it groovy
Making love, making it now
If you know a better way of goin'
You know you'd better show me how
