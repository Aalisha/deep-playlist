For decades I have waited for your response
Cause deep inside I felt that we had bonded long ago
Now a lifetime has passed before my eyes
But I've seen nothing but your face behind the veil of that snow white dress
We were ment to be for eternity
Spent your twenties between the sheets with everyone exept me
What was left for me
Couldn't eat sleep couldn't be
Call it insanity
My blushing bride I'm back
