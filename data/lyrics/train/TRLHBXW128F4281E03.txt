The only frequency I heard was you,
I heard you're going through some changes.
Changes that you know you need to make,
they're so difficult to make, but it's OK.

If only you would take the time to look inside and see that you were changing
Of all the remedies and tragedies you're old enough to fade away, and it's a shame

'Cause the only frequency, the only frequency I hear, the only frequency I hear is the only frequency I hear is you. Frequency the only frequency I hear, the only frequency I hear is you. The only frequency is you.
