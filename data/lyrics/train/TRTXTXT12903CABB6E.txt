The image of God invisible
The first born of all life
Before and within
He holds it all in
One name, one faith, one Christ

No one is good enough
To save himself
Awake my soul tonight
To boast nothing else

I trust no other source or name
Nowhere else can I hide
This grace gives me fear
And this grace draws me near
And all that it asks it provides
