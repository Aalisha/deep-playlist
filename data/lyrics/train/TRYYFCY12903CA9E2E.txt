Children, go where I send you
(How will you send me)
I'm gonna send you to that land
The land of a thousand dances

You gotta know how to pony
Like boney maronie
You gotta know how to twist
Stroll like this

Mashed potato
Do the alligator
Twist the twister
Like little sister

Then you get your ya yo
Say, hey, let's go, go
Get out on your knees
Do the sweet peas
