ROLLERBLADEYour eyes are brown
Your sky is grey
You gaze the sidewalks in your way
You reel around the fountain
Full of traffic spray

You could be white
You could be dealing cellulite
The crevices of plenty
Leave you petrified
Still you just rollerblade your life away
Gliding through the people all day
