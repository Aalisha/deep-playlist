I don't want to be the kind to hesitate
Be too shy, wait to late
I don't care what they say other lovers do
I just want to dance with you
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine,
So let it show, let it shine
Oh, if we have change to make one heart of two
Then I just want to dance with you

Chorus:
I want to dance with you
Twirl you all around the floor
That's what they invented dancing for,
...
