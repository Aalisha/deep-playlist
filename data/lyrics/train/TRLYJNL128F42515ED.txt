Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?
- I'm axing a question
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?

There are two roads before you
And you've gotta make a choice
Would you give your prince for this pauper
Would you make them sacrifice?
I know that he treats you good
And you're well looked after
Yet my question to the easy life
That's filled with fun and laughter

Would you give it all up, give it all up for me?
- I'm axing a question
Give up your easy life and your luxury
Would you give it all up, give it all up for me, ooeh
