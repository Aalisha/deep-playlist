The minutes are slipping away as we say our last goodbye
Bid the world a fond farewell
We'll share in a final embracement
When the lights begin to fade it's a tale they had to tell

I'm wiping the tears from your face
Though I can't control myself
God have mercy on us all
The chapter has ended a story
That only just begun
First the rise and then the fall

But don't let it end this way
Before you can go
There's something that I must say
