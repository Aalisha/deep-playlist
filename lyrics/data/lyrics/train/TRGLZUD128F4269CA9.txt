I could offer to you a thousand things
But with a lot of them you wouldn't bother.
I could buy you ten real diamond rings
But I'm sure that you would want another.
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away.

You have brought me a lot of things
But the main one that you've brought was trouble.
You put your finger to the trigger and you shot my heart.
Well now I'm really gonna burst your bubble.
I could take a plane and I could fly away
I could steal a car and I could drive away.

But I'm in too deep there's no getting out of it
In too deep no doubt about it.
In too deep there's no getting out of it
...
