So sweet, got me lookin' up, got me lookin' up to you
So sweet, got me lookin' up to you
So sweet, got me lookin' up, got me lookin' up to you

First impressions, handed just on how it could be
Often thinking that you could be the love I need
I'm looking forward to that sweet reality ... Oh yeah
I see myself rewarded with the love I need

And I'm believing got me looking up to you
What I'm recieving keeps me feeling like I do ... ah yeah

There's a thing never simplified ... oh no
Only mastered by those who take the time
Don't you know good judgement could keep it on your side
...
