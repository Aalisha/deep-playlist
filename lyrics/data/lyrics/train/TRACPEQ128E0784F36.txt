Please just let me stray
look the other way
i gotta do this alone
'cause im the only one here
dont misunderstand
youre the perfect man
but im not ready to go
and settle down with you
so close your eyes
close your eyes

Chorus
Im not who you think i am
let go, get out while you can
trust me
you dont, m you dont wanna see this
ill b tryin everything
knee deep into anything
trust me
