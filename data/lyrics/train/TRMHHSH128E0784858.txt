Once I could have held you
And never let you go
Now I see you calling me back
And I really do not know
"Velveteen, I want you back."
Things change and people change
And my mind just gets hazy
I truly thought I knew you
How wrong can you be
"Velveteen, I want you back."
Velveteen, Velveteen
Velveteen, Velveteen, Velveteen
Well it's been a while
And things have been wild
But I've learnt to smile
Yeah now I smile
I can't spend my life
Waiting to get hurt
When you pay the price
You own the dirt
But I still think of you
Yeah I think of you
Think of you
Do you think of me
Think of me
Like I think of you
Well the days go by
And the wheels still turn
When the night comes down
The fire still burns
And the mind is strong
But the heart it yearns
Then the pain was gone
But it's now returned
...
