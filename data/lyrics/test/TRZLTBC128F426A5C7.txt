[music composed and arranged by Buratto, Messina, Lonobile, Cartasegna, Gianotti, Agate; words by Messina]

One step into the night and the other through the light,
We don't care of what we are and we always wanna hide,
Days are goin'on, then another one will come,
But don't think 'cause other problems will fill up your brain

Strange armonies in the air,
We can' t anymore them hear,
Strange game of rhymes, we can't see,
Now takes control of my hand
...
