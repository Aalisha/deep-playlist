I look at you and I'm ready to pump
Luminous heartthrob ready to jump

Mama's dancin' with jellybone
You better watch out
Take you to the freak zone

Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Hard kiss – love chain
Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump it up – pump it up – pump it up – yeah

Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump – I'm a runaway train
Pump it up – give it up – turn up the track
Pump it up – pump it up – pump it up

Get serious get off the phone
Talk to me and make me moan
I said baby lose that phone
Rock me down to the jellybone

Motor runnin' double time
Machine is hummin'
Your body's mine
...
