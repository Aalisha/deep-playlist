How many tears can you hide
For you can't hide anymore
How can you keep it inside
When she says you need to be sure

How many tears can you hide
Before your heart is in danger
How many times do I die
Each time you're with a stranger

Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Is the sweetest thing (How many tears can you hide)
Your love (How many tears can you hide)
Means everything
But your love,... driving me insane
How long (How long)
Can I (Can I), Go on?
