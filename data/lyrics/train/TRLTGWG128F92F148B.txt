I'm just about ready
To give up on you.
(One more fight)
Then I will be through with you,
A change that I would not
Have expected to occur.

And every time that I
Look at you,
I'm reminded of what
We have been through.
This routine has become
So tiring;

I'm at a loss for words!

'Cause it's too hard, too hard
When you have lost control.
It was never as easy as it was
Before you and I lost touch.
This might sound crazy,
But I don't know
How to let you go.
