...
Candy talks to strangers
Thinks her life's in danger
No one gives a damn about her hair
It's lonely down on track street
She used to go by Jackie
The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers

...
Take a number where the blood just barely dried
...
Wait for something better

No one behind you
Watching your shadows
This feeling won't go
...
