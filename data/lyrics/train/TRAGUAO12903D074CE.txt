(E-40:)
Aight, one O this E Fizee
I gotta, I gotta thank my math teacher 'Count Dracula'
Who just teaches a brother how to, you know
Count his marbles, you know... what about you?

(Mack 10:)
You see I can't stop I won't stop til I check a mill
I need a super bad bitch and a house on the hill
365 seven days I believe crack pays
My estates been guarded by pitbulls and AK's
I'm straight cookin' them thangs movin weight like I should
Cause a nigga livin good don't mean he went Hollywood
Dog I practice my craft so each year I get better
To stay ghetto and clever and be richer than ever

(E-40:)
Fonzarelli man I thought you was a rebel I am
But tell me this then: why you move up out the ghetto?
Motherfucker I am the ghetto I beg your pardon
Nigga I was grindin tryna take niggas heads off
Flossin and fuckin hoes when you was kindergarden
Nigga this ain't 'Lenny Squiggy'
Nigga this E Fizee and Mack Tizee
Fuckin with italian romiane pasta chicken tortellini
30 odd 6 custodian with the scope far from Nickelodeon
No shit no joke southern Cali up north se we be rollin
Make a bitch purchase a gun report it stolen
Plead the 5th but don't snitch
No case cause every Po-Po and they mammy know
That 12 gauge equipment can be traced
