(Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww SHIT!)

Check it out
Yo, 1992 begins the new wave for the blunt rollers
You know what I'm sayin'?
The saga of the philly blunt continues
The flava's the P-Funk y'all, get wit it
Check it out...

(Verse 1)

Check out a new type of gimmick which is splendid
Since you're down with other shit, let's see if you're down with this
It's about.strictly trying to roll a blunt
When you get the hang of it, you'll catch more blunts than Archie Bunk
First of all you get a fat bag of ism
From uptown, any local store sells the shit friend
Purchase a philly, not the city of Philly
Silly punk, I'm talking 'bout the shit called the Philly blunt
Lick the blunt and then the Philly blunt middle you split
Don't have a razor blade, use ya fuckin fingertips
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip
Roll it in a motion then the top piece you lick
Seal it, dry it wit ya lighter if ya gotta
The results, mmmmmmmm... proper

(chorus)
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
