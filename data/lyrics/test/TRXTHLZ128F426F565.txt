I will go to another place, nowhere special just another town
You should come to the other place
Make it special and make no loss
Make it special and make mo loss

Cover the cost, cover the cost
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost

These extra expenses makes brilliant senses
All you have to do is take your chances
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost
These extra expenses makes brilliant senses, extra extra

These are the things that make it better
Are you ready for the city?
Is the city ready for you?
