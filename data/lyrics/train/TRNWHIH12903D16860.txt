Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Took us all away to New Orleans

I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowin' sad while bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
And Bobby clappin' hands we finally sung up every song that driver knew
