I think therefore I am
I live and so I wonder
programmed this empath me
And I see no religion
The circle never ends
the purpose never changes face
The circle never lies
but still it hides my life
To know I am machine
I learn perchance to dream
in digitized remorse
I replay your denial
I relive your betrayal
The circle never ends
the purpose never changes face
The learning now begins
my form assuming grace
I am conscious antithesis of flesh
