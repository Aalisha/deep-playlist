Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Everytime I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me... from me
Life's got to always be messing with me
(You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free
(So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain
(You wanna see the light)
I try to every night all in vain... in vain
Sometime I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
...
