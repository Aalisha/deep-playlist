(feat. Blitz, Kaos, Uno Dos)

[Ty Knitty]
One hand wash the other, I never shit on my niggas
I roll with them niggas that be pulling them triggers
I rep the dead and the living
We the best that did it, expenses we spend it
Big faces explosive guns we smash out dunns
IM3 coming through make way what you wanna do
Choose the fifth or get popped with the fifth
Either way you got no ends, I represent QB
The biggest hood in the world, there's too many of us
It's too easy to get touched
Catch you at a show take your 'dro take your ice
Catch you on the island while you rocking on the mic
Senting kites from down south
Cut that nigga from head to his mouth
He violated in the streets
Fronted like he wanted beef
Now it's a wrap, duke rather hang it up
We the mobb
We ain't no gang but we bang niggas up

[Uno Dos]
Besides rap I blaze niggas up
My ox shit, my mutton chops
Ice pick their guts never gon'(na) stop
All your mans is gonna watch
Free performance on the block
Meantime invest in rocks buy and sell stocks
Uno Dos is papi to connect
With my eyes on your neck
Your jewels extra large like stretch I'll show you my strength
Fiends get their check on the first
Be gone by the second the third they come on stolen shit begging for seconds
I ain't gon' lay for a second
Ain't gon' wait for a second
If it's any beef can get it
Uno Dos don't forget it
I'm chum to menace exclusive
Honorable mention fuck with Knitty, G-O & Twin
Y'all some dead niggas

[Chorus]
Hustle and rob
