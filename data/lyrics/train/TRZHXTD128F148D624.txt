I've got this special kind of something, mmm

Somebody said that I wouldn't make it big
Somebody said I would be the kid
To go all the way, to go all the way
My daddy said, "Learn and you will go far
You gotta reach out for the highest star"
That's what she said, so that's what I did

But nobody said that I would feel this pain
Nobody said that I would feel this way
And now I need to explain

I've got something to give
I need someone to hold
I need a special kind of something
Cos I don't wanna be alone
I wanna learn how to love
I need to know how to care
I've got a special kind of something
That I just need to share

I didn't really think about the consequence
I got a one-way ticket out of innocence
