I'm dreaming of one kiss from you a love long and true
We'll go on and on and

I don't wanna hear that I'm too young
To know it's love that makes me feel this way
'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun
To know it's shining on me every day
When it's warm outside and the look in your eyes
Is longing to show me the way, I don't want to wait

Just one kiss from you, and suddenly
I see the road laid out in front of me
You give me strength, you give me hope
And when you hold me in your arms you make me whole
And I don't know just what I would do without one kiss from you
...
