Murder, murder, a ripe blood stain
Pulled the fucking trigger 'cause I'm sick of it all
Murder, murder, a ripe fucking hate
Pulled the fucking trigger 'cause I'm sick of it all

I went to school today with an oozi
There's this kid, he teased me
So, I shot him in the face
All the world's light won't ease my pain

It won't cease, I'm diseased
Will you hang me please?
I'm a nihilist, raised on violence
What do I do?
