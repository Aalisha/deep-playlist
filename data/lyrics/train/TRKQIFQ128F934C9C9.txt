It bleeds! It breathes!

What stands before us, is not a machine
It breathes, it will bleed and it (will) dream!

(Scream)

Its body is covered in hundreds of wires
And a mouth that attempts to speak, it attempts to lie
Only murmurs, collapse from its jaws

And a world, a world without,
A world without you

But I rise, the dead will pride
...
