Sorry that
I could never love you back
I could never care enough
In these last days

Her tears
Fell on her pages found me out
On her words I dont know what
To do or say

Wading through
Warm canals and pools clear blue
The Tuscarawas flows into
The prairie land

Riding back
To where the highway met
Dead end tracks
The ground is now cement and glass
And far away
