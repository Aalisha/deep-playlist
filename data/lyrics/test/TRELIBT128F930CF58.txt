Hey Ma, What' up, Let's slide, all right, all right
And we gon' get it on tonight
You smoke, I smoke, I drink, me too, well good
Cuz we gon' get high tonight
Got drops, got coupes, got trucks, got jeeps, all right
Cuz we gon take a ride tonight
So ma, what's up, let's slide, all right, all right
And we gon get it on tonight

Yo, now I was downtown clubbin, ladies night
Seen shorty she was crazy right
And I approached baby like
Ma what's your age and type?
She looked at me and said you's a baby right
I told her, I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And i know what the ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens, and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I could lay the pipe
Come wit me, come stay the night
She looked at me laughin', like boy your game is tight
I'm laughin' back like sho' ya right
