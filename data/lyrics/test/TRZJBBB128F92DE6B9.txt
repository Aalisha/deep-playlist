This light doesn't hide in a bushel anymore
But I don't know what you could use it for
I've got the courage and I've got the same fear
So gather round now and watch me disappear

There is smoke here
There is fire
I'm on terms with the immolation

Don't try to pull me from the fire
It's to late for liberation

I wonder what I would have made of other features
Given all my kinds appetites

Hear my lords going to claim __ leases
if I'm going to move I've got to travel light

to the reaches
to the never-never
any way where light can't find me

I'm invisible
...
