Oh
Oh

New kid in town
Got fancy clothes
Old T-Bird car, baby
And you can tell your nose
He said, "Where is all the action in this town?"

Stop working on the women
It's on real slick
Heard enough about sin, girl
Gonna make it stick
Hey! What makes him so special anyhow?

She said, "So good lookin', that's a fact
Steel guitars run across his back"
The girls all know he's Way Cool Jr.
