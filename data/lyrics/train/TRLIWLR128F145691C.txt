Either you're with me or against me
Tell me what chu wanna do, do you wanna be with me?
Baby, you're lookin' so good tonight
I can't control myself, I wanna take you home with me

And lay you on your back, take off all your clothes
Make love you like you never ever known
And I'ma take my time and give it to you right
I wanna make love to you all night

I just wanna make love to you
(I'm gonna give it to you so good, baby)
But we got to do it right
I just wanna make love to you
(And stoke the back of my hair)
I don't wanna fuss and fight
(As I stoke you back and forth)

I just wanna make love yo you
(Real slow, real slow)
But we got to do it right
(Nice and easy, nice and easy)
I just wanna make love to you
(That's what I'm gonna do all night long)
