Didn't have the money round to buy a Morry Thou
Been around and seen a lot to shake me anyhow
Begged and borrowed sometimes, I admit I even stole
The worse crime that I ever did was playing rock 'n roll.

But the money's no good
Just get a grip on yourself
But the money's no good
Just get a grip on yourself

Suffering convictions on a two-way stretch inside
The air in here is pretty thin, I think I'll go outside
