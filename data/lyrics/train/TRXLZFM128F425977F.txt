Turn up your radio now
I'm calling out your name

Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it

So turn around and count 2 ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby

When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again, I want you back

We've both been acting strangely
And you can hardly face me
And I can see no fire in your eyes
We both know the answer
But one of us won't say it
Love's the only game in town
You sure know how to play it

The future of our love is on the line
