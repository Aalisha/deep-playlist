(heh heh heh)
Konvict (Konvict) eh eh eh eh eh eh
Go gangsta eh eh eh eh eh eh

Go gangsta keep boppin' (block royal)
Rock wit me lets get this bitch poppin' (Upfront)
Go gangsta keep boppin' (g-eah)
Like back when the nigga was clockin'

See now a days seems like 'erbody wanna be killas
Gorillas gettin' high off they weed and liquor... you die quicker
Paramedics drive back slow... to the hospital
You get pronounced dead at 4... to the hospital
So stop frontin' when you know you won't pull none (pull none)
First nigga to retreat when the tools bust (tools bust)
Playin' with death is bad for your health
All your homeboys gone you da last one left now
They hearts beatin' but these nigga's be scared (scared)
The real ones are all locked up or dead (dead)
Now a days you can't find a good connect
But if you do you might be the feds so...

I don't know you
You don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you seen what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me or we got beef 
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute guarantee you gon' bleed
Cuz that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets

Go gangsta keep boppin'
rock wit me lets get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta keep boppin'
