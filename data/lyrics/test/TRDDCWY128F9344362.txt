All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
Yeah...
Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart and there's some
How do we call this love (whoa oh oh oh)
I try to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay, oh why,
Why do we call this love (whoa oh oh oh)
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I said
All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
...
