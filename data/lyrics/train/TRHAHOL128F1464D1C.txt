Pour me some wine, join me tonight
Surround me with your happy faces
Share some fun stories, stay up all night
Sorround me with your friendly faces
Then look at me, when I'm not aware
Then you'll see, I cannot do without you
I'll be right there, if you ask me to
If you're feeling sad, I'll stay with you
