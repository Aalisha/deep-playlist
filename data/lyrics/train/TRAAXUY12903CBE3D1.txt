Verse 1: (MACK DADDY and DADDY MACK)
Who gotcha open, scopin out the track
It's no other than the sounds of the Daddy Mack
Still slackin back-packin up my turf
Cause after me was a factor real worse at the worst
Stompin, jumpin wanna-be's
But ever however there's only one M A C (say what)
Me and Daddy for the big picture
Ways of gettin richer, mister quick to hit your sister
I'm ballin in the Green County on chrome
I slip brothers on the deck on my cellular phone
I'm just loungin, leather, sound all around
And a dip on the other end wanna put me down now
No hesitation I hops to it
See it ain't easy bein' a Mac but somebody gotta do it
True it's, usually not represented right
