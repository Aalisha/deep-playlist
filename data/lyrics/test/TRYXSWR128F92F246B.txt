When every little thing
You own is looking back
At you and starts to mean
Less than it ever did,

On every,
On every inch of stone,
Skin and cloth
Made to leave you

Here you are you are breathing life into
Ghost under rocks like notes found
In pocket coats of your fathers,
Lost and forgotten,
All all all your soaking wet dreams
You've spent them,
You have gone and dreamt them
Dry, now you ask your babies why, why, why

We're gripping seats and plots,
...
