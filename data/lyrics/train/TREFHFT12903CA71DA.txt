Stack your bricks up to the sky,
Name each one and throw them high,
The trouble with trouble is it comes down fast,
So watch out where you're goin' or you just won't last,
(WOW-OH!)

You're an emotional anarchist,
You're pissed cause you've never been kissed,
You're drowning in a sea of anarchy,
With your heart above your patches and no faith in democracy.
