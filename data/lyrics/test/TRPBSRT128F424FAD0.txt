Always the war in 1983 - this is the world of today.
In our mind there is only the money and there is nothing for you.
Then hours work
no flowers in the mind
the life runs without happin
Every day dreams to go to a better life
but they remain only dreams.

You are the children
your life will be very hard.
You are the children
...
