Calling, calling, I hear you calling
Calling, calling, I hear you calling, calling me

Ref:
In the middle of the night I hear you call my name
Since you came into my life it's never been the same
In the middle of the night I hear you call my name
Calling, calling, I hear you calling, calling me

Seems like only yesterday
I was in a lonely place
Waiting for the sun to light my rainy days
Suddenly the sky was blue
From the moment I met you
When you smile at me you chase the clouds away (Ohh Yeah)

(Ooooh)
And when I go to sleep
(Ooooh)
I know I won't be dreaming
