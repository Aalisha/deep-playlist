I dreamt of all that we could be
And all the things you couldn't see
I let you walk away from me
I guess there's nothing left to say
And it's alright ...

Because you and me, we got nothing.
And I'm sorry that I ever let you in.
And I'm not doing this again. (Why?)
Because you and me, we got nothing. (Why?)
No.
