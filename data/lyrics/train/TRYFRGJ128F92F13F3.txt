the one I love is knockin' at my door
with a kinda look I never saw before
he said "Hey baby, you and me,
there's nothin' like knowin' when it's time to leave"

I took a lesson from his advice
I thought about it once but I didn't twice
packed my life in a paper sack
don't miss nothin' I never had

this old car's our limosine
ridin' on hope, livin' on dreams

don't wanna know nothin' 'bout readin' the map
