Down here below
It's not so easy, just to be
Sometimes I'm really all at sea
You made me when the world was new
And skies were blue
And I am here because there's you

They say I'll never see your face
And we're out [unverified] from your grace
The one you fashioned with your hand
And scattered all across the land

But I am happy just to know
That you will go, where I must go
...
