Red-eyes fly away from here every night
My intentions aren't unfair or unkind
How else could I purge my heart of this pillowed dream?

Arctic wind will be washed from my hair
Trading the forest for the city
Things will be different for you
Things will be different for you

When you're older, you'll look back
As you grow you'll understand
Why I left

All I talk about is you since that day
Remember when I cry into my soup
And you would say that it's okay

So many things used to break my heart
...
