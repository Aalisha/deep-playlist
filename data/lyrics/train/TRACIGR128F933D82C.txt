People try to put us d-down TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION
just because we get around. TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION
Things they do look awful c-c-cold. TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION
I hope I die before I get old. TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION
This is my generation,
this is my generation, baby.

Why don't you all f-fade away? TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION
Yeah, don't try and dig what we all s-s-say. TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION
I'm not tryin' to cause a big s-s-sensation, TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-generation. TALKIN' 'BOUT MY GENERATION
It's my generation,
it's my generation, baby.
