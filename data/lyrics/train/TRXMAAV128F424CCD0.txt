One word
Just one word to exist
Precious as a jewel
Cruel as a farewell
Like an echo in my head
Showing your obsessions
All the hopes that I fed
Just can't be illusions

Hope
I refused to say it
Thinking it was
The only privilege
Of the weakest ones
Of the weakest ones
Not believing
In hope meant for me
That I decided
On my destiny
All these sufferings
I'm ready to endure them
Just to find you again
Just find you
Again
Now you hang
On this world
Like the condamned
Man clings
To life
You'll defend
The beauty
Of it
...
