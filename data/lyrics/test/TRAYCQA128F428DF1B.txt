Samples: Graffiti vandals can be hard to catch,
It's a huge problem, All out war on graffiti, Two out of every three
cans were stolen out of your typical neighbourhood store,
And what happens to the kids convicted of graffiti offences

Chorus: Crime scene colon these cold streets you patrol on
Trying to get a hold on kids strapped with Krylon

Scratch: Vandal squad on my case
Getting chased raided but mostly getting shit painted
(chorus and scratch 2x)

(Promoe)
Yo, it was me and Suer, right. On a tuesday night
Had green, brown, black, two blue shades and white
Cosm.i.c stayed home but BIF crew stay tight
Staking out the steel dragon for a true spray fight
In other words a backjump
Wishing that we wouldn't bumb into them wack chumps
Cause the lay-ups getting crowded after sunset
Which is cool but get in line cause it ain't your fucking turn yet
Gotta burn shit can't come up with no lame style piece
If you wanna tame the wild beast
Had better burn murder the red worm spread germs in the system
to make heads turn
And snap necks at the central stations
Young kids making cops run like mental patients
Don't they know that graffiti can't be stopped
Writers unlike rappers can't go pop
So they stay underground till the day graff is legalized
Civil eyes look upon us as evil guys
Though we trod one away on third rails in front of metal giants
Death defiant to cops we keep lying
In the bushes ambushes being plotted clean trains being spotted
signed like there was dotted
Lines on the sides of the iron monsters
Representing VK mafia, call us bombsters

Sample: This is what the detectives are gonna consider a bombing.
