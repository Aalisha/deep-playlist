Us Among men
In the plans of shifting lime
We stood beside
A foundation of space and time

What would you say
To a city built in Jackson Park?
Electric castles and
A promise kept of highest art

In our white city
We'll stroll together in
Streets of wax
Streets of plaster
In our white city
White with wonder and
Heights of greatness and
Nights asunder
...
