"I slowly wake up to the conscious world, was i beaten down?
There's bodies everywhere... how could it go so wrong... this place reeks of death
No... it can't be... is it, I found my brother slayed... a sword is plunged right
through his heart!
Suddenly he opens his eyes in a silent glare... he signals me to come close..."

As the smoke has cleared
The dust lays heavy in the air
I wake up covered in blood and sweat
Can't reminisce what really happened

So hold me tight
As my life runs short
Listen now and be strong
There's something you should know
A secret well kept
You're not one of us
You're a dragon's son
...
