Ask me why
Why i see this space like another space
It's somewhere the sky is blue
Ask me why
Why it's not a dream and the children scream
It's a nightmare the sky is blue
It will blow your mind no doubt it's true
Together where you want separator were you too
Scream it scream it loud this is bad
It's a piece of your heart when you're feeling mad
You think all the troubles in the world are made for you
When you see the sky and the sky is always blue
Everybody in the world has a chance in a place
Stop becomes the culture and the race
I feel it feel it every day and night
I hear music and everything's alright
I feel it feel it every day and night
