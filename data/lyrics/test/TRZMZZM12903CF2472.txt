The unsaid tone of weak despair
Fail to resonate
Frayed end of our binding threads
Will disintegrate
By the laws our phiysique state
Failure to communicate
None too sentient
Hear no, see no works its magic
Against all function
Ongoing choices the trials will end
Filter the nonsense and laugh at what's left
Indecision/nonvision what matters taken away

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over
Lost to apathy
