No need to wait
I'm heading off
I don't feel like I want you as part of life
How your eyes look sad and surprised
I don't care I'm leaving tonight

I've had enough
You've given up
I swore this would never happen again
You don't cause my lips to keel
Your touch has lost its appeal

I trusted you in my arms
I carried you with my heart
It's criminal not to feel at all
I'm sorry but you've left it too late

We can't keep holding on
We're low on luck and out of time
I can't keep holding on
...
