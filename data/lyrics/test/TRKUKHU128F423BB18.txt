Cain got a milk-eyed mule from the auction
Abel got a telephone
And even the last of their blue-eyed babies know

That the burning man is the color of the end of day
And how every tongue that gets bit
Always has another word to say

Cain bought a blade from some witch at the window
Abel bought a bag of weed
And even the last of their brown-eyed babies see

That the cartoon king has a tattoo of a bleeding heart
...
