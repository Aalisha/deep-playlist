You're an obsession now,
Night after night i think of you,
A little mysterious, 
You're hot like the sun but you're cool like the moon

It would be easier, 
If i could only read your mind, 
Not knowing is killing me, 
Are you trying to be cruel 'coz i'm dying inside

[CHORUS]
Do you know what you're doing when you walk like that, 
Do you mean what you're saying when you talk like that, 
Did you steal my heart 'cos you knew you could, 
How could something feel so good, 
...
