This place sux
I haven't found a single thing to call my own
And there's nothing left for me to do
Just play the game, pretend to do work
No my boss isn't a jerk
It's just this place

This place sux
I've been slinking through the halls
Like an unwashed dog
And everybody treats me like a criminal
...
