Oh, sweetheart put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it

Slow motion sparks, you've caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys, oh, yes they will
They don't wanna define it

Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh, no I do not hook up, up I go slow
So if you want me I don't come cheap
