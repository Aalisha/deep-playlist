Oh, it's you again
Your angel feathers and your bloodstains
I can disregard these flighty notions and your silly grin
This time what I stitch is mine
And what I mend is just a hand hold
Take notice it's the last time...
A better company - than being alone

Look what you're faced to find
You're gonna get it in your own sweet time
There's no easy way - you make mistakes
