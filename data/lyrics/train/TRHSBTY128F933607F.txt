Seen you naked in the bath
Cigarette stains on your hands
Wilted flowers in a vase
I ask how are you? Yeah, how are you?

I see your lipstick on your glass
And I think you're drunk, I start to laugh
I find your note, the letters ran
It said, "I loved you, yeah, I loved you"

Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)

Don't ask why
(Don't ask why)
Don't ask why
Don't ask why
Sixteen candles down the drain

I watch you passed out for awhile
