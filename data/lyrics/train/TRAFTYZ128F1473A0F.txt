Talk, talk, talk, talk, keeps getting in the way
Speaking as a young artiste who has so much to say
So now you know my situation
understand my aggravation
building up so strong inside
cause I wanna make some noise

I can play
Faster and louder
I can dance
Faster and louder
I can live
Faster and louder
I'm a man
Faster and louder
