You were down and I wasn't around
So I just wanna let you know how I feel
I guess, I know that you're needing me now
I wanna be there but I just don't know how

What was I gonna do 'cause you was there when I needed you
And now I'm feeling down 'cause you need me and I'm not around
Tell me can I make you see, make you feel and believe in me?
I don't know what it is but I need to let you know, girl

If you wanna, then baby, clap your hands now
If you're gonna, then I can show you how
'Cause I can give you everything that you'll ever need
So, baby, take your chances on me

Now that I've just realized
That I haven't really been there for you
I promise you I know how you're feeling
