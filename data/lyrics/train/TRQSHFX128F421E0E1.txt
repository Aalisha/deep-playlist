Isolated
Alone and apart
Isolated
Isolated

I'll never crawl again
I'll never fall again
Until I'm free

Here I stand in this room
Caged and trapped inside
Seems I'm damned to live a lie
Unaware of what's outside
Should I care
For what's left me behind

And I stare at lights that makes me blind
Internally there's nothing left for me to be
I'm here alone and isolated

Have no choice but be isolated
Struggling, left alone, apart
Pushed aside, made segregated
...
