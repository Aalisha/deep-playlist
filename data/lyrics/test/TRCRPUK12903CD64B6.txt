No matter what they tell us
No matter what they teach us
We can't deny what we believe in
Life is ours
And we live it our way

Our own way
We have found out
Our own way
We're gonna make it
Our own way
We don't care about
What they say
Don't *wanna wait another day
Another day
We gonna make. We gonna make it
Our own way

Our own way
We have found out
Our own way
We're gonna make it
