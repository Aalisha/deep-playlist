Stars Are Resurrected
Shifting Over Desert Skies
Sand Sifting From The Hands Of War
Soldier Is Your Conscience Clean
Can You Feel There's Something Deep Inside
Lay Your Weapons Down
Let The Children Play Here
A Cry From The People
But There's No One There To Hear
And The World Is Watching.silently

We're Halfway There We See It Coming
