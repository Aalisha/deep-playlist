Fireworks and sparks when the fever starts in your eyes tonight
Explosions of heat and electricity in the firefight
I'm not bound to anything you've said to me
I can't ignore the way you adore my mystery

And I'm runnin' runnin' runnin' home just to see you alone
And I'm falling deeper into love faster than you know

Believe it when I say

Say it say it over again
Everything's better off this way
And when you think everything's lost
You got me

Tonight I just want you to see
I know I've never felt this way
...
