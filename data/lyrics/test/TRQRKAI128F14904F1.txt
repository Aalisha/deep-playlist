Mary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

Now ain't that just like me
Well, you know cracking up over you
You know that I love you, love you
Won't you come and love me too?

Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put him back again

Now ain't that just like me
...
