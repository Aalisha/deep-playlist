Excuse me, I'm trying to earn a mere buck or two
A solemn rapper come in -- and who the fuck are you?
Around this part of town with diamonds and your girl in fur
"I'm trying to enter in this rap contest you're havin sir"
You're kinda late "Flat tire" Well that'd do it cuz
Well alright, pay me now, and you'll be at the hub
"I hope I don't mess up, or run out of breath, or even BRICK"
Don't worry hon you're hittin em harder than a fuckin brick
"But what do you think Van?" Please, no one can serve us
"Wish me luck dear, I'm scared and I'm nervous"
So who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!

Now everytime I write dope raps they come vickin it
Now you know the title of this, so start lickin it
Lips kickin it, hey bitch, there is a brick in it
So when you think you're prepared, I keep stickin it
