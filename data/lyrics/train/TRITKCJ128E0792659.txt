Three in the morning
Tossin n turnin its late
Just cant rest waiting for the phone to ring
Will you call ring my phone
Girl I hope you did not forget
I cant sleep and I cant eat
And I wont until I hear your voice

When will you call

Three days ago
Rolled over to an empty bed
And I went to the bathroom
And your toothbrush wasn't there
Wheres your clothes
And wheres your shoes
Girl what would I do without you
