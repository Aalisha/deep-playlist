I am watching the rise
And fall of my salvation
There's so much shit around me
Such a lack of compassion

I thought it would be fun and games
(It would be fun and games)
Instead it's all the same
(It's all the same)
I want something to do
Need to feel the sickness
In you

I feel the reason
As it's leaving me no not again
It's quite deceiving
As I'm feeling the flesh make me bad
...
