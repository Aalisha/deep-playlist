Well, my pretty baby just left me this mornin'
Said she didn't wanna see me no more
Told me not to call her on the telephone
And never come a-knockin' on her door
Well, I fumed and I fussed, and I might have cried a little
My head went a-spinnin' around
But with a little bit of luck, and my little black book
I'll have another'n before the sun goes down

What my baby didn't know was the same thing happened
Not once, but a half a dozen times
And she didn't realize that with a telephone call
I'd have another fickle chicken on the line
