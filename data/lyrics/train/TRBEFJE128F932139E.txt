I
Sophie cannot finish her dinner
She says she's eaten enough
Sophie's trying to make herself thinner
Says she's eating too much
And her brother says, "You're joking,"
And her mother's heart is broken
Sophie has a hard time coping
And, besides, Sophie's hoping

CHORUS
She can be like all the other girls
Be just like all the other girls
Living in an ordinary world
Just to fit in, in the ordinary world
Just to fit in like an ordinary girl.
