Intro:
it's amazin to me homie
that niggas you fuck wit dawg
you dont know tha truth about these niggas until yall fall out homie
the mo you show a nigga
tha mo dangerous he become to you homie*Chorus*
I Broke Bread Wit U Nigga
Showed U Where I Lived
U Talkin Nigga
But U Dont Understand Wat Real Is
When It Came To You Pussy Ass Nigga I Woulda Killed
But It Was My Fault Nigga
I Kept It Too Real
{Repeat s x's}

*Verse 1*
We Busted Choppaz At Niggaz
Layed In Bushes Together
U Had Me Fooled Dawg I Thought U Was My Fuckin Nigga
Woulda Did A 100 Years For U
Cuz I Fuck Wit Ya
U Taught Me Wat A Good Heart In These Streetz Would Get A Nigga
Not A Muthafuckin Thing But A Sad Picture
Hurt Me When I Found Out U Had Pussy In Yo Heart Nigga
I Never Thought Id Say It
But Muthafuck A Friend
Cuz Yo Dawg Be Tha One That Cross Ya In Tha End
Tha Shit I Kno Now
Wish Id Done Knew It Bak Then
But Goin Thru It Wit A Fuck Nigga Is Wat Make A Man
I Treated Yo Pussy Ass Betta Than I Did My Own Kin
When A Nigga Locked Up Or Broke Thats When They Claim They Luv U Then

*Chrous*
I Broke Bread Wit U Nigga Showed U Where I Lived
U Talkin Nigga But U Dont Understand Wat Real Is
When It Came To Yo Pussy Ass Nigga I Woulda Killed
But It Was My Fault Nigga I Kept It Too Real
{Repeat 2 x's}
