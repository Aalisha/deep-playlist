If you love me then please don't tease
If I can hold then let me squeeze
My heart goes around and round
My love comes a tumblin' down
You leave me, breathtess.

Well, I shake all over and you know why
I am sure it's love honey that's no lie
'Cause when you call my name
You know I burn like a wooden flame
You leave me, breathless.
