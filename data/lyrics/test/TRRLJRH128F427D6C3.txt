There's a lot in life I want to see
there's a lot in life I want to believe
so I can make some sense of this imagery

There's alot in life I know I need
there's a lot in life I want to redeem
so I can shake this feeling of in a dream

I don't believe that all my prayers
just disappear into thin air
I can't afford myself that vanity
I know I can't afford
...
