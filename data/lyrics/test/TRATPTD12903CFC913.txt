Sistas recognize no matter how you try to understand
Oh noo you can't trust a man
Look here, I'm goin out with tha homies
And dont you even give me no lip like you own me
You want me couked up so you can do yo thang
But now it's time boot up and say some thangs gone change
Like when yo pager rangs
Whats up wit all these codes
You turn tha thang upside down readin stuff from yo hoes
I suppose thats why I got on my clothes
And I ain't even trippin on you
Cause tha things you think is slick really ain't
You think you bein a playa
Cause I work everyday, but I dont pay nan bill
Sex you only when I want
And never do fix a meal
I be that pimpstriss, mackadame with game
Met tha trick indeed to bring tha pain
Cause yo lame excuses
Left you hanging wide open
And I ain't even tryin to cope wit
Yo mental cause it makes no sense
