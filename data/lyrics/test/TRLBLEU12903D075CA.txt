We've planted a seed an ever growing wonder to a beautiful tree, grow

Each branch outstretched and different from the last, from the last
Where the old have broken arms some easier than the last
The right ones have grown in to fill in the gaps
And all are equal in love and trust
And all are a part of something so much bigger than this

Through the trials our tongues are tied
To trying times, so many unsaid lines, so many unsaid lies

Our lives were over at so many moments, so many moments
And now they're all just beginning
And now they're all just beginning
Our lives were over at so many moments
