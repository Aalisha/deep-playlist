The world is moving to the song I hear
Who's that singing, wind is rushing in my ear
Mind gushing memories almost lost everything
Felony and fellows running in my dream
We were in the van where the hits were driving
Saw myself In the highlands at age 13
And I'm asking questions to the present day me
Moving backwards down the hill see we were posting.

Moonlight illuminate my night and my days sunray make the people say
And a vision something's missing so they're screaming out loud
Keep my feet on ground and my head in the clouds.
I'm the arrow, you're my bow, shoot me forth and I will go
And I know and I go and I go get up and go
Make me feel its for real tell me what you know.

I don't need to glorify
Ate the apple of the tree and tried to lie
In the garden ill remember
That's when I started to sing
I said death brings life into uncertain things
