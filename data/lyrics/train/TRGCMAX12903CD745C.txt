(Jim Owen)

I've been loved in Cincinnati, Evansville and in St. Paul
All the gals were pretty and I ain't tryin' to find no fault
There's a gal in the Windy City I can't forget about
But if you want to love like you ain't had love go south, south, south.
Southern loving, take that southern loving every time.

There's a sweet thing in Augusta got the softest lips of all
When she kisses on you you just climb right up the wall
