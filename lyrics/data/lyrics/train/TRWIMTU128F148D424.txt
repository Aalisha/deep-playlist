Slow down baby uhh
Slow down baby uhh

You can get rugged, though, hard like p
Trying to play my man but you couldn't touch me
You faggot to comp rapper on a quest
You get your head flown, boy you must be smokin' sens
So many often wonder if mds paid
You're goddamn right, punk, stay outta my way
'cause I clock gs while you clock zs
And I don't smoke crack, I smoke m.c.s
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take notes
A rapper suffred from bleeding, sprains and slit throats
My style deadly psychopath or schizophrenic
Rapper choke like a curburetor, freeze up, and panic
'cause I clock pesos, don't sell ileyo
Another name for cocaine, mi amigo
That's spanish terminology for friend
Now sit back and rub my bozack as I send
Bass funk with beats that thump
Kickers and amps cold lined up in my trunk
My system cranking, my headlights are blinkin'
Brother ridin' my tip, l, at the same time thinkin'
Damn, how could a brother be so nice
'cause I'm the capital e-p twice m-d-e twice
