Hey my friend, do you mind
If I use you now just a little
Hey my friend, do you mind
If I put you here for a while in the middle

And with a little help from your eyes
I might forget I'm anothers
If you let me drown in your eyes
I might survive I'm so lost in others

And you my friend would you mind
To be here when I wake up
...
