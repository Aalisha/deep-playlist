Well, we were just another band out of Boston
On the road and tryin' to make ends meet
Playin' all the bars, sleepin' in our cars
And we practiced right on out in the street
No, we didn't have much money
We barely made enough to survive
But when we got up on stage and got ready to play people came alive

Chorus:
Rock and roll band everybody's waitin'
Getting' crazy, anticipatin'
