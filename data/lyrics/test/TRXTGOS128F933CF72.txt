*Chorus*
Behind the ghetto plains, the warfare reign
Must we be the bearer of bad terror the mystery
behind the unexplained...
Let us pound it through your brains (through your brains)

(Too Poetic/Grym Reaper)
Yo I'm the immovable object, that dwells up in your project
Deeper than mob threats, the Reaper's on the set
Each word spring a cold current, to hurt niggaz
like old warrants, make an MC, life insurance
plots unfold that rock moles and rock souls
My title be the sniper inside of the foxhole
Data, scientifical, not just the typical
waste matter my third eye expands my periphreal
See I, only attack, savage animals
Damage em, horizontally plus diagonal
...
