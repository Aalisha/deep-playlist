Wait a minute, this is where I draw the line
Tell me what's got into you 'cause apparently you've lost your mind
Repetitious fault just can't be overlooked
So I'm reading you your rights in case you misunderstood

'Cause I won't let you do that to me

Don't think I haven't checked out all your alibies
And the evidence concludes that you're just telling me half the truth
Still I keep giving you the benefit of doubt
'Cause I fell so deep in love with you, I struggle to get around
