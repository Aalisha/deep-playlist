Some of us we're hardly ever here
The rest of us
We're born to disappear
How do I stop myself
From being just a number?
How will I hold my head
To keep from goin' under?

(chorus)
Down to the wire
I wanted water
But I walk through the fire
If this is what it takes
To take me even higher
Then I'll come through like I do
When the world keeps testin' me
Testin' me, Testin' me...

How did they find me?
And what do they want from me?
All of these vultures
