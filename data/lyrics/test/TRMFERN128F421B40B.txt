(Lugaid:)
Mental vigour's been right on the edge
To a 'stupefying' hole of no return
Now we dance a holy war is won
But there must be more we got to learn

(Gabriel:)
Don't you know now that I'm here I must go
Into the morning light - illuminate the night
Be the guide on our side - the Gnosis

No return - I will go, follow the call of my spirit
No return - I must know all that I never could ask
...
