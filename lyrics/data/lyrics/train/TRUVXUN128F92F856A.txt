Knocked down, unappreciated
Day is losing grip on the light
And everywhere I turn there is night
Locked out and confused I waited
I saw but never opened my eyes
Alone together blinded by lies

And I could never get through
Cause I was never with you

If I gave you the world would it be enough for you, not for you
If I tore out my heart and my mind and wrapped them nicely, yeah
I can deal with the hurt and the blame, but not for you, not for you
And I don't wanna stay, I can deal with the pain, but baby, not for you
