You could say I'm a little bit crazy.
You could call me insane.
Walking around with all these whispers,
Running around here in my brain.
I just cant help but hear em,
Man I can't afford it, I hear voices,
I hear voices!

Like, my dad saying work that job,
but don't work your life away.
And, momma telling me to drop to drop some cash
into the offering plate on Sunday.
And, Granddad saying you can have a few,
but don't ever cross that line.
Yeah!, I hear voices all the time!
