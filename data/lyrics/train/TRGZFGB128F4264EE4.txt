I'm feeling low down and dirty
Bored and disgusted
Don't you give me no money
Cause I just cant be trusted

I got a list of diseases that I cannot pronounce
And a negative balance in my bank account
I got high blood pressure rotten teeth
I'm losing my hair I got stinking feet
I got a nasty temper and I'm quick to snap
So when you see me comin you better step back
