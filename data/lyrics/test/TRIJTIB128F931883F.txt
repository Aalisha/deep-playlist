Well we all gonna see a great empire 
Cut down in its prime
See its fruit die on the vine
In prime time color time

And there are millions in this world that mercy will not touch,
But they don't mind that much
Cause that's the way life's always been

But you don't wanna hear 'bout that from me,
I know, I know my place
And God know I don't belong
Singing a worthless freedom song

It's all a waste of time
It's all a waste of time
...
