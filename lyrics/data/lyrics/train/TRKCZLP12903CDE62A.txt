Oooooh yeah

Looking back,
I know I was walking around in disguise,
In disguise,
I was just as lost and I needed a guide,
And the moment that you came to change my life,
Use life burn my heart and make me smile,
Coz' you and I know that,

I'm a different person,
Yeah,
Turn my world around,
I'm a different person,
Yeah,
Turn my world around,
I'm a different person,
Yeah,
Turn my world around.
