You know that I want your loving,
But my logic tells me that it ain't never gonna happen,
And then my defenses say I did't want it anyway.
But you know sometimes I'm a liar...

Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness, please ignore my vacant stares,
'Cause just what I've been thru is nothing like where I'm going to.
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
