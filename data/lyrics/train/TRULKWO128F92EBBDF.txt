I got a one way ticket and I? m planning on comin' back
I got body full of kicks and I? m heading right for the sack
I got some bad-ass speakers playing Miles in a silent way
I gonna say my good byes and I? ll turn right round and stay

I got a one way ticket and I? m planning on comin' back
I got body full of kicks and I? m heading right for the sack

'Cause I'll go where I don? t wanna go
(Yeah I? ll go)
And I know when I don't know how
(I know)
I? ll smile with a tear in my eye
(I? ll cry)
And I? ll stay when I say good bye
