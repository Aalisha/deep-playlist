Brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
Fast lives are stuck in the undertoe
But you know the places I wanna go

'Cause, oh, oh, oh

I've got a sickness
You've got the cure
You've got the spunk
I've been lookin' for
And I've got a plan
We walk out the door

No you wanna just let go
It's time to roll down the windows

Sing it, oh, oh, oh

Yeah all we need
So here we go

Turn it up
It's five minutes to midnight
You're coming home with me tonight
I can't get enough, shakin' me up
Turn it up

Alright
At five minutes to midnight
You see our name in city lights
We'll make the clock stop
Make your heart drop
And come alive
