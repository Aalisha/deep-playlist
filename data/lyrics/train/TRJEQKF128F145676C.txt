She comes on like a freight train
Tearin' up the tracks again
She'll shift it hard into high gear
To get away from where she's been
And I heard her comin' from a mile away
Yeah, I felt the ground shake
If you wanna ride her put coal into her fire
Man that's your first mistake

Well you're smooth like silk
But you spoil like milk
...
