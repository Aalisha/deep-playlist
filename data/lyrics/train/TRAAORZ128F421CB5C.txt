I taught him how to talk to me
I showed him what a woman needs
A hand just to hold in the dark

He used to think it was enough
Sending flowers to show love
Now he knows he's gotta open up his heart

And the saddest thing 'bout how it all came down
Is he's not here with me now

I got him ready for you
Look at all the things he can do
You can cry on his shoulder
He might even cry too
