This is not okay
For me to feel this way
and I don't believe a single word you say

This is something rare
that I don't wanna feel
No not this way, not this way okay?

Nothing in this life is free
Slave untill they bury me
I'm blinded, running from it
Forever looking for a
taste that honey, chase that money,
keep on running away
till you die
You are just a slave!
