In a romantic fashion
I will experiment with my fear right before her eyes
And every smile that's unveiled will be soaked
In my nervous charm

Then I'll say
"Is everything alright?
There's been a few things I've been meaning
To let go of tonight"
And she will say
"Everything's just fine
So you can put an end to your worrying mind"
And then our lips will collide

The August sky will then bare witness
To a brand new chapter with torn up pages
When the planets align, I can feel the gates opening
To my courage
As I proceed to run my fingers through her hair
And forget everyone who's jaded, 'cause they don't matter
And I don't care

In a confident fashion
I will admit my deepest and darkest to her
And every gaze across the table
Will send my unsuspecting body into shock
...
