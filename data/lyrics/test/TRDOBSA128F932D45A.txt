[CHORUS:]
(No relation) Get Up, Get Out! (x3)
Go! Go! Go! Go!
(No relation) Get Up, Get Out! (x3)
Are you in or out, or in or out?

That way someday you may want to go
Fools pray that way, you can lay low
Easy cop out, stay in and take-out
You'll get snowed in, I got no time

Big G, Little G, he don't wanna go
Out that way - a lame and tame show
If G Squad want me, they're going to have to say so
You may want me, but I don't want know
