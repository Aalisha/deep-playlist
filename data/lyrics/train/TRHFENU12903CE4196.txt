Lazy swallow flying homeward
Watch the river wind back slowly to the sea
Oh, my soul is waiting patiently
Will you ever find your way back home to me

Somewhere I lost upon the journey
A love that was mislaid somewhere in time
Oh, my love, my heart is aching for you
Will you ever find your way back home to me
