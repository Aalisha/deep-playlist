Well hello sir, we look for monday
Confident well get there someday
Pushing all the papers to a wealthy man
Might I say, a beautiful tie you wear
and how do you find such lovely polka dots and stripes these days?

Break all my thoughts hit the floor
like im makin the score
im the king of the world
im a popular man
count by zeros to ten
if you cant, well i can
dont let any one wake me

Im dreamin out loud
dreamin out loud
and all at once you're familiar it seems
Im dreamin out loud
dreamin out loud
cant find a puzzle to fit in a piece, a part of me.
