Samantha Jade Step Up Lyrics

This is somethin for the radio

This is somethin for the radio

This is somethin for the radio

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
As long as when we
Stepping on the dance floor
It's me and you

Feel the rhythm of the beat
That's my heart
Cupid shot me with an arrow
From the start
And you know that it's your love that's got me trapped
Every time I try to leave, you bring me back

So much harder at times I cried a river
You dried my eyes and brought me back laughter
And when I lay next to you I want to wake up
And when I break up
It's only to make up

Boy, No matter what we go through
You step up, I'll step up too
It don't matter what the haters say
As long as you are my boo

No matter how hard it gets
This love will have no regrets
