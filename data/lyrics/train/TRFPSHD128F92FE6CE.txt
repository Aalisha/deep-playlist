It's three in the morning on a Saturday night.
The laundry and dishes just ain't worth the fight.
Headlights are dancin' across the living room wall.
And that long distant highway just echos the hall.

Now the babies are sleeping on back in their room,
And he's been passed out on the sofa since noon.
Nobody told her about none of these things,
And God knows, she'd leave there if heartaches had wings.

If heartaches had wings she would fly,
Away like some bird through the night.
