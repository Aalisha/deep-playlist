You'll find â€“ in time
The brightest flame will slowly die
And bear the darkest night
To rise
When everything that's meant to shine
Burns out before you eyes

Tonight
We're longing for daylight
Burning the same lie
To find the ghost of you and I
We're running from midnight
Dying to ignite
To find the ghost of you and I
