What do you think when you spit in my face
How does it feel to accuse and to haze
Now look at me, I'm not one of your kind
And I prefer to stay behind

And walk the wicked way

We don't wanna be like you
Don't you get that king of fools
We don't mind your life is trite
You are the king of fools
We are never gonna be like you
We don't follow - King Of Fools
