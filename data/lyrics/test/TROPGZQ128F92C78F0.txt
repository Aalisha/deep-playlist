One more time for the womankind
This is for the womankind
Check it out

Ooh baby's got precious eyes
And when he smiles the sun comes shinin'
To make the day seem like each cloud contains a silver linin'
I would be so happy
If he belonged with me forever
But I know it's not to be
It"s not part of my destination

I wish I had a lover who could turn this water into wine
I wish I had a lover who could give me love at any time
Wish I had so many things
And all my wishes would come true
It's got me thinkin' that I want to get too close to you

Hear my prayer
I'm tired of waitin'
Hear my prayer
Give it a chance
Hear my prayer
I'm clearly statin'
I need to change this circumstance

You could be the best damn thing
