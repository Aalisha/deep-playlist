There's just too many rages
Too many infinite screams at night, we're living in concrete cages
Another child is doomed to be torn in his mother's womb
By the spark of the twelve gauges

Sometimes it seems like I can't go on, I can't go on
But when I envision a black man with thorns in his hand on
A crucifix, I get strong, never will I ever let
A devil deceive me again, mislead me
(Ha)

'Cause what I'ma hit you with's gonna hurt
(Yeah)
Because the flesh is meaningless, it remains amongst the dirt
But the soul is uplifted, 10-31-67, I'm God gifted
MC's are changing, it grows like a fungus

Beware of the evil that walks among us, behold a fallen angel
Hark, the rebel, the mark of 6-6-6, the Devil
You better beware 'cause he's comin' behind you
No, it doesn't take long for him to find you

It's a sneak attack black, he's gonna smack you
In the form of a rock that's inside of a capsule
Or maybe in the form of a man
That says to trust me and then begins to shake your hand
