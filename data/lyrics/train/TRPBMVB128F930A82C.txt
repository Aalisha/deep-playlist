You were born on judgement day
But you don't care and go your own way
Your living your life and you made your own laws
Fellowship forever, your freeing your souls

Riding with the brothers
Through the wind and the rain
You're proud of your color
And can feel no pain

Forever angel
Keep on riding and fight for your rights
Forever angel
Roaring thunder through endless nights
Endless nights
