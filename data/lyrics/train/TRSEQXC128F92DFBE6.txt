Felt the heat of the fire
Caught a cold from the rain
Love just left me standing with nothing but a name
Picked my heart off the ground
As I said to the sky
Never will I let somebody
Ever make me cry

But, just a smile from you
Tore though my defenses
It made no sense
Now, I gotta confide and
Tell the truth
Cause boy I'm left wide open
Hoping you wont leave me broken

You'd think
By now I've seen it all
That my heart
Should be indestructible
But, your touch
Made it impossible
Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable

You'd think
By now I've seen it all
That my heart
Should be indestructible
But, your touch
Made it impossible
Cause underneath it all
I'm vulnerable
