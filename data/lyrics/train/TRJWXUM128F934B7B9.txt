A Million Miles (I Love You)
How could I illustrate my love 4 U?
What would U do if U were in my shoes?
Would U climb the highest mountain?
Would U sail across the sea?
If I were a million miles away, would U visit me?

How could I illustrate how much I really care?
How could U do if U were here, my dear, and I was there?
Would U eat a poison apple?
Would U be burned at the stake?
