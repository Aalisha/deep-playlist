Stretched between the lamplight and the cigarette ash
In the corner of the city where the markets crashed
There are boxes of the lonely here and fires of hope
We built a monster
We built a monster

You can take a bit of red, a bit of white and blue
From across the Atlantic laying trails to you
A little flash of lightning and some bully boy charm
We built a monster
We built a monster
