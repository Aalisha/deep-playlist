I know
We're all souls just trying to connect with
Someone, but we're all
Left searching on our own.
On our own...
On our own...
On our own!

Tell me that you can hear it:
Three taps under the floorboard.
Don't say I'm losing it.
Maybe you're deaf...
Could have sworn
That I locked
All these windows fairly tight.
Shut the door,
Hear a knock.
She starts turning off the lights...

And from the corner of my eye,
I saw you dressed all in white.
