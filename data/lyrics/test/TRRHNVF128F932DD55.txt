There are times when I'm alone
I think of you and I need to calm down
There are times when I see you
I want to tell you that you got to come around

There are things that you possess
I can't resist and could never turn now
There are things that you affect
I never dreamt could ever be found

There's a fire in my soul yeah
Because of you now why don't come around
There's a fire in my soul yeah
Because of you now you ought to come around
Oh come around
