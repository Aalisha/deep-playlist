I've really got to use my imagination
To think of good reasons to keep on, keepin' on
Got to make the best of a bad situation
Ever since that day, I woke up and found that you were gone

Darkness all around me, blackin out the sun
Old friends call me but I just don't feel like talkin to anyone
Emptiness has found me and it just won't let me go
I go right on livin' baby, but why I just don't know

You're so strong
