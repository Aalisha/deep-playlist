[Verse 1:]
God has truly been good to me,
not even one sad day or minute have I had 
since You've come my way.

I hope You know I'll gladly go
anywhere You need me;
it's So Amazing to be loved,
I'll follow You 'til I'm home in the sky above.

[Verse 2:]
Got to tell You how You fill me,
I'm happy as I can be,
You have come and it's changed my whole world.
