Yeah, yeah, yeah

Her beauty's crazy.
I watch her from the crowd.
Her voice is so amazing.
She make her momma proud.
I tried to send her flowers,
But she has no address
Her home is in my heart.
It's like she never left.

This is more than a crush,
More than a like, like
More than a love,
Baby I'm a make you mine,
And I ain't giving up

This is more than a crush,
More than a like, like
More than a love,
Baby I'm a make you mine,
And I ain't giving up

Don't run away
Don't run away from the truth
'Cause I'm not giving up on you

Don't run away
Don't run away from the truth
'Cause I'm not giving up on you

Shawty you got fire
I know you know
