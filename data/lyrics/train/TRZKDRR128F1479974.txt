Yes I know
We're born a little bit surprised
We went a little far this time
Oh no
And I said
We've got too many thing to lose don't wanna live my life this way

From a moment that lingered too long
To a battle that can never be won
So wrong yeah

Thought it's love we both want
It's a love we don't need
Let's sit here in silence
Let out heats bleed
That it's hard to be strong
When u're feeling so week
