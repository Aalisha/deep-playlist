What is it?
It ain't a black thing, or a white thing
Get high, get drunk all night
It's a chill, hangout make sure you're all right

When they play this song, they start dancin'
If they can't get in they throw a tantrum
When the girls see me they say I'm handsome
DJ, play this, my anthem

If you feel good, put your hands up
I'ma get the party people what they payin' for
Don't be Hollywood
Put your hands, put your hands
Put your hands up

If you feel good, put your hands up
I'ma get the party people what they payin' for
Don't be Hollywood
Put your hands, put your hands
Put your hands up

Groove!
You gotta boogie on

To the dance floor, let your hands go
I'ma get the party people what they payin' for
And now when I go out to the club
I'm trying dance and cut a rug

I'm a get a few drinks in my system, system
And holla at a freak in my distance
I say, 'hey lil mama I like your style'
She see my goatee and said, 'I like your style'
Got some weed, a girl, a bottle of Patron

Right now, uh uh uh
