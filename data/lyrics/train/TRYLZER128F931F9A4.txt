From your words, I can tell you've lost a reason, the will to carry on
No chance that we will make it, You've faked it for so long
But I'm standing here before for you, as your barely holding on
And I'm writing just to show you, there strength in who you are

We live and we fall, but Ill try to move on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own
We live and we fall, but I'll keep moving on
It's so hard to be the one that's on my own

From the night, I can faintly here you breathing, I know that you're around
I can feel your arms around me, Ill take the water down
But I'm standing here before you, as your deep within this ground
