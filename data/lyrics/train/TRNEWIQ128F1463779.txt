Jeffrey drew a circle but no one wanted to know
So Jeffrey lit a candle and then began to blow

Progress was no excuse, pleasure was there none
And lights went out along the coast as Jeffrey lost and won

Oh, open your minds to Jeffrey
Hoist another flag, hoist another flag
And do it again for Jeffrey
Fill another bag, fill another bag
...
