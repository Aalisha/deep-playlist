There ain't a single day without you on my mind
From the very start I knew that you are no kind

And every passing day to come
I feel I'm incomplete
I need to have you closer
To give you what you need

I'd walk on broken glass to you
To find out who really want me too

Now, I'm all tied
I tremble with desire
I'm in for something real
Now, I feel strong
I know we wanted love
'til I see you come my way
And make you mine someday
...
