Girlfriend now
I have a have a girlfriend now
No way, no how I get a girlfriend now

I remember it vividly, love.
I've been walking erect since the moment we met
And I caught your eyes to my surprise (your white thighs)
Hebraic neuroses ceased to be
And angel's conversing with me
The new attractive to me is divine
And even if your friends don't understand
No matter what, I'll always be your man
And even if you go, you know you? ll leave me feeling grand
Yeah yeah

I'll need new contraceptives, green eyes
I found god when you left him, green eyes
Let's spend the night entwined out on the boardwalk in sickly summertime
