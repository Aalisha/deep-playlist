Stuck in my bedroom with nothing
But a voice in my head
Once my feeling was dead set
(Watch my will begin to fade)

What did you say, am I restless?
What can I do to relieve it?
As my mind just melts away

Once I say, I can't be saved
No more change
I dodge the grave almost every day

One single life needs not to die
For such a cheap price, for one last flight
God save the child who lives like a whore
(I made it through yesterday)

Once I say, I can't be saved
...
