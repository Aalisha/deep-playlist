Cool Drink Of Water


(Don Cook/Kix Brooks)

I bought my girl a diamond, it was our engagement ring
She took it to a pawn shop, like it didn't mean a thing
She went right out and bought herself
A brand new party dress
She'll be looking good tonight
When we go out I guess

She's a cool drink of water
She's done hocked the ring I bought her
She might be the devil's daughter
