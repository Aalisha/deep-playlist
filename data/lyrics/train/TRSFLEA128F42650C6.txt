Hey.

The furnace burns in steel town
Big business came and tried to shut 'em down
Workers got together and they bought that mill
They're making steel in Pittsburgh still

The family farm down in Indiana
The bank's foreclosin' just because they can
The farmer can't do nothin' 'bout another drought
But John, Waylon & Willie came and helped 'em out

These are the days of America
Brother to brother, hand in hand
...
