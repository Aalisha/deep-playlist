You're hiding something cause it's burning through your eyes
I try to get it out but all I hear from you are lies
And I can tell you're going through the motions
I figured you were acting out your part
Once again we're playin off emotion
Which one of us will burn until the end?

Catalyst, you insist to pull me down
You contradict the fact that you still want me around
And it's all downhill from here
And it's all downhill from here

Your good intentions slowly turned to bitterness
Reoccurring episodes with each and every kiss
