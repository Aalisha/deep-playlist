Tell me that I'm dreamin'
I'm dreamin'
Don't you stop me from believin'
I'm dreamin'

You, you came into my life
Without a reason why
Why did you have to smile?
Why did you have to touch my soul

It cries right out for you
I love the little things you do
My heart depends on you
So say, you'll never leave me

Tell me that I'm dreamin'
I'm dreamin'
Don't you stop me from believin'
I'm dreamin'

You, you walked out of my life
We didn't even say goodbye
I didn't even hear you cry
...
