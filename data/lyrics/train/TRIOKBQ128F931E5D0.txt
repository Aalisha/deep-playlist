Let me tell you why I adore Howard girls
Ooo she got a killer sway (yes she does)
Ooo on a sunny day
A summer dress rockin some top tens
How she display (oh yeah)
Walkin around
Ooo without a care (Howard girls)
Headphones in hair
A smile and a derriere
Let me tell you why I adore Howard girls
Perfectly round
Ooo every shade of brown (Howard girls)
Crisp from the rays
That's raining down
Never a rush
