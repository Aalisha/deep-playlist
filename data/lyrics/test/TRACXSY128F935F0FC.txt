Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with that one boy
Sighing sigh after sigh
It's nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
