Come on Mutha Fuckers!

another heart another life just another test
another murder another lie just another death

and ours is to suffer for you want always more
and ours is to suffer cause you kill all that we adore

i don't need no master to command
i am the law by myself

paradise is falling down
and you try to leave this god damn town
and your world is burning down
like rats forsaking a sinking ship
down to your knees and pray
...
