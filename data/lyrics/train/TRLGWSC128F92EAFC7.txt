Everybody needs a friend now and then
To come and pick their heart up again when everything gets shattered
Everybody needs someone to understand
Someone just to come and hold their hand to be there through disaster
And I'm gonna be there for you

So when you're crying I wanna be the shoulder you lean on
When you're lonely I'm never gonna leave you, so just hold on
When you're crying I wanna be the shoulder you lean on
