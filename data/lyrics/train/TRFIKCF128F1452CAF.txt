Ooh I think I fell for you,
From the day that you arrived,
Into my life. I believe its true,
When I look into your eyes.
I see, love in your eyes,
I see, love in your eyes.
I see, love.

Holding hands, making plans,
Into our future.
Together, spending time, living life,
So happy.
Together, on that day I saw your face,
Remember, I wanna,
Tell you so how much you have affected me.
I feel for sure, that its you I've waited for.

Ooh I think I fell for you,
From the day that you arrived,
Into my life. I believe its true,
When I look into your eyes.
I see, love in your eyes,
I see, love in your eyes.
I see, love.

Oooh kisses, missin you when you're away,
I've played this over in my head,
And it is meant to be,
If you see what I do,
Maybe we can try to,
...
