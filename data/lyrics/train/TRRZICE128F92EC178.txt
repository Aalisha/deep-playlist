I took my time, I never touched
When you danced you tease me
All night sugar rush
Just gimme a taste tonight

Oh girl, you're too much
I'm burning up right now and I need your touch
Come on let's take a ride, crash and we'll collide
Just give it a chance tonight

So I can taste you on my tongue
With your lips to kiss like a red hot sun
You're one big sugar rush
Suck me in, suck me in, hold me down till the very end

I hate the chase, just stop the clock
'Cause you're so close now
That I can taste sugar rush
Then up and go without a trace
...
