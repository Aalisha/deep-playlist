Some times she runs, some times she don't
more than once shes left me on the side of the road
the older she gets the slower we go
but There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio

She needs a carbuerator, a set of plug wires
shes riding me around on four bald tires
the wipers don't work and the horn don't blow
But There Ain't Nothin' Wrong With The Radio
