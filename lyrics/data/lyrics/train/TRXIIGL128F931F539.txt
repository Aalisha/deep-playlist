Speak up, your silence is killing me
I've had enough, baby speak up
Are you lovin' or hatin' me?
Cuz I can never tell
I'll be the first to admit it
Been silent for a minute
Thinking like damn is he feeling me
We fell in love took a second
But now I'm always checking
Cuz I never hear you say what you really think

Some days I feel it then I feel it's over
Some days were harder then some days were colder
When you open up, our love is alive
But now you're quiet and I'm dying inside

So baby speak up
Cuz your silence is killing me
I've had enough, baby speak up
Are you lovin' or hatin' me
Cuz I can never tell, I can never tell
Just let your heart say what you can't say (speak up)
Let your heart say what you won't say (speak up)
Don't let the silence tear us away
Cuz I can never tell, I can never tell
