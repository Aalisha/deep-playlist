You always talk about yourself in contradictions
Stuck in recking and verbal consciousness distinction
Help yourself and try to rationalize
The keys to change are held within your mind
Back where we've started from lost in concentration
You've got to stop and open up your eyes
You tell me which side of the fight the guilt's on
I'll tell you which side you'll find me on
