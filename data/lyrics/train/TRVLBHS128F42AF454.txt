Ohhh...
Ohhh...
Come back...

Verse 1:
I guess it looks like my playa face has got me messed up again.
(She had me dipping and I, I'm feeling guilty)
Cuz you gave me a second chance and damn I did it again.
Tryna be fly.
And now I'm sitting here tryna figure out how to get my baby back.
I done apologized so many times and girl, I don't know.
(If she's coming home)
Damn, me tryna be fly.
Baby...

Chorus:
Come back to me shawty.
Cuz you're taking my heart away.
Come back to me shawty.
(Please forgive me)
Come back to me shawty.
I can't erase you.
Ain't no replacing you.
Cuz you know you got that bomb, bomb.
And I'm really missing you, yeah.
Come back to me shawty.
Cuz you're taking my heart away.
