Finally found a fella almost completely divine
But his vocabulary is killin this romance of mine
We get into an intimate... situation
And then begins this Romeo's conversation

He says murder, he says, every time we kiss
He says murder, he says, at a time like this
He says murder, he says, is that the language of love

He says, solid, he says, takes me in his arms
And says, solid, he says,, eaning all my charms
He says, solid, he says, is that the language of love?

He says, chick chick, you torture me
Zoom, are we livin?
I'm thinkin of leaving him flat
