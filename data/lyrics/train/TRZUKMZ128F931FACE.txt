One man he disappoint me
He give me the gouge and he take my glee
Now every other man I see
Remind me of the one man who disappointed me

Wait 'til I get him back
He won't have a back to scratch
Yeah keep turning that chin
And you will see my face
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch

So I say and on I go
To another one who disappoint me so
