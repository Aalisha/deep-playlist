Son you make me feel so proud
I pop the buttons of my shirt
I know I said I'd take you to the lake today
But I'm going to have to break those plans and it really hurts.

Every time I go fishin' it'd always start me wishin'
That I could be a child again
Take my 50 cents and go down to the local picture show
To watch my heroes rope and ride.
