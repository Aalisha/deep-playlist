Check me out, I'm losing control
I wanna rock and roll
But everything I plan just slips right through my hands
Yeah, I don't know why

Hey, I'm a nice guy
I wanna take it easy baby
But every time I start, my world falls apart
Yeah, I don't know why

The world is feelin'
(Don't know why)
Like it's passin' me by
(Don't know why)
I'm fixin' to lose it
And I don't know why

Check me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your lover, darling
But everything I say comes out the wrong way
