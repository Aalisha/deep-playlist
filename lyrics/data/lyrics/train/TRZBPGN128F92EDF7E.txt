Throw away everything
Challenged hope
Challenged fate
Fuck the world
Find my place
Like it matters

Point your fingers at me
Contest my integrity
Question my honesty
Don't even try it

Feed the life to
Someone who cares
Nothing, no one
Do it myself

One fist in the gold
One foot in the grave
One fist in your face
Destroying

So sick of believing
Feels like I'm
Eating myself alive

So sick of existing
Feels like I'm dying
Feels like I'm
Eating myself alive
