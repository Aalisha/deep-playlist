Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
But I have gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you, I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
