Break the chains and release me from this struggle,
I have the right to see freedom

Not like the rest,
so weak and powerless
I rise to face the day

Burn down my whole inspiration,
burn me into the ground
I will never surrender or silence

Bind to false ideals and never let them go,
fake words for the feeble minded

My path is strong,
we need to find redemption
Remove your face from the dirt
