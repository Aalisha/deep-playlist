Sinners heart can't think or feel
The sharp sting of slicing steel
Punish, kill, repeat
The death caress, so bittersweet
I live outside the rule of law
My one decree is shock and awe
Black sheep of my kind
Progeny of hate refined

[Pre-chorus:]
Suffering spreads like the plague
Reasons why, still oh so vague
The siren song of slaughter summons me
To inner demons I succumb
I know not that which I've become
Exhibit A in man's atrocity

Take the gun, take the knife
Take the pain, then take the life
My taste for homicide
