Everytime I try to leave this game
These streets keep on callin' me (Streets keep callin' me)
Just keep on callin' me (Just keep on callin' me)
(x2)

Now, this ghetto got me crazy
And these streets got me trapped
Many times I've tried to leave
But this game keep pullin me back
In a circle full of crime
Bout to lose my mind
Shit, I wanna make a change
But I just keep wasting my time
Ain't no real future sellin' dope
Only few make it out
For a ghetto nigga like me
Got too many golds in my mouth
I can't get a job
Ain't nobody gonna hire a thug
And my rap sheet consists
Of 187 and drugs
And goin' in and outta jail
