Take me up higher, reach for the top
Higher and higher, don't ever wanna stop
Take me up higher, reach for the top
Higher and higher, don't ever wanna stop

Take me up higher, reach for the top
Higher and higher, don't ever wanna stop

Days and times will come with all that you need
Fulfilling desires or hope what is real
Deeper than this loneliness as long as it's true
You're inner light will shine on through and

Take me up higher, reach for the top
Higher and higher, don't ever wanna stop

See the changes with your eyes, feel it in your heart
However long it takes, oh, there's the start
We're just a single step to our begin
To understand this claim, so I can win
