You and I fall together
You and I sleep alone
After all, things might be better
After one, and there's one that's long gone

For the moon you keep shootin'
Throw your rope up in the air
For the kids you stay together
You nap 'em and you slap 'em in a highchair
All you ever wanted was someone to take care of ya
All you're ever losin' is a little mascara
Little mascara
Little mascara

Afternoon, things are quiet
Settle back now if you can
