Look in the trees
Through the window at the moor
Like some...
You play with my cheek, yeah
Whisper something I were born
Liquid light harmony
Wrapped around inside of me
Born out of trees
On a moonlit song
It's free

Shiny and Warm
Shiny and Warm
Head in a storm
I'm driving home to you
Shiny and Warm
...
