Little village, baby
Ain't large enough to be a town
From a little village, baby
Ain't large enough to be a town
You gotta get away from the city
It's gonna bring you down

Heard the voice of the silence
In the evening, in the long cool summer nights
Heard the voice of the silence
In the evening, in the long cool summer nights
Telling me not to worry
Everything's gonna be all right
...
