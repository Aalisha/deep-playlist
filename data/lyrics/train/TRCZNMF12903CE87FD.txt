Faces in this empty room
Cited in despair
Gazes that I had invoked
They're driving me insane now
Walls have eyes they're staring down on me
From everywhere around

In the face of dreams I had
Grimaces of pain
Now I am turning helpless
Callous and alone
Waiting for a storm to brew
To wash my dream and love and sins away

I'm with you
I'm the other side
You just gotta try
Fly now! No one's gonna care
Cause no one's gonna know
What no one's ever seen
...
