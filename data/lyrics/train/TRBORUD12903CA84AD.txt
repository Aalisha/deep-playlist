Set this place on fire, send your spirit, Savior
Rescue from the mire, show Your servant favor
Yesterday was the day that I was alone
Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God

And yes our God, He is a consuming fire
And the flames burn down deep in my soul
Yes our God, He is a consuming fire
He reaches inside and He melts down this
Cold heart of stone
