[El-P]
I met her last week, this insane tart
we been swimmin in eachother with the same heart
I mean I think we might be sections of the same part
And we don't seperate at all until the day's dark
And then she floats away
After zonin with me close all day
I don't believe some of the things we say
Using whispers speaking in the simplest of ways
Thinkin in a similar way
I mean, basicly strangers but we livin the day
Together in a serious way
Gettin blazed and escapin a sick play
So high that our faces erase
We go together through the spaces I trace
Man she looked me dead in my grill
With a hand out strapped for one pill
And I prescribed her fill
And we made love to the thought that life's ill
And how it's crazy that through all of this swill
How you can bump into the beautiful while jumpin from sills
