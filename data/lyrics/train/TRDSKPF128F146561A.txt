Love is such a precious gift
One thing in my life, I know is true and I.O.U.
Deeper than the ocean bay
You touch me like no one could ever do, I.O.U.

And I never could repay that look that's in your eyes
I could save up all my kisses till the end of time
All my love in my life 'til it's through, I.O.U.
(I.O.U.)

Love is such a precious gift
The currency of life I never knew, now I.O.U.
Keep it for eternity
The vow I made the day, I said I do, I.O.U.
