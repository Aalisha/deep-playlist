There's trouble brewing
Leave what you're doing and
Step out of line
No point in keeping
Watch if you're sleeping
Half of the time
Check out the crummy lines you've been saying
You're not in some second-rate soap

There's trouble brewing
Leave what you're doing and
It just might pay
There's no denying
Always complying
Isn't the way
...
