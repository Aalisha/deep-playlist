Head

Yes, the day that I first saw you, it was in March, I think
'Cause I seen you lending some things from a shop
You saw me, you laughed, blow a kiss and I turned right around
You followed me out and ever since that day I've been.

'Cause we could go for ever and ever
Abergele's not too bad this time of year
Or if you, if you want I'll make a promise
And if you stick around I'll make it honest.

I'm gonna get back down and my head get's stronger
Climb back up and my arms get longer
...
