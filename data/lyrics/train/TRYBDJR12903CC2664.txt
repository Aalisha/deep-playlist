A smile on your face puts a smile on my face
When our brown eyes first met
You sang a song to me and now it's my turn to return the favor
In hopes of showing you exactly how I feel

If I could I would do anything to put a smile on your face everyday
What I want more than anything is you by my side
When I leave and when I return, when I leave and when I return
...
