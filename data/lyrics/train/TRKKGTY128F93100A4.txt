When I feel your eyes on me I fall to my knees
And I wait for your look to judge and define me
I'm just a thin shell breaking in your palm
Starving for substance, identity
I am not afraid of this act of mutual creation
I take from you as you take from me
Like nervous hands reaching out for each other
Your eyes can tell no lies, I am what you see

You're my mirror
Everything I do I see in you
You're my mirror
In your eyes I hide
You're my mirror
What you see is what you're giving me
You're my mirror
In your eyes
