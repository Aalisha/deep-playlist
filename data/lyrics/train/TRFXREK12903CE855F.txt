I know this girl
Who's pretty as can be
The sign of an Aquarius
She was born on the 18th
UFOs, snakes and spiders
Give her the creeps
She's got a half-life and a half smile
And lives in semi luxury
Questions God, drugs and bullets
And a high school beauty queen
She's courageous but scared to death
But that's what courage means

She's looking for some courage
She feels faithless, she feels earthless
She wants to run
