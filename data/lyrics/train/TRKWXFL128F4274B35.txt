Too cool and too sexy,
Like the purest dime you shine
The way you dance around me
Nasty, just like a snake...

I cannot hear the words you're telling me
I cannot even tell where the hell you came from

There is something in you that is holding me
Seductive sound of frying skin
Your face is now the one I want to see
And I drink your speech while you're serving me
