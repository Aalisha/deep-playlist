Now, let's talk about the time I had this morticiachair in my apartment

Right there in front of the living room as an open invitation to strangers
A cold machine might show
Smiling like a face, waiting for a telephone call, of a beloved feline
She is in a state and it's california, she's been there for quite a while

I've got no presents, I've got no presents

Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again
Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again
Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again

Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again
Drop the phone, take the plane and come back home again
She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob
She knows where she rolls when she goes for the doorknob
