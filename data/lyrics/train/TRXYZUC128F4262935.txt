Hey Dott Dogg... muthafucka was out there in them streets
Nigga did whatever it took to get in nigga
From the jackin', to the rappin', to the slangin' crack and...

First

X-Raided up in this bitch, bout to disrupt some shit,
Ain't from the pound, but I'm still down to Kurupt some shit,
Interrupt your shit, cuz I'm always in a rush to spit,
Like an axe, when I rap, I splitter up your clique,
You better relax, be a witness or a participant,
Eddie Gaffin' laughin' at the CO, wonder where the Sergeants went,
See we flow, but it's way more bigger than that,
Ransom note, deliver the gats and all them wack ass tracks,
So we slit his throat, it's malicious, but the game's vicious,
And niggas know, we'll do anything that gains us riches,
We quick to flow, but we just as quick to bark that heat,
Start that beef and Dott Dogg will pause that heartbeat,
We hard to beat, like Schwarzanegger in movies bout factual
Burning niggas like third degree,
Critical surgery,
When I'm mad, you hoes burglary, intrudin' your home,
Stole everything like clepto includin' your dome,
Left your ass chewed up, gaze blast, mid-section blew up,
Bet you all five homicide detectives threw up,
Suit up, in coca sacks then I smoke a bag,
They make me get my focus back, then I choke the gat

When it came to gettin' that money I did whatever it took,
