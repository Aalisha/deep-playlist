Heavenly torture
You're burning again
Envy the clueless
That fight 'til the end

Save one that kills one
It's always the same
General scapegoat
No one is to blame

You want to help
And to learn
But it's hard
When they turn
And everybody want
To see you burn

Business and pleasure
Curse your ways
You represent everything
Wrong with the world today
