Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow flow
Straight to my lover's heart
For me, no, nobody else
But me, hey, hey, hey

Cupid, please hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now listen
I don't want to bother you
But I'm in distress
There's danger of me losing
All of my happiness

For I love a girl
Who doesn't know I exist
Oh, and this you can fix
...
