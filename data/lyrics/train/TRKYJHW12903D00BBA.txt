It's lonely in the Garden State, the place of no left turns
In a Motel 6 in East Brunswick smoking 'till my lungs burn
I put ice in the trash can to cool down my beer
Breathe in the perfume in the room of the person last here
I can't stand this singing, I can't stand this song
I can't stand being home, lord I can't stand being gone
My ears ring when it's quiet and I ain't heard a thing all day
And I'd call if I could but right now I ain't got nothing to say
And so on, and so long
...
