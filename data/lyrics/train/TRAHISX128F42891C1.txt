Buddy some Topeka night
When it's just you and the road
Seen no tailights there for miles
And nothin' much but static on the radio

Wasn't lookin' to the left
Wasn't lookin' to the right
Just kept walking' like Virginia to the surf
Towards the far end of the night

Time hangs like a noose
Before me
