The twilight shadows deepen into night, dear
The city lights are gleaming o'er the snow
I sit alone beside the cheery fire dear
I'm dreaming dreams from out the long ago
I fancy it is springtime in the mountain
The flowers with their colors are aflame
And every day I hear you softly saying
"I'll wait until the springtime comes again"

When it's springtime in the rockies
I am coming back to you
Little sweetheart of the mountains
With your bonny eyes of blue
Once again I'll say "I love you"
While the birds sing all the day
...
