Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless

Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless

Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless

Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Alone and defenceless

Every now and then when I see you
There seems to be no measure of time
I can't make you feel the way that I do
