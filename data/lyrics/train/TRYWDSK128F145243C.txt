When I was up
You'd always come around
When I need a friend
You could never be found
I got a hole
Where my heart used to be
I wouldn't treat a dog, no
The way you treated me

When time was good, love
All of your lovin' was the same
Oh, when the goin' got rough
Boy, you hardly knew my name
You locked me out
