Someone dies and as we close our eyes
Another hungry child will starve away
Say a prayer, we've got to be aware
If we're the ones to face another day

When my pleasure turns to pain
When I'm scared
I'm caught in a lifetime
Since the world has gone insane
Try to hold on
Open your eyes

Pay attention
The end is not that far away
Attention
We're heading towards judgement day
