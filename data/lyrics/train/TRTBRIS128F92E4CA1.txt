You are the one who causes me pain
You are the one who causes me grief
You are the one who lied to me
It won't be long soon you will see

King is coming
King is coming
King is coming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
King is coming

You are the one who magnifies hate
You are the one who destroy our love
You are the one disguised as a saint
