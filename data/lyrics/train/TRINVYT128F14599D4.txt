I'm the best friend he's got
I'd give him the shirt off my back
He knows he can trust me with his life
But he's tryin' to leave me alone
Leaves me alone with his wife

I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think he really trusts me too much

How can he be so blind?
We've both got the same good taste
He should know when he's gone on his business trips
I can't help watchin' his woman
'Cause I'm losin' my grip

I wish he didn't trust me so much
I think he really trusts me too much

Though I swear, all is not my will
...
