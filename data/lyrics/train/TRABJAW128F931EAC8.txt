Everybody knows
Everybody knows
That you cradle the sun, sun
([Suffer life again])
Living in remorse
Sky is over

Don't you want to hold me baby
Disappointed, going crazy

Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
The sky is over
I don't want to see you go
The sky is over
Even though we can't afford
...
