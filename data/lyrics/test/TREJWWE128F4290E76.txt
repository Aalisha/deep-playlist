Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else
You steam a lens stable eyes and glass
Not get pissed off through my bird lips as good news
Still we can find our love down from behind
Down far behind this fabulous, my turn rules

Beetles and eggs and blues and bells and eggs and then blued
Beetles and eggs and blues and pour a little everything else

You steam a lens stable eyes and glass
