Givin' up is hard to do when you really love someone.
Givin' up is so hard to do when you still depend upon…

His word and his tender touch.
His kiss and his caress.
Oh, oh it used to mean so much…
And bring your happiness.

Givin' up is so hard to do.
I've tried, but it just ain't no use.
Givin' up is so very, so very hard to do.
I said, I've tried, but it just ain't no use.
