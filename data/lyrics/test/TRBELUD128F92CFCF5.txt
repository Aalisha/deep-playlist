Hey…
Wooo…
Alright baby….
Ohhh…
Oh….
Yeah…
I can make the pain disappear
And I can erase the past ohh
I can make the future shine so bright
And I can make right now alright yeah
I got it you got it we got the magic girl
I got it you got it we got the magic girl
I got it you got it we got the magic girl
I got it you got it we got the magic girl
All I got is concrete all around me wooo…
But I can see the countryside
You can be rich when you're poor
Poor when you're rich
