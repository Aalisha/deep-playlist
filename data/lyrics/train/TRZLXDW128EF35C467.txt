- Clopin and Friends -
Alms for the beggar man
Please help the indigent of Paris
Madame I need a bit of sympathy

Alms for the beggar man
Who's there, don't be afraid of touching me
Blindness is not exactly leprosy

Alms for the beggar man
Kind sir can you spare a franc for some food
I'll take any gift you give but shoes

Alms for the beggar man
Hey look, these were hiding inside my clothes
At last I've got some hands to pick my nose

My God it's a miracle
