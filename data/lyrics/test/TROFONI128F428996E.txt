She thinks I walk on water
She thinks I hung the moon
She tells me every morning,
"They just don't make men like you"

She thinks I've got it together
She swears I'm as tough as nails
But I don't have the heart to tell her
She don't know me that well

She don't know how much I need her
She don't know I'd fall apart
Without her kiss, without her touch
Without her faithful, loving arms
She don't know that it's all about her
She don't know I can't live without her
...
