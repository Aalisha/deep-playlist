Oh yeah, nananana yea, oh Mama, Mama dont cry, Mama dont cry dont cryyy...

Mama dont cry no more, Oh better days are there for sure
Wipe those tears from your eyes
I will bear the hunger, we poor [x2]

[Verse:]
Mama, theres so many times we go through days without food to eat
Mama, theres so many nights we sleep in a bundle like a flock of sheep
Mama, i know what it feels like to have a holey shoes on my feet
So mama don't cry, cus i know
I'm gonna make your bitter turn sweet.

[Chorus:]
Mama dont cry no more
OOh.better days are there for sure
Wipe those tears from your eyes
Oh i will bear the hunger, we poor
(Mama dont cry)
