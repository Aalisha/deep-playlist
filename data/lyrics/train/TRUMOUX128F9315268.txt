I had my coffee and I waited for a while
I was waiting for your smile
But you never came
I wasn't thirsty, but I poured down every drop
I was so sure you'd show up
But you never came
So maybe you just couldn't find the time
There might have been an accident,
It might have slipped your mind
I know you didn't mean to let me down
