Long day and I'm ready
I'm waiting for your call
'Cause I've made up my mind
My heart aches with a hunger
And I want that you were mine
No I cannot deny
So for one night
Is it all right
That I give you

My heart
My love

My heart
Just for one night
My body
My soul
Just for one night
My love

My love
For one night
One night
