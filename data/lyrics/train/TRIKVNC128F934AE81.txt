Ah - oh; she rides like the wind
Praise her world
Long live Seyreon!
On yes, she goes on -
- Aieliaria and Everonn -
I can see the starlight
Fading from me
Hear; there -
She calls
Whither in darkness befalls
There Novia rings
In fear for my
Soul, that she sing
In my dreams
Calling my name, Everonn -
On -

Aieliaria Ann
Princess of the
Winds she commands;
Natures goddess heir
Knows only one single care
...
