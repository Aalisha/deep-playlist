Now the apology done
Applause can begin
Now the apologies done
Applause begins

If it bleeds it leads
If it cries it flies
If it feeds a need
If it dies, it dies

Now the struggle has a name
It doesn't fade, it hasn't changed
I still feel the same
Now the struggle has a name

And Honey Watson
I struggle on

Oh Honey Watson
