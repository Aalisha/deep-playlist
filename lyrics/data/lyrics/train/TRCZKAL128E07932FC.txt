Rejoice rejoice
Good tidings I bring you
Hear ye a message to you my friend
Voices cry invoke your angels
When pressure drop it cannot conquer dread no
So blow away your bluesy feeling
Spirits say take the world off you shoulder
One foot in the grave is a foolish step to take (dancer)

Who sow in tears shall reap in joy
Wise man doctrines assure your safety
No more stumbling block back stabbers get down
To the righteous revealed
The secret of the scriptures
The wicked dem portion is vanity
Disciples of Lucifer

In your hands lie your destination
The book of true life you hold the key
