They say that nothin' lasts forever
And things can fall apart in a day
We? ve been so happy together, oh
I just want you to know, I? m here to stay, oh

So if your luck ever leaves you
And your friends don? t call
If they should ever deceive you
I won? t let you fall

'Cause if it all comes tumble tumble down
You know I? m the one who? ll always need you so
I? m the one who? ll never let you go
If it all comes crashin' to the ground

You know I? m the one who? ll find you anywhere
I? m the girl you know who? ll always care
If it all comes tumble tumble down

They say that the city? s gonna slide in the ocean
And rain? s gonna fall for forty days
