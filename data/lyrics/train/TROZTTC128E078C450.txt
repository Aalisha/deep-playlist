Got to keep on...
We waste our time with big illusions
Talking to the walls
But Jericho will never fall
We sold our trumpets long ago
Exchanging all the best we had
Into atomic master plans
We read the books, we had our chance
We spend the world for just one dance
So keep on dancing, all you fools
(Got to keep on dancing)
The cups of fury have been filled
So keep on dancing, all you clowns
(Got to keep on dancing)
