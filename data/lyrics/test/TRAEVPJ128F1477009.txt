I know where to go tomorrow
Where tears will not find me
And I'll give you this song
When autumn rays come down
Ring out the bells on Tara
My destiny in your hands

I'm waiting at the crossroads, waiting for you
With the blossoms around us, promising true
Dreaming on the high wind, dream it for you
And return to our lost ocean blue
...
