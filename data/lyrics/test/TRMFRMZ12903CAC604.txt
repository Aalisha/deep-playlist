You can depend
On certainty
Count it out and weigh it up again
You can be sure
You've reached the end
And still you don't feel

Do you know you're beautiful
Do you know you're beautiful
Do you know you're beautiful
You are, yes you are

You can ignore
What you've become
Take it out and see it die again
You can be here
For who's a friend
...
