Go to work
The foreman teats me like dirt
day after day
Don't realise how it hurts
Deep down inside
justice burns like a flame
but I go straight home and treat my children the same

Who's in charge of this program here?
Break out of the trance
I can't get nowhere advancing to the rear
Break out of the trance,
Break out of the trance,
Break out of the trance

You don't get this chance too often
when you're out with your pals
You'll be sick in the morning but don't think about that now
You're an upstanding person
You'd never go too far
...
