Standin' on the side of the road with a long shadow and suitcases, 
going nowhere, and I don't care, I'm a grown man. 
Hold my own hand, kickin' my own ass for cryin', 
I'm dyin' on the inside, they don't know who I am.
Filthy, fraught, and haunted by a guilty conscience,
runnin' away, and all because of silly nonsense.
Gone since - God knows when, 
and I aint comin' back knowin' that, no one gives a rat's ass anyway.

I just wanna find a place where I can sit in a rocking chair, 
no matter how far, even if it means walking there.
Maybe I'll get me a dog for some company, 
it's better than tryin' to figure out somebody.
Give me a good book, a radio, and a sewing machine, 
...
