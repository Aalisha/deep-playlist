Say I (I)

Say I (I)

If you want a brand new shiny car, say I
If you're sick of songs about broken hearts, say I
If you spent some nights parkin' at the noon
If you don't like being told what to do

Say I (I)
I gotta have something to hang my dreams upon
Say I (I)
I'm gonna keep rockin' until I'm dead and gone

If you turn up the radio too loud, say I
If you make the tilt-a-whirl spin round, say I
