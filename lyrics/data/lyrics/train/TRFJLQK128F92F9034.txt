Had a sweet little girl, I lose my baby, boy ain't that bad
Had a sweet little girl, I lose my baby, boy ain't that bad
You can't spend what you ain't got, 
You can't lose some little girl you ain't never had

Had money in the bank, I got busted, people ain't that bad
Had money in the bank, I got busted, people ain't that bad
You can't spend what you ain't got, 
You can't lose some little girl you ain't never had

Ain't that the truth boys
