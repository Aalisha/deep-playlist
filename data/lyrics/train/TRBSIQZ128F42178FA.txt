Few will escape the sleep that swells there lungs. Consider youself fortunate for the rest.
Dirt helmet silence is held high in regards of the troubled.
Sleep easy under this illusion that your dreaming and waking is merely a thing of fact.
While your sleeping I'm plotting a way to end this night.
I'll shout down the moon and keep the sun at bay.
Four chimes and an empty bed remind me I'm still here.
Don't sleep. Here silence is revered and held holy, quiet enough to hear my blood hit the ground like razors through my veins.
Sleep in. This rest we dream forever.
