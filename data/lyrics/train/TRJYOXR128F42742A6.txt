Westside
We live in la la, we smokin' la la
Fuck wit dada, boo, go bye bye
Nigga, ha ha
We live in la la, we smokin' la la
Fuck wit dada, boo, go bye bye
Nigga, ha ha

Get outta pocket, we might just whoop yo' ass
Pull out a rocket, we might just take yo' cash
An' when I cock it, we might step out an' blast
But we ain't gon' let that bullshit pass

I used to be a young phenom like Lebron
Now I'm doin' shit beyond Genghis Khan
Peon, you can't pass on Deon
The best rapper in the world ain't a European

Look, respect my gangsta, nigga, obey
An' I been rich since my first pro day, ask O' Shea
West ridin' is my forte
An' will the hustle ever stop? Nigga, no way

No, niggaz can't fuck wit Dub SC
Gang related an' leavin' 'em leakin' like STDs
C-Walkin' out of the SC, lettin' the tech breathe
Until I rest in peace, Dub gon' rep these streets

K Mac is the one, nigga, fuck Neo
No love, hit 'em up with the dub wherever we go
My game's so cold, the hoes call me Sub Zero
Oh, you know that nigga pimpin', Ken? That's my hero

Get outta pocket, we might just whoop yo' ass
Pull out a rocket, we might just take yo' cash
An' when I cock it, we might step out an' blast
But we ain't gon' let that bullshit pass
