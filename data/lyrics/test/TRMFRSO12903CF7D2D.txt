One Two One Two Three
Well I take whatever I want
And baby I want you
You give me something I need
Now tell me I got something for you
Come on come on come on and do it
Come on and-uh do what you do
I can't get enough of your love, uh

I can't get enough of your love
I can't get enough of your love
Listen

Well it's late and I want love
Love that's gonna break me in two
Gonna hang me up in your doorway
Gonna you hang me up like you do
