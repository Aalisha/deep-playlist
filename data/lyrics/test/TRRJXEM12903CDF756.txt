As the heaven shatter
Carries on the breeze
On the edge of the great abyss
In the pause occupying the space
That seperates lightning and rainfall
Not unlike the echo of murder
That travels on the wind
Satanus- summon the sleepwalker
The silence in a world that screams
Celebrate me
For I am your new Christ
There can be no Heaven without Hell
