Fell down this old road and I don? t care
If you roll on your sides, I seen a ghost
In the future, sometimes it gets hard to hide
If you need somethin', don? t let me know
Subtle substance control turns to overflow
I gotta get my connect

I saw her in the bathroom drinkin' vodka
She must have been a sweet nothin'
Dope let's her slide, looks she can? t hide
Heroin hands can? t keep her clean
She needs another way out
