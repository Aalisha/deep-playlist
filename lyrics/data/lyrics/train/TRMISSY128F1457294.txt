Woke up a little too rough
Looking like a quarter when a dollar ain't enough
This room is just a mess
Nothing's ever working and I couldn't care less
You know I ain't got no honey
Because I ain't got no money
Broke up, no goodbye
Now it's down to slumming and living high and dry

So don't go coming around
No more bringing me down

There's nothing left, baby, it's all over now
That's why can't cry, now you've got a ticket, it's all over now
...
