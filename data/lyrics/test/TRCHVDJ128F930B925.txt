For those who thought I didn't survive
And that I faced my end that night
You should know by now. I'm truly alive!

That force creates a place for those
Who have used that magic force
This is the place where we spend eternity

Where I am called Shadow Land
Like ghosts in the dark
To be free, I found and I believe
That I get out of here, forevermore

I am the silent voice, in his wicked mind
I rule, I command him, until I find the way, out from here.
