I can't take your hand and
Lead you to the water
I can't make you feel what you don't feel
But you know you wanna

Find out how to crack me
Log in try to hack me
Underneath the surface
There's so much you need to know And you might feel like you're drowning
But that's what I need to let go

Tell me what you got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite
Tell me what you got to break down the walls
Kick senseless my defenses
Tell me what you're gonna do
I need you to light the fuse
Tell me what you've got to break down the walls
You just might need dynamite

(Got dynamite)
Got dynamite?
(Got dynamite)
