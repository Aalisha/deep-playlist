I have given all my life to you,
Still I can't see you through.
I've been waiting for a star to fall
And I've come to the point where I can't stand one more single lie,
No more lies.
You gave me gold and I called you teaser
But you told all your friends: 'It was just to please her'.
How come every road I walk is winding,
When I can watch from behind as you are sliding?

I believe in life,
I believe in dreams,
I believe in everything in between,
But I know for sure my love is more than you can retrieve.
I gave it all, I got it back, right in the face it's just the fact
...
