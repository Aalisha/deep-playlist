South of the Mason-Dixon finger-lickin' good

Welcome to my neighborhood
Congeniality, hostpitality go hand in hand,

But don't dis a Southerner, we're quick to take a stand.
The South will rise again already there Olympic City, '96 was our year.

The weather's swell, on racism we won't dwell

'Cause everything north of us they won't tell.

I've got that Southern pride.
