I tried everything to find you
I even took the stairway to hell
I wrote these words down to remind you
that I know life is never pass or fail

so hand me the keys to your kingdom
give me back my garden of Eden
lead me to a place that I can call my own

a home
a sanctuary
home

and we are standing on the edge of it
trying to make some sense of it all
the fear is building and the hatred
...
