We're standing in front of the fire on this faux-summer night 
It just takes one spark and we'll burn this whole place down 
I love the way your eyes turned red when the city hall burned bright 
As red as the blood from my arm searching for colours 

We'll burn this whole place down 
I think I'm ready now 
As red as the blood from my arms 
To take the life of someone who should die 
We'll burn this whole place down 
...
