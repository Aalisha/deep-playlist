Some people they call me Jack
Some people they call me insane
I'm looking for somebody
And I don't even know her name
I might be looking for you
Wherever you may be
For there is something I've got to do to you honey
And it's between you and me
Now you might think it's fun
Or maybe it's a joke
But you've got plenty of reason to worry honey
Cause you wouldn't stand a hope

There's a killer on the loose again
A killer on the loose
There's a killer on the loose again
A ladykiller on the loose

Now I'm not trying to be nasty
Or I'm not trying to make you scared
But there's a killer on the loose
Or haven't you heard
He'll be walking around this town
