You wanted excuses, they gave you excuses
The pressure got stronger, inside you grew warmer
The calender boiled, time just ticked away for you
Now you're on your own

Another day gone by
I see it in your eyes
Trying so hard just to please
Did you stop to think?

We're seein' things different in time
