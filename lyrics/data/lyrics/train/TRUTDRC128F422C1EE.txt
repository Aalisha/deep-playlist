You say that you're leaving
You give me your reasons
I can tell by your voice that
you're not alone, alone
Is she out in the hallway
As you're taking your love away
Hearing every word I say
Try to fight, find reasons why
But you don't hear a word I say, no

Time's run out
I'm walking out, I'm walking out
Time to find some peace of mind
I'm walking out
(I'm walking out, I'm walking out)

You come 'round to see me
You say that you've been missing me
I can tell by your face what
you came here for
