Don't ever let nobody drag your spirit down
(Eric Bibb version)

You might slip, you know you might slide.
Stumble and fall by the road side.

But don't you ever let nobody, drag your spirit down.
Remember we're walking up to heaven, don't let nobody turn your around.

Walk with the rich, and walk with the poor.
Learn from everyone, that's what life is for.
