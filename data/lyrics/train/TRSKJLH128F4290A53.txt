About this time of evening, out by the bay
They turn the roadlights on the bridge
Well, a diesel rolls in silhouette, eastbound
Lovers glad the sun has set

I'm staring into twilight
Wishing I could find someone tonight

I know she's out there somewhere
On the western skyline
Lonely women say a prayer
On the western skyline

The rooftops sag on Second Street
Bachelor's quarters
Too much fun, not enough dough
Well, the kite's still hanging on the wire
