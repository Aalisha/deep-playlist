I saw my love walking down the aisle
And as he passed me by
He turned to me and gave me a smile

Then the preacher, then the preacher
The preacher joined their hands
And all the people, the people began to stand
When I shouted

"You know that it should have been me"
Instead of her walking with you
You know that it should have been me, oh baby
Gettin' ready to marry you, darlin', darlin', darlin'

You made a promise that we would never part
...
