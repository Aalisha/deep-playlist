There is a time to laugh
And a time to cry
And there is a time to accept
And a time to deny

There is a time to be strong
And a time to be weak
And there is a time to listen
And a time we must speak

For everything there's a reason
For everything there's a rhyme
For everything there's a season
For everything there's a time

For everything, everything
Everything there's a time
For everything, everything
