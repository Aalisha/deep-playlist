Hang the Jolly Roger, it's time to set the mood
All kinds are invited, the sweeties and the rude
I see so many people, who's here that I know?
I don't see any faces, they're head first in the snow
My dazed eyes closing, how I want to see
What did I just say, I've lost my memory
Find someone to lean against, I don't wanna fall
He can't drive 55, well I can't drive at all
Going Under, but I'm still drinking, and will until dawn's light
