Babylon be still while I blow this trumpet.
Babylon be still.

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same that was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without
him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light
of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not...
He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came
unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he
power to become the sons of God...
Jah Rastafari, Haile Selassie the First.
Who was born not of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of the will of God.
Full of grace and truth. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among I and I and I and I.
And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace
and truth.

King Haile Selassie I
