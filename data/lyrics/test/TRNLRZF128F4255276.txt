Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
It's bad, know I mean? It's bad

'Cause I'm goin' through a couple things
Life means change, that's the way it goes

All my life I had a constant burning, a strong deep desire
An aching ambiguous yearning, yearning, yearning
For something better, for something bigger
For something wider, for something higher

And lots of regrets 'cause I ain't seem to found it yet
I've been searchin' around the world
