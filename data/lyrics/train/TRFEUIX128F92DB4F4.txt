Push the pen to the paper
Wasting ink trying to make her move back east
To good old New Jersey
I know it's not feasible
Running out of reasons to
Have these doubts in my mind
Oh, in my mind.

[Chorus:]
Go for it, don't play these games
I promise you it's right
Settle down and think this out it's way too far to try
