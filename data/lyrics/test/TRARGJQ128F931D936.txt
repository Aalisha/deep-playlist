Take my cigaretts trash my guitar
I'll do anything just to know where you are
I'll write your name across the whole Chines wall
Please pick up the phone, answer my call

I know last night didn't turn out so great
I feel like Nixon right after Watergate
And I'm so sorry but I'll make it up to you
Oh, that's the reason why

I fly around the world
To bring my baby back
I give my word
It's just a simple fact
All around the world
And I won't stop
No matter where she's at
I'll bring my baby back
Oh, I'll bring my baby back

I'd cross the ocean in a boat full of holes
To find you baby, I'd walk on burning coals
Give me a sign, tell me where to run
So I won't be like Icaros and fly into the sun

I fly around the world
