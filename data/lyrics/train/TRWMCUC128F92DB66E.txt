Work the same job for 25 years
Boss still don't know my name
Whether I screw up or tow the line
Things stay about the same
Break my back making a rich man richer
What am I working for
Just to send my wife to buy crap I don't need
At the all-night discount store
So roll me a joint, fix me a turkey pot pie
