Running the race like a mouse in a cage
Getting nowhere, but I'm trying
Forging ahead but I'm stuck in the bed
That I made, so I'm lying

But if you keep real close
Yeah, you stay real close
I will reach you
I'm down to a whisper
In a daydream on a hill
Shut down to a whisper
Can you hear me still
...
