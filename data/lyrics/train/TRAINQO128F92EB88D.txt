Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart, we got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we leave
Need no conversation
We ride it together, ah huh

Making love with each
other, ah huh
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
...
