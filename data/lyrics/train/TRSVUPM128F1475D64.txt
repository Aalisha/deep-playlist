Got an illusion,
I wanted to say,
There's something wrong here
A lot to take,
I need to play the game again

All my friends are slipping in the mud,
Well it's a lot like dying, a lot like trying,
All my friends are misunderstood
I don't know which way to point my kiss,
Well it's a lot too clever, it's all too severe,
All my friends are cold in their graves

Got an illusion,
I wanted to say,
There's something wrong here
A lot to take,
I need to play the game again

Got an illusion,
I guess it's okay,
...
