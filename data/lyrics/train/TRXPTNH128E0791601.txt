Eggplant
Michael Franks
From: The Art of Tea
Whenever I explore the land of Yin
I always take one on the chin
And now this lioness has almost made me tame.
I can't pronounce her name but eggplant is her game.

The lady sticks to me like white on rice.
She never cooks the same way twice.
Maybe it's the mushrooms.
Maybe the tomatoes.
