The path of choice optimal
The labyrinth unsolved
Haunting the complex of these halls
Adrift upon the massive waves
This godforsaken maze
Suddenly returning to the haze

Guiding star shine bright tonight
And light up the path
Time has come to know myself

Least resistant path
The burning signals I'm finding
Least resistant path
Things to be said and done
I burn with the flames
Float with the uncontrolled waters
My soul flies with the breeze
