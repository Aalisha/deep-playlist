I'm dreaming of death, I take deep dive.
The rest of my life will drown in your eyes.
The words in my mouth will take your heart.
Repeating the rhyme that reveals my disguise.
I feel your pain,
Inside of my dreams where is nothing to see it all.
I fall into you and I take it all down, and reach for my dawn.

I will blacken your eyes and mute your mouth,
Blind love is the bound.
I reach to your heart it's cold inside,
I'll suffer in flames that burns my eyes.
