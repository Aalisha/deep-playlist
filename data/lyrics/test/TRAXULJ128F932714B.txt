People are in the dark, they don't know what to do
Had a little lantern oh but it got blown out too
I'm reachin out my hands. I know you are too
Cuz I just want to be in the dark with you

Every day every night all over my whole life through
Just let me be in the dark with you
Every day every night all over my whole life through
