I, I have this need
I need to see you bleed
I need to taste your brain
Oh god it drives me insane

Come, come over here my dear
Theres nothing for you to fear
I need a little piece of your head
So you too can be among the living dead

you know I need it
you know I feel it
you know I want it
some fresh blood and flesh

please forgive for me wrong
