what are you gonna do with all your lonely letters?
why don't you pack them up and send them all to me
instead of sitting around and thinking what could be better
don't you kinda wonder what i've got up my sleeve
and while you sit around like a deer caught in the headlights
1500 miles i could do it in a day
