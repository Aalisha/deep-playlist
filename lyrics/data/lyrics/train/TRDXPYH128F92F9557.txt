Together on the eve of the new year
In a logging camp in Gatineau
Far away from the ones we love
In the desolation and the snow

Drunk Baptiste says he has a plan
A plan to travel across this land
We'll be with our family tonight and be back before first light
We must run La Chasse Galerie
Make a deal with the Devil
He'll give us what we need
On a flying canoe we ride
To the r√©vellion or die

And then the Devil appeared and the rules he made quite clear
Touch not a cross or swear on the Lord's name
Or your soul is lost
Be back before the light as well
If not it's straight to hell
We put our fears aside
To the rules we will abide

Let's ride tonight across the sky
...
