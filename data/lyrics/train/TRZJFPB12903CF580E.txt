In the sea beyond us
In the city below
How much farther must I guide you
Until youll let me go
You are the violent thief within
Taking all that I hold dear
You are the gorgeous parasite
Feeding on my fear

So bring it on heavy Severine
Youre coming through loud and clear
Show me no mercy Severine
Youll still have sanctuary here
