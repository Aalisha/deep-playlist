There isn't much that I feel I need
A solid soul and the blood I bleed
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
I only want a proper house

There isn't much (isn't much)
That I feel I need (that I feel I need)
A solid soul (a solid soul)
And the blood I bleed
(And the blood I bleed)
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
(and by my spouse)
I only want (I only want)
a proper house (a proper house)

There isn't much (isn't much)
That I feel I need (that I feel I need)
A solid soul (a solid soul)
And the blood I bleed
(And the blood I bleed)
But with a little girl, and by my spouse
(and by my spouse)
I only want (I only want)
a proper house (a proper house)

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will, with heart, on my father's grave

I don't care for fancy things
Or to take part in the freshest wave
But to provide for mine who ask
I will, with heart, on my father's grave

On my father's grave
(On your father's grave)
On my father's grave
(On your father's grave)
On my father's grave
(On your father's grave)
