When the weight of the world is on my shoulders
And my bridges are broken
I will remember You
When the flowers are blooming
Skies are bluer than ever
And everything's well
I will remember You

Oh Lord my God
You walk beside me
Through my laughter through the tears
Oh Lord my God
You hold and You hide me
...
