I'm not behind your boy
and I'm not behind your ass
I don't want to fall in love
with the whole male working class
you say that I'm a problem
but the problem isn't me
it's your narrow minded sexuality
given by the law, by the church and their holy hypocrisy
you don't like when two men kiss,
but child pornography
...
