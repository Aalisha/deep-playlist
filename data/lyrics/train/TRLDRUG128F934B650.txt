I am washing my hands of you.
hand prints on my heart still bleeding through.
a momentary chance for reasoning . . .
and in the morning she'll be leaving.
this is one fight i can not win.

she is delicate when she smiles at you and you hate it.
let it go unnoticed, a perfect reflection.
he wants what she wants . . .
i had seen it in a movie once.
a hollywood romance and i let it go unnoticed.

its been a long night and im not looking forward to this drive.
its been a long night and im not looking forward to saying goodbye.
