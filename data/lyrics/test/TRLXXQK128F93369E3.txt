o sleep last night, I been dreaming of you
Please hold me tight
I just can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Deep in the night you took my heart
Now danger's in sight
I just can't help the way that I feel
I just can't help the way that I feel
Girl you make my love come down
