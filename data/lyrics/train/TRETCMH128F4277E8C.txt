The key's in the ignition
We're going home, going home
And there's nowhere to go but home
There's nowhere to go

Timing is everything we need
It is the only thing that's keeping us from leaving

Trust me, trust me
We'll be there soon
We'll be there soon

Our wheels are stuck in the mud
Our wheels are stuck in the mud
And with the storm rolling in,
It looks like this could be the end
It looks like this could be the end

There's a gaping hole, it's so big
...
