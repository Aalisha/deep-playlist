Here I stand baby, holding out my hand
You need love, real love. Ain’t no better man.
I tried to work it out, but anything I could do.
My words are falling after years, there is no getting through to you.
I’m speaking from the heart now, hear what I say.
You find a way to good things
Maybe the best thing to come your way.

You better think twice, before you walk away, think twice yeah.
Before you close that door, take another long last look at the one who loves you

Consider everything, cause what we had was good.
