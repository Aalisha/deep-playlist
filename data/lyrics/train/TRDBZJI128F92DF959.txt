Somedays I barely
hold on
When life drags
me down
I wanna let go

But when my spirit is weak
You come to my aid
And strengthen my soul
I'm lost without you
I'm never doubt you
Your grace is beyond compare
And thought when it rains it pours
You know all I have is yours
Your smile when you hear my prayer

You rescued me
And I believe
That God is love
And he is all I need
From this day forth
For all eternity
I'll never wander on my own
For I am yours
Until you call me home
I close my eyes
And I can hear you say

You're not Alone
