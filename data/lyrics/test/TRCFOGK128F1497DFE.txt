Sam, bless him, has died and left this home
The woodchucks running wild, the bushes overgrown
Slip unseen into the skein of trees
Slide through dusky grasses and scatter his ashes

Oh, it's all over, he's never coming back
There'll be no more roaming
He was only here for fourteen years
And now the branches scratch my face and I can't hold back my tears

Long ago I'd see him running in the snow
He'd come in from the cold and he'd lie down by the stove
Pass along this loping road
...
