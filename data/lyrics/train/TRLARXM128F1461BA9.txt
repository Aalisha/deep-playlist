Jo Ann Walker was a girl of trade
She had friends all over town
Jo Ann knew it was a stroke of fate
That she had to walk the streets up and down
And every time a car would stop
Sweet Jo Ann just waved hello
She'd get in and tell him where to go
Jo Ann Walker goes around all over town

Everybody knew about Jo Ann
'cos everyone had passed the word around
In the streets she'd cause a traffic jam
She was a queen and the talk of the town
