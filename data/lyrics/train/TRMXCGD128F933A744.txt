I've been to hell. I spell it...
I spell it DMV
Anyone that's been there
knows precisely what I mean
Stood there and I've waited
and choked back the urge to scream
And if I had my druthers
I'd screw a chimpanzee

call it pointless

When I need relief I spell it THC
Perhaps you may know vaguely what I mean
...
