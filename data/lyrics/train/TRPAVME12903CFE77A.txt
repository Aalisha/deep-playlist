For once my eyes are open to you, and everything you’ve said.
For once your web of lies is in the open.
I gave you everything I had, until I had nothing left.
And Still you act as if I’m just a burden.
I’ve finally let go.
Let go
Let go

Stay silent at least for now, and let me move on.
Cause I’m so done playing these games with my heart
I’ve been around the world and back for you, and now its time to choose.

I’ve been swallowed by this wreck that you call your life.
