I am livin' on Channel Z
Getting nothing but static, getting nothing but static
Static in my attic from Channel Z
Getting nothing but static, getting nothing but static.
Static filling my attic from Channel Z

I don't know---I feel like something's happening
Something good is happening!
I feel love has got to come on, and I want it
Something big and lovely

I want the world to change for me! Gotta get away
Away from Z---Living on the edge of Z
Space junk---laser bombs---ozone holes
Better put up my umbrella!
Giant stacks blowin' smoke
Politicrits pushin' dope

All I know---we've got to change what's happening
Something good could happen
I feel light has got to come through---and I need it
