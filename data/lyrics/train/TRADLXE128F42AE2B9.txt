When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you

Is this forever, this feeling I got
Not enough and too much - so free and so caught up
And something and nothing - both at the same
I'm either out of my head or I'm out of my mind

When I find out who I am
I'm gonna know just what to do
When I pull myself together again
I'm gonna give myself to you
