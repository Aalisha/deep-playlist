Uhh, yes yes, y'all
To the beat, and the S.V.'s is rockin it swift
Yes y'all, lyrics just come off like shifts
See when I'm on the microphone how fly I get
Yes y'all, my crew don't take no bullshit
Bullshit not never, never get wet up
Your hoe want to know why the crew's gettin better
Not sayin shit, just gettin my flows together
Yes y'all, to the beat and
What y'all, if you hear what I am sayin
Hoes get dig down and get dug down when I start sprayin
Cause when I'm on the microphone there will be no delayin
No playin

You think we talk cause we don't bust gats
Others be like they're weak cause they don't kill in they raps
(Kill in they raps) Fuck that! We from the city of crooks
Niggaz be dyin for givin them fake-ass looks'll
Get yo', shit took quick, check it in
Niggaz pony down while the hoes Errol Flynn

OOH, OOH! With the usual
