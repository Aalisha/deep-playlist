I wanna dance

Dance with the funk and get loose
Now hit the floor directly through the roof
Cool kick the nation with the groove
Till we rock the place when the biz gets moved

Dance with the funk and get loose
Now hit the floor directly through the roof
Cool kick the nation with the groove
Till we rock the place when the biz gets moved

Dance with the funk and get loose
Now hit the floor directly through the roof
Cool kick the nation with the groove
Till we rock the place when the biz gets moved

Dance with the funk and get loose
Now hit the floor directly through the roof
Cool kick the nation with the groove
Till we rock the place when the biz gets moved

Dance with the funk and get loose
Now hit the floor directly through the roof
