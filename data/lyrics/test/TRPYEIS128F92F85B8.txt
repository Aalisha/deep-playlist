Dirty on the ground is white on me
I got another one to tell you and another one to make you believe
Pity on the grass, I tried to be
The one you needed when I told you that you wanted something bigger than me

I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want and I know they don't want me to stay
I said that I've got friends in all the right places
I know what they want and I know they don't want me to stay

'Cause you and I will ride
But when I need you
I need it quickly
