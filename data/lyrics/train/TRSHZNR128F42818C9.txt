All the women in the factory
when their faces blow a fuse it's a miracle
i have to feed them facts to be alone
magnifico!
oh, fellas and umbrellas in the middle of the night
what you gonna do when the menanites bite?
lock lips in the teddy boy's cheverolet
dutch tips and you're punked in the alleyway

novotel; the phone's tapped anyway
novotel; i need something of my own
no dice, i feed them facts to be alone
...
