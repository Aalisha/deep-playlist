I'm on the phone I can't say anything in case I say the wrong thing,
and you smile like you like this but maybe it's not working,
I'm a stone under a mountain and I wish that you'd stop thinking,
and you lie under the mountain cause you know you can't do anything.

And you check your phone 'cause you're looking for an escape,
sometimes when we fall we just land in the right place,
'cause we're magnetic and we land in the right place,
are you magnetic do you land in the right place?

It tasted bad I wore a mouth guard the blood was overwhelming,
head over heel a mild concussion do you remember was I talking,
you've been had and in attack you said maybe we're exhausting,
it's not real but in attack I know just what you're saying.
