You and I, stand with our heads held up high
Me and you, together whatever we do
You and I, stand with our heads held up high
Me and you, together whatever we do

All the love - you've given me, I cherish, babe, so tenderly
All the times - I've spent with you, I treasure girl, you know I do
Everything I possess is down to you more or less
Anything that you say, I'm for you all the way
All the joy that you bring makes my heart wanna sing
Really forever this way
