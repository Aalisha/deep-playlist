You feel the weight of the world on your shoulder
As every day gets shorter and colder
And hand in hand we walk through a land of fire
The mountains bleed red as the sun gets higher

All the things that you want, I'll provide
Till your footprint is swept away by the tide
I can wait for a while, I don't mind
I can wait for a while 'cause I got time

I wish it was less of the way it is
I wish it were more of the way it could be
...
