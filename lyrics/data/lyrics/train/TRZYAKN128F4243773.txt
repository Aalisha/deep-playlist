Please listen to me and don't disagree
Even as we fight, it doesn't matter to me
Please listen to me and don't disagree
Even as we fight, it doesn't matter to me

Please listen to me and don't disagree
Even as we fight, it doesn't matter to me
Alone in this place, you alone in my bed
I feel nothing but grace and these thoughts in my head
