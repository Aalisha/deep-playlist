(I will not give up on you)

Cute red hood come walk with me
Leave your room mate friend
Come up to this apartment with me
Your soft feet will melt
They walked so far, jumped workin' streets
They need to feel some furs
Come up to my den with me

(Wait, shoot straight)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you make me want to...
