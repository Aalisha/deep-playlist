You took me by surprise
just like a rainbow in the night.
When I looked in your eyes

I could see diamonds shining bright.
I never realized you'd be the one to make it right.
You got me hypnotized
before my life was black and white.
You and me make a teom
I want you near me every day.
Last night I had a dream: You went away.

Don't breok my heart
don't let me down
