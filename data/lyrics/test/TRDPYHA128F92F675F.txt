Big boy shit, you dig

Up in the wolves where the deer's run free
Kevlar fire, streets get low key
Ferragamo attire, preach and pope free
Sprinkle in the air, not a wrinkle in my gear
Got my girl wide open, see the twinkle in her stare

Valley stream water, got that valley clean aura
Puffin' Cali green, when I steam I'ma cough-a
Copin' with the game, got me loc'in' at the rain
Lettin' off rifles, vocalin' my name

Postin' in the grain, hear the callin' of the wild
See the birds in the air, hear the bears on the prowl
Chillin' like a villain, got them mirrors on my ceilin'
Pillow top on the bed, takin' shots to the head

Flat screen vision, it's that happy king's livin'
Far from the stars and the bars and the prisons
...
