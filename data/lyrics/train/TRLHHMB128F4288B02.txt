Walkin' down a dark alley, shook as a bitch, lookin' behind me (shit)
I'm paranoid, heart beatin' like clips that unload fast
And click 'til you drop in a ditch
And get colder by the moment while you moan and you twitch, oh
Somebody's followin' Jean
Now somethin's creepin' up 'tween the shadows and the city lights
And it's mean
I can't sleep no more
Can't eat, can't keep food inside of my jaw
Pardon me y'all
I feel it in the air like I'm Phil Collins
The whole problem is ill, my first instinct's to get violent
I can't see it clearly, God wished me safety
If He ever appears then please just God take me
I'm hearin' words spoken when I'm turnin' off the lights
Feelin' hands chokin' my neck, provokin' me to fight
Jean's lost it, sweet Jesus, mind's been accosted
In prison and these visions and yo, I can't come off it
Oh God

[Hook]
I think I'm goin' crazy
Oh Lord I'd wish you'd save me
(Oh God) I can't keep runnin'
Please, somebody save me
(Oh Lord, la la la la)
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

{*harmonizes*}

[Verse 2]
I'm thinkin' it's some Geto Boys +Mind Playin' Tricks on Me+, shit
