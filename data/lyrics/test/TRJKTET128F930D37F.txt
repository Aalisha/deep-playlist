I'll give myself a vision for a boy for this one girl. 
He can be the colors of a paintbox set in a black and white world. He'll be a bit of everything, be the silver in the clouds. 
Be a whisper silent as a kiss or a scream that's just as loud. 
I know he can be found. 

Adonis Blue 
Adonis Blue. 
Sad like me but he's always smiling. 
You can't find me. 
I can't find you. 
You're tried and true. 
It's only you 
Adonis Blue. 

He'll be the stroke of midnight or the morning's faithful rise. 
Be the music buried in the garden of a church like the loveliest surprise. 
I heard there isn't anyone, that the breed has long been gone. 
I'm still not sure that I'm convinced 
Gonna try to prove them wrong. 
Gonna look and look and look hard and long. 

Adonis Blue 
Adonis Blue
