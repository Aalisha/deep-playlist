Look at me
It really was not easy
But I can breathe
And I'm so grateful 'cause I can see
I am free to do exactly what I please
So come with me to a place where we can be

Ooh I wanna touch the sky
I wanna fly so high
Ooh I wanna hold you
I wanna love you tonight
Ooh I wanna touch the sky
I wanna fly so high
Ooh I wanna satisfy
I wanna make you cry

Follow me to a place where we can be
Absolutely free
To be exactly what you want to be
Completely, lose control that's when I need you more
Give me the key, to set your heart and spirit free
