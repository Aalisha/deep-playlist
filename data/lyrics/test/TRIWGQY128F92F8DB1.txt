We fought your wars with all our hearts
You sent us back in body parts
You took our wills with the truth you stole
We offer prayers for your long lost soul
Your remainder is an unjustifiable
Egotistical power struggle
At the expense of the American dream
Of the American dream, of the American
We don't give a damn about your world
With all your global profits and all you're to oppose
We don't give a damn about your world
Right now, right now
We don't give a fuck about your world
With all your global profits and all you're to oppose
We don't give a fuck about your world
Right now, right now, right now, right now
