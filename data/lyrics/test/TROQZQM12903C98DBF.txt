I'm asleep on a train on the Zone 2 boundary
Awoken by the weary sigh of a ticket guy
Placating some 'young lady' by his side
I was late, I was tired and I lost my Oyster card
He's coming on with all this tired bureaucracy
When all I need is empathy and sleep
On the street nothing's changed since the 1990s
(You've changed, you're so much older)
Oh, I haven't changed since '99
(Well I've seen your suit)
I've still got my paperround
When I get to my desk I'm a different person
(That's a conscious choice you made though)
I'll manage risks and strategies
(Is that enough?)
Yes, as long as I get paid
