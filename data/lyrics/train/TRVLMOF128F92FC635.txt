It ain't easy
Livin' like a gypsy
Tell ya honey how I feel
I've been dreamin'

Floatin' down the stream n'
Losin' touch with all that's real
Whole earth lover
Keepin' under cover

Never know where ya been
You've been fadin'
Always out paradin'
Keep in touch with Mama Kin

Well you've always got your tail on the wag
Shootin' fire from your mouth
Just like a dragon
You act like a perpertual drag

You better check it out
'Cause someday soon you'll have to
Climb back on the wagon
It ain't easy
...
