[I-20]
Hell, let u all hear it
i love it when the bar dropping get low wit' it
the eight-eye-style i'm so sick with it
a fresh white tea, an a new break with it
make it back side bottle like it ain't no to mo'
i love it with her, an' i hope she swallow
the most get a choosin' when i hit a club scene
to old motherf**ker, i'm a doup bitch scream
please let me tap bro, i want see if it's workin'
