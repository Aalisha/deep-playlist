I scrapped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my, safest heaven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off in all my spite, in all my spite
I'll turn it off
And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
Then in the freefall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
The tragedy it seems unending
