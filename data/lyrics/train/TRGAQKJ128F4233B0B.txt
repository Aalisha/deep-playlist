Scribes and pharisees slay them slay them slay them
See them deh heathen you nuh rasta cut and clear the way
Go tell dem sey

A clean heart a do it a livity a do it.
A inity and respect a just so mi see it.
Clean heart a do it a livity a do it.
Righteousness a fling the heat under the wicked man feet yow

Well i nuh come yah so to fight flesh and blood woy.
Spiritual wickedness in high and low place.
Plant the seed of righteousness and watch it grow yow yow grow yow yow. and remember is not the place weh yuh live is how yuh live.
Remember is not what you receive and get is what you give.
I stay positive and then dash wey negative
Weh grass nuh grow grass nuh grow.

A clean heart a do it a livity a do it.
A inity and respect a just so mi see it.
