Um, can you make it 
So can you make it 
Are you something special 

Some stupid a things say they thrill a lot of my life 
Like the feeling that I want to get to know you better 
Say If you're in my heart 
Say I could and I would 
And you might and you shouldn't 
No I can't go on 
Thinking this love isn't strong 
This love isn't strong 
Till I seek those words of wisdom 
Until I seek those words of wisdom 
Till I seek those 
Until I seek those words 
Until I seek those words of 
You gotta learn 

You may wear your heart upon your sleeve
