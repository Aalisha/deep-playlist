Ten - dress it up
Nine - dress it up
Eight - dress it up
Seven - dress it up, dress it up
Six
Fa fa fa fa fa five (ooh!)

Hey hey what do you say?
Had me a woman she ran away
Warned me one time, warned me twice
Found me out and it weren't too nice.

Hey hey what do you say?
Had me a woman she ran away
Can the chatter, bye-bye dear
Carved me a crimson career.

Well whoopsin-a whoopsin (dress it up)
Jan jan jammering (dress it up, dress it up)
Yabba-yabba-ding-ding (dress it up)
Delta hey max nine

We will be fine (we will be fine)
Apollo 9 (Apollo 9)
Even though NASA say
"Way out of line" (out of line)
We will be fine (we will be fine)
Apollo 9 (Apollo 9)
Even though NASA say
"Way out of line" (out of line)

Well whoopsin-a whoopsin (dress it up)
Jan jan jammering (dress it up, dress it up)
Yabba-yabba-ding-ding (dress it up)
Delta hey max nine
