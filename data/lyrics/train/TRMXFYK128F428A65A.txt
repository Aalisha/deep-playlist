Set me free why don't cha baby
get out of my life why don't cha baby
'cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

Why do you keep a comin' around playing with my heart?
Why don'tcha get out of my life and let me make a new start?
Let me get over you the way you've gotten over me.

Set me free why don't cha baby
let me be why don't cha baby
'cause you don't really love me
