I wanna spread news all around
About the new love that I found
I found a love that I've been looking for
Now I don't have to look no more

Headline news, headline news
Everybody say
Extra, extra, read all about it
Extra, extra, read all about it

The world is at my feet
There's a halo around my head
I went out searching for gold
I found love instead
