Remember when I told you
You were pretty lost
Seems you had it up to here
Well you just paid the cost

All I have, all I need, all you've got is providence
All I have, all I need, all you've got is providence

You're looking pretty tired
It seems you've lost some weight
You made it through
I don't know how it's all you can do

All I have, all I need, all you've got is providence
...
