She said something like I want to go down where the rivers wild
He said take me then I want to drown deep in your violent eyes
[Feel the water rise again, call the river by your name]
I want to float in through your door
Hang it on the wall hang it all
But I want to be sure of one thing
That I'm getting into something peaceful
I want to fly in on your wing
Way, way up here I don't care for anything
It's all in, and I'm not afraid I don't fear
...
