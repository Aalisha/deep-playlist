You always keep your love...just outta my reach, outta my reach.
you always keep your love...ooh girl just out of my reach.
outta my reach

(You know what)

When your in a crowd, your talkin loud. 
treating me mean, every chance you get. 
to the other people, it must seem, 
you don't want me around, 
Girl i must confess yeah, yeah
still i tried to be who you want me to be 
bein your fool has become a part me, oh.
