So go ahead and ask her
For happy ever after
'Cause nobody knows what's coming
So why not take a chance on loving?

Come on, pour the glass and tempt me
Either half-full or half-empty, yeah
'Cause if it all comes down to flavor
The glass is tippin' in my favor

Life gave me lemonade
And I can't imagine why
Born on a sunny day
Beneath a tangerine sky

I live life without pretending
I'm a sucker for happy endings
Thanks for the lemonade
Thanks for the lemonade

Now take your time to answer me
For the beauty of romancing
...
