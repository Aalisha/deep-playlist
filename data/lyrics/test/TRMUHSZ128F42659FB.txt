I'm gonna ask you for something
and it may sound like a lot
I've never really asked you for anything no
we've always lived so far apart
Would you fly all the way 
from New York to see me
could you fly all the way
to stand here next to me
I didn't think so
but here you are with me
I was hanging on to nothing as a child
