You feel the world is rushing by you
While you're waiting for someone to understand
You tend to see love as an island
Where hopes like words are written in the sand
When the only door sends you back
Nothing you live for ever lasts

Every second's so slow, every hour's so low
You wanna put your arms around someone
Who doesn't wanna let you go
When the love you're in, baby, just can't win
It doesn't mean you're meant to alone
'Cause the grass will grow and the river will flow
And your heart will know

You feel you're watching through a window
I know what you want is just beyond your touch
