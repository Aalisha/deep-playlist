Now run along face lift
If it kills I got news, it ain't a side effect
Call it a full reject or
Fuel-injected time-corrected teenage obstacle

(All I want to do is have my mind erased)
I'm begging you, pleading you, stop coma-teasing us all
(Drug company, where's the pill for me?)
I call it mind eraser, no chaser at all

(On permanent leave of everything)
Law abiding, dick riding, fun police, leave us alone
(Dulling the edge of a razor blade)
What does it mean when the knife and the hand are your own?
