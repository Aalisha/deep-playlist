We want your information
We will do what we must
But not here or in front of people or
on the phone

We're not all blood-sucking leeches
For we all have families too
But that don't mean that we really
love them or that we don't
'Cos I can't love you
And you can't love me
But I can love you
And you can lover me

Love me
