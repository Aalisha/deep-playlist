Baby don't go
When you've nearly shown everythin' you are to me
Darling don't stray just stay here with me
'Cause that's how it ought to be

You've come this far to see who you are
See the love inside yourself
So don't be afraid I'm holdin' your hand
Just let the love run freely through me

You're so tangled up in love
Searchin' for you soul, searchin' for yourself
So tangled up in love
That you can't see anythin' else

My oh my
Do I have to tell you how to live your life
Ooh baby don't you know now that you're mine
You've got so set your lovin' free

Um me my oh my
Do I have to tell you how to live your life
Ooh baby don't you know now that you're mine
You've got so set your lovin' free

Tell me you see all we can be
