I guess I gave myself to someone
Maybe a time or two
Well I tried, I went through the motions
What was I supposed to do
Well I spun my wheels, I wasted so much time
And then with you I finally got it right

It's like I never loved before
Like I never saw the sun
Or felt the rain fall on my face
It's like, like it's never ever been
Can't imagine life without you anymore
It feels just like I never loved before
