Come all brother, tradesmen that travel along
O pray, come and tell me where the trade is all gone
Long time have I traveled and I cannot find none

And sing all the hard times of old England
In old England, very hard times

Provisions you buy at the shop, it is true
But if you've no money, there's none there for you
So what's a poor man and his family to do?

And sing all the hard times of old England
In old England, very hard times

You must go to the shop and you'll ask for a job
