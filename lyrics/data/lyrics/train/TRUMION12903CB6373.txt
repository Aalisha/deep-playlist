You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and this model sit outside of the side
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night

Dad was a risk taker, his was a shoe maker
You greatest hits 2006, little list maker
Caught in the melody, you wait in the car
You were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all

Interest in colors, I discover myself
