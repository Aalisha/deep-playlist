I've got a feeling, call it intuition
I've got a feeling we're getting into something more
You've been talking telling me your secrets
Baby, that's just a crack in the door

I wanna know what's on the other side
Come on baby, now don't be shy
I wanna know what's on the other side
Of this kiss, that look
I wanna read you baby, like a book
So close, to those eyes
I wanna know what's on the other side
