I'm just a girl
And you're just a boy
This is my heart
It's not a toy
So what's with you playing with my mind?

We used to be cool
This used to be love
Now it's become
Something like a job
Like it or not
Maybe things are changing
Right before out eyes

(Pre-chorus:)
I tried to be your picture perfect girl
But you were in your own fantasy world
Tryna control me
Like some kind of barbie
But that just ain't me

(Chorus:)
