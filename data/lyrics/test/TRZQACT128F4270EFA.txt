don't even be like that - try not to take it
in - cause all that you'll hold will break down,
whatcha doing, doing to me well i've heard it
all before, every day just a little bit better,
every day just a little bit more,
well i don't mind the things that i'v
e heard today and i don't mind the things i've
seen, gonna sit right here on my brand new
porch cause this house is good enough for me,
(51 - 51 gardner)
it's a nice house i don't need much
it's got a welfare little porch, i can sit there
all day and still have fun you don't see what's
...
