I had the best intentions. yeah honestly
I paid attention
I'm a loose connection. some promise me
A soft injection
A shallow feeling
Defies meaning

To blow you all away
Lose all the stiffs in my parade
I need a holiday
A nuclear holiday
Just go anywhere, I'll stay

Fell on the outside
Where giving in comes in like the tide
