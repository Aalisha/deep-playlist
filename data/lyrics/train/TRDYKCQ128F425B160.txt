I am the one, your help I've refused
Your offering hand just set off the fuse
I am the rock that pushes away
I gave up tomorrow to spite today

Too proud to beg
Too stubborn to try
I'd look in your face
And spit in your eye

But I'm willing to find what's really inside
And show I am strong enough to

Trust in you.
Trust in you.
