No, don't mock me
Don't you look at me, pity me, feel for me
It's okay
look down on me
cause now you're born again, dead again so
now to my face you lie to me
Don't sit there and tell me
you just want to be my friend
don't lie to me
don't sit there and judge me.you don't wanna face yourself
don't lie to me
don't sit there and test me I don't have the patience now
don't lie to me
don't lie to me

All the times I've seen your face
never thought I could erase
and now I watch it slip away
you can never take my place
I don't want this.I don't need this
I will never go away
I leave this all to you to live inside you till you die
