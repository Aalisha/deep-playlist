back on a mission and ready to go
back on a mission and ready to go
back on a mission and ready to go
back on a mission and ready to throw down

It's a ratatatatt on the nucleus of your brain cell
came to rock the funky joint so I might as well
get on the one
and have some fun
and drop a break in the barrel of my shotgun
boom like a bolt of lightning goes my shotgun
I pass the mic to cause I like to
Back on a mission and ready to ride
if we dont get you now gonna get you on the b-side

coming at you live monophonic lo-fi
were cutting up rugs where the beats will never die
in it to win it no matter how skin it
no holdin back loading breaks to the finish
boom like a bolt of lightning goes my shotgun
I pass the mic to cause I like to
...
