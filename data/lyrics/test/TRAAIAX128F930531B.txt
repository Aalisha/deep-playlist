Believe me I would rather say nothing than lie
But have you heard about that so-called beautiful guy
I was begging for some money at the usual time
The only thing he gave me was a lousy dime

Why can't you see that I'm beautiful
How can you call that beautiful
Why can't you see how beautiful I am

I never paid him much attention before
I think I know why I never noticed him more
