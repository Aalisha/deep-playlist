Intro:
This is about being grown, being mature and being brave. Can you be brave? Listen.

Verse 1:
I'm emotional,
You're emotional,
Could be why we always argue ourÂ…
Conversations short,
We cant open up,
It's just become,
Much too difficult,
I don't know what to do,
Don't know what to prove.
This is more than me,
So much more than you.
Can we make it through?
You and I.
I can't decide.

B-sec:
I just can't decide,
If it's you I want,
Don't wanna choose between,
Having you in my life,
Or loosing you for real.

Hook:
Because I caught feelings.
(Feelings)
Are we falling in love with our fears?
I caught feelings.
(Feelings)

Caught feelings.
(Feelings)
I'm not afraid of the pain.
