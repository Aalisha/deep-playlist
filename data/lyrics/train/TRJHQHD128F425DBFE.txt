Mommy, just dry your eyes, mommy, don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you

Only 15 put under pressure
First month 27th day, they took away my mother
I was left to be raised by my brother
Tought to be a hustla, mommy gone gotta stick together

Stay strong through the stormy weather
Became a top seller, look how we stackin' this cheddar
When you jump mommy life would be better
Just like Rhianna you can stand under my umbrella

You know how to make me better
Even when we lose our cheddar
Even through the stormy weather
You hold me down

Mommy, just dry your eyes, mommy, don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
And I just wanna tell you I love you

Mommy, just dry your eyes, mommy, don't you cry
I know we've been through hard times and the struggles
...
