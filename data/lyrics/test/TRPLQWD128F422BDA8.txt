Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)
Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)

Am I the reason why you tossed and turned last night
Everything was such a blur, it didn't come out right
All of a sudden it's cold and we're falling apart
No, this can't be, please don't leave me alone in the dark

And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
And I guess we're really over, so come over, I'm not over it
Late night you make me feel like I'm desperate, I'm not desperate
Oh, a little bit possessive, little miss obsessive
Can't get over it

Wa-o, wa-o, wa-o (That side of your bed is still mine)
