There's a place that's full of danger
Not a good place for good girls
It's a place that's full of strangers
Watching you, wanting you
Who'd have thought
You'd walk on the wild side
'Cause you were always so pristine
Who'd have thought
You'd jump on this wild ride with me

You make me feel like dancin'
Down on the Riviera
There's a town called Saint Tropez
Where a girl like you's a
"Pachanguera"
You make me feel like dancin'
We'll make it last forever
Let's get away to Saint Tropez
'Cause a girl like you's a
"Pachanguera"

We're makin' love, with just a glance
Un nuovo amor, a new romance

There's a world, that sleeps within you
...
