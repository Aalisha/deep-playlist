Me and my baby on a February holiday
'Cause we got the news
Yeah we got the news
500 miles and we're gonna make it all the way
We got nothing to lose
Got nothing to lose
Been ten years waiting
But it's better late than the never we've been told before
We can't wait one minute more

Oh, me and my baby driving down
To a hilly seaside town in the rainfall
Oh, me and my baby stand in line
You never seen a sight so fine
As the love that's gonna shine at City Hall

Me and my baby been through a lot of good and bad
Learned to kiss the sky
