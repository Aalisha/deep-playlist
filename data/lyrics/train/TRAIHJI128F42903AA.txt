Everybody Knows That You're A Star
Gucci Shoes Beluga Caviar
They All Know Exactly Who You Are
And They All Wanna Get Next To You

I See Your Face In Every Magazine
Staring Out From Every Movie Screen
Your Body Is The Best Theres Ever Been
But They'll Never Get Next To You

(Chorus)
And I've Got Your Pictures All Over The Wall
But I've Got The Greatest Secret Of All
Because Your Absolutely Mine
Thats Why Im Lyin' Here Next To You
Absolutely Fine
