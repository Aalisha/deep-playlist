Stop playing Jesus, Judas disguised
I know you fake it all the time
One love to my love, one compromise
I know your blood tastes like wine

And if I breathe in for you, can your heart shine through?
The only pain is to feel none at all
And if we stay here tonight, under the moonlit sky
Will we breathe in or will our hearts just fade away?
