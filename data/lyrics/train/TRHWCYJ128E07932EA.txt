David Hinds
STATE OF EMERGENCY
STATE OF EMERGENCY
STATE OF EMERGENCY
STATE OF EMERGENCY

Ready - Aim - Fire
From Brixton to Cape Town
Unrest all around
From Handsworth to Uitenhage
Lawlessness on the rampage
Sticks and stones they're throwing
Set ablaze the buildings
Youthful minds are stirring
Time to make a change
Who they think they're fooling
No want no diverse doctrine
Forever we will strive
Fighting against apartheid
