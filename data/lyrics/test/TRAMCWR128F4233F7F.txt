In the city the commute is a silent train
Full of tired workers
Blank stares, discomfort, and caffeine
Keep them awake

And it seems so sad to me
But it's honorable still
And I wish them peace
At this pace, it'll never change

And I think I'm finally over it
These words fall on deaf ears
And everybody's hell looks different
It changes shape but it never goes away
