They're everywhere and everyplace
Scum of the human race
Stickin' to my skin like a rash
Society's their scapegoat
But I am the antidote
And it's time to take out the trash
The world's a big cesspit
But I ain't gonna be its whore
Follow and I'll lead the way
Predators are now the prey

You may think I'm insane
Or maybe just a little absurd
what you don't understand is
I'm just culling, I'm just culling the herd

I know I'm not the only one
Who thinks that something must be done
