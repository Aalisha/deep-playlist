Lonely teardrops
My pillow's never dry
Of lonely teardrops

Come home, come home
Just say you will
Say you will (say you will)
Say you will (say you will)
Say you will (say you will)

My heart is crying
Crying lonely teardrops
They just keep on falling
Lonely teardrops
Come home, come home

Just give me another chance
