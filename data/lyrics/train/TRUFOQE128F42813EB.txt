And the warbler sings
(deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet!)
And the sparrow sings
(deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet!)
Through the wheels
Through the wheels on the interstate
And hears no refrain

And the beetle creeps
(deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet!)
On the crippled trees
(deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet-deet!)
...
