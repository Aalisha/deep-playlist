Terror strewn across the floor
Fate creeps under the creaking door
Say farewell to the solid days
Arms held out for the needle haze
Scars, scars start to show
But don't, don't despair for the shame I know

Bible for the loving damned
Religion for the pagan man
Faith and prayer for the chosen few
Mystic shades of violent hues
Blood, blood on my cheeks
...
