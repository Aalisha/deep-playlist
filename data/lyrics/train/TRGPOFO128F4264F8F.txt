Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Trying to move on
I'm walking in rhythm
Singing my song
Thinking 'bout my baby
Trying to get home

Walking in rhythm
Moving in sound
Humming to the music
Trying to move on
I'm walking in rhythm
Singing my song
Thinking 'bout my baby
Trying to get home

It's been so long since I've seen her
