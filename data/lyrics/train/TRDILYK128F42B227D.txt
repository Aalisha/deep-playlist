When he walks into the room men sit up and women swoon
Everybody murmurs \"he's here\"
He's the most important guy
Never stop to wonder why
He's always got so much to say

He's so cool, he
makes the rules

Many witty anecdotes one day he will surely choke
on a story so far away
He's so cool he'll never die
Makes us laugh and makes us cry
If only he'd promise to stay home
...
