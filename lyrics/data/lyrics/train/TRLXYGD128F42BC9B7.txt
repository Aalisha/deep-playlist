Midnight

It started out like any other day
But it was anythin' but
Somethin' 'bout the way the moon was shinin'
Somethin' seems so different, no

Got in my car but didn't have no reason
Swear I was drivin' but somethin' else was leadin' me
Lost all track of time, damn
The next thing, you won't believe

At 9 o'clock, I saw her
By 10, I had her number
11's when I called her
At 12 o'clock, it happened, I gotta blame

Midnight, I was caught up
It's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
 (Blame it on midnight)
If she found out about us, would it be a good excuse?
 (Midnight)

It's 12 o'clock, tick tock tick, the clothes drop
She's on top and I don't even wanna stop, no
Made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight
