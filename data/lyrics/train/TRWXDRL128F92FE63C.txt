Well, I could use a little spin on a red brick floor
In that crazy ol' bar when Tim locks the door
Where the walls are gonna ring and the strings are gonna bend
It's a buss on the cheek from all my old lovers again

And it's the Blue Ridge mountains at the fall of the night
It sure feels good when you cross that line
I'll tip my cup and holler at the moon
I'll say-a-great white north, honey, here's to you sleep tight

I've gone crazy on this road
With all of this travelin' alone
