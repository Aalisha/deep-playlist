(Dedicated, dedicated, dedicated)

This goes out to all my peoples in the city
Making ends meat, getting by
Thinking 'bout the hustle, everybody struggles for the answer
Confusion will attack in a cold blooded manner

But cancer kills my society, no need to lie to me
Real people fighting always try to be
Correct with the mental and upright with the info
Catching hell, paying dues but could it be so simple?

The dark cold planet, you can't take the drama
Don't worry, underprivileged got the bullet proof armor
Surviving's just a job as they dodge caps daily
People goin' crazy, everyone who raised me

Thanks to my moms, and thanks to my pops
And thanks to the youth rowdy on the roof top
Who warned me of trouble so son, get the bonus
I dedicate this to those who kept me focused

To my brother Big E, yo rest in peace
To the dead money makers, rest in peace
To my little cousin Shawn, rest in peace
To the slang gang bangers, rest in peace

(Dedicated, dedicated, dedicated)
I've got to live, kid
(Dedicated, dedicated, dedicated)
(Dedicated, dedicated, dedicated)
I've got to live, kid
(Dedicated, dedicated, dedicated
Dedicated, dedicated)

This goes out to all my peoples locked down
And waiting for the days to see the sun and the clouds
The stormy weather came, of course, we ignored it
...
