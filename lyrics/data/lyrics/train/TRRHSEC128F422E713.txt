A man can't foresee it, his own destiny is written
All guessing is useless, just to do what you have to, to get by
Another road taken, another bridge is going to fall
Too many dices, thrown for the sake of his own
Explorations ended, opportunities lost along the way
Relationships lying dead
Explorations ended, opportunities lost along the way
Relationships lying dead
Strive - to have nothing done right
To have nothing to live for
To have only existed, and you call it life
Strive - to have nothing done right
Nothing to hang on to
