Through a mirror of silver my sullen sulcus portrays some dark anger.
For the grey lights wrapped their chaotic shape round my tired, hungry eyes.

Fractaled rancour bleeds through the lifeless mirror within which
all hope sprawls, dangling from the cool draught of air to amuse us all.
The black and white frames which flash unerringly, bend

they bend to an end, touched by scorching sunlight and this self induced madness
Where I see the world explode into miniscule droplets of unnerving sadness
But to stop would be to blunt the very stars that shine from behind a threatening stone.
