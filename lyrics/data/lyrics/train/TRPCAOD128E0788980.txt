Freak out and give in
Doesn't matter what you believe in
Stay cool and be somebody's fool this year
'Cause they know who is righteous, what is bold
So I'm told

Who wants honey
As long as there's some money
Who wants that honey?

Hipsters unite, come align for the big fight to rock for you
But beware, all those angels with their wings glued on
'Cause deep down, we are frightened and we're scared
...
