If you were me.

If you were me, look from the in
Youd know exactly how much, im intoxicated by you
Un-cover me, breathe silently
Come catch me while you can, hush baby I wont run

Resistance is useless
So jump in with both feet cos
Its perfect we got it
So lets milk it freeze this moment

The way you spin me over
No ordinary touch
Obscenely Delicious
A love injected rush

If you were me.
Youd know just how good youd feel
