This song was meant to hurt
Was meant to be
About the broken world
In a broken girl
These words
I found written on my window
By the L the lipstick dead

I thought I've seen her crying
I thought she ran too fast
I thought I'd make her stop
But I just stood there,
Watched her fight

If I could live it one more time
Reverse the days
Back to where I begun
...
