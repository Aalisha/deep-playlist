I've been lying awake at night
I've been hoping that I'm alright
I've been winding myself too tight
Wondering if I will sleep tonight

Never thought things would get like this
Always hoping that they'd work out
Still ingesting the wrong amount
Now I seem to be filled with doubt

I cannot stop this ride
I'm growing cold inside
I shouldn't let it slide
Will sickness be mine

This should not be my weight to bear
Go on acting like I don't care
Stop this high, I wouldn't dare
I have earned and deserve my share
