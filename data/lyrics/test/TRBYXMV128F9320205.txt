Grant me the powers of thunder
And give me a sword forged in the raging Hell's fire
Lend me the eight legged black stallion of Odin and I'll have my vengeance,
oh, I'll kill with desire

Vengeance flows like boiling poison through my twisted veins
Tonight I'll blood shed with wrath and set the night on flames
Invincible in battle, wargods hear my deathwish cry
I'll laugh in the face of death, I into glory ride
...
