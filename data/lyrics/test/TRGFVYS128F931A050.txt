Life goes on day after day after day after day.
Hearts torn in every way,
So ferry cross the Mersey, Cos this lands the place I love and here I'll stay,
And here I'll stay.

People they rush every where, Each with their own secret care,
So ferry cross the Mersey, Cos this lands the place I love and here I'll stay,
...
