Wake up, break up, step out of your dream 
Never gonna get my loving
Life's not what it seems 

Claiming she's from Hollywood
But she's a southern girl 
Trying to make a living 
In a mad and crazy world 

Money's all that matters 
In her narrow mind 
Once you start to talk to her 
She's of the simple kind

Oh, you pretty thing 
You're superficial (you're superficial)
Oh, you pretty thing 
Born artificial (you're artificial)

Wake up, break up, step out of your dream 
Never gonna get my loving
Life's not what it seems 
You better wake up, break up, got to get a life 
...
