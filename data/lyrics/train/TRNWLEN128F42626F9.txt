I just wrote the dumbest song
It's gonna be a sing along
All our friends will clap and sing
Our enemies will laugh and be pointing

It won't bother me, what the thoughtless are thinking
I am more concerned with what we're drinking
They'll laugh about it at the warehouse, saying I'm so lame
It wrote itself, you can keep the blame

It'll be a happy song
