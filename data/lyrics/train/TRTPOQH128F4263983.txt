Got two cars and a chainlink fence
Got insurance for accidents
Nevermind what I don't know
I dream of places I won't ever go
But I lead a good life
Yeah, I lead a good life

'N every Sunday we're out at the lake
Teachin the kids how to jump the wake
We drag em on two skis they kick one loose
They don't know it, they hadn't got a clue
