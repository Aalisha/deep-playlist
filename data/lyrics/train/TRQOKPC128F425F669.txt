Tell me of your perfect world, that you fight so hard for.
Show me your priorities, what you live your life for.
We're not against your beliefs.
We just know there is little time.
There are more important things.
It's time to choose your side.
This is the time to fight for souls.
Winning the lost, it is our goal.
