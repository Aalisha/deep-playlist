Sittin' back in the cut looking fine
Look at that nigga, what the shit is mine
Sittin' back in the cut looking fine
Look at that nigga, what the shit is mine

Sittin' back in the cut looking fine
Look at that nigga, what the shit is mine
Sittin' back in the cut looking fine
Look at that

So they call us stars, get that
And not all of us are chosen
And I drive a car with the top back
'Cause my vanity's my token

Now all this talkin' ain't my style
About some responsibilities
Like this here nation is my child
Like it's a direct humility

So I'll be sittin' back in the cut looking fine
Look at that nigga, what the shit is mine
Sittin' back in the cut looking fine
Look at that nigga, what the shit is mine
