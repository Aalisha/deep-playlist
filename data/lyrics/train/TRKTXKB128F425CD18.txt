TJ don't want no less
Can't think, can't talk, must process
No practice, no sample
Must earn, must learn, must trample

And don't forget you can get off the conveyor
And don't forget you can get off the conveyor
And when you want you can get off the conveyor
And when you want you can get out...

And don't forget you can get off the conveyor
And don't forget you can get off the conveyor
And when you want you can get off the conveyor
And when you want you can get out of the machine

TJ don't want no less
Can't think, can't talk, must process
No choice, no prospectus
...
