Black and blue I chose my wave
I, the candid castaway
In a way delayed
By one more broken season
To find reason for appeasing you

And so I found my guiding light
lambent, flashing red and white
Through a starry night
I'm better nowhere bound
Than drowning on your solid ground

Satellite, save my life
I'm wishing on a two-way radio
Love might be just like me
Jaded waiting all alone
...
