The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there, and they began to wail
The band began to-jumping, they began to swing
You should have heard the knock down jailbird sing
Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Oh everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Number forty-seven said to number three
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
So come and do the jailhouse rock with me
Let's rock, everybody let's rock
Oh everybody in the whole cell block
