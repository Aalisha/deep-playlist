Boogie nights, ohh
Boogie nights, ohh

(Boogie nights, boogie nights, boogie nights)
Ain't no doubt we are here to party
(Boogie nights)
Come on now got to get it started
Dance with the boogie get down
 (Dance with the boogie get down)
'Cause boogie nights are always the best in town

Got to keep on dancing
Keep on dancing
Got to keep on dancing
Keep on dancing

(Boogie nights)
Get that groove, let it take you higher
(Boogie nights)
Make it move, set this place on fire
Dance with the boogie get down
 (Dance with the boogie get down)
'Cause boogie nights are always the best in town

Got to keep on dancing
Keep on dancing
Got to keep on dancing
Keep on dancing

(Party night)
Can you show that you know how to do it?
 (Boogie nights)
Do it, do it
(Party night)
Get on down with the sound of the music
 (Boogie nights)
Music, music

(Boogie nights)
It's so right, when you got the feeling
