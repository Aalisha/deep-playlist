Drifting away so many times
Searching for something I could never find
Living the live on my own
Wondering why I felt so alone

Knew I was wrong but my pride
Stood in the way I was so blind
That's when I heard you say
Those words that changed my life

Come home this is where you belong
In my arms it's been far too long
I've waited for this day to come
So my son, please won't you come home
