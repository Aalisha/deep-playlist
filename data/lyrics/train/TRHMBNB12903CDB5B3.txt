The journey begins beyond the mountains far away
Where the sun always shine and the rainbow begins... the Grand Utopia
A young man in his pride
...his restless heart and soul leaving his loved ones behind
To explore the great unknown alone... all by himself

Mother... always watching over me
Now she must let me go

He feels the absence of well-being as he leaves his roots behind
Wandering night an day without any rest
Voices from inside that I can not understand
Calling me to go somewhere
The road he once knew change before his weary eyes
Sunlight is gone... now the darkness prevails

Suddenly the ground begins to shake
Tremble... now it's too late

Step into our endless darkness
You are now our soul to keep
Ooh no I'm falling into the burning skies

I thought it was over now, bur the chapter of my life has just begun
Resurrected to complete the task that's been brought on to me
...
