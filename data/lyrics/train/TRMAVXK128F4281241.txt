What in the world happened to you?

Before you started tokin'
You used to have a brain
But now you don't get even the simplest of the things
I can draw a little picture
Or even use my hands
I try to explain but you just don't understand

Man you're really losin' it
And you've really done a lot of junk now
But you keep abusin' it
What in the world happened to you
It's bad enough you do it, you do it to yourself
