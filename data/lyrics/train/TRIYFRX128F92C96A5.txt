Yeah, you? re so convinced of how it? s supposed to be
I know that you? re confused, don? t take it out on me
We? re not afraid to try, we? re not afraid to dream
But when it all goes wrong we? re not afraid to scream

? Cause the future now is ours to make
Oh, oh, shout it out

Get ready? cause we like it loud
? Cause we were born to make some noise
Don? t tell me we should turn it down
? Cause we were born to make some noise
Make some noise, make some noise

We? re not the enemy you might be surprised
Don? t need hypocrisy to open up our eyes
We don? t need your rules, don? t need a uniform
This is who we are, we won? t be ignored
