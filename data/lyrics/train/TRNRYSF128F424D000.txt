I read your letter, I got it just the other day...
You seem so happy, so funny... how time melts away
It's such a pleasure, to see you growing
And how you sending your love to the air today

I think of Heaven... each time I see you walking there
And as you're walking, I think of children everywhere
It's in your star sign... you growing stronger
I can't believe you... so good to care
