Tearing at my neck my sharpened teeth pierce the meat
My warm bloodied prey sustains my life for one more day
The oldest of souls, left behind after life
Before death I was nothing but human

Indulgence in the blood, intoxicated from its drug
It warms my cold soul

Tapping the gushing sap, trickling down my throat
Rejuvenation of my body
No blood left to scab
Now it flows through my veins
Heaven I have found
Fear in my grip
Transcend beyond mortal
The sweet blood
I will swallow
Draining the inner spirit
...
