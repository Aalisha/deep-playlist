Once upon a time, you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you

You used to laugh about everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud, now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging around for your next meal

How does it feel, how does it feel
To be on your own with no direction home?
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
Don't you know you only used to get juiced in it?
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
Now you find out you're gonna have to get used to it

You said you'd never compromise
