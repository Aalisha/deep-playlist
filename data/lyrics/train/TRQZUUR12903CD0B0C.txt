Got a million reasons to run and hide
I don't blame you for being scared(for being scared, no)
Bout a novel long, all the pain that she caused you
Baby I'm fully aware(I'm fully aware)

If I could change the story's ending to me and you
Don't know the meaning of pretending what to do

I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what she has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believed
Please believe in me

This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is us
This is love
This is love
Let the world know baby
This is us
