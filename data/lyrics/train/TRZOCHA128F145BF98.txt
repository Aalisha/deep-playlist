When I met you in the restaurant
You could tell I was no debutante
You asked me what's my pleasure
A movie or a measure
I'll have a cup of tea
And tell you of my dreaming
Dreaming is free
Dreaming
Dreaming is free

I don't want to live on charity
Pleasure's real or is it fantasy
Real to real is living rarity
