Ever find yourself doing the same thing
Walking the safe old life
Looking back on yesterday
And dreaming the same dreams
Wishing away the time
Then you answer your feelings
And looked deep inside
You know there's got to be meaning
Or are we here for the ride?
Caught up here with you
Trying to make this old thing new
Caught up trying to chase the stars
Caught up here with you
Trying to make this earth thing groove
