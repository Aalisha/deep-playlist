If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There’s nothing we can do
But play cops and robbers
Cops and robbers

We’re at a revolution
And we’re baying for your blood
We’re laying down the law
And your name’s mud

You’d like to be a member of the human race
You want to be a good boy
But you couldn’t stand the taste

Blame Simon
Because he said
You’ve got two lives down
And one life left
Blame Simon
Because he said
You could think better with a hole in your head
You could think better with a hole in your head

If we catch a criminal
When we catch a criminal
There’s nothing we can do
...
