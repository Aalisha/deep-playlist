Eve is gone again
Back to her palace, back to her island
Eve can smile again
And run round the hedges in the Garden of Eden

Run the way you did before the nightmares
Run just like before the overkill
Run the way you did it's over darling

Oh, could I be so gentle
Oh, so soft and tender
Oh and could I forgive
And could I die in my mother's arms like her

Eve's a child again
Sing her a lullaby
Read to her every night

Eve's in heaven
Plenty of friends are there
No one the enemy
