I woke up this morning with a buzz rolling 'round in my brain
I haven't been drinking but it feels pretty good just the same
It must be contagious, looks like it's going around
It's cool once you catch it, you can't keep your feet on the ground
Oh now, come on, come on, let's get something started (let's get something started now)
Oh yeah, come on, come on, let's start something now (let's start something now)

We gonna rock this country
We gonna rock this country
Every brown-eyed boy, every blue-eyed girl
Gotta really go psycho, give it a whirl
We gonna rock this country
Right out of this world
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na
Ah-oo-na-na-na na na na na na na
