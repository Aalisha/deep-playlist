It's iconoclastic
I'm clastic
I only want you to think I'm fantastic
I participate in what you believe
If you give me the attention
Yeah, Yeah that's the only compensation
I wanna be included in your conversation
So am I in?
Or am I out?
What is there to think about
What is this paintbrush for
Are you preparing to draw me
No wait
Please don't
I am scared of what I'll see
I'm not a picture perfect portrait
But I am working on it
I've been thinking about being cool
I must have to admit

Blame it on the corporate skyscrapers in the sky
But if it wasn't for you
We wouldn't have all the multiple crowds
