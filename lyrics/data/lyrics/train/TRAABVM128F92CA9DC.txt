If you can imagine this
The whole world sharin' one big kiss
These are thoughts all through my brain
That I daydream every day
I'm alive and well
Right now I'm alive, I'm feelin' well
It's my life to live my way
So I'll keep daydreaming away
Who knows, maybe someday it will all come true
And I will get my way
And we will live as one

I'm caught up in a dream
I'm gonna wish for it all
No one is gonna tell me how
No way, this is my dream now
I'm caught up in what seems
Simply impossible
I ain't gonna change a thing
No way, it's my dream
