I met her in a pool room
Her name I didn't catch
She looked like something special
The kind who'd understand
The room was almost spinning
She pulled another smile
She had the grace like pleasure
She had a certain style

Sunlight on the lino
Woke me with a shake
I looked around to find her
But she'd gone
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
