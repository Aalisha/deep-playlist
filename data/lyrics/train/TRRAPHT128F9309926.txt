One day maybe we will dance again
Under fiery skies
One day maybe you will love again
Love that never dies

One day maybe you will see the land
Touch skin with sand
You've been swimming in the lonely sea
With no company

Oh, don't you want to find?
Can't you hear there's beauty in life?
The roads, the highs, breaking up your mind
Can't you hear there's beauty in life?
