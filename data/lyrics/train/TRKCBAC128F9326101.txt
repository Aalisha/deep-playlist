Had a dream that we were dead, but we pretended that we still lived.
With no regrets we never bled and we took everything life could give
And came up broken empty handed in the end
In the hearts of the blind, something you'll never find is a vision of light
With the voice of the dead, I'm screaming

I don't know who I am anymore
Not once in life have I been real but I never felt this close before
I've been looking in your window I've been dressing in your clothes
I've been walking dead, watching you, long enough to know I can't go on.
