Twisted little daydreams,
Memories with pain
Locking me behind the closet door
I will be a good boy
Promise I won't run
Sit quiet in my room
Playing with my toy gun

Now I'm older but the memories
Still eat me like disease
Alone and in the darkness
Watching you on my tv
Why did god make you so famous
When he only spit on me
...
