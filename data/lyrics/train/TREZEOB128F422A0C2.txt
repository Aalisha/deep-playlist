She likes pottering about, before she ever goes out
She likes meeting her friends, would love them till the end
She likes when she’s alone, while talking on the phone
She walks between the lines when she’s on her way home
I don’t know whats wrong with you, whats wrong with us, can it be true
I don’t know it don’t make sense, every night you get more tense
I know that you’ve been sad, you wanted this so bad
Can you walk for miles and miles and miles?
