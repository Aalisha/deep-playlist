Joey...
Baby...
Don't get crazy
Detours, fences...
I get defensive...

I know you've heard it all before
So I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and let you
Fight your secret war

And though I used to wonder why
I used to cry till I was dry
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
Oh Joey if you're hurting so am I
