(This is a DPS production )
Gimme a beat, alright
Gimme a beat, ok
Gimme a beat, alright
Gimme a beat, ok
Gimme a beat, alright
Gimme a beat, ok
Gimme a beat, alright

I'm gonna have some fun tonight
Lookin' for a girl tonight
Lookin' for a perfect personality
And she gotta have a freak side, I wanna know
If you are curious, then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin' this, then this is what I need

Girl let me be your everything
Baby all that you need and more
Shakin' off all this drama in the
And kickin' out the door, I wanna know
If you are curious, then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin' this, then come to me, so unbelievable

So unbelievable, (that's right) your love is incredible
If you're available, girl this is what I need
(Baby just let me know)
So, so unbelievable, your love is incredible
