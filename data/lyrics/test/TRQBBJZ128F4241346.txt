I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star

But until then, baby, I'm the one who's crazy
'Cause that's the way you make me feel
I don't want no romance
I just want the chance to show you that I'm for real

I never said that I would be your everything
But you know that I love you, baby
And it's gonna be such a shame
When you can start living with it
