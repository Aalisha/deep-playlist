I like to sneak a drink, and roll my smokes
You see I like my collars pressed
I wear big ol' hats, and fancy ties
And I hang late with my friends

I can take it on the chin with a Cheshire grin
I'm a sinner VIP
I like mixed drinks, I likes what I thinks
I think you know just what I mean

You know the heroes and legends are one and the same
It's-a how you play the game
You see, I'm no fool, I'm from the old school
It's the fire from the flame

Wahp bah bah dzoo zah
Zah be dah dah dah
Zahp bahp bahdlyoodah
Wahbah doo doo dah
Zih boo bah
