With each single breathe, I pray for death
I curse my day of birth, I hate this stinking earth
I walk the path of self-destruction
Just like your worthless kind, I too was blind
But now that I'm awake, this world fills me with hate
I've cast aside all false illusions

No more a servant nor a puppet on strings
The time has come for rebellion
This burden has for far too long weighed heavy on me
Release my soul through a rope and a tree

With each step of mine, I cross the line
Into where light is dark, and death is the spark
That ignites my satisfaction
