Mya you know the hook,
you see the bait,
I know you want a bite,
So why procrastinate,
Come on.

Everybody knows that yeah I'm kind of shy,
I'm not the kind of girl that who can ever approach a guy,
But I wanna find a way to get you to notice me,

I got a 4 wheel drive, 55, from eyes
but maybe you can handle these because I'm Free.

Single, sexy, and sweet, making my own money, looking for the right party,
And if your free,
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see,
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy.
