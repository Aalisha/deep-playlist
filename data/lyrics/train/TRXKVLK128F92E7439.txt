Goodbye, so long, fairweather
This time I'm gone forever

I should've seen it comin' from a mile away
I guess I wasn't countin' on a rainy day
As soon as I could swear the sky was falling down
You were out of there before it hit the ground
Get out of town

Goodbye, so long, fairweather
This time I'm gone forever
