You'd sit and wait, restricted
You bit my bait- greatly predicted
You saw the wicked side of me lifted
Knew I was gifted laid me to drift

Used you like a stick
Stable like brick
The quick fix, had no time for the fickle shit
The deadly mix, nineteen and twenty six
You named it age
I thought our brain waves had never clicked
For true, realised what I had to pursue
Energised had no time to let love rule
You knew
And that's why you left me

And it's all in the hands
Of something bigger than
We can understand
It's all in the plan
One day you'll understand
...
