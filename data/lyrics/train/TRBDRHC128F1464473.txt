She don't need anybody to tell her she's pretty
She's heard it every single day of her life
He's got to wonder what she sees in him
When there's so many others standing in line

She gives herself to him
But he's still on the outside
She's alone in this world
She's nobody's girl, she's nobody's girl

She shows up at his doorstep in the middle of the night
Then she disappears for weeks at a time
Just enough to keep him wanting more
...
