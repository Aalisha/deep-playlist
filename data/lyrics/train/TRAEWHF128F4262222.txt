"Better be good", I've said
Better be bad, I've done
Better be told, what you want
Better believe, in what?

Better to think about it
Better to live without it
Better be told, what you want
Better believe, in what?

Oh, you think you're so special
Oh, you think you're so clean
Oh, you think you're just better than me

Well, first I chew you in
And then I spits you out
Spits you out
