There it is, there it is
What took us so long to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong

But I knew the answer to why people fall in love
But then I found I knew nothing about it
Till I met you, girl, I thought that I had had enough
Now I'm sure I've always been without it

And it feels so good that you and I can go together
Ooh baby, we won't find what we've been looking for
And this time I know we're gonna make it better
Our heart is a key to pump it at the door
Don't have to search no more

There it is, there it is
What took us so long, ooh, to find each other, baby?
There it is, there it is
This time I'm not wrong
