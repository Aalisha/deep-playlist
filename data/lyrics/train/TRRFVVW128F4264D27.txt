Well, just because I'm in my teens
And I still go to school.
Don't think that I dream childlish dreams
I'm nobody's fool.
Don't mother me - that makes me wild.
And please don't treat me like a child.

It's often said that youngsters should be seen and not be heard.
But I want you to realize that is quite absurd.
Don't wanna be so meek and mild.
