Faster moment spent, spread tales of change within the sound
Counting form, through rhythm electric freedom
Moves to counter balance, stars expound our conscience
All to know and see the look in your eyes

Passing time will reach as nature relays to set the scene
New encounters spark a true fruition, guiding lines we touch them
Our bodies balance out the waves
