No-one can hear the things I whisper
no-one but you can hear the sound of my soul
dont run away from me, I need you
im gonna follow you, wherever you go

Get up, stand up,
open your eyes,
take me to the limit
never let me go.
dont cry, dont lie,
open your mind
come and take me over
make me feel alright.

I feel it fade at night, the sunset,
two moons softly, slowly into the sea
...
