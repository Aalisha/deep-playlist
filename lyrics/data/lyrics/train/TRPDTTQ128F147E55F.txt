Three jolly little dwarfs running round the meadow
The sun is very very bright leaving little shadows
One wears red
One wears green
Another one blue
Are they true?

Three jolly little dwarfs sitting on their toadstools
They're such good company in their house so small
Sitting at home
Feeling so alone
Little short legs
Keeps them warm

Danger lurks
...
