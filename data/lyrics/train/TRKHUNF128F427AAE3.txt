I don't know why I love you
Your face is a hammer in my head
I remember every word you said
I just don't know why I love you
I don't know why I care
I never even liked your hair
I feel like a seven heir
But I don't know why I love you
Television turns me on
When the summer's hot and the spirit's thrown
How can I get close to you
When you got no mercy, no, you got mercy
No you got no
