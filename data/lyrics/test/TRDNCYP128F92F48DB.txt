Well, all my friends are boppin' the blues; it must be goin' round
All my friends are boppin' the blues; it must be goin' round
I love you, baby, but I must be rhythm bound

Well, the doctor told me, Carl you need no pills.
Yes, the doctor told me, boy, you don't need no pills.

Just a handful of nickels, the juke box will cure your ills.

Well, all my friends are boppin' the blues; it must be goin' round
All them cats are boppin' the blues; it must be goin' round
I love you, baby, but I must be rhythm bound
