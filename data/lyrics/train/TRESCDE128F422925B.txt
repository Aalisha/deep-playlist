I'm not the world's most sensitive guy
Big talkin', heart stoppin'
Oh I ain't never been shy
Don't even ask me why

Waastin' time putsa lines on my face
I could have you breathless, baby
And leave without a trace
Anytime, anyplace

Well I sense your satisfaction
Couldn't stop me baby if you tried
So give in to this chain reaction
You are going under
Tonight I'm gonna do you like
Lightning and thunder
...
