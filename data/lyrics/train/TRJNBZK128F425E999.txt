Why did you do it for me?
Did you do it for me?

I hear what you're saying,
Your lips move like they're praying,
I see it trough my tears,
Oh, You say you can't let me go

You've taken my heart,
And you've burned it to the core,
Ooh, you've played your part,
Now it's my time to seal the show

How could you do it?
How come you blew it?
You broke a precious thing,
And think that you can glue it,
How could you do it?
You took me through it
You're messing with your destiny,
But you can't fool it
How could you do it?
Yes I can prove it
My privacy is not for you,
Beacuse I rule it,
How could you do it for me?
How could you do it for me?

Feelin' cold and lonely,
You were my one and only,
The sun is falling from the sky,
And you're the reason why

Ooh, 'Cause you took my heart,
And you tossed it on the floor,
Ooh, Can't live in a lie,
No, I can't take this no more
...
