Spite the hand that breeds innocence
Light the fires of impurity
Pull the hood over your fucking face
And hide away your real self
If you've come here to pass judgement
Leave your cause behind fade away
You have come here to tear me apart
Then come to me and take this life from me
Your time your chance to show
