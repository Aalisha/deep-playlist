Now you have been staring at the sun for a while
Is it hurting your eyes
I know you want to put those shades on
And walk on home with a tan
To arrive and leave with style

But didn't a warm wind blow right through you
Melting the ice
I know you want to put those shades on
And walk on home as planned
But stand still for a while

You can hide it
...
