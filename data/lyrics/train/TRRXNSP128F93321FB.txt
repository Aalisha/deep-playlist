You can't know, oh no
You can't know
How much I think about you, no
It's making my head spin

Looking at you
And you are looking at me
And we both know what we want
Hmm, so close to giving in

Feel so nice
Oh yeah, you feel so nice
Wish I could spend the night
But I can't pay the price, oh no, no

But I'm flying so high
High off the ground
When you're around

And I can feel you're high
Rocking me inside
It's too much to hide
