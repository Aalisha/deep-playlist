I am both Zapruder and Kennedy
Witnessing the shots she fired into me
Played out in slow motion under scrutiny
Frame by frame, I make my own conspiracy

On a grassy knoll I think I'm wondering
How Lincoln figures into what's happening
And who and what it is that pulls her puppet strings
Suspect myself, I start a line of questioning

She didn't act alone
Her cover has been blown
She didn't act alone

She didn't act alone
The footage never shown
She didn't act alone
...
