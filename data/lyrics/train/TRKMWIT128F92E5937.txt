I was listening to this conversation
Noticing my daydream stimulated me more
I was crumbling with anticipation
You better send me home before I tumble down to the floor

You? re so beautiful, but oh so boring
I? m wondering what am I doing here
So beautiful, but oh so boring
I? m wondering if anyone out there really cares
About the curlers in your hair
My little golden baby where have all your birds flown now
