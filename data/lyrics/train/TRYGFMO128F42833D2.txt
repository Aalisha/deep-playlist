Well I know your life has been hard
I see it in your eyes and I feel it in your heart
When your eyes move down to the floor
And your mouth changes shape, and your voice sounds sore
I can hold you close in my arms
And tell you that you're special
And that you treasure such great charms
And that you always keep my heart full
But I'm hardly speaking a word
I'm hardly speaking a word

And I know these things should be heard
But I'm hardly speaking a word
And your struggle never changes me
...
