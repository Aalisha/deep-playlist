I can sit and try to figure out the reasons why
You were always going out alone
I thought that you were meeting with some other guy
All those times you weren't at home

I was wrong but then I didn't understand
What you were trying to say to me
I thought that you were busy making other plans
None of those including me

But then I always had
Too many insecurities
Why didn't I
Just decide to let it be?

I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know

Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

I remember it so clear when I got the call
It was the hospital on the phone
They told me how you slipped and had a nasty fall
And would I come and take you home
...
