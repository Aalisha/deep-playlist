I've been doing this for too long to keep
Singing the same song
This is another one of those happy moments not made for anyone
I don't rap in bumper stickers, I'm witty with 40-liners
Every breath is a chorus, sing along if you're still breathing
I've got gods, I've got issues
Nowadays I've learned to not criticize
Ever seen my foot-in-mouth stance I'm a g walking
Broken token, something of little appreciation
To truly see where all of this aggression stems from
You gotta always play the nice guy and get shitted on
Everyday's a gavin convention with no one to see
Everyday they put up new doors and I don't want the keys
If I'm not getting black-balled I'm getting white-boyed
You can condescend me but you can't offend me
I'm sure i'll get all the secret codes
When showing love to sole becomes trendy

Poor me, I dig myself holes
Somebody marry me, I'm getting old
Somebody remind me why I continue to press on
I need a flamingo to put on my front lawn, I need a front lawn
