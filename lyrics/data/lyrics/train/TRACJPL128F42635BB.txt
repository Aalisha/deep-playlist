[Intro] (6 1/2 times)
Gone getcha hype, gone getcha crunk, gone getcha buck, nigga (I'm P-Troy nigga!)
Y'all know what time it is, baaaby!

[Verse]
Now let's pray lord have mercy, help 'em God
Pastor Troy baby, and I'm- coming hard
Had to sit back, and see the big picture
Probably in the back seat, bustin' me a Swisher
Know how I getcha
Huffin' and puffin' and cussin' over percussion
Out the back field, two-thousand yards rushin'
I'm struttin', I'm rushin', spinnin', I'm jukin'
Gotcha girlfriend on the side-line lookin' (Whassup, baby?)
It's all a game, but the winner is the one who maintain
They all know my name, I'm the heavyweight champ
I rock the belt and got some killers on my camp
This drank done got me amp, it got me ready to shut the club down
Can't get all the way, for a motherfuckin touchdown
Let's clown
Dancin' in the endzone, I'm lookin' good, I'm lookin strong
Pastor Troy 'bout to getcha buck, tell them hoes it's on (Yeah!)

[Hook]
Gone getcha hype, gone getcha crunk, gone getcha buck, nigga (This right here!)
