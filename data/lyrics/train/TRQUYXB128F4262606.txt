This is a story 'bout a day that came not long ago
About this girl I met her name's Yvette that you might know
This girl was bad she left me sad not knowing what to do
She was all wrong for me no matter what had to be free but
She made it seem like she wanted to be with me
Playin' tricks on me tell me

(Is it true?)
The things that people say you do
(Is it true?)
My man said he hit it too, tell me
(Is it true?)
You've only like me for what I can do
(Is it true?)
You're not feelin' me like I'm feelin' you

Even though I try I can't deny
Way she look making me weak
But word is she's a freak
Things I heard man I could hardly speak

They say don't believe everything you hear
So what the deal my dear
