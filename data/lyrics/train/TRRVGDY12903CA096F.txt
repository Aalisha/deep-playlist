In the morning when the sun makes it shadows
my blood begins to rush
In the morning when you ask me how I'm doing
your love can make me blush
Tell me how to do this
Tell me what to say
Show me how to spell it
Just tell me I'm okey for tomorrow
Alright for today
Yesterday was nothing
far far away
and I tried to see the future
and I tried to see the past
and I'd like to see the morning
